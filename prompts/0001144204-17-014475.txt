Our Company
 
We are a regenerative technologies company that commercializes differentiated regenerative medical products which assist the body in the repair or replacement of soft tissue. Through our sales and distribution network, together with our proprietary products, we believe we offer solutions that allow clinicians to utilize the latest advances in regenerative technologies to bring improved patient outcomes to their practices. Our contract manufacturing business provides custom hydrogels to the OEM market.
 
On October 5, 2016, we entered into a merger agreement to acquire the business of Soluble Systems, LLC (“Soluble”) through a series of transactions. On February 27, 2017, we terminated this agreement, due to the inability to secure the requisite financing to meet the closing conditions of the merger agreement. The merger agreement was contingent upon us securing debt or equity financing, or a combination thereof, that results in gross proceeds of at least $45 million, inclusive of any current indebtedness of Soluble or us that is assumed, restructured or refinanced by the combined company.

Products and Services
 
Our commercial wound care portfolio currently consists of three product categories: wound bed preparation, human biologics and antimicrobial protection. We currently market MIST® Ultrasound Healing Therapy (“MIST Therapy”), which uses painless, noncontact low-frequency ultrasound to promote healing, Biovance® Amniotic Membrane Allograft (“Biovance”) and Interfyl™ Human Connective Tissue Matrix (“Interfyl”), which are human biologic regenerative technologies, and TheraBond 3D®, which is an advanced dressing incorporating its proprietary TheraBond 3D® Antimicrobial Barrier Systems (“TheraBond”) technology. We seek to broaden this product portfolio by identifying, acquiring and integrating technologies and products that enhance our product portfolio while diversifying our customer base and growing our sales footprint. In addition, we maintain our legacy contract manufacturing business, which provides custom hydrogels to the OEM market.
Wound Bed Preparation
 
On May 29, 2015, we completed our acquisition of Celleration, Inc. (“Celleration”), a medical device company focused on developing and commercializing the MIST Therapy therapeutic ultrasound platform for the treatment of acute and chronic wounds. MIST Therapy is a painless, noncontact, low-frequency ultrasound delivered through a saline mist medium to the wound bed. The MIST Therapy system and UltraMIST® System (“UltraMIST”) consist of a portable countertop generator and handheld transducer. Attached to the transducer is a single-use disposable applicator, which includes an inlet for sterile saline. As the device is activated, the saline is introduced to the head of the transducer where it is atomized. This saline mist is the medium allowing the ultrasonic energy to be efficiently transmitted to the wounded area without direct contact of the device. The energy delivery via a fluid mist has been described as painless and often pain-relieving for the patient. The disposable applicator is designed for a single use only, to avoid any potential of contamination from patient to patient. Unlike most wound therapies that are limited to treating the wound surface, we have evidence that MIST Therapy sound wave energy promotes healing and reduces bacterial bioburden.
Human Biologics
 
In November 2013, we entered into a license, marketing and development agreement with Anthrogenesis Corporation d/b/a Celgene Cellular Therapeutics (“CCT”), an affiliate of Celgene Corporation, pursuant to which CCT granted us an exclusive, royalty-bearing license in its intellectual property related to certain placental based products for wound care and wound management, including those made from extracellular matrix (“ECM”) derived from the human placenta, and Biovance, a decellularized and dehydrated allograft produced from human amniotic membrane for the management of non-infected partial- and full-thickness wounds. On May 5, 2015, the license agreement was further amended, pursuant to which we received the additional right to develop and market CCT’s connective tissue matrix product known as Interfyl, our latest regenerative technology. In February 2016, Human Longevity Inc. (“HLI”), a genomics-based, technology-driven company, acquired the assets of CCT related to ECM, Biovance and Interfyl, among other select assets. All of CCT’s rights and obligations under the license agreement were assigned to HLI in connection with this acquisition. The initial term of the license agreement ends on November 14, 2023, unless sooner terminated pursuant to the termination rights under the license agreement, and will extend for additional two-year terms unless either party gives written notice within a specified period prior to the end of a term. The license agreement is terminable on a product-by-product basis, and not with respect to the entire license agreement (i) by either HLI or us, if we fail to meet certain sales thresholds, and (ii) by either party upon written notice if outside legal counsel recommends discontinuance of commercialization of a product because of significant safety, legal, or economic risk as a result of a claim, demand or action or as a result of a change in the interpretation of law by a governmental or regulatory authority.

The license agreement permits us to commercialize Biovance in the United States. The development and application of the intellectual property covered under the license agreement is managed by a joint steering committee, composed of members of our company and HLI. We pay HLI annual license fees, designated amounts when certain milestone events occur and royalties on all sales of licensed products, with such amounts being variable and contingent on various factors. On September 30, 2014, the license agreement was amended to give us the exclusive right to market Biovance for podiatric and orthopedic applications.
 
In connection with the Biovance products, on November 14, 2013, we also entered into a supply agreement with CCT, as subsequently amended on each of April 10, 2014 and September 30, 2014, pursuant to which CCT agreed to supply us with our entire requirement of Biovance for distribution and sale in the United States. On April 10, 2014, we and CCT entered into a supply agreement for ECM, on substantially the same terms as the supply agreement for Biovance. On April 23, 2014, we initiated our sales and marketing efforts for Biovance at the Spring 2014 Symposium on Advanced Wound Care and had our first commercial sale on May 1, 2014. In February 2016, HLI assumed all of CCT’s rights and obligations under the supply agreement in connection with the acquisition and the assignment of the license agreement.
 
Biovance and Interfyl are derived from the placenta of healthy, full-term pregnancies. Human tissues contain collagen, fibronectin, and other proteins and biochemicals that support healing. These important components are maintained in their native architecture throughout HLI’s processing. However, essentially no cells are contained in the finished products (Biovance and Interfyl are decellularized), which is different from other placenta-based products, and this decellularization together with the gentle minimal manipulation of the tissues contribute to minimization of irritation and inflammation related to immune responses that can interfere with healing. When the scaffold or extracellular matrix of Biovance and Interfyl is placed in a wound or an area with damaged or deficient soft tissue, it can serve as a platform that allows the body’s own cells to migrate into the matrix and attach. Once attached, the cells release growth factors to signal other activities to progress healing.
 
Biovance is intended for use as a biological membrane covering, that provides extracellular matrix while supporting the repair of damaged tissue. As a barrier membrane, Biovance is intended to protect the underlying tissue and preserve tissue plane boundaries with minimized adhesion or fibrotic scarring. Indications include, but are not limited to, surgical covering, wrap or barrier, application to partial- and full-thickness, acute and chronic wounds (such as, traumatic and complex wounds, burns, surgical and Mohs surgery sites; and diabetic, venous, arterial, pressure and other ulcers), including wounds with exposed tendon, muscle, bone or other vital structures.
 
We believe Interfyl treats deep wounds or soft tissue voids for which a sheet format such as Biovance is not as well suited. Interfyl is regulated as a 361 human tissue product, indicated for the replacement or supplementation of damaged or inadequate integumental soft tissue. There are podiatric and orthopedic applications, as well as wound management opportunities for homologous use of Interfyl. In connection with the Interfyl products, on April 15, 2016, we entered into a supply agreement with HLI, pursuant to which HLI agreed to supply us with our entire requirements of Interfyl for distribution and sale in the United States. In September 2016, we announced the commercial introduction of Interfyl in the United States and had our first commercial sale. We offer Interfyl in both particulate and flowable forms. In these forms, Interfyl can be used to fill voids and correct defects in soft tissue, providing mechanical and structural support to facilitate the tissue repair process or replace missing or inadequate soft tissue.
 
Interfyl is intended for use as the replacement or supplementation of damaged or inadequate integumental tissue. Indications include, but are not limited to, treatment of soft tissue voids, correction of soft tissue defects, soft tissue augmentation during repair of dehisced or complicated surgical closures and repair of small surgical defects resulting from either medical or surgical conditions including those with exposed vital structures (bone, tendon, ligament, or nerve). Interfyl is also intended for use as the replacement or supplementation of damaged or inadequate integumental tissue. Indications include, but are not limited to: augmentation of deficient/inadequate soft tissue and treatment of deep dermal wounds; surgical wounds; soft tissue voids as a result of tunneling wounds, fistula tracts, or dermal undermining–including those with exposed vital structures (bone, tendon, ligament, or nerve).
 
Any further development and commercialization of ECM is not planned by us at this time.
 
Antimicrobial Protection
 
In May 2014, we acquired Choice Therapeutics, Inc. (“Choice”), a provider of innovative wound care products using proprietary TheraBond 3D® Antimicrobial Barrier Systems. The TheraBond product line includes contact dressings, island dressings and wraps. Based on a proprietary and patented manufacturing process, silver is bonded to the entire surface of the nylon fibers of the TheraBond dressing. When the TheraBond products are placed on the wound, bioactive ionic silver is released at a controlled rate. Used largely in burn care, we believe TheraBond promotes an optimal wound healing environment by creating an antimicrobial barrier that helps protect against infection. With its one-piece construction and unique struts between the contact and outer layers, TheraBond enables efficient transfer of fluid and exudate (excess wound fluid) away from the wound and into an absorptive outer dressing, while providing rapid, sustained antimicrobial protection.

Contract Manufacturing
 
In connection with our legacy contract manufacturing business; we develop, manufacture and market high water content, electron beam cross-linked, aqueous polymer hydrogels, or gels, used for wound care, medical diagnostics, transdermal drug delivery and cosmetics. We specialize in custom gels by capitalizing on proprietary manufacturing technologies. Our products are manufactured using proprietary and non-proprietary mixing, coating and cross-linking technologies. Together, these technologies enable us to produce gels that can satisfy rigid tolerance specifications with respect to a wide range of physical characteristics (e.g., thickness, water content, adherence, absorption, moisture vapor transmission rate (a measure of the passage of water vapor through a substance) and release rate) while maintaining product integrity. Additionally, we have the manufacturing ability to offer broad choices in selection of liners onto which the gels are coated. Consequently, our customers are able to determine tolerances in moisture vapor transmission rate and active ingredient release rates while personalizing color and texture.
Planned Products and Services
 
We intend to continue to expand our existing product offerings through the licensing of products and acquisitions. We believe that our management team will be able to successfully integrate and leverage acquired products so we will have a more comprehensive suite of wound care products. We believe acquiring a product with established sales channels would also help us market our existing products. In evaluating potential acquisition targets, we are looking for technology platforms which enhance our current products, have revenue associated with the technology where possible, and have a strong value proposition in today’s health care climate, among other factors. 
 
In addition to expanding our product offerings through licenses and acquisitions, we also intend to modify our existing products through the expansion of customer options (e.g. additional offerings in different sizes and shapes) and potentially expand into new indications for use of our existing regenerative technologies. As our products, with the exception of the ECM suite, are already cleared or do not require clearance by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”), we believe these types of modifications can be made with minor regulatory delay. We believe that these improvements and additional options will enhance our reputation and potentially attract new customers.
 
Asset Sale
 
On June 30, 2016, we entered into a purchase agreement with BSN medical, Inc. (“BSN”), pursuant to which we sold to BSN all of our rights under our former distribution agreement with former Sorbion GmbH & Co KG (“Sorbion”), dated as of September 20, 2013, as subsequently amended and assigned to BSN, including but not limited to all distribution rights, exclusivity rights, intellectual property rights and marketing rights to the sorbion product line and our remaining unsold inventory of sorbion products purchased under the distribution agreement. Subject to the terms and conditions of the purchase agreement, in exchange for the sale of such rights to the sorbion products and unsold products, BSN paid us an aggregate consideration of $4.1 million. Effective upon the closing of the sale, the distribution agreement was terminated. In addition, we received $100,000 in connection with a transaction services agreement with BSN. As a result of the foregoing, we no longer distribute Sorbion wound dressings and exudate management products.
Growth Strategy
 
We intend to grow our business by pursuing the following strategies:
 

· | Strategic Acquisitions. We intend to broaden our product portfolio by identifying, acquiring and integrating technologies and products that enhance our product portfolio while diversifying our customer base and growing our sales footprint. In May 2015, we acquired Celleration and added the MIST Therapy to our product portfolio.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Expand our Sales Capabilities. We intend to increase our sales resources through the greater engagement of independent contractors, as well as other distribution partners. We believe this increase in sales capabilities will increase awareness of our products and help generate increased sales.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

· | Focused Sales Efforts. We expect to focus an increased portion of our sales representatives in the hospital surgical area. We also plan on focusing sales efforts for our MIST Therapy products in the areas such as deep tissue injuries and venous leg ulcers. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Grow our Business through New Product Introductions. We intend to grow our business by expanding our existing product offerings. We may have the opportunity to obtain commercial rights for potential new products from third parties. In addition, we may also have the opportunity to modify our existing products through life cycle management and through other verticals.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Expand into Surgical Specialties. We intend to seek potential partners to expand the use of our products into other surgical specialties.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Increased reimbursement coverage. We intend to continue to increase government and commercial insurance reimbursement coverage for our products. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Industry and Markets
 
According to medical market research firm BioMedGPS, LLC SmartTRAK™ data, the U.S. market for wound care management products, which had revenues of approximately $5.9 billion in 2015, is expected to grow to $7.4 billion by 2019, which is a compound annual growth rate of 5% for 2015 to 2019. Growth in the U.S. wound care market will likely come from new therapies that result in decreasing healing times and subsequent cost savings and a growing focus on special populations such as diabetics and the obese.
 
We intend to target four specific market segments within the wound care industry:
 

· | Diabetic Ulcers. According to the National Diabetes Clearinghouse (“National Diabetes Fact Sheet, 2014” available at www.cdc.gov), there are over 29 million diabetics in the U.S., or more than 9.3% of the U.S. population. Almost 11.2 million people over the age of 65 are diabetic, which equates to almost 26% of all people in this age group. Furthermore, more than 60% of nontraumatic lower-limb amputations occur in people with diabetes. A study published by Wild, et. al. (Diabetes Care, May 2004) estimates that the worldwide number of diabetics is projected to be 366 million people by the year 2030. Boulton, et. al. (“Neuropathic Diabetic Foot Ulcers,” New England Journal of Medicine, July 2004) reported that diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs) develop in approximately 15% of patients with diabetes and precede 84% of all diabetes-related lower leg amputations. We believe that our wound care products can aid in the healing of these diabetic foot ulcers, thereby lessening the need for amputation. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Pressure Ulcers. Dorner, et. al. (“The Role of Nutrition in Pressure Ulcer Prevention and Treatment,” The National Pressure Ulcer Advisory Panel, 2009) stated that according to The Joint Commission, more than 2.5 million patients in U.S. acute-care facilities suffer from pressure ulcers. Dorner, et. al. also stated that the prevalence of pressure ulcers in the U.S. is widespread in all settings, with estimates of 10% to 18% in acute care and 2.3% to 28% in long-term care. The study further noted that these pressure ulcers can reduce overall quality of life and may also contribute to premature mortality in some patients, therefore any intervention that may help to prevent or treat them once they occur is important to reduce the cost of pressure ulcer care and improve the quality of life for affected individuals. Park-Lee, et. al. (“Pressure Ulcers Among Nursing Home Residents: United States, 2004,” The National Center for Health Statistics Data Brief, No. 14, February 2009) reported that 35% of nursing home residents with stage 2 or higher pressure ulcers received special wound care by specially trained professionals. We believe that our wound care products can aid in the treatment of pressure sores and ulcers, thereby increasing quality of life and decreasing the amount of time spent in wound care facilities.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Venous Stasis Ulcers. These wounds are believed to occur due to improper functioning of venous valves, usually of the legs. According to the University of Washington Medical Center (available at www.uwmedicine.org/health-library/Pages/venous-stasis-ulcers.aspx), the main risk of venous stasis ulcers is the spread of infection from a persistent wound. Failure to address the condition appropriately could ultimately result in limb loss. As these ulcers are typically small, they are often undertreated, which leads to larger ulcers which require more complex treatments. Brem, et. al. (“Protocol for the Successful Treatment of Venous Ulcers,” American Journal of Surgery, July 2004) reported in one study that up to 48% of venous ulcers had recurred by the fifth year after healing. These often chronic ulcers affect up to 2.5 million U.S. citizens annually. We believe that our wound care products can aid in the treatment of venous stasis ulcers and increase the quality of life for those affected.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

· | Post-Surgical and Burn Dressings. The study entitled “Number, Rate, and Standard Error of All Listed Surgical and Non-surgical Procedures for Discharges from Short-stay Hospitals, by Selected Procedure Categories: United States, 2009” (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) reported that in 2009, an estimated 29 million surgical procedures were performed in the U.S. The New York Times (Sack, “Hospital Infection Problem Persists,” The New York Times, April 13, 2010) cited a report from the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality in 2010 that the problem of hospital-acquired infections (“HAIs”) contributes to an estimated 100,000 deaths annually and concluded that the problem merited “urgent attention”. According to the American Burn Association (“Burn Incidence and Treatment in the United States: 2015 Fact Sheet,” available at www.ameriburn.org/resources_factsheet.php), an estimated 486,000 people with burn injuries receive medical treatment on an annual basis. If the burn is second degree or worse, medical attention may be required to reduce the risk of infection. We believe that our wound care products can aid in the prevention of HAIs. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sales and Marketing
 
We continue to focus on sales and marketing efforts in the United States. As of December 31, 2016, we had 40 employees dedicated to sales, all of whom have experience in the wound care industry. Additionally, we have developed an independent network of agents to sell our wound care products through our extensive channel reach through a network of distributors. In addition, we have assembled a Medical/Surgical Advisory Board to help us target improvements and new applications for our products and assist in our marketing efforts. We also market our advanced wound care products at conferences, trade shows and other educational events.
Customers
 
One customer accounted for approximately 7% and 10% of our revenue for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. This customer is a medical device manufacturer and a consumer of our contract manufacturing products. The decrease in this concentration is due to an increase in product revenue from our regenerative technologies, which is consistent with our strategy.
Competition
 
Leading competitors in the tissue-based wound care area that will compete with our biologic products, Biovance and Interfyl include companies such MiMedx Group, Inc., Osiris Therapeutics, Inc., Organogenesis Inc., Integra LifeSciences Corporation, as well as a significant number of smaller companies.
 
We believe that MIST Therapy has no direct competition in the advanced wound care market. As a result, we believe that MIST Therapy may compete favorably on the basis of broad application. Notwithstanding the lack of direct competition, we expect many physicians and allied professionals to continue to employ other treatment approaches and technologies to treat chronic and hard-to-heal wounds.
 
There are several established silver-based wound dressings and other products which are already in the marketplace that compete with TheraBond. These include Acticoat (sold by Smith & Nephew), Aquacel Ag (sold by ConvaTec), and Silvercel (sold by Acelity). We believe that our low cost of sales will enable us to capture market share from our competitors.
 
Our ability to establish sales in a market with many larger manufacturers may be difficult. We continue to recruit veterans of the medical device industry to leverage our product offerings into the most beneficial distribution channels. Our competitors may still have greater resources to support their products and may not allow us to take any market share from them. 
 
Sources and Availability of Raw Materials; Principal Suppliers
 
In general, raw materials essential to our businesses are readily available from multiple sources. For reasons of quality assurance, availability, or cost effectiveness, certain components and raw materials are available only from a sole supplier. Our policy is to maintain sufficient inventory of components so that our production will not be significantly disrupted even if a particular component or material is not available for a period of time.
 
We purchase MIST Therapy applicators and the saline bottles included with each applicator from single sources. We purchase the MIST systems from one supplier. We and our suppliers purchase many of the components and raw materials in manufacturing the MIST products from numerous suppliers in various countries. We have been able to obtain adequate supplies of such raw materials and components and work closely with suppliers to try to ensure continuity of supply while maintaining high quality and reliability.

Under our supply agreement with HLI, we receive the finished goods of Biovance and Interfyl from HLI. 
 
Noble Biomaterials, Inc. is the principal manufacturer utilized in production of our TheraBond dressings. Noble Biomaterials, Inc. utilizes a proprietary and patented manufacturing process. Although we have not experienced significant production delays attributable to supply changes, we believe that developing alternative sources of supply used to make TheraBond would be difficult over a short period of time.
 
Because we have no direct control over these suppliers, interruptions or delays in the products and services provided by these parties may be difficult to remedy in a timely fashion. In addition, if such suppliers are unable or unwilling to deliver the necessary products or raw materials, we may be unable to redesign or adapt our technology to work without such raw materials or products or find alternative suppliers or manufacturers. In such events, we could experience interruptions, delays, increased costs or quality control problems, or be unable to sell the applicable products, all of which could have a significant adverse impact on our revenue.
 
Other than as discussed above, we believe that, due to the size and scale of production of our suppliers, there should be adequate supply of raw materials from our manufacturers.
 
Patents, Proprietary Rights and Trademarks
 
We own or license trademarks covering our company and our products. Our policy is to file patent applications to protect technology, inventions and improvements that are important to the development of our business. We also rely upon trade secrets and continuing technological innovations to develop and maintain our competitive position.
 
As of December 31, 2016, we have beneficial ownership of 15 issued U.S. utility patents, 2 issued U.S. design patents, 17 foreign patents, and several pending U.S. and foreign patent applications covering aspects of our MIST Therapy platform. Specifically, the MIST Therapy patent rights cover both medical and device aspects of wound care using non-contact ultrasound, as well as other clinical ultrasound applications.
 
In November 2013, we entered into a license, marketing and development agreement with CCT, as subsequently amended on each of September 30, 2014 and May 6, 2015, pursuant to which we hold an exclusive, royalty-bearing license in CCT’s intellectual property related to certain placental based products, including DRS(ECM), Interfyl and Biovance, to develop and commercialize these products in the United States. In February 2016, HLI assumed all of CCT’s rights and obligations under the license agreement in connection with HLI’s acquisition of the assets of CCT related to DRS and Biovance, among other select assets. The development and application of the intellectual property covered under the license agreement is managed by a joint steering committee, composed of members of us and HLI. Following the commencement of commercial sales of each licensed product, the license agreement requires us to pay HLI certain annual license fees, royalty payments based on a percentage of net sales, as well as financial and performance milestone payments, subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the license agreement. The initial term of the license agreement expires on November 14, 2023, unless sooner terminated pursuant to the termination rights under the license agreement, and will automatically renew for additional two-year periods unless either party gives written notice within a specified period prior to the end of a term. The license agreement may be terminated (i) by HLI if we or any of our affiliates challenges the validity, enforceability or scope of certain enumerated HLI patents anywhere in the world; (ii) by either party if there is a final decree that a licensed product infringed on the intellectual property of a third party and the parties cannot cure such third party infringement; (iii) by either party for breach and failure to cure such breach of the license agreement; or (iv) by either party if the other party is the subject of insolvency proceedings, either voluntary or involuntary. In addition, the license agreement is terminable on a product-by-product basis, and not with respect to the entire license agreement: (i) by HLI, if we fail to meet certain minimum sales thresholds for the second year of commercial sales, and by either HLI or us if we fail to meet certain minimum sales thresholds for the third or any subsequent year of commercial sales and (ii) by either party upon written notice if outside legal counsel recommends discontinuance of commercialization of a product because of an actual, threatened, or perceived significant safety, legal, or economic risk as a result of a claim, demand or action or as a result of a change in the interpretation of law by a governmental or regulatory authority. Each year of commercial sales are referred to in the license agreement as “launch years” and the calendar period constituting each launch year for each licensed product is determined in accordance with the terms of the license agreement. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors - If we fail to meet certain minimum sales thresholds for products licensed pursuant to our agreement with HLI, we could lose our right to license such products.”

Government Regulation
 
Product Regulation. Under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, medical devices are classified by the FDA into one of three classes—Class I, Class II or Class III—depending on the degree of risk associated with each medical device and the extent of control needed to ensure safety and effectiveness. While some applications of hydrogels fall under the jurisdiction of the FDA, hydrogels are generally classified as Class I exempt devices and the majority of the hydrogel products that we manufacture are thereby exempt from the FDA filing of any regulatory submissions and/or pre-market notification requirements. To the extent that any FDA regulatory submissions are required, we will be required to file these submissions and maintain all appropriate documentation. With respect to registering the manufacturing facility with the FDA under the Code of Federal Regulations, 21 CFR 820.1, Scope: Part A, it is stated that the regulation does not apply to manufacturers of component parts of finished devices. Currently, hydrogels are sold as component parts to various medical device/cosmetic manufacturers.
 
We believe that a number of products that our partners are developing will be classified in the U.S. as either Class I or Class II medical devices or Human Cells, Tissues, and Cellular and Tissue-Based Products (HCT/Ps). Class I medical devices are subject to the FDA’s general controls, which include compliance with the applicable portions of the FDA’s Quality System Regulation, facility registration and product listing, reporting of adverse medical events, and appropriate, truthful and non-misleading labeling, advertising, and promotional materials. Class II devices are subject to the FDA’s general controls and may also be subject to other special controls as deemed necessary by the FDA to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the device. Most Class II devices require pre-market clearance by the FDA through the 510(k) pre-market notification process. When a 510(k) is required, the manufacturer must submit to the FDA a pre-market notification demonstrating that the device is “substantially equivalent” to either a device that was legally marketed prior to May 28, 1976, the date upon which the Medical Device Amendments of 1976 were enacted, or to another commercially available, similar device which was subsequently cleared through the 510(k) process. By regulation, the FDA is required to clear a 510(k) within 90 days of submission of the application. As a practical matter, clearance often takes longer. HCT/Ps that are regulated under 21 Code of Federal Regulations Part 1271 and Section 361 of the Public Health Service Act (“361 HCT/Ps”) and do not require FDA approval or clearance prior to marketing. We are required to follow Current Good Tissue Practices (CGTP) including registration as a storage/distribution facility as well as track the tissue products from receipt to final disposition.
 
Biovance and Interfyl are products derived from human tissue. The FDA has specific regulations governing HCT/Ps. An HCT/P is a product containing or consisting of human cells or tissue intended for transplantation into humans. HCT/Ps that meet the criteria for regulation solely under Section 361 of the Public Health Service Act and 21 CFR 1271 (361 HCT/Ps) are not subject to pre-market clearance or approval requirements, but are subject to post-market regulatory requirements. To be a 361 HCT/P, a product must meet all four of the following criteria:
 

· | It must be minimally manipulated;
--+----------------------------------


· | It must be intended for homologous use;
--+----------------------------------------


· | It must not be combined with another article; and
--+--------------------------------------------------


· | It must not have a systemic effect and not be dependent upon the metabolic activity of living cells for its primary function.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
We and HLI believe that, within their intended uses, Biovance and Interfyl qualify as 361 HCT/Ps. The FDA is in the process of clarifying definitions of homologous use and minimal manipulation in their Guidance for Industry publications.
 
The FDA has broad post-market regulatory and enforcement powers with respect to medical devices, similar to those for pharmaceutical products. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. medical device regulatory requirements could result in, among other things, warning letters, fines, injunctions, consent decrees, civil penalties, repairs, replacements, refunds, recalls or seizures of products, total or partial suspension of production, the FDA’s refusal to grant future pre-market clearances or approvals, withdrawals or suspensions of current product applications, and criminal prosecution. Similarly, the FDA may audit any manufacturer of medical devices or facilities with a registered 361 HCT/P.
 
If there are any modifications to a cleared medical device such as our UltraMIST Class II device identified in 510(k) K140782, including changes in indication, manufacturing process or labeling or a change in a manufacturing facility, an applicant must notify the FDA, and in many cases, clearance for such changes must be submitted to the FDA. Additionally, the FDA regulates post-approval promotional labeling and advertising activities to assure that such activities are being conducted in conformity with statutory and regulatory requirements. These regulations include standards or restrictions for direct-to-consumer advertising, industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities, promotional activities and off-label promotion. Likewise, labeling and advertising of HCT/Ps may be monitored for indication language to be consistent with homologous use. While physicians may prescribe for off-label uses, manufacturers may only promote for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label (or homologous use). The FDA has very broad enforcement authority under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, and failure to abide by these regulations can result in enforcement action, including the issuance of untitled or warning letters directing entities to correct deviations from FDA regulations and civil and criminal investigations and prosecutions. These activities could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

Quality Assurance Requirements. The FDA enforces regulations to ensure that the methods used in, and the facilities and controls used for, the manufacture, processing, packing and holding of drugs, medical devices and/or HCT/Ps conform with current good manufacturing (CGMP) and/or CGTP. The CGMP regulations the FDA enforces are comprehensive and cover all aspects of manufacturing operations, from receipt of raw materials to finished product distribution, insofar as they bear upon whether drugs meet all the identity, strength, quality and purity characteristics required of them. The CGMP regulations for devices, called the Quality System Regulation, are also comprehensive and cover all aspects of device manufacture, from pre-production design validation to installation and servicing, insofar as they bear upon the safe and effective use of the device and whether the device otherwise meets the requirements of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act. CGTPs are narrower in scope than CGMPs. CGTP requires a quality program to prevent, detect, and correct deficiencies that could increase communicable disease risk. To assure compliance requires a continuous commitment of time, money and effort in all operational areas.
 
The FDA also conducts periodic inspections of drug, device and registered HCT/P facilities to assess their current CGMP/CGTP status. If the FDA were to find serious non-compliant manufacturing or processing practices during such an inspection, it could take regulatory actions that could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. With respect to domestic establishments, the FDA could initiate product seizures or in some instances require product recalls and seek to enjoin a product’s manufacture and distribution. In certain circumstances, violations could support civil penalties and criminal prosecutions. In addition, if the FDA concludes that a company is not in compliance with CGMP requirements, sanctions may be imposed that include preventing that company from receiving the necessary licenses to export its products and classifying that company as an “unacceptable supplier”, thereby disqualifying that company from selling products to federal agencies.
 
We conduct audits of our outside manufacturers and believe that we and our suppliers and outside manufacturers are currently in compliance with CGMP/CGTP requirements. We are currently registered as a device manufacturer and human tissue distributor with the FDA and we intend to register as a drug facility with the FDA when we are required to do so.
 
Third-Party Reimbursement 
 
In the United States as well as in foreign countries, sales of our products depend, in significant part, on the availability of reimbursement from third-party payers. In the U.S., third-party payers consist of government programs such as Medicare, private health insurance plans, managed care organizations and other similar programs. For any product, three factors are critical to reimbursement:
 

· | coding, which ensures uniform description of procedures, diagnoses and medical products;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | coverage, which is the payer’s policy describing the clinical circumstances under which it will pay for a given treatment; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | payment process and fee schedules.
--+-----------------------------------

 
We believe the availability, as of January 2014, of a Category I CPT code for MIST Therapy has encouraged and will continue to encourage, broader coverage and subsequent use of its MIST Therapy System in the United States. Previously, MIST Therapy was billed under a temporary Category III CPT code, which some payers generally refuse to cover. Each government and private payer, however, makes its own coverage decision.
 
Access to MIST Therapy is available to Medicare beneficiaries in all 50 states. Although private payers will often pay for MIST Therapy when medically necessary and pre-approved, we have not focused on securing private payer coverage decisions for MIST Therapy.
 
For Medicare-covered patients who are commonly treated in a hospital outpatient department, the payment system is called the Outpatient Prospective Payment System. The facility payment for MIST Therapy is billed under the CPT Code and then categorized for payment under a single Ambulatory payment (“APC”). Each hospital has a specific APC payment based on the hospital’s wage index for their geographic location.
 
If MIST Therapy is delivered by a physician, non-physician practitioner, or physical therapist, a professional payment may be based on the Medicare Physician Fee Schedule (“MPFS”). The MPFS includes both a facility, and, for treatment delivered in a physician’s office a non-facility rate. The actual amount will vary by location per the geographic practice cost index adjustment to the national rate. Therapy services are typically paid under the non-facility MPFS payment rate pursuant to Medicare guidelines.

Biovance is currently marketed in hospitals where Diagnosis Related Group Procedures are performed, in the Veteran’s Affairs health system, and in hospital outpatient departments as well as Physician offices or other outpatient care centers. Providers of outpatient services will be reimbursed for Biovance by Medicare where there is a local coverage determination by the prevailing Medicare Administrative Contractor (“MAC”). On October 31, 2014, Biovance was assigned a new and unique, Level II Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System product reimbursement Q code (Q4154) by Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (“CMS”). The new reimbursement code took effect on January 1, 2015. We currently have reimbursement coverage for Biovance from seven of the eight MACs, representing 93% of Medicare covered lives, as well as 50.4% of BlueCross BlueShield covered lives in the U.S.
 
We have the Healthcare Common Procedural Coding System, or HCPCS, codes, from the Pricing, Data, Analysis, and Coding contractor for CMS, for use when billing for our wound care dressings. HCPCS was established in 1978 to provide a standardized coding system for describing the specific items and services provided in the delivery of health care. HCPCS codes are used by Medicare and monitored by the CMS. They are based on the Current Procedural Technology codes developed by the American Medical Association. We believe that these codes will facilitate reimbursement for the use of our dressings in Medicare patients with applicable wounds.
 
Environmental Regulation. We are subject to various laws and governmental regulations concerning environmental matters and employee safety and health in the U.S. and other countries. We have made, and continue to make, significant investments to comply with these laws and regulations. We cannot predict the future capital expenditures or operating costs required to comply with environmental laws and regulations. We believe that we are currently compliant with applicable environmental, health and safety requirements in all material respects. However, we cannot assure you that current or future regulatory, governmental, or private action will not have a material adverse effect on our performance, results or financial condition.
 
In the future, if a loss contingency related to environmental matters, employee safety, health or conditional asset retirement obligations is recognized, we would record a liability for the obligation and it may result in a material impact on net income for the annual or interim period during which the liability is recorded. The investigation and remediation of environmental obligations generally occur over an extended period of time, and therefore we do not know if these events would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, liquidity, or cash flow, nor can we assure you that such liabilities would not have a material adverse effect on our performance, results or financial condition.
 
Federal and State Anti-kickback, Self-referral, False Claims and Similar Laws. Our relationships with physicians, hospitals and the marketers of our products are subject to scrutiny under various federal anti-kickback, self-referral, false claims and similar laws, often referred to collectively as healthcare fraud and abuse laws. Healthcare fraud and abuse laws are complex, and even minor, inadvertent violations can give rise to claims that the relevant law has been violated. Certain states have similar fraud and abuse laws, imposing substantial penalties for violations. Any government investigation or a finding of a violation of these laws would likely result in a material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock, as well as our business, financial condition and results of operations. We believe that we are currently compliant with applicable anti-kickback, self-referral, false claims in all material respects.
Research and Development Costs
 
For the year ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, we incurred research and development costs of approximately $859,000 and $715,000, respectively, related to a randomized controlled trial for our Biovance product in chronic diabetic foot ulcers. We have experienced slower than expected patient enrollment and projected costs to complete the trial are significantly higher than we previously expected. In addition, we believe there is no longer a business need for this trial due to the amount of patient data currently available, our success in getting government and commercial insurance coverage for Biovance, and our recent increase in Biovance sales. Due to these factors, we have decided to terminate patient enrollment for the Biovance trial. We expect our research and product development costs related to this trial to continue through the completion of study close-down during the first half of 2017.
 
We bear our own research and development costs and do not directly pass along our research and development costs to our customers.
 
We intend to commit capital resources to research and development only as our cash resources allow. We have incurred all costs associated with the launch of our proprietary products and will only require research and development expenses for product enhancements and modifications and to obtain additional reimbursement coverage, which we do not expect to be significant.

Employees
 
As of December 31, 2016, we had 81 full-time employees. Of these employees, 60 are involved with finance, sales, marketing, and administration and 21 are involved with manufacturing, clinical and regulatory matters. Our employees are not represented by a labor union or other collective bargaining groups, and we consider relations with our employees to be good. We currently plan to retain and utilize the services of outside consultants for additional research, testing, regulatory, legal compliance and other services on an as needed basis.
ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS
 
There are numerous and varied risks, known and unknown, that may prevent us from achieving our goals. You should carefully consider the risks described below and the other information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including the consolidated financial statements and related notes. If any of the following risks, or any other risks not described below, actually occur, it is likely that our business, financial condition, and/or operating results could be materially adversely affected. The risks and uncertainties described below include forward-looking statements and our actual results may differ from those discussed in these forward-looking statements.
 
The report of our independent auditors contains an explanatory paragraph as to our ability to continue as a going concern, which could prevent us from obtaining new financing on reasonable terms or at all.
 
Because we have had recurring losses, negative cash flows from operating activities, limited cash on hand in light of expected expenditures and are in default of our Credit Agreement, the report of Marcum LLP, our independent auditors, with respect to our financial statements at December 31, 2016 and for the year ended December 31, 2016 contains an explanatory paragraph as to our potential inability to continue as a going concern. This opinion indicates that substantial doubt exists regarding our ability to remain in business. Such an opinion may adversely affect our ability to obtain new financing on reasonable terms or at all.
 
We have experienced significant losses and expect losses to continue for the foreseeable future.
 
We have incurred annual net losses of $28.2 million and $26.0 million, respectively, during the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015. As of December 31, 2016, we had an accumulated deficit of $124.3 million. We expect to incur additional operating losses for the foreseeable future. Although we expect sales to continue to increase in 2017 and beyond from our existing product offerings, there can be no assurance our sales will increase or that we will ever be profitable in the future.
 
We will require additional capital in order to execute the longer term aspects of our business plan.
 
The implementation of our growth strategy will continue to result in an increase in our fixed cost structure. Due to the time delay between outlays for working capital expenditures, such as costs to acquire rights to additional products, the hiring and training of sales agents and personnel, marketing costs, the purchasing of inventory, the billing and collection of revenue, debt service costs, and diligence costs related to merger and acquisition activities, we expect to have a net cash outflow from operating activities as a result of these expenditures. Future results of operations involve significant risks and uncertainties. Factors that could affect our future operating results and cause actual results to vary materially from expectations include, but are not limited to, potential demand for our products, risks from competitors, regulatory approval of our new products, technological change, and dependence on key personnel. In addition, a portion of the contingent consideration payable to Celleration shareholders in connection with our acquisition of Celleration is payable in cash in 2017.
 
In order to complete our future growth strategy, additional equity and/or debt financing will be required. If we are unable to raise additional capital or if we encounter circumstances that place unforeseen constraints on capital resources, we will be required to take even stronger measures to conserve liquidity, which may include, but are not limited to, eliminating all non-essential positions and ceasing all marketing efforts. We would have to curtail business development activities and suspend the pursuit of our business plan. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in improving revenues, reducing expenses and/or securing additional capital in sufficient amounts and on favorable terms.

We have a substantial amount of indebtedness under our $13.8 million principal term loan and are in default under the Credit Agreement, which may adversely affect our cash flow and our ability to operate our business. 
 
In order to finance our acquisition of Celleration, on May 29, 2015, we and each of our subsidiaries entered into a credit agreement and guaranty (the “Credit Agreement”) with Perceptive Credit Opportunities Fund, L.P. (“Perceptive”), which provided for a senior, secured term loan with a current principal amount of approximately $13.8 million. The full unpaid principal amount of the term loan will mature on May 29, 2019. Prior to maturity, on the last business day of each calendar month following May 29, 2017, we will be required to make monthly principal payments of $225,000, with any remaining unpaid balance of the term loan being payable in cash on the maturity date. The repayment of the term loan and our obligations under the Credit Agreement are secured by a first priority lien on all of our existing and after acquired tangible and intangible assets, including intellectual property. The Credit Agreement also contains certain restrictions that prohibit us and our subsidiaries from engaging in certain transactions and activities, including but not limited to the following:
 

· | entering into, creating, incurring or assuming any indebtedness of any kind, subject to limited exceptions;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | creating or incurring new liens, subject to certain exceptions;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------


· | entering into new acquisitions or investments in other entities, subject to certain exceptions;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | winding up, liquidating or dissolving;
--+---------------------------------------


· | merging or consolidating with another person or disposing of assets, subject to certain exceptions;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | entering into inbound or outbound licenses, subject to certain exceptions;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | changing the nature of our core business;
--+------------------------------------------


· | paying cash dividends; and
--+---------------------------


· | repaying, repurchasing or otherwise acquiring shares of our common stock or other equity securities.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Our ability to meet our expenses, debt obligations and other financial covenants under the Credit Agreement will depend on our future performance, which will be affected by financial, business, economic, regulatory and other factors. We will be unable to control many of these factors. We cannot be certain that our earnings will be sufficient to allow us to pay the principal and interest on our debt and meet any other obligations. We do not have enough money to service our debt, we are required, but may be unable to refinance or restructure all or part of our existing debt, sell assets, borrow money or raise equity on terms acceptable to us, if at all, and the lender could foreclose on its security interest and liquidate some or all of our assets, which would harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.
 
The Credit Agreement also requires us to meet certain financial covenants. Our ability to meet these financial covenants may be affected by events beyond our control. If, as or when required, we are unable to repay, refinance or restructure our indebtedness under, or amend the covenants contained in, the Credit Agreement, the lender could institute foreclosure proceedings against our assets, which would harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. We are currently in default under the Credit Agreement.
 
In addition, as a result of our increased level of indebtedness, demands on our cash resources will continue to increase in the future and could, among other things:
 

· | require us to dedicate a large portion of our cash flow from operations to the servicing and repayment of our debt, thereby reducing funds available for working capital, capital expenditures, research and development expenditures and other general corporate requirements;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | limit our ability to obtain additional financing to fund future working capital, capital expenditures, research and development expenditures and other general corporate requirements;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | restrict our ability to make strategic acquisitions or dispositions or to exploit business opportunities;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


15
--


· | adversely affect our credit rating, with the result that the cost of servicing our indebtedness might increase and our ability to obtain surety bonds could be impaired;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | adversely affect the market price of our common stock; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------


· | limit our ability to apply proceeds from an offering or asset sale to purposes other than the servicing and repayment of debt.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
We are currently in default under the Credit Agreement, which allows the lender to exercise certain rights and remedies, including, without limitation, declaring the entire outstanding indebtedness under the Credit Agreement of approximately $13.8 million immediately due and payable, imposing a default rate of interest and/or foreclosing on some or substantially all of our assets.
 
We are currently in default of the Credit Agreement, as a result of our failure to achieve gross revenue of $22,250,000 for the twelve-month period ended September 30, 2016 and $24,600,000 for the twelve-month period ended December 31, 2016. Under an agreement dated January 26, 2017, as amended on March 7, 2017, the lender agreed to forbear from exercising any rights and remedies related to the default until the earlier of April 30, 2017 or the date when the lender becomes aware of any other default. The remedies available for the lender include, among others, the ability to accelerate and immediately demand payment of the outstanding debt of approximately $13.8 million under the Credit Agreement, to impose a default rate of interest, to foreclose on some or all of our assets, and/or to take possession of or sell some or all of our assets. Were the lender to demand payment of the outstanding debt after expiration of the forbearance period, we would currently have insufficient funds to satisfy that obligation, and the lender’s exercise of its other remedies would have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial condition.
 
We are exploring initiatives to address solutions to our credit issues, which include a restructuring of the Credit Agreement with our lender and the evaluation and pursuit of various sources of financing including a refinancing. However, no assurance can be given that we can restructure our Credit Agreement or that additional financing will be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all.
 
Occurrence of an event of default under the Credit Agreement could result in a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition, or the loss of our assets as the lender holds a first priority security interest in all of our assets and the assets of our subsidiaries.
 
Events of default under the Credit Agreement include, but are not limited to, the following:
 

· | failure to pay principal, interest or other amounts, if any, when due;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------


· | any form of bankruptcy or insolvency proceeding instituted by or against us or any of our subsidiaries that is not dismissed in 60 days;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | a default occurring under any debenture, mortgage, credit agreement, indenture or other instrument representing or securing indebtedness in an amount exceeding $250,000;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | we or any of our subsidiaries is party to a change of control;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------


· | the FDA or other governmental authority (i) issues a letter or other communication asserting any of our products lacks a required product authorization, including in respect of CE marks or 510(k)s or 361HCT/P qualification, or (ii) initiates enforcement action or warning against us, any of our products or manufacturing facilities resulting in the discontinuance of marketing, withdrawal of any material products, or delay in the manufacture of any material products, each lasting for more than 90 days;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | a recall of any product that has generated or is expected to generate at least $1.0 million in revenue in the aggregate over any consecutive twelve (12) month period;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | we or any of our subsidiaries enters into a settlement agreement with the FDA or any other governmental authority that results in aggregate liability as to any single or related series of transactions, incidents or conditions, in excess of $500,000;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


16
--


· | we are in default under our license agreement with HLI or the license agreement is terminated, amended, waived or otherwise modified in a manner materially adverse to the lender’s interests; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | failure to observe or perform any other covenant contained in the Credit Agreement.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Upon occurrence of an event of default under the Credit Agreement, payment of the entire principal amount could be accelerated and become immediately due and payable. The cash that we may be required to pay would most likely come out of our working capital, which may be insufficient to repay the obligation or leave us with insufficient cash to finance our operations. In such event, we may lose some or all of our assets as the lender could foreclose on its security interests and liquidate some or all of these assets, which would harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. We may also be required to file for bankruptcy, sell assets, or cease operations, any of which would put our company, our investors and the value of our common stock, at significant risk.
 
The pledge of these assets and other restrictions may limit our flexibility in raising capital for other purposes. Because substantially all of our assets are pledged under the Credit Agreement, our ability to incur additional secured indebtedness or to sell or dispose of assets to raise capital may be impaired, which could have an adverse effect on our financial flexibility.
 
Our goodwill and long-lived assets are subject to potential further impairment, and if those become further impaired, it could materially further the reduction in the value of our assets and increase our net loss for the year in which the write-off occurs.
 
Our intangible and fixed assets have finite useful lives and are amortized or depreciated over their useful lives on either a straight-line basis or over the expected period of benefit or as revenues are earned from the sales of the related products. The underlying assumptions regarding the estimated useful lives of these intangible assets are reviewed annually and more often if an event or circumstance occurs making it likely that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable and are adjusted through accelerated amortization if necessary. Whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets is not recoverable we test intangible assets for impairment based on estimates of future cash flows. If an intangible asset is considered to be impaired, the amount of the impairment will equal the excess of the carrying value over the fair value of the asset.
 
As of December 31, 2016, we had $12.0 million in goodwill related to acquisitions, which represents the purchase price we paid in excess of the fair value of the net tangible assets and identifiable intangible assets we acquired. We assess the recoverability of goodwill annually, at the beginning of the fourth quarter of each fiscal year, and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate the carrying amount may be impaired. Under Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) guidance for goodwill and other intangible assets, a reporting unit is defined as an operating segment or one level below the operating segment, called a component. However, two or more components of an operating segment will be aggregated and deemed a single reporting unit if the components have similar economic characteristics. We adopted authoritative accounting guidance that allows us to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the more detailed two-step quantitative goodwill impairment test. We perform the quantitative test if the qualitative assessment determined it is more likely than not that a reporting unit’s fair value is less than its carrying amount. We may elect to bypass the qualitative assessment and proceed directly to the quantitative test for any reporting unit. When performing the quantitative test, an impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount of the reporting unit’s net assets exceeds the estimated fair value of the reporting unit and the carrying amount of reporting unit goodwill is determined to exceed the implied fair value of that goodwill. The estimated fair value of a reporting unit is calculated using a discounted cash flow model. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we recorded an impairment charge of approximately $1.7 million related to our MIST tradename and approximately $9.2 million related to our goodwill.
 
If actual results differ from the assumptions and estimates used in the goodwill and intangible asset calculations, we could incur further impairment or amortization charges. Any finding that the value of our goodwill and long-lived assets has been further impaired would require us to write off the impaired portion, which could materially reduce the value of our assets and reduce our net income or increase our net loss for the year in which the write off occurs and increase our accumulated deficit, which could contribute to difficulty in raising additional funds.

If we fail to meet certain minimum sales thresholds for products licensed pursuant to our agreement with HLI, we could lose our right to license such products.
 
Our license agreement with HLI is terminable on a product-by-product basis if we fail to meet certain minimum sales thresholds in the second year or any subsequent year of commercial sales of each licensed product. Each year of commercial sales are referred to in the license agreement as “launch years” and the calendar period constituting each launch year for each licensed product is determined in accordance with the terms of the license agreement. To maintain our license for Biovance, we must meet a minimum gross sales amount for Biovance in the second year and third year of commercial sales. If we fail to meet the minimum threshold in the second year of commercial sales of product, we would be able to cure such failure by making a cure payment specified in the license agreement to HLI; provided, however, we do not have the option to make a cure payment, should we fail to meet the minimum threshold for such product in the third year of commercial sales and HLI may terminate the license agreement with respect to such product. If we do not meet the minimum sales threshold, HLI may terminate the license with respect to Biovance or Interfyl, as the case may be. Even though we are implementing sales and marketing strategies to meet this minimum gross sales amount, no assurance can be given that we will be able to meet the minimum sales threshold for Biovance in the second or third year of commercial sales as required by the license agreement. If we were to lose or otherwise become unable to maintain our right to license Biovance, Interfyl or other products from HLI, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, any termination of our right to license Biovance, Interfyl or other products under the license agreement with HLI could trigger an event of default under the Credit Agreement that we entered into to finance the cash portion of the purchase price for the Celleration acquisition.


Decisions in reimbursement levels by governmental or other third-party payers for procedures using our products may have an adverse impact on acceptance of our products.
 
We believe that our products will be purchased principally by hospitals or physicians, which typically bill various third-party payers, such as state and federal healthcare programs (e.g., Medicare and Medicaid), private insurance plans and managed care plans, for the products and services provided to their patients. The ability of our customers to obtain appropriate reimbursement for products and services from third-party payers is critical to the success of our business because reimbursement status affects which products customers purchase and the prices they are willing to pay. In addition, our ability to obtain reimbursement approval in foreign jurisdictions will affect our ability to expand our product offerings internationally.
 
Third-party payers have adopted, and are continuing to adopt, a number of policies intended to curb rising healthcare costs. These policies include:
 

· | imposition of conditions of payment by foreign, state and federal healthcare programs as well as private insurance plans;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | rules related to how products and services may be marketed; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------


· | reduction in reimbursement amounts applicable to specific products and services.

Adverse decisions relating to coverage or reimbursement of our products would have an adverse impact on the acceptance of our products and the prices that our customers are willing to pay for them.
 
We are unable to predict whether foreign, federal, state or local healthcare reform legislation or regulation affecting our business may be proposed or enacted in the future, or what effect any such legislation or regulation would have on our business. Changes in healthcare systems in the United States or internationally in a manner that significantly reduces reimbursement for procedures using our products or denies coverage for these procedures would also have an adverse impact on the acceptance of our products and the prices which our customers are willing to pay for them.
 
We depend on our executive officers and key personnel.
 
We believe that our success will depend, in part, upon our ability to retain our executive officers, including David Johnson, our Chief Executive Officer, Brian M. Posner, our Chief Financial Officer, Nino Pionati our Chief Strategy and Marketing Officer and Bradford C. Barton, our Chief Operating Officer, and other key personnel, and attract additional skilled personnel, which may require substantial additional funds. There can be no assurance that we will be able to find and attract additional qualified employees or retain any such executive officers and other key personnel. Our inability to hire qualified personnel, the loss of services of our executive officers or key personnel, or the loss of services of executive officers or key personnel who may be hired in the future may have a material and adverse effect on our business.
 
Our strategic business plan may not produce the intended growth in revenue and operating income.
 
Our strategies include making significant investments in sales and marketing programs to achieve revenue growth and margin improvement targets. If we do not achieve the expected benefit from these investments or otherwise fail to execute on our strategic initiatives, we may not achieve the growth improvement we are targeting and our results of operations may be adversely affected.

Our acquisition strategy may not produce the intended growth in revenue and operating income.
 
As part of our strategy for growth, we may make acquisitions and enter into strategic alliances such as joint ventures and joint development agreements. However, we may not be able to identify suitable acquisition candidates, complete acquisitions or integrate acquisitions successfully, and our strategic alliances may not prove to be successful. Such acquisitions could reduce shareholders’ ownership, require us to incur debt, expose us to liabilities and result in amortization expenses related to intangible assets with definite lives. In addition, acquisitions involve other risks, including diversion of management resources otherwise available for ongoing development of our business and risks associated with entering new markets with which we have limited experience or where distribution alliances with experienced distributors are not available. Our future profitability may depend in part upon our ability to further develop our resources to adapt to these new products or business areas and to identify and enter into satisfactory distribution networks. Moreover, we may fail to realize the anticipated benefit of any acquisition as rapidly as expected or at all, or the acquired business may not perform in accordance with our expectations. We may also incur significant expenditures in anticipation of an acquisition that is never realized. There can be no assurance that difficulties encountered in connection with acquisitions will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
 
Our future success depends upon market acceptance of our existing and future products.
 
We believe that our success will depend in part upon the acceptance of our existing and future products by the medical community, hospitals and physicians and other health care providers, third-party payers, and end-users. Such acceptance may depend upon the extent to which the medical community and end-users perceive our products as safer, more effective or cost-competitive than other similar products. Ultimately, for our new products to gain general market acceptance, it may also be necessary for us to develop marketing partners for the distribution of our products. There can be no assurance that our new products will achieve significant market acceptance on a timely basis, or at all. Failure of some or all of our future products to achieve significant market acceptance could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
 
We operate in a highly competitive industry and face competition from large, well-established medical device manufacturers as well as new market entrants.
 
Competition from other medical device companies and from research and academic institutions is intense, expected to increase, subject to rapid change and significantly affected by new product introductions and other market activities of industry participants. In addition to competing with universities and other research institutions in the development of products, technologies and processes. We compete with other companies in acquiring rights to products or technologies from those institutions. A number of factors may limit the market acceptance of our products, including the timing of regulatory approvals and market entry relative to competitive products, the availability of alternative products, and the price of our products relative to alternative products, the availability of third party reimbursement and the extent of marketing efforts by third party distributors or agents that we retain. There can be no assurance that our products will receive market acceptance in a commercially viable period of time, if at all. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that we can develop products that are more effective or achieve greater market acceptance than competitive products, or that our competitors will not succeed in developing or acquiring products and technologies that are more effective than those being developed by us, that would render our products and technologies less competitive or obsolete.
 
Our competitors enjoy several competitive advantages over it, including some or all of the following:
 

· | large and established distribution networks in the United States and/or in international markets;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | greater financial, managerial and other resources for products research and development, sales and marketing efforts and protecting and enforcing intellectual property rights;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | significantly greater name recognition;
--+----------------------------------------


· | more expansive portfolios of intellectual property rights;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------


· | established relations with physicians, hospitals, other healthcare providers and third party payers;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | products which have been approved by regulatory authorities for use in the United States and/or Europe and which are supported by long-term clinical data; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | greater experience in obtaining and maintaining regulatory approvals and/or clearances from the FDA and other regulatory agencies.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Our competitors’ products will compete directly with our products. In addition, our competitors as well as new market entrants may develop or acquire new treatments, products or procedures that will compete directly or indirectly with our products. The presence of this competition in our market may lead to pricing pressure which would make it more difficult to sell our products at a price that will make us profitable or prevent us from selling our products at all. Our failure to compete effectively would have a material and adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

Changes to the FDA approval process or ongoing regulatory requirements could make it more difficult for us to obtain FDA approval of our products or comply with ongoing requirements.
 
Based on scientific developments, post-market experience, or other legislative or regulatory changes, the current FDA standards of review for approving new medical device products are sometimes more stringent than those that were applied in the past. For example, with passage of the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act in 2012 (FDASIA), the FDA was required to revisit some of our policies regarding 510(k) devices which resulted in the FDA drafting new guidance for the 510(k) process. The FDA continues to revisit and clarify our guidance regarding 510(k) devices, and such revisions could impact the process for clearing medical devices, determining which devices are eligible for 510(k) clearance, the ability to rescind previously granted 510(k) clearances and additional requirements that may significantly impact the process.
 
We cannot determine what effect changes in regulations or legal interpretations by the FDA or the courts, when and if promulgated or issued, may have on our business in the future. Changes could, among other things, require different labeling, monitoring of patients, interaction with physicians, education programs for patients or physicians, curtailment of necessary supplies, or limitations on product distribution. These changes, or others required by the FDA could have an adverse effect on the sales of these products. The evolving and complex nature of regulatory science and regulatory requirements, the broad authority and discretion of the FDA and the generally high level of regulatory oversight results in a continuing possibility that from time to time, we will be adversely affected by regulatory actions despite ongoing efforts and commitment to achieve and maintain full compliance with all regulatory requirements.
 
Should the FDA determine that Biovance or Interfyl does not meet regulatory requirements that permit qualifying human cell and/or tissue based products (“HCT/Ps”) to be processed, stored, labeled and distributed without pre-marketing approval, our supplier may be required by the FDA to stop processing and we may be required to stop distributing Biovance or Interfyl, or to narrow the indications for which Biovance or Interfyl is marketed, which, in turn, could also result in a default under our planned credit facility.
 
Each of Biovance and Interfyl is a product derived from human tissue. The FDA has specific regulations governing HCT/Ps. An HCT/P is a product containing or consisting of human cells or tissue intended for transplantation into humans. HCT/Ps that meet the criteria for regulation solely under Section 361 of the Public Health Service Act and 21 CFR 1271 (361 HCT/Ps) are not subject to pre-market clearance or approval requirements, but are subject to post-market regulatory requirements. To be a 361 HCT/P, a product must meet all four of the following criteria:
 

· | it must be minimally manipulated;
--+----------------------------------


· | it must be intended for homologous use only;
--+---------------------------------------------


· | it must not be combined with another article; and
--+--------------------------------------------------


· | it must not have a systemic effect and not be dependent upon the metabolic activity of living cells for our primary function.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
We and HLI believe that each of Biovance and Interfyl qualifies as a 361 HCT/P. The FDA is in the process of clarifying definitions of homologous use and minimal manipulation in its Guidance for Industry publications. Should a significant change occur with these updated final documents expected in 2017, and the FDA disagrees with our belief, changes its policy with respect to 361 HCT/P qualifications, or determines that our marketing claims exceed what would be permitted for a 361 product, and either Biovance or Interfyl is determined to not qualify as a section 361 HCT/P product, we may have to revise our labeling and other written or oral statements of use or obtain approval or clearance from the FDA before we can continue to market the product in the United States. Furthermore, a communication from the FDA asserting that either Biovance or Interfyl does not qualify as a 361 HCT/P product could also trigger an event of default under our Credit Agreement.
 
Modifications to our current products may require new marketing clearances or approvals or require us to cease marketing or recall the modified products until such clearances or approvals are obtained.
 
Any modification to an FDA-cleared product that could significantly affect our safety or effectiveness, or that would constitute a major change or modification in our intended use, requires a new FDA 510(k) clearance or, possibly, a premarket approval. The FDA requires every manufacturer to make its own determination as to whether a modification requires a new 510(k) clearance or premarket approval, but the FDA may review and disagree with any decision reached by the manufacturer. In the future, we may make additional modifications to our products after they have received FDA clearance or approval and, in appropriate circumstances, determine that new clearance or approval is unnecessary. Regulatory authorities may disagree with our past or future decisions not to seek new clearance or approval and may require us to obtain clearance or approval for modifications to our products. If that were to occur for a previously cleared or approved product, we may be required to cease marketing or recall the modified device until we obtain the necessary clearance or approval. Under these circumstances, we may also be subject to significant regulatory fines or other penalties. If any of the foregoing were to occur, our financial condition and results of operations could be negatively impacted.

We and our manufacturers will be required to comply with current good manufacturing practices (“cGMPs”) and current good tissue practices (“cGTPs”) and could be subject to suspensions or product withdrawals if found non-compliant.
 
The FDA regulates the facilities, processes and procedures used to manufacture and market medical products in the United States. Manufacturing facilities must be registered with the FDA and all products made in such facilities must be manufactured in accordance with cGMP, regulations enforced by the FDA. Compliance with cGMP regulations requires the dedication of substantial resources and requires significant expenditures. The FDA periodically inspects our manufacturing facilities and those of our subcontractors and procedures to assure compliance. The FDA may cause a suspension or withdrawal of product approvals if regulatory standards are not maintained. In the event an approved manufacturing facility for a particular drug or medical device is required by the FDA to curtail or cease operations, or otherwise becomes inoperable, or a third-party contract manufacturing facility faces manufacturing problems, obtaining the required FDA authorization to manufacture at the same or a different manufacturing site could result in production delays, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flow.
 
We will be subject to ongoing federal and state regulations, and if we fail to comply, our business could be seriously harmed.
 
Following initial regulatory approval of any products that we may develop, we will be subject to continuing regulatory review, including review of adverse (drug or device) experiences or reactions and clinical results that are reported after our products become commercially available. This would include results from any post-marketing tests or continued actions required by a condition of approval. The manufacturing facilities we may use to make any of our products may become subject to periodic review and inspection by the FDA. If a previously unknown problem or problems with a product or a manufacturing and laboratory facility used by us is discovered, the FDA may impose restrictions on that product or on the manufacturing facility, including requiring us to withdraw the product from the market. Any changes to an approved product, including the way it is manufactured or promoted, often requires FDA approval before the product, as modified, can be marketed. In addition, for products we develop in the future, we and our contract manufacturers may be subject to ongoing FDA requirements for submission of safety and other post-market information. If we or any of our contract manufacturers fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, a regulatory agency may:
 

· | issue warning letters;
--+-----------------------


· | impose civil or criminal penalties;
--+------------------------------------


· | suspend or withdraw our regulatory approval;
--+---------------------------------------------


· | suspend or terminate any of our ongoing clinical trials;
--+---------------------------------------------------------


· | refuse to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications filed by us;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | impose restrictions on our operations;
--+---------------------------------------


· | close the facilities of our contract manufacturers; and/or
--+-----------------------------------------------------------


· | seize or detain products or require a product recall.
--+------------------------------------------------------

 
Additionally, regulatory review covers a company’s activities in the promotion of our medical products, with significant potential penalties and restrictions for promotion of drugs, devices or tissues for an unapproved use. Sales and marketing programs, such as illegal promotions to health care professionals, are under scrutiny for compliance with various mandated requirements. We are also required to submit information on open and completed clinical trials to public registries and databases. Failure to comply with these requirements could expose us to negative publicity, fines and penalties that could harm our business.
 
If we violate regulatory requirements at any stage, whether before or after marketing approval is obtained, we may be fined, be forced to remove a product from the market or experience other adverse consequences, including delay, which would materially harm our financial results. Additionally, we may not be able to obtain the labeling claims necessary or desirable for product promotion.

We and our sales personnel, whether employed by us or by others, must comply with various federal and state anti-kickback, self-referral, false claims and similar laws, any breach of which could cause a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
 
Our relationships with physicians, hospitals and the marketers of our products are subject to scrutiny under various federal anti-kickback, self-referral, false claims and similar laws, often referred to collectively as healthcare fraud and abuse laws. Healthcare fraud and abuse laws are complex, and even minor, inadvertent violations can give rise to liability, or claims of alleged violations. Possible sanctions for violation of these fraud and abuse laws include monetary fines; civil and criminal penalties; exclusion from federal and state healthcare programs, including Medicare, Medicaid, Veterans Administration health programs, workers’ compensation programs and TRICARE, the healthcare system administered by or on behalf of the U.S. Department of Defense for uniformed services beneficiaries, including active duty and their dependents, retirees and their dependents; and forfeiture of amounts collected in violation of such prohibitions. Many states have similar, or sometimes broader, fraud and abuse laws that also authorize substantial civil and criminal penalties for violations. Any government investigation or a finding of a violation of these laws would likely result in a material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock, as well as our business, financial condition and results of operations.
 
The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits any knowing and willful offer, payment, solicitation or receipt of any form of remuneration in return for the referral of an individual or the ordering or recommending of the use of a product or service for which payment may be made by any federal healthcare program, including Medicare.
 
The scope and enforcement of the healthcare fraud and abuse laws is uncertain and subject to rapid change. There can be no assurance that federal or state regulatory or enforcement agencies will not investigate our current or future activities under these laws. Any investigation or challenge could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Any state or federal investigation, regardless of the outcome, could be costly and time-consuming. Additionally, we cannot predict the impact of any changes in these laws, whether these changes are retroactive or will have effect on a going-forward basis only.
 
If we engage additional physicians on a consulting basis, the agreements with these physicians will be structured to comply with all applicable laws, including the federal ban on physician self-referrals (commonly known as the “Stark Law”), the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, and state anti-self-referral and anti-kickback laws. Even so, it is possible that regulatory or enforcement agencies or courts may in the future view these agreements as prohibited arrangements that must be restructured or for which we would be subject to other significant civil or criminal penalties. Because our strategy includes the involvement of physicians who consult with us on the design of our products, we could be materially impacted if regulatory or enforcement agencies or courts interpret our financial relationships with our physician advisors who refer or order our products to be in violation of one or more health care fraud and abuse laws. Such government action could harm our reputation and the reputations of our physician advisors. In addition, the cost of noncompliance with these laws could be substantial because we could be subject to monetary fines and civil or criminal penalties, and we could also be excluded from state and federal healthcare programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, for non-compliance.
 
If we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights adequately, we may not be able to compete effectively.
 
Our success depends in part on our ability to protect the proprietary rights to the technologies used in our products. We rely on patent protection, as well as a combination of trademark laws and confidentiality, noncompetition and other contractual arrangements to protect our proprietary technology. However, these legal means afford only limited protection and may not adequately protect our rights or permit us to gain or keep a competitive advantage. Our patents and patent applications, if issued, may not be broad enough to prevent competitors from introducing similar products into the market. Our patents, if challenged or if it attempts to enforce them, may not necessarily be upheld by the courts. In addition, patent protection in foreign countries may be different from patent protection under U.S. laws and may not be favorable to us. Efforts to enforce any of our proprietary rights could be time-consuming and expensive, which could adversely affect our business and prospects and divert management’s attention.
 
We are dependent on proprietary know-how.
 
We rely on trade secret protection to protect our interests in proprietary know-how and for processes for which patents are difficult to obtain or enforce. We may not be able to protect our trade secrets adequately. In addition, we rely on non-disclosure and confidentiality agreements with employees, consultants and other parties to protect, in part, trade secrets and other proprietary technology. These agreements may be breached and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach. Moreover, others may independently develop equivalent proprietary information, and third parties may otherwise gain access to our trade secrets and proprietary knowledge. Any disclosure of confidential data into the public domain or to third parties could allow competitors to learn our trade secrets and use the information in competition against us.
 

22
--

 

Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, there is no assurance that such protections will preclude our competitors from developing and/or marketing similar products. While we are not aware of any third party intellectual property that would materially affect our business, our failure or inability to obtain patents and protect our proprietary information could result in our business being adversely affected.
 
If we are not able to establish and maintain successful arrangements with third parties or successfully build our own sales and marketing infrastructure, we may not be able to commercialize our products, which would adversely affect our business and financial condition.
 
To commercialize our products, we must continue to develop our own sales, marketing and distribution capabilities, which will be expensive and time consuming, or make arrangements with third parties to perform these services for us. The third parties may not be capable of successfully selling any of our products. We will have to commit significant resources to developing a marketing and sales force and supporting distribution capabilities. If we decide to enter into arrangements with third parties for performance of these services, we may find that they are not available on terms acceptable to us, or at all.
 
We may face intellectual property infringement claims that could be time-consuming, costly to defend and could result in our loss of significant rights and, in the case of patent infringement claims, the assessment of treble damages.
 
On occasion, we may receive notices of claims of our infringement, misappropriation or misuse of other parties’ proprietary rights. We may have disputes regarding intellectual property rights with the parties that have licensed those rights to us. We may also initiate claims to defend our intellectual property. Intellectual property litigation, regardless of its outcome, is expensive and time-consuming, could divert management’s attention from our business and have a material negative effect on our business, operating results or financial condition. In addition, the outcome of such litigation may be unpredictable. If there is a successful claim of infringement against us, we may be required to pay substantial damages—including treble damages if we were to be found to have willfully infringed a third party’s patent—to the party claiming infringement, and to develop non-infringing technology, stop selling our products or using technology that contains the allegedly infringing intellectual property or enter into royalty or license agreements that may not be available on acceptable or commercially practical terms, if at all. Our failure to develop non-infringing technologies or license the proprietary rights on a timely basis could harm our business. In addition, modifying our products to exclude infringing technologies could require us to seek re-approval or clearance from various regulatory bodies for our products, which would be costly and time consuming. Also, we may be unaware of pending patent applications that relate to our technology. Parties making infringement claims on future issued patents may be able to obtain an injunction that would prevent us from selling our products or using technology that contains the allegedly infringing intellectual property, which could harm our business.
  
Our products risk exposure to product liability claims
 
We are and, if successful in developing, testing and commercializing our products, will increasingly be, exposed to potential product liability risks, which are inherent in the testing, manufacturing and marketing of such products. It is likely we will be contractually obligated, under any distribution agreements that we enter into with respect to products our manufactures, to indemnify the individuals and/or entities that distribute our products against claims relating to the manufacture and sale of products distributed by such distribution partners. This indemnification liability, as well as direct liability to consumers for any defects in the products sold, could expose us to substantial risks and losses. While we have obtained product liability insurance, there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain such insurance on acceptable terms or that such insurance will provide adequate coverage against potential liabilities. As we begin to sell and distribute our new line of proprietary products, we intend to increase the amount of our product liability insurance. A successful product liability claim or series of claims brought against us could result in judgments, fines, damages and liabilities that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We may incur significant expense investigating and defending these claims, even if they do not result in liability. Moreover, even if no judgments, fines, damages or liabilities are imposed on us, our reputation could suffer, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
 
Healthcare policy changes, including reforms to the U.S. healthcare system, may have a material adverse effect on us.
 
Healthcare costs have risen significantly over the past decade. There have been, and continue to be, proposals by legislators, regulators, and third-party payers to keep these costs down. The efforts of governments and third-party payors to contain or reduce the cost of healthcare and legislative and regulatory proposals to broaden the availability of healthcare will likely affect the business and financial condition of biomedical companies. A number of legislative and regulatory changes in the healthcare system in the United States and other major healthcare markets have occurred in recent years, and interpretation and application of such changes continue to evolve. These developments have included healthcare reform legislation enacted by certain states and implementation of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (the “Affordable Care Act”) in 2010 which resulted in significant changes to the health care industry. These developments could, directly or indirectly, impose limitations on the prices we will be able to charge for our products, or the amounts of reimbursement available for our products from governmental agencies or third-party payers. These limitations could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations.
 

23
--

 

The Affordable Care Act includes significant provisions that encourage state and federal law enforcement agencies to increase activities related to preventing, detecting and prosecuting those who commit health care fraud and abuse. The Affordable Care Act continues to be implemented through regulation and government activity but is subject to possible, amendment, additional implementing regulations and interpretive guidelines. The manner in which the Affordable Care Act continues to evolve could materially affect the extent to which and the amount at which medical devices and products are reimbursed by government programs such as Medicare, Medicaid and TRICARE. We cannot predict all impacts the Affordable Care Act may have on our products, but it may result in our products being chosen less frequently or the pricing being substantially lowered. Or, the new legislation could have a positive impact on our future net sales due to increasing the number of persons with healthcare coverage in the United States.
 
Other healthcare reform proposals have emerged at the federal and state levels. We cannot predict the exact effect newly enacted laws or any future legislation or regulation will have on us. However, the implementation of new legislation and regulation may lower reimbursements for our products, reduce medical procedure volumes and adversely affect our business, possibly materially.
 
It may be difficult to replace some of our suppliers.
 
In general, raw materials essential to our business are readily available from multiple sources. However, for reasons of quality assurance, availability, or cost effectiveness, certain components and raw materials are available only from a sole supplier. Noble Biomaterials, Inc. is the principal manufacturer utilized in production of our TheraBond dressings. Noble Biomaterials, Inc. utilizes a proprietary and patented manufacturing process.
 
We believe that, due to the size and scale of production of our suppliers, there should be adequate supply of these raw materials from these manufacturers. In addition, our policy is to maintain sufficient inventory of components so that our production will not be significantly disrupted even if a particular component or material is not available for a period of time. However, there is no guarantee that our inventory will be sufficient to carry us through any disruption in supply. Because we have no direct control over our third-party suppliers, interruptions or delays in the products and services provided by these third parties may be difficult to remedy in a timely fashion. In addition, if such suppliers are unable or unwilling to deliver the necessary raw materials or products, we may be unable to redesign or adapt our technology to work without such raw materials or products or find alternative suppliers or manufacturers. In such events, we could experience interruptions, delays, increased costs or quality control problems.
 
Under our supply agreements with HLI, we receive finished goods from HLI. Because we have no direct control over HLI’s suppliers, interruptions or delays in the products and services provided by these parties may be difficult to remedy in a timely fashion. In addition, if such suppliers are unable or unwilling to deliver the necessary products, we would be unable to sell any products that we expect from HLI, and, therefore, could experience a significant adverse impact on our revenue.
 
We purchase the MIST Therapy system from a single source and UltraMIST from a single source. Reliance on outside suppliers makes us vulnerable to a number of risks that could impact our ability to manufacture the MIST Therapy system and UltraMIST and/or disposable applicators, resulting in harm to our business, including:
 

· | inability to obtain an adequate supply in a timely manner or on commercially reasonable terms;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | uncorrected defects that impact the performance, efficacy and safety of our products;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | difficulty identifying and qualifying alternative suppliers for components in a timely manner;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | production delays related to the evaluation and testing of products from alternative suppliers and corresponding regulatory qualifications;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | delays in delivery by our suppliers due to changes in demand from us or other customers; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | delays in delivery or production stoppage by our supplier due to a shortage of one or more of the components comprising our product.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


24
--

 

If the supply of the MIST Therapy system or UltraMIST or the disposable applicators or saline bottles is interrupted or significantly delayed and we are unable to acquire product from alternate sources in a timely manner and at a commercially reasonable price, our ability to meet our customers’ demand would be impaired and our business could be harmed. Identifying and qualifying additional or replacement suppliers for the MIST Therapy system and/or UltraMIST or disposable applicators may not be accomplished quickly or at all and could involve significant additional costs. Interruption of supply from our suppliers or failure to obtain additional suppliers would limit our ability to distribute our products and could therefore have an adverse effect on our business.
 
Contractual and other disagreements with or involving our licensors, distribution partners and other commercial partners could harm our business, make us liable to them or result in litigation costs or other expenses.
 
Our agreements with licensors, distribution partners and other commercial partners require us to comply with performance conditions that are subject to interpretation and could result in disagreements. At any given time, we may be in disputes with one or more licensors, distribution partners or other commercial partners. Any such dispute could be very expensive for us, even if the outcome is ultimately in our favor. We cannot predict the outcome of any arbitration or litigation, the effect of any negative judgment against us or the amount of any settlement that we may enter into with such licensors, distribution partners or any other third-party. A contractual dispute may result in a licensor or other commercial partners seeking to terminate our agreements, which could harm our business, even if such termination would be wrongful.
 
We are dependent upon third-party local distributors to market and distribute our products in key markets.
 
We rely on third-party distributors for marketing and distribution of our products in certain markets, both domestically and internationally. Our success in generating sales in markets where we have engaged local distributors depends in part on the efforts of others whom we do not employ. Many of these distributors have only limited personnel, which could impair their ability to successfully market, sell and service our products. Because of limited resources or for other reasons, they may not comply with applicable local regulations or respond promptly to adverse event reporting requirements under FDA regulations. As a result of such failures to comply with regulatory requirements, we may experience significant loss of revenue, increased costs and damage to our reputation, and our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. In addition, if a distributor is terminated by us or goes out of business, it may take us a period of time to locate an alternative distributor, to transfer or obtain appropriate regulatory approvals and to train our personnel to market our products, and our ability to sell and service our products in the region formerly serviced by such terminated distributor could be materially adversely affected. Any of these factors could materially adversely affect our revenue from international markets, increase our costs in those markets or damage our reputation.
 
Security breaches and other disruptions could compromise our information and expose it to liability, which would cause our business and reputation to suffer.
 
In the ordinary course of our business, we use networks to collect and store sensitive data, including intellectual property, proprietary business information and that of our customers, suppliers and business partners, personally identifiable information of our customers and employees, and data relating to patients who use our products. The secure processing, maintenance and transmission of this information is critical to our operations. Despite our security measures, our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers or breached due to employee error, malfeasance or other disruptions. Any such breach could compromise our networks and the information stored there could be accessed, publicly disclosed, lost or stolen. Any such access, disclosure or other loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings, liability under laws that protect the privacy of personal information, and regulatory penalties, disrupt our operations and the services we provide to customers, damage our reputation, and cause a loss of confidence in our products and services, which could adversely affect our operating margins, revenues and competitive position.
 
Risks Relating to Our Common Stock
 
 Our stock price has been and may continue to be volatile, which could result in substantial losses for investors.
 
The market price of our common stock has been and is likely to continue to be highly volatile and could fluctuate widely in response to various factors, many of which are beyond our control, including the following:

· | technological innovations or new products and services by or our competitors;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | additions or departures of key personnel;
--+------------------------------------------


· | sales of our common stock, particularly under any registration statement for the purposes of selling any other securities, including management shares;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | our ability to execute our business plan;
--+------------------------------------------


· | operating results that fall below expectations;
--+------------------------------------------------


· | loss of any strategic relationship;
--+------------------------------------


25
--


· | industry developments;
--+-----------------------


· | economic, political and other external factors; and
--+----------------------------------------------------


· | period-to-period fluctuations in our financial results.

In addition, the securities markets have from time to time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that are unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. These market fluctuations may also significantly affect the market price of our common stock.
 
Our common stock could be delisted from The Nasdaq Capital Market if we fail to regain compliance with the minimum bid price requirement of $1.00 per share for continued listing within the time period required by the Nasdaq Listing Rules.
 
On October 12, 2016, we received written notice from the Listing Qualifications Department of Nasdaq indicating that, based upon the closing bid price of our common stock for the last 30 consecutive business days, we did not meet the minimum bid price of $1.00 per share required for continued listing on The Nasdaq Capital Market pursuant to Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2). In accordance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(A), we have 180 calendar days, or until April 10, 2017, to cure the deficiency and regain compliance with the minimum bid price requirement. In order to cure the deficiency, the closing bid price of our common stock would have to be $1.00 or higher for a minimum of ten consecutive business days during the initial 180-day compliance period.
 
If we do not regain compliance by April 10, 2017, an additional 180 days may be granted to regain compliance if we (i) meet the continued listing requirement for market value of publicly held shares and all other initial listing standards for The Nasdaq Capital Market (except for the bid price requirement) and (ii) provide written notice to Nasdaq of our intention to cure the deficiency during the second 180-day compliance period, by effecting a reverse stock split, if necessary. If we meet these requirements, Nasdaq will inform us that we have been granted an additional 180 calendar days. However, if it appears to Nasdaq that we will not be able to cure the deficiency, or if we are otherwise not eligible, Nasdaq will provide notice that our common stock will be subject to delisting. At that time, we may appeal Nasdaq’s delisting determination to a hearings panel. There can be no assurance that we will be able to regain compliance with the minimum bid price requirement or will otherwise be in compliance with other Nasdaq listing criteria.
 
If our common stock is delisted from The Nasdaq Capital Market, our ability to raise capital in the future may be limited. Delisting could also result in less liquidity for our stockholders and a lower stock price. Such a delisting would likely have a negative effect on the price of our common stock and would impair the ability to readily sell or purchase our common stock. Although we expect to take actions to restore our compliance with Nasdaq’s listing requirements, we can provide no assurance that any action taken by us would be successful, or that any such action would stabilize the market price or improve the liquidity of our common stock.
 
Our stock price, and the stock price of many other life science companies, have suffered significant declines over the past 12 months.
 
Market prices for securities of life sciences companies, particularly companies like ours with limited product revenues, have been highly volatile and have suffered sharp losses over the past 12 months. As a result of these declines, it has become much harder for life sciences companies, like us, to raise money, as needed, in the capital markets. As such, should we desire to sell equity in the future to raise capital, such capital may not be available on favorable terms, or at all. In addition, any such capital raises could be highly dilutive to current stockholders. Depressed valuations of our stock will also make it harder for us to consummate strategic transactions or acquisitions, which have historically been a significant part of our growth strategy, absent significant dilution to our current investors.
 
We do not expect to pay dividends in the future. As a result, any return on investment may be limited to the value of our common stock.
 
We do not anticipate paying any dividends in the foreseeable future. Our Credit Agreement prohibits us from paying cash dividends or distributions on our capital stock. Even if we are permitted to pay cash dividends in the future, we currently intend to retain any future earnings for funding growth. As a result, an investor should not rely on an investment in our securities if such investor requires dividend income. Capital appreciation, if any, of our shares may be the only source of gain on our securities for the foreseeable future. Moreover, an investor may not be able to re-sell such investor’s shares at or above the price paid for them.

We are subject to financial reporting and other requirements that place significant demands on our resources.
 
We are subject to reporting and other obligations under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), including the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. Section 404 requires us to conduct an annual management assessment of the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting. Provided our market capitalization, as defined, exceeds a certain threshold requires our independent registered public accounting firm to test our internal control over financial reporting and report on the effectiveness of such controls. These reporting and other obligations place significant demands on our management, administrative, operational, internal audit and accounting resources. Any failure to maintain effective internal controls could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and stock price. Moreover, effective internal control is necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and prevent fraud. If we cannot provide reliable financial reports or prevent fraud, we may not be able to manage our business as effectively as we would if an effective control environment existed, and our business and reputation with investors may be harmed. 
 
There are inherent limitations in all control systems, and misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. 
 
The ongoing internal control provisions of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 require us to identify material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting, which is a process to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our internal controls and disclosure controls will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. In addition, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefit of controls must be relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, in our company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple errors or mistakes. Further, controls can be circumvented by individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more persons, or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls is also based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving our stated goals under all potential future conditions. Over time, a control may be inadequate because of changes in conditions, such as growth of the company or increased transaction volume, or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.
 
In addition, discovery and disclosure of a material weakness, by definition, could have a material adverse impact on our financial statements. Such an occurrence could discourage certain customers or suppliers from doing business with us, cause downgrades in our future debt ratings leading to higher borrowing costs and affect how our stock trades. This could, in turn, negatively affect our ability to access public debt or equity markets for capital.
 
Our board of directors can authorize the issuance of preferred stock, which could diminish the rights of holders of our common stock, and make a change of control of it more difficult even if it might benefit our stockholders.
 
Our board of directors is authorized to issue shares of preferred stock in one or more series and to fix the voting powers, preferences and other rights and limitations of the preferred stock. Accordingly, we may issue shares of preferred stock with a preference over our common stock with respect to dividends or distributions on liquidation or dissolution, or that may otherwise adversely affect the voting or other rights of the holders of common stock. Issuances of preferred stock, depending upon the rights, preferences and designations of the preferred stock, may have the effect of delaying, deterring or preventing a change of control, even if that change of control might benefit our stockholders.
 
Offers or availability for sale of a substantial number of shares of our common stock may cause the price of our common stock to decline.
 
Sales of a significant number of shares of our common stock in the public market could harm the market price of our common stock and make it more difficult for us to raise funds through future offerings of common stock. As additional shares of our common stock become available for resale in the public market, the supply of our common stock will increase, which could decrease the price of our common stock.
 
In addition, if our stockholders sell substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market, upon the expiration of any statutory holding period under Rule 144, upon the expiration of lock-up periods applicable to outstanding shares, or upon the exercise of outstanding options or warrants, it could create a circumstance commonly referred to as an “overhang,” in anticipation of which the market price of our common stock could fall. The existence of an overhang, whether or not sales have occurred or are occurring, could also make it more difficult for us to raise additional financing through the sale of equity or equity-related securities in the future at a time and price that we deem reasonable or appropriate.

If securities or industry analysts do not publish research or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price and trading volume could decline.
 
The trading market for our common stock will depend in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about it or our business. Although we currently have research coverage by securities and industry analysts, you should not invest in our common stock in anticipation that we will increase such coverage. If one or more of the analysts who covers us at any given time downgrades our stock or publishes inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price would likely decline. If one or more of these analyst’s ceases coverage of us or fails to publish reports on us regularly, demand for our stock could decrease, which could cause our stock price and trading volume to decline.
