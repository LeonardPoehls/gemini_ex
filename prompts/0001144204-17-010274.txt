Organization 
 Bluerock Residential Growth REIT, Inc. (we, us, or the Company) was incorporated on July 25, 2008 under the laws of the state of Maryland. 
 We have elected to be treated, and currently qualify, as a real estate investment trust (or REIT) for federal income tax purposes. As a REIT, we generally are not subject to corporate-level income taxes. To maintain our REIT status, we are required, among other requirements, to distribute annually at least 90% of our REIT taxable income, as defined by the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code), to our stockholders. If we fail to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, we would be subject to federal income tax on our taxable income at regular corporate tax rates. We were incorporated to raise capital and acquire a diverse portfolio of residential real estate assets. 
 We have no employees and are supported by a related-party service agreement with BRG Manager, LLC (the Manager), a Delaware limited liability company organized in 2014. We are externally managed by the Manager, which manages our day-to-day operations under a Management Agreement. On November 7, 2016, the Company announced that it had begun the process of internalizing the external management functions that are currently provided to us by our Manager. See Formation of Special Committee for Internalization Transaction below. Our Management Agreement has a three-year term expiring April 2, 2017, and will be automatically renewed for a one-year term each year on April 2, unless previously terminated in accordance with the terms of the Management Agreement. The Manager is responsible for managing our affairs on a day-to-day basis and for identifying and making real estate investments on our behalf. Substantially all our business is conducted through our Operating Partnership, Bluerock Residential Holdings, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership (our Operating Partnership). 
 The principal executive offices of our Company and the Manager are located at 712 Fifth Avenue, New York, New York 10019. Our telephone number is (212) 843-1601. 
 Investments in Real Estate 
 As of December 31, 2016, our portfolio consisted of interests in thirty-one properties (twenty-one operating and ten development properties). The thirty-one properties contain an aggregate of 9,570 units, comprised of 6,972 operating units and 2,598 units under development. As of December 31, 2016, our stabilized properties, exclusive of our development properties, were approximately 94% occupied. For more information regarding our investments, see Item 2. Properties. 
Business and Growth Strategies 
 Our principal business objective is to generate attractive risk-adjusted investment returns by assembling a high-quality portfolio of apartment properties located in demographically attractive growth markets and by implementing our investment strategies and our Live/Work/Play Initiatives to achieve sustainable long-term growth in both our funds from operations and net asset value. 
 Invest in Institutional-Quality Apartment Properties.  We acquire institutional-quality apartment properties where we believe we can create long-term value for our stockholders utilizing our Core-Plus, Value-Add, Opportunistic and Invest-to-Own investment strategies. 
 
 | Core-Plus. We invest in institutional-quality apartment properties with strong and stable cash flows in target markets where we believe there exists opportunity for rental growth and with potential for further value creation. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Value-Add. We invest in well-located apartment properties that offer significant potential for medium-term capital appreciation through repositioning, renovation or redevelopment, to reposition the asset and drive future rental growth. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 TABLE OF CONTENTS
 
 | Opportunistic. We invest in properties available at opportunistic prices (i.e., at prices we believe are below those available in an otherwise efficient market) that exhibit some characteristics of distress, such as operational inefficiencies, significant deferred capital maintenance or broken capital structures providing an opportunity for a substantial portion of total return attributable to appreciation in value. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Invest-to-Own. We selectively invest in development of Class A properties in target markets where we believe we can capture significant development premiums upon completion. We generally use a mezzanine loan with an option to purchase common equity in the project or convertible preferred equity structure, both of which provide income during the development stage, while providing us the ability to capture development premiums at completion by exercising our rights to take ownership. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Invest in Class A Apartment Properties. We intend to continue to acquire primarily Class A apartment properties targeting the high disposable income renter by choice, where we believe we can create long-term value growth for our stockholders. 
 Focus on Growth Markets. We intend to continue to focus on demographically attractive growth markets, which we define as markets with strong employment drivers in industries creating high disposable income jobs over the long term. Employment growth is highly correlated with apartment demand; therefore, we believe that selecting markets with job growth significantly above the national average will provide high potential for increase rental demand leading to revenue growth and attractive risk-adjusted returns. 
 Implement our Value Creation Strategies. We intend to continue to focus on creating value at our properties utilizing our Core-Plus, Value-Add, Opportunistic and Invest-to-Own investment strategies in order to maximize our return on investment. Our Manager will work with each member of our Partner Network to evaluate property needs along with value-creation opportunities and create an asset-specific business plan to best position or reposition each property to drive rental growth and asset values. Our Manager then provides an aggressive asset management presence to manage our Partner and ensure execution of the plan, with the goal of driving rental growth and values. 
 Implement our Live/Work/Play Initiatives. We intend to continue to implement our amenities and attributes to transform the apartment community from a purely functional product (i.e., as solely a place to live), to a lifestyle product (i.e., as a place to live, interact, and socialize). Our Live/Work/Play initiatives are property specific, and generally consist of attributes that go beyond traditional features, including highly amenitized common areas, cosmetic and architectural improvements, technology, music and other community-oriented activities to appeal to our residents desire for a sense of community by creating places to gather, socialize and interact in an amenity-rich environment. We believe this creates an enhanced perception of value among residents, allowing for premium rental rates and improved resident retention. 
 Diversify Across Markets, Strategies and Investment Size. We will seek to grow our high-quality portfolio of apartment properties diversified by geography and by investment strategy and by size (typically ranging from $25 to $75 million) in order to manage concentration risk, while driving both current income and capital appreciation throughout the portfolio. Our Partner Network enables us to diversify across multiple markets and multiple strategies efficiently, without the logistical burden and time delay of building operating infrastructure in multiple markets and across multiple investment strategies. 
 Selectively Harvest and Redeploy Capital. On an opportunistic basis and subject to compliance with certain REIT restrictions, we intend to sell properties in cases where we have successfully executed our value creation plans and where we believe the investment has limited additional upside relative to other opportunities, in order to harvest profits and to reinvest proceeds to maximize stockholder value.

 Summary of Investments and Dispositions 
 In conjunction with the completion of the initial firmly underwritten public offering that closed in April 2014 (the IPO), we completed a series of related contribution transactions pursuant to which we acquired interests in five apartment properties for an aggregate asset value of $152.3 million (inclusive of Villas at Oak Crest, which was accounted for under the equity method, and Springhouse, in which we already owned an interest and which was reported as consolidated for the periods presented) that added to our pre-IPO portfolio.

Formation of Special Committee for Internalization Transaction 
 On November 7, 2016, the Company announced that it had begun the process of internalizing the external management functions that are currently provided to us by our Manager. The board of directors appointed a special committee, (or the Special Committee), comprised solely of independent directors of our board of directors to pursue the internalization. The Special Committee has engaged independent legal and financial advisors to assist the Special Committee in connection with the internalization transaction. The Compensation Committee of our board of directors has also engaged an independent compensation consulting firm to provide a market-based compensation study with respect to key REIT executives and directors of internalized REITs. As of February 16, 2017, negotiations have begun with respect to the internalization, but no definitive agreements have been entered into. We currently anticipate consummating the internalization transaction at the beginning of the third quarter of 2017, although we are providing no assurances that the internalization transaction will be completed on the timeframe we currently anticipate or at all. For risks associated with our internalization, see the section entitled Risk Factors. 
Distribution Policy 
 We intend to continue to qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes. The Code generally requires that a REIT annually distribute at least 90% of its REIT taxable income, determined without regard to the deduction for dividends paid and excluding any net capital gain, and imposes tax on any taxable income retained by a REIT, including capital gains. 
 To satisfy the requirements for qualification as a REIT and generally not be subject to federal income and excise tax, we intend to continue to make regular monthly distributions of all or substantially all of our REIT taxable income, determined without regard to dividends paid, to our stockholders out of assets legally available for such purposes. All future distributions will be determined at the sole discretion of our board of directors on a quarterly basis. When determining the amount of future distributions, we expect that our board

 of directors will consider, among other factors, (i) the amount of cash generated from our operating activities, (ii) our expectations of future operating cash flows, (iii) our determination of near-term cash needs for acquisitions of new properties, development investments general property capital improvements and debt repayments, (iv) our ability to continue to access additional sources of capital, (v) the requirements of Maryland law, (vi) the amount required to be distributed to maintain our status as a REIT and to reduce any income and excise taxes that we otherwise would be required to pay and (vii) any limitations on our distributions contained in our credit or other agreements. 
 Holders of shares of 8.250% Series A Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock, $0.01 par value per share (the Series A Preferred Stock), will be entitled to receive cumulative cash dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock when, as and if authorized by our board of directors and declared by us from the end of the most recent dividend period for which dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock have been paid, payable quarterly in arrears on each January 5th, April 5th, July 5th and October 5th of each year, commencing on January 5, 2016, to holders of record on each December 25th, March 25th, June 25th and September 25th, respectively. From the date of original issue to, but not including, October 21, 2022, we will pay dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock at the rate of 8.250% per annum of the $25.00 liquidation preference per share (equivalent to the fixed annual amount of $2.0625 per share). Commencing October 21, 2022, we will pay cumulative cash dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock at an annual dividend rate of the initial rate increased by 2.0% of the liquidation preference per annum, which will increase by an additional 2.0% of the liquidation preference per annum on each subsequent anniversary thereafter, subject to a maximum annual dividend rate of 14.0%. 
 Holders of shares of Series B Redeemable Preferred Stock, $0.01 par value per share (the Series B Preferred Stock), are entitled to receive, when and as authorized by our board of directors and declared by us out of legally available funds, cumulative cash dividends on each share of Series B Preferred Stock at an annual rate of six percent (6%) of the initial stated value of $1,000 per share (the Stated Value). Dividends on each share of Series B Preferred Stock will begin accruing on, and will be cumulative from, the date of issuance or the end of the most recent dividend period for which dividends on the Series B Preferred Stock have been paid, payable monthly in arrears on the 5th day of each month to holders of record on the 25th day of the prior month. 
 Holders of shares of 7.625% Series C Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock, $0.01 par value per share (the Series C Preferred Stock), will be entitled to receive cumulative cash dividends on the Series C Preferred Stock when, as and if authorized by our board of directors and declared by us from and including the date of original issue or the end of the most recent dividend period for which dividends on the Series C Preferred Stock have been paid, payable quarterly in arrears on each January 5th, April 5th, July 5th and October 5th of each year, commencing on October 5, 2016, to holders of record on each December 25th, March 25th, June 25th and September 25th, respectively. From the date of original to, but not including, July 19, 2023, we will pay dividends on the Series C Preferred Stock at the rate of 7.6250% per annum of the $25.00 liquidation preference per share (equivalent to the fixed annual amount of $1.90625 per share). Commencing July 19, 2023, we will pay cumulative cash dividends on the Series C Preferred Stock at an annual dividend rate of the initial rate increased by 2.0% of the liquidation preference per annum, which will increase by an additional 2.0% of the liquidation preference per annum on each subsequent anniversary thereafter, subject to a maximum annual dividend rate of 14.0%. 
 Holders of shares of 7.125% Series D Cumulative Preferred Stock, $0.01 par value per share (the Series D Preferred Stock), will be entitled to receive cumulative cash dividends on the Series D Preferred Stock when, as and if authorized by our board of directors and declared by us from and including the date of original issue or the end of the most recent dividend period for which dividends on the Series D Preferred Stock have been paid, payable quarterly in arrears on each January 5th, April 5th, July 5th and October 5th of each year, commencing on January 5, 2017, to holders of record on each December 25th, March 25th, June 25th and September 25th, respectively.

 TABLE OF CONTENTS
 Holders of shares of Class A common stock, $0.01 par value per share (the Class A common stock), will be entitled to receive cash dividends when, as and if authorized by our board of directors and declared by us. 
 We cannot assure you that we will generate sufficient cash flows to make distributions to our stockholders, or that we will be able to sustain those distributions. If our operations do not generate sufficient cash flow to allow us to satisfy the REIT distribution requirements, we may be required to fund distributions from working capital, offering proceeds, borrow funds, sell assets, make a taxable distribution of our equity or debt securities, or reduce such distributions. Our distribution policy enables us to review the alternative funding sources available to us from time to time. Our actual results of operations will be affected by a number of factors, including the revenues we receive from our properties, our operating expenses, interest expense, the ability of our tenants to meet their obligations and unanticipated expenditures. For more information regarding risk factors that could materially adversely affect our actual results of operations, please see Item 1A  Risk Factors. 
 Regulations 
 Our investments are subject to various federal, state and local laws, ordinances and regulations, including, among other things, zoning regulations, land use controls, environmental controls relating to air and water quality, noise pollution and indirect environmental impacts such as increased motor vehicle activity. We believe that we have all permits and approvals necessary under current law to operate our investments. 
Environmental 
 As an owner of real estate, we are subject to various environmental laws of federal, state and local governments. Compliance with existing laws has not had a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations, and management does not believe it will have such an impact in the future. However, we cannot predict the impact of unforeseen environmental contingencies or new or changed laws or regulations on properties in which we hold an interest, or on properties that may be acquired directly or indirectly in the future. 
Industry Segment 
 Our current business consists of investing in and operating multifamily communities. A significant portion of our consolidated net income (loss) is from investments in real estate properties that we own through joint ventures. We internally evaluate operating performance on an individual property level and view our real estate assets as one industry segment, and, accordingly, our properties are aggregated into one reportable segment. 
Available Information 
 We electronically file annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and all amendments to those reports with the SEC. We also have filed with the SEC registration statements on Form S-3 (File Nos. 333-208956, 333-200359, 333-203415 and 333-208988) and Form S-8 (333-202569). Copies of our filings with the SEC may be obtained from the SECs website at www.sec.gov, or downloaded from our website at www.bluerockresidential.com, as soon as reasonably practicable after such material has been filed with, or furnished to, the SEC. Access to these filings is free of charge.
