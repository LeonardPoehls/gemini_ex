ITEM 1. BUSINESS 
 Macquarie Infrastructure Corporation is the successor to Macquarie Infrastructure Company LLC (MIC LLC) pursuant to the conversion (the Conversion) of MIC LLC from a Delaware limited liability company to a Delaware corporation on May 21, 2015. MIC LLC was formed on April 13, 2004. Except as otherwise specified, all references in this Form 10-K to MIC, we, us and our refer (i) from and after the time of the Conversion, to Macquarie Infrastructure Corporation and its subsidiaries and (ii) prior to the Conversion, to the predecessor MIC LLC and its subsidiaries. Except as otherwise specified, all references in this Form 10-K to common stock or shares refer (i) from and after the time of the Conversion, to common stock and (ii) prior to the Conversion, LLC interests. 
 MIC Level Strategy 
 We intend to own and efficiently operate and grow a diversified portfolio of businesses with the aim of producing an attractive risk adjusted total stockholder return. We intend to achieve this by:

 | providing optimal service levels while maintaining the highest safety, environmental and governance standards;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | prudently deploying capital in:
--+--------------------------------


 | growing our existing businesses; and
--+-------------------------------------


 | developing and acquiring additional businesses;
--+------------------------------------------------


 | optimizing price, volume and margin;
--+-------------------------------------


 | effectively managing expenses;
--+-------------------------------


 | optimizing capital structures and tax planning; and
--+----------------------------------------------------


 | realizing both cross-selling and cost synergies across our businesses.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------

 We expect these efforts, collectively, to produce growth in the amount of cash generated by our businesses and growth in our stockholder dividend. 
 General 
 We currently own and operate a diversified portfolio of businesses that provide services to other businesses, government agencies and individuals primarily in the U.S. The businesses we own and operate are:

 | International-Matex Tank Terminals (IMTT): a bulk liquid terminals business providing bulk liquid storage, handling and other services to third parties at ten marine terminals in the U.S. and two in Canada; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Atlantic Aviation: a provider of fuel, terminal, aircraft hangaring and other services primarily to owners and operators of general aviation (GA) jet aircraft at 69 airports throughout the U.S.; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Contracted Power (CP): comprising a gas-fired facility and controlling interests in wind and solar facilities in the U.S.; and, 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | MIC Hawaii segment: comprising an energy company that processes and distributes gas and provides related services (Hawaii Gas), and several smaller businesses collectively engaged in efforts to reduce the cost and improve the reliability and sustainability of energy, all based in Hawaii. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We buy, develop and invest in the growth of our businesses based on a general assumption that we will own them indefinitely. It is neither our intent nor our expectation that we will divest of a business at a particular point in our ownership or as a result of having achieved certain targets, financial or otherwise. This view of ownership as a long-term relationship does not preclude sales of assets when we believe that we have either maximized the amount of value in the asset relative to our capability, or the asset is more highly valued by another owner. Since listing in December 2004, we have divested a total of approximately $360.0 million

 TABLE OF CONTENTS
 in assets including partial interests in several non-U.S. businesses, two businesses in the U.S. and several of the facilities owned and operated by our Atlantic Aviation business. In general, we have redeployed the proceeds from these asset sales in the development of our remaining businesses either through investment in growth projects or acquisitions of small, bolt-on operations consistent with our view of MIC as a long-term owner. 
 Deployment of growth capital has been and is expected to continue to be an important part of our strategy and the creation of stockholder value. Our sources of growth capital include the capital generated by our businesses but not distributed as a cash dividend to our stockholders, capital generated through the issuance of additional debt and/or equity securities, or, as noted above, the proceeds of sales of certain assets. 
 Since 2006, we have owned and operated businesses in the four segments in which we operate today, having acquired a 50% interest in IMTT in May 2006 and the Hawaii Gas business (Hawaii Gas) in June of that year. Since then, and excluding the investment in the second half of IMTT and our initial investment in Bayonne Energy Center (BEC), we have deployed over $2.7 billion in the expansion or improvement of, or bolt-on acquisitions on behalf of our businesses. Over time, we expect to deploy growth capital of approximately $350.0 million per year in projects and bolt-on acquisitions across all of our businesses. 
 Importantly, we are not obligated to invest in the growth of any one business or segment. If the opportunities in any of our businesses or segments are insufficient or the risk adjusted returns are inadequate relative to our financial targets, we will seek to drive stockholder value through other means. That may mean that in some years we invest very little in growth and focus instead on operational improvement  driving top line increases and/or managing expenses (or the rate of growth in expenses) down. Further, although we find value in diversification and the generally uncorrelated nature of the businesses in our current portfolio, ideally we would prefer to have a portfolio of five or six lines of business as we had following our initial public offering (IPO). However, we do not intend to pursue diversification for the sake of diversification if the opportunities are insufficient in number or the expected returns are inadequate relative to our financial hurdles. 
 Businesses 
 Our businesses, in general, are defined by a combination of the following characteristics:


 | ownership of long-lived, high-value physical assets that are difficult to replicate or substitute around;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | a platform for the deployment of growth capital;
--+-------------------------------------------------


 | broadly consistent demand for their services;
--+----------------------------------------------


 | scalability, such that relatively small amounts of growth can generate disproportionate increases in earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA);
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | the provision of basic, often essential services;
--+--------------------------------------------------


 | generally predictable maintenance capital expenditure requirements; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | generally favorable competitive positions, largely due to high barriers to entry, including:
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | high initial development and construction costs;
--+-------------------------------------------------


 | difficulty in obtaining suitable land on which to operate;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------


 | long-term concessions, leases or customer contracts; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------


 | lack of immediate, cost-effective alternatives for the services provided.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The different businesses that comprise our Company exhibit these above characteristics to different degrees at different times. For example, macro-economically correlated businesses like Atlantic Aviation may exhibit more volatility during periods of economic downturn than businesses with substantially contracted revenue streams. While not every business that we own will meet all of the general criteria described above, we seek to own a diversified portfolio of businesses that possesses a balance of these characteristics.

 TABLE OF CONTENTS
 In addition to the benefits associated with these characteristics, margins generated by most of our businesses generally can be expected to keep pace with historically normal rates of inflation. The price escalators built into many customer contracts, and the inflation and cost pass-through adjustments typically a part of pricing terms or provided for by the regulatory process to regulated businesses serve to insulate our businesses to a significant degree from the negative effects of inflation and commodity price risk. We sometimes employ hedging contracts in connection with our businesses floating rate debt and limited commodity price exposure. 
Our Manager 
 We are a party to a Management Services Agreement with Macquarie Infrastructure Management (USA) Inc. (Manager), subject to the oversight and supervision of our Board of Directors. Our Manager is a member of the Macquarie Group, a diversified international provider of financial, advisory and investment services. The Macquarie Group is headquartered in Sydney, Australia and is a global leader in the management of infrastructure investment vehicles on behalf of third-party investors and advising on the acquisition, disposition and financing of infrastructure assets. 
 Our Manager is responsible for and oversees the management of our operating businesses. Our Manager has assigned, or seconded, to us two of its employees to serve as our chief executive officer and chief financial officer and seconds or makes other personnel available as required. The services performed for us by our Manager are provided at our Managers expense, and include the compensation of our seconded personnel.

We pay our Manager a monthly base management fee based primarily on our market capitalization and holding company net debt and excluding debt in support of specific operating entities. Our Manager may also earn a performance fee if the quarterly total return for our stockholders (capital appreciation plus dividends) is positive and exceeds the quarterly total return of a U.S. utilities index benchmark, both in the quarter and cumulatively. If payable, a performance fee is equal to 20% of the difference between the benchmark return and the total return for our stockholders during the quarter. Our Manager may elect to invest its fees in shares of our common stock and may only change the election during a 20 trading day window following our earnings release. Any change would apply to fees incurred thereafter. The current method of settling both base management and performance fees, if any, is through the reinvestment of the fees in shares. 
 Our Businesses 
 Use of Non-GAAP measures 
 In addition to our results under U.S. GAAP, we use certain non-GAAP measures to assess the performance and prospects of our businesses. In particular, we use EBITDA excluding non-cash items, Free Cash Flow and certain proportionately combined financial metrics. Proportionately combined financial metrics reflect MIC Corporate and our ownership interest in each of our businesses. 
 We measure EBITDA excluding non-cash items as it reflects our businesses ability to effectively manage the volume of products sold or services provided, the margin earned on those transactions and the management of operating expenses independent of the capitalization and tax attributes of those businesses. 
 In analyzing the financial performance of our businesses, we focus primarily on cash generation and Free Cash Flow in particular. We believe investors use Free Cash Flow as a measure of our ability to sustain and potentially increase our quarterly cash dividend and to fund a portion of our growth. 
 See Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  Results of Operations  Consolidated  Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization (EBITDA) excluding non-cash items, Free Cash Flow and Proportionately Combined Metrics in Part II, Item 7, for further information on our calculation of EBITDA excluding non-cash items, Free Cash Flow and our proportionately combined metrics and for reconciliations of non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP measures.

 TABLE OF CONTENTS
 IMTT 
 Industry Overview 
 Bulk liquid terminals provide an important link in the supply chain for a broad range of liquid commodities (see below). In addition to renting storage tanks, dock access and intra-modal transportation access, bulk liquid terminals generate revenue by offering ancillary services including product transfer (throughput), heating, blending and packaging. Pricing for storage and other services typically reflects local supply and demand as well as the specific attributes of each terminal including access to deepwater berths and connections to land-based infrastructure such as roads, pipelines and rail. 
 Both domestic and international factors influence demand for bulk liquid terminals in the U.S. Demand for storage rises and falls according to local and regional consumption. In addition, import and export activity accounts for a material portion of the business. Shippers require storage for the staging, aggregation and/or distribution of products before and after shipment. The extent of import/export activity depends on macroeconomic trends such as currency fluctuations as well as industry-specific conditions, such as supply and demand imbalances in different geographic regions. Demand for storage is also driven by fluctuations in the current and perceived future price and demand for the product being stored and the resulting temporal price arbitrage. 
 Potential entrants into the bulk liquid terminals business face several barriers. Strict environmental regulations, availability of waterfront land, local community resistance and initial investment costs may limit the construction of new bulk liquid terminal facilities. These barriers are typically higher around waterways near major urban centers. As a consequence, new tanks are generally built where existing docks, pipelines and other infrastructure can support them, resulting in higher returns on invested capital compared with development of new facilities. However, restrictions on land use, difficulties in securing environmental permits, and the potential for operational bottlenecks due to constraints on related infrastructure may limit the ability of existing terminals to expand the storage capacity of their facilities. 
 Business Overview 
 IMTT is one of the larger independent providers of bulk liquid terminal services in the U.S., based on capacity. IMTT stores or handles primarily refined petroleum products, various commodity and specialty chemicals, renewable fuels and vegetable and animal oils (collectively liquid commodities). Crude oil constitutes an immaterial portion of IMTTs overall storage and handling operations. The business operates a network of 12 terminals including ten in the U.S. and two in Canada (one partially owned) with principal operations in the New York Harbor market and on the Lower Mississippi River. 
 We acquired a 50% interest in IMTT from the firms founding family in May 2006 and operated the business on a joint basis through July 15, 2014. On July 16, 2014, we completed the acquisition of the remaining 50% interest that we did not previously own (IMTT Acquisition). Over the period of our ownership through the year ended December 31, 2016, excluding the acquisition of the business, we (and our co-owners in the period prior to July 16, 2014) deployed approximately $1.0 billion in the growth and development of additional storage capacity, facilities and related infrastructure (pipes, pumps, docks, etc.) and an acquisition of a facility in Illinois. Consistent with IMTTs strategy below, we expect to be able to continue to deploy capital in the growth and expansion of storage capacity and capabilities provided that they generate attractive risk-adjusted returns. 
 IMTT also owns OMI Environmental Solutions (OMI), an environmental emergency response, industrial services, waste transportation and disposal business.

 TABLE OF CONTENTS
 IMTT  (continued) 
 Locations 
 As of December 31, 2016, IMTT comprised the following facilities and storage capacity, not including tanks used in packaging, recovery tanks, and/or other storage capacity not typically available for rent. 

Facility | Land | | Aggregate Capacity of Storage Tanks in Service (Millions of Barrels) | Percent of Ownership
Facilities in the United States: | | | | | | | 
Louisiana Terminals (4) | | Owned | | | 20.8 | 100.0 | %
Bayonne Terminal | | Owned | | | 15.7 | 100.0 | %
Other Terminals (5) | | Owned | | | 3.7 | 100.0 | %
Facilities in Canada: | | | | | | | 
Quebec City, Quebec | | Leased | | | 2.0 | 100.0 | %
Placentia Bay, Newfoundland | | Leased | | | 3.0 | 20.1 | %
Total | | | | | 45.2 | | 

 IMTT facilities generally operate 24/7 providing shippers, refiners, manufacturers, traders and distributors with prompt access to a wide range of storage services. In each of its two key markets, IMTTs scale ensures availability of sophisticated product handling and storage capabilities. IMTT continues to improve its facilities speed and flexibility of operations by investing in upgrades of its docks, pipelines and pumping infrastructure and facility management systems. 
 Louisiana Terminals (52% of gross profit) 
 On the Lower Mississippi River, IMTT currently operates four terminals (St. Rose, Gretna, Avondale and Geismar). With combined storage capacity of 20.8 million barrels, the four sites give IMTT substantial market share in the storage of black oil, bulk liquid chemicals and vegetable oils on the strategically important Lower Mississippi River. 
 The Louisiana facilities also give IMTT a substantial presence in a key domestic transport hub. The Lower Mississippi River serves as a major transshipment point between the central U.S. and the rest of the world for agricultural products (such as vegetable oils) and commodity chemicals (such as methanol). The region also has substantial traffic related to the petroleum industry. Gulf Coast refiners and traders send products to other regions of the U.S. and overseas and use IMTTs Louisiana facilities to perform some of these functions. These facilities enjoy relatively unencumbered marine and road access when compared to other, more congested waterways such as the Houston Ship Channel. 
 Bayonne Terminal (39% of gross profit) 
 Located on the Kill Van Kull between New Jersey and Staten Island, the 15.7 million barrel capacity terminal occupies an attractive position in New York Harbor. As the largest independent bulk liquid terminal in New York Harbor, IMTT-Bayonne has substantial market share of independent storage of refined petroleum products and chemicals. 
 New York Harbor serves as the main petroleum trading hub in the northeast U.S. and a physical settlement site for the gasoline and ultra-low sulfur diesel futures contracts traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange. In addition to waterborne shipments, products reach New York Harbor through petroleum product pipelines from the U.S. Gulf region and elsewhere. New York Harbor also serves as the starting point for refined product pipelines linked to inland markets and as a key port for refined petroleum product exports and imports. IMTT-Bayonne has connections to the Colonial, Buckeye and Harbor refined petroleum product pipelines as well as rail and road connections and substantial blending capabilities. As a result, IMTT-Bayonne provides its customers with logistical flexibility.

 TABLE OF CONTENTS
 IMTT  (continued) 
 IMTT-Bayonne has the capability to quickly load and unload the largest bulk liquid transport ships entering New York Harbor. The U.S. Army Corp of Engineers has dredged the Kill Van Kull channel passing the IMTT-Bayonne docks to 50 feet (IMTT has dredged two of its docks to 47 feet). Most of IMTTs competitors in New York Harbor have facilities located on the southern portion of the Arthur Kill (water depth of approximately 37 feet) and force large ships to transfer a portion of their cargoes to barges (a process known as lightering) before docking. This technique increases the cost of loading and unloading.
Competition 
 The competitive environment in which IMTT operates varies by terminal location. The principal competition for each of IMTTs facilities comes from other bulk liquid terminals facilities located in the same regional market. Secondary competition for IMTTs facilities comes from bulk liquid terminal facilities located in the same broad geographic region as IMTTs terminals. For example, IMTTs Louisiana facilities indirectly compete with bulk liquid terminal facilities located on the Houston Ship Channel. 
 Independent terminal operators generally compete on the basis of the location and versatility of facilities, service and price. The services typically provided by the terminal include, among other things, the safe storage of the product at specified temperature, moisture and other conditions, as well as receipt and delivery from the terminal, all of which must be in compliance with applicable environmental regulations. A favorably located terminal will have access to various cost-effective transportation modes, both to and from the terminal. Transportation modes typically include waterways, railroads, roadways and pipelines. A terminal operators ability to obtain attractive prices is often dependent on the quality, versatility and reputation of the facilities owned by the operator. 
 IMTT faces significant competition from a variety of international, national and regional energy companies, including large, diversified midstream entities, global terminal operators and large multi-national energy companies. We believe that IMTT is favorably positioned to compete in the industry due to the strategic location of our terminals in the Gulf Coast and New York Harbor, our reputation, the prices we charge for our services and the connectivity, quality and versatility of our services. In particular, we believe that IMTTs proximity to petroleum and chemical refineries in both of its key markets and to the very substantial end use market in the Northeast are sources of competitive advantage. 
 As noted above, we believe that significant barriers to entry exist in the storage business. These barriers include significant capital requirements and execution risk, a lengthy permitting and development cycle, financing challenges and the finite number of sites suitable for development. 
 Customers 
 IMTT provides bulk liquid terminal services primarily to vertically integrated petroleum product producers and refiners, chemical manufacturers, food processors and traders of bulk liquid petroleum, chemical and agricultural products. IMTT does not depend on a single customer, the loss of which would have a material adverse effect on IMTT. 
 For the year ended December 31, 2016, approximately 55% of IMTTs revenue was generated by its top ten customers of which seven were rated as investment grade and the other three were not rated. Customers typically sign contracts which, among other things, provide for a fixed periodic payment (usually monthly) for access to and use of IMTTs facilities. This payment may be expressed in terms of cents per barrel of storage capacity, a dollar amount per unit of infrastructure, or a dollar amount per month. These amounts are payable whether the customer uses the facilities or not. 
 IMTT is responsible for ensuring appropriate care of products stored at its facilities and believes it maintains adequate insurance with respect to its exposure. IMTT does not have material exposure to commodity price fluctuations because it typically does not purchase or market the products that it handles. IMTTs customers retain title to products stored and have responsibility for securing insurance or self-insuring against loss or fluctuation in value.

 TABLE OF CONTENTS
 IMTT  (continued) 
 Regulation 
 The rates that IMTT charges for its services are not subject to regulation. However, a number of regulatory bodies oversee IMTTs operations. IMTT must comply with numerous federal, state and local environmental, occupational health and safety, security, tax and planning statutes and regulations. These regulations require IMTT to obtain and maintain permits to operate its facilities and impose standards that govern the way IMTT operates its business. If IMTT does not comply with the relevant regulations, it could lose its operating permits and/or incur fines and increased liability. As a result, IMTT has developed environmental and health and safety compliance functions overseen by terminal managers at the terminal level, as well as by IMTTs Vice President of Environmental, Health, Safety and Security, Chief Operating Officer and Chief Executive Officer. While changes in environmental, health and safety regulations pose a risk of higher operating costs, such changes are generally phased in over time to manage the impact on both the industry and the business. 
 The Bayonne terminal has significant environmental remediation requirements that were partially assumed at the time of purchase from the various former owners. One former owner retained environmental remediation responsibilities for a purchased site as well as responsibility for sharing other remediation costs. Remediation efforts entail removal of the free product, groundwater control and treatment, soil treatment, repair/replacement of sewer systems, and the implementation of containment and monitoring systems. These remediation activities are expected to continue for an additional ten to twenty years. See Legal Proceedings in Part I, Item 3, for further discussions.

The Lemont terminal has entered into a consent order with the State of Illinois to remediate contamination at the site that pre-dated IMTTs ownership. This remediation effort, including the implementation of extraction and monitoring wells and soil treatment, is estimated to continue for an additional ten to twenty years. 
 Employees and Management 
 As of December 31, 2016, IMTT (excluding the Newfoundland terminal) had a total of 1,052 employees, of which 230 employees were unionized. In January 2017, IMTT agreed to a new, five year collective bargaining agreement with its Bayonne employees represented by the United Steel Workers. This agreement is expected to be executed within the quarter ended March 31, 2017. We believe employee relations at IMTT are good. 
 The day-to-day operations of IMTT are managed by individual terminal managers who are responsible for most aspects of the operations at their terminals. IMTTs operations are overseen by senior personnel with significant experience in the bulk liquid storage industry. Management of the business is headquartered in New Orleans, Louisiana. 
 Atlantic Aviation 
 Industry Overview 
 Fixed based operations (FBOs) primarily service the GA corporate and leisure flying segment of the air transportation industry. Local airport authorities own the airport properties and grant FBO operators the right to provide fueling and other services pursuant to long-term ground leases. Fueling services provide the majority of an FBOs revenue and gross margin. 
 FBOs often operate in environments with high barriers to entry. Airports tend to have limited physical space for additional FBOs. Airport authorities generally do not have an incentive to add additional FBOs unless there is a significant demand for additional services. Government approvals and design and construction of a new FBO can also take significant time and require significant capital expenditures. Furthermore, airports typically impose minimum standards with respect to the experience, capital investment and breadth of services provided by the FBO. 

10



 TABLE OF CONTENTS
 Atlantic Aviation  (continued) 
 The ownership of FBOs in the U.S. is fragmented with the majority of facilities individually owned and operated rather than part of networks or chains. Consolidation has been and is expected to continue to be an important feature of the industry with larger networks that are able to achieve economies of scale in fuel and insurance purchasing, marketing and back office operations acquiring locations from individual owners/operators. We believe that this is a trend that will continue over the medium term. 
 Demand for FBO services is driven by the level of GA flight activity and is defined as the number of take-offs and landings in a given period. Industry wide, GA business jet take-offs and landings increased by 1.3% for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared with the year ended December 31, 2015 according to flight data reported by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). GA business jet take-off and landings at airports where Atlantic Aviation operates increased by 1.1% during the year ended December 31, 2016. We believe GA flight activity will continue to expand consistent with increased economic activity in the U.S. and Atlantic Aviations presence in some of the more popular business and recreational destinations in the U.S.

Business Overview 
 At December 31, 2016, Atlantic Aviation operated FBOs at 69 airports in the U.S. Atlantic Aviations FBOs provide fueling and fuel-related services, aircraft parking and hangar services to owners/operators of jet aircraft, primarily to the GA sector of the air transportation industry, but also to commercial, military, freight and government aviation customers. 
 Atlantic Aviation has been a part of the MIC portfolio since our IPO. In December 2004, the business owned and operated a total of 16 FBOs. Through a roll-up of FBOs since then, we have acquired a total of 69 facilities. Consistent with our strategy of seeking to optimize the portfolio by exiting markets we believe have limited growth potential in favor of entering those with better prospects, we have divested of a total of 16 sites. Today Atlantic Aviation operates FBOs on 69 airports in the U.S. Including the acquisition of additional FBOs, we have deployed over $1.7 billion in Atlantic Aviation in the development of projects including the construction of terminals and aircraft hangars, fuel tank farms, aircraft parking (ramps) and a range of smaller projects through the year ended December 31, 2016.

 TABLE OF CONTENTS
 Atlantic Aviation  (continued) 
 Operations 
 Atlantic Aviation has high-quality facilities and focuses on attracting customers who desire a high level of personalized service. Fueling and fuel-related services generated 64% of gross margin for the year ended December 31, 2016. Other services, including de-icing, aircraft parking, hangar rental and catering, provided the balance. Fuel is stored in tank farms and each FBO operates refueling vehicles owned or leased by the FBO to move fuel from the tank farms to the aircraft being serviced. The FBO either owns or has access to the fuel storage tanks to support its fueling activities. At some of Atlantic Aviations locations, services are also provided to commercial airlines and the military. Services provided to the airlines may include refueling from the airlines own fuel supplies, de-icing and/or ground and ramp handling services. 
 Atlantic Aviation buys fuel at a wholesale price and sells fuel to customers either at a contracted price, or at a price negotiated at the point of purchase. While wholesale fuel costs can be volatile, Atlantic Aviation generally passes fuel cost changes through to customers and attempts to maintain and, when possible, increase its dollar-based margin per gallon. Atlantic Aviation also fuels aircraft with fuel owned by third parties and charges customers a fee for this service. The business has minimal exposure to commodity price risk as it generally carries a limited inventory of jet fuel on its books. 
 Atlantic Aviation is focused on managing costs effectively and continuously evaluates opportunities to reduce expenses. Such opportunities may include business reengineering, more efficient purchasing, partnering with service providers and/or capturing synergies in acquisitions. 
 Locations 
 Atlantic Aviations FBOs operate pursuant to long-term leases from airport authorities who own or manage the airport. Atlantic Aviation works with these airport authorities to maximize lease lengths through capital improvements or other enhancements to the airport. 
 Atlantic Aviations EBITDA-weighted average remaining lease length (at Atlantic Aviations discretion) was 19.6 years at December 31, 2016 and 2015, notwithstanding the passage of one year. The leases at nine of Atlantic Aviations FBOs, collectively accounting for approximately 10.0% of Atlantic Aviations gross margin, will expire within the next five years. No individual FBO generates more than 10% of the gross margin of the business at December 31, 2016. 
 The airport authorities have certain termination rights in each of Atlantic Aviations leases. Standard terms allow for termination if Atlantic Aviation defaults on the terms and conditions of the lease, abandons the property or becomes insolvent or bankrupt. Most of the leases allow for termination if liens are filed against the property. Fewer than twenty leases may be terminated for convenience or other similar reasons. In these cases, generally, there are compensation agreements based on amortization schedules or obligations of the airport authority to make best efforts to relocate the FBO.

Atlantic Aviation periodically evaluates its portfolio of FBOs and may conclude that some of its sites do not have sufficient scale or do not serve a market with sufficiently strong growth prospects to warrant continued operations at these locations in which case it may elect to sell the site or not renew the lease upon maturity. 
 Marketing 
 Atlantic Aviation has a number of marketing programs, each utilizing an internally-developed point-of-sale system that tracks GA flight movements. This program supports flight tracking and provides customer relationship management data that facilitates up-selling of fuel and optimization of revenue per customer. 
 Atlantic Aviation also maintains a loyalty program for pilots known as Atlantic Awards that provides an incentive to purchase fuel from Atlantic Aviation. These awards are recorded as a reduction in revenue in Atlantic Aviations consolidated financial statements.

 Competition 
 Atlantic Aviation directly competes with other FBO operators at more than half of its locations. The FBOs compete on the basis of location of the facility relative to runways and street access, service, safety, value-added features, reliability and price. Each FBO also faces competitive pressure from the fact that aircraft may take on sufficient fuel at one location and not need to refuel at a specific destination. FBO operators also face indirect competition from facilities located at nearby airports. 
 Atlantic Aviations main competitors are Signature Flight Support, Jet Aviation, Million Air, Sheltair Aviation and TAC Air. In February 2016, Signature Flight Support acquired Landmark Aviation, resulting in the combination of two of Atlantic Aviations biggest competitors. Signature Flight Support competes with Atlantic at 22 airports, but only three of these locations were added as a result of the merger. Atlantic Aviation has not noticed a significant shift in customer or competitor behavior and remains confident in its ability to compete effectively. To our knowledge, other than the competitors listed, no other competitor operated more than 20 FBOs in the U.S. at December 31, 2016. 
 Customers 
 Atlantic Aviation does not depend on a single customer, the loss of which would have a material adverse effect on the business. 
 Regulation 
 The aviation industry is overseen by a number of regulatory bodies, but its primary regulator is the FAA. In addition, local airport authorities also regulate the FBOs. The business must comply with federal, state and local environmental statutes and regulations associated in part with the operation of fuel storage tank systems and mobile fueling vehicles. These requirements include, among other things, tank and pipe testing for tightness, soil sampling for evidence of leaking and remediation of detected leaks and spills. 
 Atlantic Aviations FBOs are subject to regular inspection by federal and local environmental agencies as well as local fire departments and other agencies. The business does not expect that compliance and related remediation work, if any, will have a material negative impact on earnings or the competitive position of Atlantic Aviation. The business has not received notice requiring it to cease operations at any location or of any abatement proceeding by any government agency as a result of failure to comply with applicable environmental laws and regulations. 
 Employees and Management 
 As of December 31, 2016, the business employed 1,956 people, of which 190 employees were subject to collective bargaining agreements. We believe relations with union and non-union employees at Atlantic Aviation are good. 
 The day-to-day operations of Atlantic Aviation are managed by individual site managers who are responsible for most aspects of the operations at their site. Atlantic Aviations operations are overseen by senior personnel with significant experience in the aviation industry. 
 Contracted Power 
 Industry Overview 
 The power industry represents a large and critical infrastructure market, both in terms of the number and value of facilities as well as their contribution to overall economic activity. In developed economies, capital spending in the sector is driven by aging infrastructure, new technologies, increased legislation regarding emissions, the use of renewable energy and modest demand growth. 
 The Energy Information Administration forecasts the demand for electricity in the U.S. to grow at a compound annual rate of approximately 0.7% over the next twenty years. As aging and inefficient generating capacity is retired or replaced, opportunities for deployment of capital in the growth of our CP segment are expected to increase. 

13



 TABLE OF CONTENTS
 Contracted Power  (continued) 
 Transaction activity in the electricity generating sector of the industry has been driven by a combination of portfolio optimization and a significant number of renewable power projects being developed as a result of the adoption of Renewable Portfolio Standards (RPS). RPS are state-level regulatory mandates that aim to create demand for electricity derived from renewable sources by obligating utilities and other load-serving entities to provide a specific portion of their electricity generation from qualifying renewable technologies by a specified date. Transactions involving both existing and greenfield power assets have increased in number as CP projects offer an attractive risk-adjusted return, particularly in a low interest rate environment. 
Business Overview 
 The businesses in our CP segment sell electricity to creditworthy off-takers, typically pursuant to multi-year contracts. These contracts include either long-term power purchase agreements (PPAs) or tolling arrangements whereby a counterparty has contracted with one of our businesses to deliver a specified suite of energy and related services. These contracts provide a hedge against volatility in revenue from fluctuations in demand or price. MICs current portfolio of electricity generating facilities utilize wind, solar and gas-fired technologies. We expect to continue to seek attractive investment opportunities in a range of conventional and renewable energy production and distribution projects and to pursue expansion opportunities at existing facilities. 
 At our IPO, we invested in a district energy business in Chicago, Illinois. We owned 100% of the business from our IPO until December 2009 at which time we sold a 49.99% interest in the business to a third party. In August 2014, we divested our remaining 50.01% interest. The financial results for the district energy business were reported as a component of CP through the date it was divested. 
 At December 31, 2016, CP consisted of controlling interests in six solar facilities, two wind facilities and a 100% interest in a gas-fired facility. We made our first investment in a solar facility in late 2012. Our portfolio consists of two solar facilities in Arizona, two in California, one in Texas and one in Utah. These solar facilities have an aggregate generating capacity of 137 megawatts (MW). Our wind facilities are located in Idaho and New Mexico and have a combined generating capacity of 203 MW. The gas-fired facility, BEC, has a generating capacity of 512 MW and is located in Bayonne, New Jersey, adjacent to IMTTs Bayonne terminal. 
 The solar and wind projects sell electricity under PPAs with initial terms of 20  25 years. The PPAs generate a fixed amount of revenue for each unit of electricity sold and certain of the PPAs have fixed or CPI-linked escalators. All of CPs solar facilities and the wind project in New Mexico are owned through tax-equity partnership structures in which we have controlling interests whereby we receive cash distributions disproportionate to our investment during the first several years of the projects operations and taxable income or loss disproportionate to our interest thereafter. Our interest in the wind project located in Idaho is an approximately 75% ordinary economic interest.

The renewable energy facilities utilize arrays of photovoltaic solar panels and wind turbine generators to convert energy from sunlight and wind into electricity. The electricity is aggregated and fed directly into regional power grids. These technologies tend to produce a predictable amount of electricity within the bounds of seasonal variability in insolation and wind. The business also generates Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs) based on the amount of electricity provided to off-takers. These RECs are either bundled with the electricity under the terms of the PPAs or sold separately to third-parties.

 TABLE OF CONTENTS
 Contracted Power  (continued) 
 In April 2015, we completed the acquisition of BEC, a 512 MW gas-fired simple cycle power facility in Bayonne, New Jersey, adjacent to IMTT. The BEC facility comprises eight natural gas turbine power generating sets (installed in 2012). Power produced by BEC is transmitted via a dedicated cable beneath New York Harbor to a substation in Brooklyn, New York, from where it is distributed into the New York City power market. The majority of the facilitys output is contracted with a creditworthy power wholesaler that has entered into tolling agreements with BEC for 62.5% of the facilitys capacity. The tolling agreements generate revenue whether or not the facility is in use for power production. In addition to revenue related to the tolling agreement and capacity payments from the grid operator, BEC generates an energy margin when the facility is dispatched and also receives revenue for ancillary services provided to support grid stability and the system-wide transmission of capacity and energy. Revenue from these ancillary services does not require the facility to dispatch. In late 2015, we commenced the process of expanding the generating capacity of BEC by at least 130 MW and the connection of the facility to a second gas pipeline that runs beneath IMTTs property. 
 The financial results discussed in this Form 10-K reflect 100% of the performance of the solar and wind facilities within the CP segment since our acquisitions, not the contribution based on our economic interest, and the performance of BEC from the date of our acquisition on April 1, 2015, unless specified otherwise. The financial results for the CP segment, including the results of the district energy business through August 21, 2014, the date it was divested, is presented below ($ in millions):

Strategy 
 Our CP businesses are pursuing a strategy that has four principal components: 
 
1. | to deliver cost-competitive electricity in a safe and reliable manner;
---+-----------------------------------------------------------------------


2. | to deploy additional capital at attractive risk-adjusted returns by developing or acquiring energy projects across a range of technologies and geographies;
---+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


3. | to leverage the growing scale of our portfolio to manage costs and increase efficiencies across the businesses; and
---+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


4. | to recycle capital through the sale of selected facilities to third parties.
---+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Operations 
 Operation and maintenance (O&M) of the CP facilities is performed by qualified contracted personnel and by established third-party service providers under long-term contracts. Other costs such as insurance and land leases are also based on annual contracts. Accordingly, a significant portion of the operating costs of these facilities is highly predictable. The business regularly evaluates which O&M services are best provided by employees, contractors or third-parties. 
Customers 
 The primary customers of the contracted power business are creditworthy counterparties including utilities and power remarketers. Customers have entered into long-term PPAs or tolling agreements with remaining terms ranging from 11 to 22 years as of December 31, 2016.

 TABLE OF CONTENTS
 Contracted Power  (continued) 
 Seasonality 
 Each CP facility has unique seasonality based on local market factors including weather and energy demand. The solar projects generate a disproportionate amount of their revenue in the summer months when insolation is highest, while wind energy revenues vary by season depending on the location of the specific project. Other CP projects may also exhibit seasonality based on the respective markets varying electricity demand. For example, BEC is a peaking power plant that is dispatched when energy demand increases above a base load, therefore BEC is dispatched more often in the summer and winter months. 
Competition 
 The contracted portion of CPs business is not subject to substantial direct competitive price pressure due to the long-term nature of the PPAs and tolling agreements with creditworthy off-takers. Our BEC facility has incremental generating capacity which is available for sale in the spot power market. After the expiration of the PPAs or tolling agreements, our facilities could be subject to greater competition. 
Regulation 
 The power and energy sectors are the subject of substantial and complex laws, rules and regulations. Sector regulators include the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) and the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC). The FERC has jurisdiction over the transmission and wholesale sale of electricity in interstate commerce and over the transportation, storage and certain sales of natural gas in interstate commerce, including the rates, charges and other terms and conditions for such services. The NERC serves to establish and enforce reliability standards applicable to all users, owners and operators of the bulk power system. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency also oversees certain environmental matters related to the construction and operations of CPs electric generating facilities. 
 The New York competitive wholesale electricity market in which BEC participates is administered by the New York Independent System Operator (NYISO). NYISO is a not-for-profit agency that serves to ensure regional grid reliability, comprehensive planning, and open and efficient markets. BEC is also subject to certain New York State and New York City regulations and to environmental regulations by the State of New Jerseys Department of Environmental Protection. 
 Each of the solar and wind facilities comprising CP is subject to regulation and oversight in the jurisdictions in which they operate. 
 Employees and Management 
 At December 31, 2016, the CP businesses had seven employees and two contractors that provide certain management oversight, while O&M is provided by third parties. 
 MIC Hawaii 
 Industry Overview 
 Beginning in 2008 with the Hawaii Clean Energy Initiative, Hawaii implemented a RPS that required increasing levels of electricity be derived from renewable resources with the goal of generating cleaner and lower cost electricity. In 2015, Hawaii accelerated its RPS and currently targets 100% of its electricity generated from renewable resources by 2045 with interim milestones in 2020, 2030 and 2040. 
 MIC Hawaiis businesses support the States clean energy goals of lowering emissions, increasing energy security and decreasing costs for all energy users in Hawaii. For example, at Hawaii Gas, we are focused on diversifying our feedstock to include fuels which are cleaner burning and have the potential to lower energy costs for our customers, such as renewable natural gas (RNG) and liquefied natural gas (LNG). Further, natural gas-fired generation better complements Hawaiis growing renewable power generation sources given its efficiency and operating flexibility. 
At Waihonu Solar, we are generating renewable energy that serves customers on Oahu. At Critchfield Pacific, Inc. (CPI), we work with customers to lower their overall energy use through the design and construction of energy efficient infrastructure.

 TABLE OF CONTENTS
 MIC Hawaii  (continued) 
 In 2016, over 25% of Hawaiis electricity was generated from renewable sources, where the primary sources were solar, wind, and biomass. While geographic location and the high cost of electricity make Hawaii an attractive market for solar power generation, there is the potential to increase the amount of all renewables-based power generation in the market. MIC Hawaii has made one investment in the solar sector and expects to pursue further growth opportunities in line with Hawaiis energy goals. 
Business Overview 
 MIC Hawaii comprises Hawaii Gas and several smaller businesses collectively engaged in efforts to reduce the cost and improve the reliability and sustainability of energy in Hawaii. From mid-2006 to 2016, our MIC Hawaii segment consisted of only Hawaii Gas, the states government-franchised gas utility and an unregulated liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) distribution business. Founded in 1904, Hawaii Gas serves Hawaiis 1.4 million residents and 8.9 million visitors across Oahu, Hawaii, Maui, Kauai, Molokai and Lanai (the main islands). 
 In July 2016, we commenced commercial operations at the Waihonu Solar facilities on Oahu. Waihonu Solar has an installed capacity of 7 MW and produces clean energy under a long-term feed-in tariff with the regulated electric utility. O&M is conducted by a third party provider. During its development phase, Waihonu Solar was reported as a part of our CP business. 
 In August 2016, we acquired CPI, a design-build mechanical contractor with a focus on engineering and constructing energy efficient infrastructure. CPI serves a broad range of end markets including hospitality, real estate and the military throughout Hawaii. With the acquisition of CPI, the portfolio of MIC Hawaii companies now offers a range of clean energy solutions including energy efficient design/build services, cleaner fuel supply and renewable power generation. 
 The largest business within MIC Hawaii is Hawaii Gas. Hawaii Gas comprises a regulated gas utility and an unregulated LPG distribution business. The utility business includes the processing, distribution and sale of synthetic natural gas (SNG) and the distribution and sale of regasified LNG on the island of Oahu and the distribution and sale of LPG on all of the main islands. The non-utility business distributes and sells LPG to customers on all the main islands. LPG is delivered by truck to individual tanks located on customer sites or is distributed in cylinders filled at central locations. The gas distributed by Hawaii Gas has a wide range of commercial and residential applications including water heating, drying, cooking, emergency power generation and decorative lighting, such as tiki torches. LPG is also used as a fuel for specialty vehicles such as forklifts. Users include residential customers and a wide variety of commercial, hospitality, military, public sector and wholesale customers. 
 Hawaii Gas products are relatively cleaner-burning fuels that produce lower levels of carbon emissions than other hydrocarbon fuels such as coal or oil. This is particularly important in Hawaii where heightened public awareness of the environmental impact of using hydrocarbon fuels makes lower emission fuels attractive to customers. Hawaii Gas is evaluating several projects to source cleaner, locally generated RNG, which include the recovery of gas from municipal waste water treatment plants and landfills as well as the processing of locally sourced biomass. In August 2016, the City and County of Honolulu awarded the Honouliuli Wastewater Treatment Plant Biogas contract to Hawaii Gas. Under the terms of the agreement, Hawaii Gas will purchase approximately 800,000 therms of biogas per year at a fixed rate through December 31, 2024. The agreement is pending approval by the Hawaii Public Utilities Commission (HPUC) and, if approved, operations are expected to commence in 2018. 
 Hawaii Gas primary products consist of: 
 Synthetic Natural Gas (SNG):  The business converts a light hydrocarbon feedstock (currently naphtha) into SNG which has a similar heating value to natural gas. Hawaii Gas has the only SNG processing capability in Hawaii at its plant located on the island of Oahu. SNG is delivered by underground pipeline to utility customers throughout Oahu.

 TABLE OF CONTENTS
 MIC Hawaii  (continued) 
 Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG):  LPG is a generic name for a mixture of hydrocarbon gases, typically propane and butane. LPG liquefies at a relatively low pressure under normal temperature conditions and can be efficiently transported in a range of quantities. LPG is typically stored in cylinders or tanks and Hawaii Gas maintains the largest network of LPG storage throughout Hawaii. Domestic and commercial applications of LPG are similar to those of natural gas and SNG. 
 Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG):  In March 2014, the business received regulatory approval to procure, transport and utilize LNG as a backup fuel for the SNG utility distribution system and currently uses conventional intermodal cryogenic containers to transport LNG from the U.S. mainland. The first shipment of LNG was regasified in April 2014 and LNG operations have been ongoing since that time. In April 2016, the business received regulatory approval to invest $12.8 million in its utility business to replace up to 30% of its SNG gas demand with containerized LNG. Hawaii Gas expects this transition to a cleaner fuel source to be completed in 2017. 
 Renewable Natural Gas (RNG):  In August 2016, the City and County of Honolulu awarded a wastewater biogas contract to the business. The agreement is subject to approval by the HPUC. The business continues to evaluate a range of renewable feedstock sources including waste water treatment plants, landfills and biomass.

Strategy 
 Our MIC Hawaii businesses are pursuing a strategy that has four principal components:


1. | to lower the cost of energy in Hawaii in a safe and environmentally sustainable manner;
---+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


2. | to diversify sources of energy and power generation to ensure energy security for the State of Hawaii;
---+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


3. | to increase and diversify the customers served by the businesses of MIC Hawaii; and,
---+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


4. | to maintain positive relationships with regulators, government agencies, customers, the communities MIC Hawaii serves and other stakeholders.
---+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Customers 
 The businesses of MIC Hawaii generate revenue primarily from the provision of gas services to commercial, residential and governmental customers, the generation of power and the design and construction of building mechanical systems. 
 MIC Hawaii does not depend on any single customer, the loss of which would have a material adverse effect on the business.

 TABLE OF CONTENTS
 MIC Hawaii  (continued) 
 Utility Regulation 
 Hawaii Gas utility business and Waihonu Solar are regulated by the HPUC. The HPUC exercises broad regulatory oversight and investigative authority over all public utility companies in Hawaii. 
 Rate Regulation.  The HPUC establishes the rates that Hawaii Gas can charge its utility customers via cost of service regulation. Although the HPUC sets the base rate for the gas sold by Hawaii Gas utility business, Hawaii Gas is permitted to pass through changes in its raw materials cost by means of a monthly fuel adjustment charge. 
 Hawaii Gas utility rates are established by the HPUC in periodic rate cases typically initiated by Hawaii Gas. The business initiates a rate case by submitting a request to the HPUC for an increase in rates based, for example, upon materially higher costs related to providing the service. Following initiation of the rate increase request and submissions by other intervening parties of their positions on the rate request, and potentially an evidentiary hearing, the HPUC issues a decision establishing the revenue requirements and the resulting rates that Hawaii Gas will be allowed to charge. Hawaii Gas last rate case had a test year of 2009 and was approved in 2010. Hawaii Gas expects to file a rate case in 2017. 
 The HPUC also establishes the rate for solar power feed-in-tariff projects such as Waihonu Solar. 
 Other Regulations.  In addition to regulating utility rates, the HPUC acts on requests for the acquisition, sale, disposition or other exchange of utility properties, including mergers and consolidations; acts on requests for financings; and approves material supply contracts. When we acquired Hawaii Gas, we agreed to 14 regulatory conditions with the HPUC that address a variety of matters including: a requirement that the ratio of consolidated debt to total capital for Hawaii Gas and HGC Holdings LLC (HGC) does not exceed 65%; and a requirement to maintain $20.0 million in readily-available cash resources at Hawaii Gas, HGC or MIC. 
Competition 
 Depending upon the end-use, Hawaii Gas competes with electricity, diesel, solar, geo-thermal, wind, other gas providers and alternative energy sources. Electricity in Hawaii is generated by four electric utilities and various independent power producers. In addition, residential and some commercial customers in Hawaii have increased the rate at which they are installing distributed solar photovoltaic generating capacity. 
 Hawaii Gas Utility Business.  Hawaii Gas holds the only government franchise for utility gas services in Hawaii. This enables Hawaii Gas to utilize public easements for its pipeline distribution systems. This franchise also provides for the exclusive use of extensive below-ground distribution infrastructure that Hawaii Gas owns and maintains. In certain instances, the business utility customers also have the ability to use alternative sources of energy, such as diesel. 
 Hawaii Gas Non-Utility Business.  Hawaii Gas sells LPG in an unregulated market on the main islands of Hawaii. There are several other wholesale and small retail distributors that compete in the LPG market (some of whom are supplied by Hawaii Gas). Hawaii Gas believes it has a competitive advantage because of its established customer base, storage facilities, distribution network and reputation for reliable service. 
 CPI.  CPI competes with a variety of mechanical contractors in Hawaii based on technical skills, equipment distributor relationships and cost. There are a limited number of competitors in Hawaii that provide comprehensive design and engineering services combined with the capability to construct major mechanical projects.

 Fuel Supply, SNG Plant and Distribution System 
 Fuel Supply 
 Hawaii Gas obtains the majority of its LPG supply from off-island producers with the remainder supplied by Island Energy Services. Hawaii Gas currently sources naphtha feedstock for its SNG plant from Par Hawaii and on September 30, 2016, Hawaii Gas filed an application with the HPUC requesting approval of a new multi-year contract with Par. The HPUC subsequently issued an Interim Decision and Order in January 2017 providing interim approval of the new feedstock supply agreement. Issuance of a final decision and order is expected in the first half of 2017. 
SNG Plant and Distribution System (Utility Business) 
 Hawaii Gas processes and distributes SNG from its plant located west of the Honolulu business district. The life of the plant continues to be extended through routine maintenance and additional capital investments. A 22-mile transmission pipeline links the SNG plant to a distribution system at Pier 38 in south Oahu. From Pier 38, a pipeline distribution system consisting of approximately 900 miles of distribution and service pipelines transports gas to customers. On islands other than Oahu, LPG is distributed by direct deliveries from off-island suppliers by ship and by barge from Oahu. It is then distributed via pipelines to utility customers. Approximately 90% of the Hawaii Gas pipeline system is on Oahu. 
Distribution System (Non-Utility Business) 
 The non-utility business of Hawaii Gas provides gas to customers (on each of the main islands) not connected to Hawaii Gas utility pipeline system. The majority of Hawaii Gas non-utility customers are on islands other than Oahu. LPG is transported to these islands by direct deliveries from off-island suppliers by ship and by barge from Oahu. Hawaii Gas also owns the infrastructure by which it distributes LPG to its customers, including harbor pipelines, trucks, several holding facilities and storage base-yards on Kauai, Maui and Hawaii. 
Environmental Permits 
 Hawaii Gas:  This business requires environmental operating permits, the most significant of which are air and wastewater permits required for the SNG plant. Hawaii Gas is in compliance in all material respects with all applicable provisions of these permits. 
 CPI:  Certain of CPIs projects are subject to air and wastewater permits. CPI is in compliance in all material respects with all applicable provisions of these permits. 
Employees and Management 
 As of December 31, 2016, MIC Hawaii had 570 employees, of which 412 are union employees. Hawaii Gas has 211 union employees that are subject to the terms of a collective bargaining agreement. The remaining 201 union employees at CPI are subject to the terms of one of four multi-employer industry collective bargaining agreements. MIC Hawaii believes it has a good relationship with its union and non-union employees and there have been no major disruptions in operations due to labor matters for over 30 years. Management for all of the businesses are headquartered in Honolulu, Hawaii. 
Consolidated 
 Our Employees 
 As of December 31, 2016, we employed approximately 3,600 people across our consolidated businesses of which approximately 23% were subject to collective bargaining agreements. The MIC holding company does not have any employees.
