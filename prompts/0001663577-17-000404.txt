Item 1. BUSINESS
 
We are an exploration stage company engaged in the acquisition and exploration of mineral properties with the intent to take properties into production. We were incorporated as a Nevada state corporation on February 18, 2010. We acquired mining concession properties in Peru during the fiscal year ended August 31, 2014.
 
We are considered an exploratory stage company, as we are involved in the examination and investigation of land that we believe may contain valuable minerals, for the purpose of discovering the presence of ore, if any, and its extent. There is no assurance that a commercially viable mineral deposit exists on the Peruvian properties, and further exploration will be required before a final evaluation as to the economic and legal feasibility for our future exploration is determined. We have no known reportable reserves of any type of mineral. To date, we have not discovered an economically viable mineral deposit on the property, and there is no assurance that we will discover one.
 
As of August 31, 2017, we had cash reserves of $802 and a working capital deficit of $2,273,317. We do not have sufficient funds to enable us to complete the initial phase of our exploration programs for the mining claims, and will require additional financing in order to do so. There is no assurance that we will be able to obtain additional financing. Both advanced exploration and an economic determination will be contingent upon the results of our preliminary exploration programs and our ability to raise additional financing in order to proceed with advanced exploration and an economic evaluation. There is no assurance that we will be able to obtain any additional financing to fund our exploration activities.
 
Peruvian Property
On June 23, 2014, Aim Exploration, Inc. entered into a Mining Concession Asset Acquisition Agreement (the “Agreement”) with Percana Mining Corp. (“Percana”). Pursuant to the Agreement, the Company acquired three separate mining concessions. The concession titles are unencumbered and comprise of three separate adjoing mining concession two concessions representing 40% are known as El Tunel Del Tiempo 1 code 11060780 and El Tunel Del Tiempo 2 code 11060781, and the third concession property is known as Agujeros Negros MAAG
 comprising the remaining 60%, all of which are registered to the company.
 
In consideration for the above concessions, the Company has issued 63,000 restricted common shares (15,750,000 restricted common shares pre consolidation to Percana in two separate blocks; the first block consists of 25,200 common shares (6,300,000 common shares preconsolidation) The second block consists of 37,800 common shares (9,450,000 common shares preconsolidation). The fair value of these shares is $326,969 which was based on fair market value.
 
On April 25, 2016, the Company entered into an amendment to its Agreement with Percana and issued an additional 15,687,000 common shares to Percana to bring its post consolidation shareholdings back to 15,750,000 common shares. The fair value of these additional shares is $15,687. An additional 220,000,000 common shares were issued on September 14, 2016, pursuant to this amended agreement. The fair values of these shares is $462,000. Furthermore, under the terms of the amended Agreement, the Company agreed to issue additional common shares to Percana at any time common shares are issued to any director and/or controlling shareholder of the Company, the number of common shares issued to Percana to be equal to those issued to the director and/or controlling shareholder.
Royalties
 
The combined concessions are known as “The Black Hole”, the first two concessions, El Tunel del Tiempo 1 & 2 do not have royalties payable. The third concession, Agujeros Negros WA-AG has a royalty consisting of payment of US $1.00 per each metric ton of anthracite coal extracted from and sold. The royalty applies from the time when the sales of anthracite coal reach US $150,000.
Process Whereby Mineral Rights Are Acquired in Peru (Peruvian System of Concessions)
 
In Peru, any individual or company can solicit (through a “Petition” to the Government, the grant of a mining concession. Through an administrative process at INGEMMET (the geological Mining and Metallurgical Institute), when all technical and legal requirements are complied with, the Government will grant the mining concession. The mining concession grants the titleholder the right to explore, exploits, process, transport, market and refine mineral whether it is metallic, non-metallic or coal mineral. Once the concession is granted it must be registered at the Public Registries and the concession titleholder can freely transfer, assign, encumber or exercise over it any kind of disposition act.
 
A mining concession in Peru does not have duration of time limit. However, it carries an obligation to pay annual Validity fees to prevent cancellation from the Government as in Peru the nature of a mining concession entails a duty for its development and production in order to grant it added value. In the General Regime this is for medium and large mining, the payment of validity fees is US$ 3.00 per hectare per year.
  Rights and Obligations: Concession titleholder’s rights
 

· | The properties are all located on vacant land, and vacant land properties are entitled to the free mining use of the surface land that corresponds to the concession and outside of it, for its economic advantage without the need for any additional request, however that being said the titleholder does not have the right for the use of surface land without formal consent, the properties are owned by the government and for a total fee of approx. US$15,000.00 the surface rights are readily available to AIM.

Figure 1 Property Location
 
Geology
 
The geology in the area of the property and surrounding areas in general have a regional stratigraphy, composed in large percentage of sequences of Mesozoic sedimentary rocks ranging from Jurassic in the western sector, then the Lower Cretaceous superior and in the northwest-northeast with Tertiary volcanic sequences, which cover much of the region, and the upper most are alluvial deposits from the recent Quaternary. There are also some Tertiary intrusive bodies that outcrop in the southwest area of the region.
 
The local geology for the property consists of sedimentary units, corresponding to the Chimú Chicama formations, Santa, Carhuaz and Farrat, and the Alto Chicama River basin is characterized by outcrops of Mesozoic rocks that have the have major folding and fracturing. This folding is apparent in the Jurassic sedimentary rocks (Chicama formation) at lower levels near the Alto Chicama River. Chicama Formation is characterized by the presence of dark gray shale with interbedded sandstones, and slate gray tuffaceous quartz at some levels. The Chimú Formation is present in most of the study area, and is the most noticeable towards the southwest and Chicama formation is exposed near the river. These formations are important because this is the horizon in the area of ​ ​ greatest interest because of the presence of coal seams and in some cases have the presence of sub-anthracite and anthracite, occurring with some areas as "lenses" in the bituminous coal. The following is the sedimentary sequence; sandstones, siltstones, shale, and black shale (Cobbing et al., 1996: 73-74). The two formations are exposed mostly in streams and Quina Shangala (erosional cut within the property), covering most of the local area. The Santa and Carhuaz formations, are not fully differentiated in the study area, having found areas with shale, siltstone, limestone, sandstone, quartzite and in some sectors they have small "lenses" of bituminous coal, but are of smaller magnitude. In summary these formations, especially the formation Chimú, are of great interest, as possible sources for economic development for the "Black Holes Property".

 There are granodioritic intrusive rocks that outcrop in the form of stocks, with the presence of a large intrusive towards the left of the village of Lajon (northwest corner of the property). This area is heavily disturbed and altered, and has the presence of metallic minerals, which is an association of the coal deposits of the basin Chicama (usually Au.).

-


These various Shangala features (used in sampling activities) are essentially a creek that dissects perpendicular to the outcrops surrounding the river Alto Chicama, both sectors have significant levels of bituminous coal, quite broken, which could be of value in the economic exploration to exploitation of the property.
  The oldest rocks in the prospect of coal formations are the Upper Jurassic Chicama and overlie rocks of the Chimú formation, this being the one with the anthracite coal and sub-anthracites plus it includes other sedimentary horizons with bituminous coal. These formations and especially above the village of Chimú is of great interest as a source of possible development of the mining project because they are the carriers of coal in the area and this is this geological unit which covers 80% of the area.
 
The studies done by MTC and later by Gustavson are not done to NI43-101 or coal industry standards to report resources and reserves. The property is currently without known reserves and current and planned exploration programs are exploratory in nature.
 
Current and planned exploration:
 
The previous work completed on or near the property has focused on geologic mapping and sampling via trenches at the outcrop areas and in old, existing tunnels. There are active small mining operations on the northwest area of the property that has also added information on the quality of the coal from the property.
 
The property’s evaluation and database will be greatly improved by a program of additional geologic mapping, trenching and most of all by completing 3-4 drill holes that provide core for sampling and testing, but also will be an important guide to the structure of the coal deposits. More drill holes are required to define resources; the first suggested drilling program may define the need for additional drill holes due to the structural complexity of the coal beds.
 
Figure 2 shows many relevant features of the property. The map is very busy so some explanation is required.
 

Note: this figure is also from the MTC Report of 2012 and shows many features of the property that are describe and explained in the text of this report.
 
Figure 2 Property Map showing Site Specific Features
 
The outline of the property is shown by a lavender line that defines a rectangle shape that is extended to the south. There is no north arrow, but there are grid lines that show north-south and east-west. The Alto Chicama River is in the south (bottom) of the figure and the features, some with red markings that cross the property in a northeast to southwest direction, are the features referred to as Shangalas. The small black marks towards the northwest are the small mines mentioned above.

The main feature from Figure 2 that will aid the exploration and drilling effort is the existing road that crosses the center of the property and is shown as a light blue, meandering line. The importance of this existing road is that it will give easy access to the center of the property where the proposed drill holes can be located. The coal deposits proposed to define first are south of the road and by setting up at various locations along the road and drilling at an angle towards the south will provide the best possibility to intersect and sample the coal seams. Four drill holes along the road can be spaced to provide data points to define some resources as Indicated. The exact drill sites will be defined in a combination of future site visits and geologic mapping, which is the first phase of exploration.
 
The cost and timing for the Phase I of drill hole siting and mapping is estimated at about $35,000 and will be started as soon as AIM has the necessary funds, the process is expected to take approximately 10 days. The planning for Phase 2, drilling, sampling, analysis and possible more trenching is estimated at $350,000 to include a drilling contractor, geologic support, sample analysis and reporting and could complete the 4 drilling program in 6 weeks. This data provided by Phase 1 and Phase 2 could then be utilized to develop a NI43-101 Resource Report and possible a Preliminary Economic Assessment (PEA).
 
The cost and timing for the required permitting for the property is as follows:

Summary
 
Gustavson Associates based out of Boulder Colorado provided the technical information on the Peruvian property. Gustavson Associates is a mining consulting firm with over 30 years of extensive international experience. Mr. Karl D. Gurr of Gustavson Associates completed a site visit of the property together with visiting the Port of Salaverry located in Trujillo Peru and has reviewed numerous reports. Mr. Karl Gurr is a Registered Member of the Society of Mining Engineers and has degrees in Geology and Mining Engineering with over 25 years of direct experience in the coal industry, which defines Mr. Gurr’s status as a qualified person. As stated Mr. Gurr performed a property visit and a visit to the Port of Salaverry and confirms that the property is a known coal bearing area with sufficient past geologic study to merit additional work (exploration) to better define coal resource and eventually a plan for mining the resource. Any further exploration will be overseen and supervised by or through Mr. Gurr and will be focused on providing additional information to advance the project and to do it in a cost effective manner. Mr. Gurr has confirmed the infrastructure and property access already exists and the Port of Salaverry has the capability to store and ship the produced coal.
 
In addition to Mr. Gurr’s visit we solicited the efforts of mining engineer and geologist Manuel Chumpitaz Cama. Mr. Cama has known the property for many years and he attended to extractive of coal samples from various mine tunnels within the property. Through the supervision of Mr. Cama samples of coal were taken from the property and delivered to the local university lab for testing. Following is the official results of the testing.
 
The legal and permitting information was provided to AIM by their team of Peruvian legal advisors based in Lima Peru.

WE WILL REQUIRE SIGNIFICANT ADDITIONAL FINANCING IN ORDER TO CONTINUE OUR EXPLORATION ACTIVITIES AND OUR ASSESSMENT OF THE COMMERCIAL VIABILITY OF OUR PROPERTIES. EVEN IF WE DISCOVER COMMERCIAL RESERVES OF PRECIOUS METALS ON OUR MINERAL PROPERTY, WE CAN PROVIDE NO ASSURANCE THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO SUCCESSFULLY ADVANCE INTO COMMERCIAL PRODUCTION.

While we are very optimistic the properties contain minerals we are not sure. Our business plan calls for significant expenditures in connection with the exploration of the property. We will, however, require additional financing in order to complete the remaining phases of the exploration program, and to conduct the economic evaluation that would be necessary for us to assess whether sufficient mineral reserves exist to justify commercial exploitation. We currently are in the exploration stage and have no revenue from operations. We currently do not have any arrangements in place for additional financing, and we may not be able to obtain financing on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all. If we are unable to obtain additional financing, we will not be able to continue our exploration activities and our assessment of the commercial viability of the property. Further, if we are able to establish that development of the property is commercially viable, our inability to raise additional financing at this stage would result in our inability to place the property into production and recover our investment.
 


Competition
 
We are a junior mineral resource exploration company. We compete with other mineral resource exploration companies for financing and for the acquisition of new mineral properties. Many of the mineral resource exploration companies with whom we compete have greater financial and technical resources than those available to us. Accordingly, these competitors may be able to spend greater amounts on acquisitions of mineral properties of merit, on exploration of their mineral properties and on development of their mineral properties. In addition, they may be able to afford more geological expertise in the targeting and exploration of mineral properties. This competition could result in competitors having mineral properties of greater quality and interest to prospective investors who may finance additional exploration and development. This competition could adversely impact on our ability to achieve the financing necessary for us to conduct further exploration of our mineral properties.
 
We will also compete with other junior mineral exploration companies for financing from a limited number of investors that are prepared to make investments in junior mineral exploration companies. The presence of competing junior mineral exploration companies may impact on our ability to raise additional capital in order to fund our exploration programs if investors are of the view that investments in competitors are more attractive based on the merit of the mineral properties under investigation and the price of the investment offered to investors.
 
We will also compete with other junior and senior mineral companies for available resources, including, but not limited to, professional geologists, camp staff, helicopter or float planes, mineral exploration supplies and drill rigs.

As at August 31, 2017, we had cash reserves of $802 and working capital deficit of $2,273,317. We do not have sufficient funds to enable us to complete this initial phase of our exploration programs for the mining claims. We will require additional financing in order to commence the initial phases of exploration of the properties. There is no assurance that will be able to obtain additional financing. Both advanced exploration and an economic determination will be contingent upon the results of our preliminary exploration programs and our ability to raise additional financing in order to proceed with advanced exploration and an economic evaluation. There is no assurance that we will be able to obtain any additional financing to fund our exploration activities.
 
Patents, Trademarks, Franchises, Royalty Agreements or Labor Contracts
 We have no current plans for any registrations such as patents, trademarks, copyrights, franchises, concessions, royalty agreements or labor contracts. We will assess the need for any copyright, trademark or patent applications on an ongoing basis.
Research and Development
 We have not spent any amounts on research and development activities during the year ended August 31, 2017. We anticipate that we will not incur any expenses on research and development over the next 12 months. Our planned expenditures on our operations or a business combination are summarized under the section of this annual report entitled “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Position and Results of Operations”.
Employees and Employment Agreements
 At present, we have no employees other than our executive officers and directors. We presently do not have pension, health, annuity, insurance, stock options, profit sharing or similar benefit plans; however, we may adopt such plans in the future. There are presently no personal benefits available to any officers, directors or employees.
