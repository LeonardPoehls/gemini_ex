     Item 1.  Business
     General
     Glu Mobile develops, publishes and markets a portfolio of free-to-play mobile games designed to appeal to a broad cross section of users who download and make purchases within our games through direct-to-consumer digital storefronts, such as the Apple App Store, Google Play Store, Amazon Appstore and others.   Free-to-play games are games that a player can download and play for free, but which allow players to access a variety of additional content and features for a fee and to engage with various advertisements and offers that generate revenue for us.   We have a portfolio of compelling games based on our own intellectual property such as Contract Killer, Cooking Dash, Covet Fashion, Deer Hunter, Design Home, QuizUp, Racing Rivals, and Tap Sports Baseball, as well as games based on third party licensed brands including Gordon Ramsay DASH, Kendall & Kylie, and Kim Kardashian: Hollywood.  We are headquartered in San Francisco, California, with U.S. offices in California in the cities of Burlingame, San Mateo, and Long Beach and in Portland, Oregon, and international locations in Canada, China, India, Japan, and Russia. 
     We were incorporated in Nevada in May 2001 as Cyent Studios, Inc. and changed our name to Sorrent, Inc. later that year.  In November 2001, we incorporated a wholly owned subsidiary in California, and, in December 2001, we merged the Nevada corporation into this California subsidiary to form Sorrent, Inc., a California corporation.  In May 2005, we changed our name to Glu Mobile Inc.  In March 2007, we completed our initial public offering and our common stock is traded on the NASDAQ Global Market under the symbol “GLUU.”   Except where the context requires otherwise, in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, references to “Company,” “Glu,” “Glu Mobile,” “we,” “us” and “our” refer to Glu Mobile Inc., and where appropriate, its subsidiaries.

     Strategy and Business Developments
     Our Strategy
     Our goal is to become the leading developer and publisher of free-to-play mobile games. Our strategy for achieving this goal is comprised of three parts:

· | Building Blue Ocean Platforms;
--+-------------------------------


· | Attracting and Fostering Creative Leaders; and
--+-----------------------------------------------


· | Cultivating Highly Creative Environments.
--+------------------------------------------

  Building Blue Ocean Platforms
 The first prong of our strategy is to build blue ocean platforms for smartphones and tablets. Platforms are titles that we continue to update with additional content and features and which grow revenue year over year. We believe a key component of driving revenue growth year over year from a platform title is the inclusion of community features which may involve users competing with each other, forming clubs or groups to cooperate in completing goals or events, or contributing their own original content to the game.  Covet Fashion, Design Home and Tap Sports Baseball are examples of our existing titles that are, or have the potential to be, platforms. We are focused on building platforms in what we refer to as “blue oceans,” meaning that we seek to identify genres that are not oversaturated with competitive titles and where we believe we can become the leader in that genre.  We currently publish titles in five genres: fashion and celebrity, sports and action, food, home and social networking. We believe these are genres in which we have already established a leadership position, are otherwise aligned with our strengths or are conducive to the establishment of a strong platform. 
 In addition, we have also focused our efforts on turning our existing games with a significant daily active user base into what we call evergreen titles. Evergreen titles are similar to platforms in that we continue to update them with additional content and features, but differ from platforms in that our focus is to reduce and potentially reverse their year over year revenue declines; to the extent that we succeed in our efforts to grow annual revenue from an evergreen title, we would then consider such evergreen title to be a platform.  Cooking Dash 2016, Deer Hunter 2017, Gordon Ramsay DASH, Kim Kardashian: Hollywood, and Racing Rivals are examples of our existing evergreen titles.
 While we have generally designed our games to incorporate social features that enhance the user’s gameplay experience, as part of our platform strategy we have further prioritized adding new social and community-based features, systems, and modes into our platform and evergreen titles.  For example, Covet Fashion allows users to join “Fashion Houses” with other users and then borrow each others’ clothes, receive advice on their looks, chat and work together to unlock additional rewards in special style challenges, Racing Rivals enables players across Apple’s iOS and Google’s Android platforms to compete against each other in real-time, synchronous racing, and our Tap Sports Baseball titles allow players to challenge their friends to head-to-head matchups.  We intend to continue to innovate to further enable our titles’ ability to function as successful platforms or evergreen titles. Many of our games also leverage technologies such as Apple’s Game Center or Facebook Connect, which enables players to compare their high scores and achievements with their friends and against the global leaderboard.  
 Another prong of our platform strategy is the inclusion and utilization of key brands and celebrity licensors within our titles. For example, we have worked with our celebrity licensors to engage their social media audiences and build games that will resonate with their unique fan bases.  In particular, Kim Kardashian: Hollywood utilizes transmedia storytelling, leveraging Ms. Kardashian West’s built-in social media fan base to drive installs and awareness of the game, and then attempts to surprise and delight those fans with real-world events and other game content based on her life.  Our Gordon Ramsay DASH title utilizes Gordon Ramsay’s personality to guide users to become a restaurateur in the image of Mr. Ramsay. Our goal is for the game content to become entwined with the celebrity’s persona and social media presence, and to otherwise enhance interaction with the celebrity’s fans.   We believe that we can continue to drive installs and

awareness of our games through our licensing efforts with celebrities, social influencers, organizations and brands that resonate with potential players of our games.  In 2017, the latest offering in our Tap Sports Baseball franchise will feature licensed content from Major League Baseball, or MLB, for the first time, together with current and former MLB players pursuant to our continuing agreements with the Major League Baseball Players Association, or MLBPA, and Major League Baseball Players Alumni Association, or MLBPAA. Partnering with desirable licensing partners and renewing our existing licenses requires that we continue to develop successful games based on licensed content and are able to compete with other mobile gaming companies on financial and other terms in signing such partners.  We also plan to continue introducing third-party licensed brands, properties and personalities into our games as additional licensed content, for cameo appearances or for limited time events in order to drive awareness and monetization.
 We also plan to continue monitoring the successful aspects of our games to drive downloads and enhance monetization and retention as part of our platform strategy, whether by optimizing advertising revenue within each title, securing additional compelling licensing arrangements, building enhanced and more complex core gameplay, adding additional social features, tournaments and events or otherwise.  
 Creative Leaders
 The second prong of our strategy is to attract, cultivate and retain proven creative leaders who will develop and update our platform and evergreen titles and also work to prototype new ideas that have the potential to become platforms prior to committing larger investments in terms of headcount and resources.  Each creative leader is responsible for the long-term planning of his or her platform and evergreen titles and to identify and invest in long-term opportunities and concepts that have the potential to become top grossing hit titles. We have made, and plan to make, significant investment in our creative leaders.  Our talent model is to attract the industry’s finest and provide them with world-class infrastructure, tools, funding and the support to create innovative and polished games. In 2016 and early 2017 we made the following key hires as part of our creative leader strategy, and intend to make additional creative leader hires in 2017:
· | in July 2016, we hired former Vice President and Chief Operating Officer of EA Mobile, Mark van Ryswyk, as our Senior Vice President of Global Studios. Mr. van Ryswyk has more than 15 years of gaming experience and expertise and currently manages our Crowdstar Inc., or Crowdstar, studio that we acquired in November 2016; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | in January 2017, we hired Mike Olsen as Senior Vice President of Studios. Mr. Olsen served in various roles during his 20 years at Electronic Arts where he led the design and creative direction for 25 titles including Star Wars: Galaxy of Heroes, The Godfather, Tiger Woods PGA Tour Golf, NCAA March Madness, NCAA Football and more. Mr. Olsen brings to us an extensive background in creative direction, game design, studio management and live game operations. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Highly Creative Environments
 We believe a key part of building platforms and attracting and cultivating creative leaders is providing them with highly creative environments that are optimal for creating hit games. We intend to build out studios that enable small teams to rapidly prototype a game concept and then move on to developing a game or to building another prototype. Creative environments that support our creative leaders and other game development personnel are also needed to attract the level of talent that will support our growing platforms and build new platforms.  During 2017, we intend to consolidate our teams to fewer locations, including a new larger headquarters in San Francisco.  Our goal is to create a state-of-the-art facility in San Francisco that is optimal for the creation of innovative designs and successful platform and evergreen games. Business Developments
 Since January 1, 2016, we have taken the following actions to support our business:

· | We continued to focus our efforts on developing and publishing games for smartphones and tablet devices.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our significant achievements related to these efforts include the following:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | In December 2016, we had approximately 4.4 million daily active users and 35.9 million monthly active users of our games on our primary distribution platforms, including Apple’s App Store, the Google Play Store, Amazon’s Appstore, Facebook, and the Mac App Store.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | As of December 31, 2016, we had approximately 1.5 billion cumulative installs of our games on our primary distribution platforms, including approximately 60.4 million installs during the fourth quarter of 2016.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | We globally released seven free-to-play games that we developed during 2016, including three titles that we consider to be platform or evergreen titles – Design Home, Gordon Ramsay DASH and Tap Sports Baseball 2016. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | In December 2016, we completed the acquisition of Crowdstar, a leading developer of fashion and décor home games. Crowdstar’s portfolio includes platform title, Covet Fashion, and the recently launched Design Home title. We intend to leverage their successful platforms as part of our platform strategy and learn from their historical success.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | In December 2016, we acquired substantially all of the intangible assets and certain other assets of Plain Vanilla Corp., or Plain Vanilla, including their existing trivia-based title, QuizUp. We have transitioned daily operations and development of QuizUp to our Hyderabad, India location and believe QuizUp has the potential to become a platform title.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | We partnered with MLB to incorporate its brands and properties into our forthcoming title MLB Tap Sports Baseball 2017. MLB Tap Sports Baseball 2017 will also include current and former MLB players pursuant to our continuing agreements with the MLBPA and MLBPAA, including featuring current National League Most Valuable Player Kris Bryant. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | In February 2016, we announced that we had partnered with award-winning artist, Taylor Swift, on the development of a new mobile game. We expect to release our Taylor Swift title during 2017 and believe it has the potential to be a platform title. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | We successfully transitioned our Chief Executive Officer role, as our former President and Chief Executive Officer, Niccolo de Masi, became our Executive Chairman in November 2016, and our former President of Global Studios, Nick Earl, was appointed President and Chief Executive Officer in November 2016 and joined our Board of Directors in December 2016.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | In January 2017, we began transitioning the maintenance and daily operations of Racing Rivals to Carbonated Inc., or Carbonated, a mobile game studio managed by game industry veteran Travis Boatman, as part of our efforts to consolidate our studio locations and increase revenue from this title.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

      Across the globe our industry is experiencing a trend where hit titles generally remain higher in the top grossing charts for longer.  We believe this is due to the continued specialization and investment of teams and companies in their hit titles, and the live, social nature of certain games.  Our strategy and the measures we have implemented during the past year to support our business position us to take advantage of these trends.  We plan to focus on regularly updating and otherwise supporting our platform and evergreen titles in order to ensure that those games monetize and retain users for even longer periods of time.  In addition, we plan to continue to invest in our creative leaders and the creative environments in which they and their teams work to increase our likelihood of creating significant hit platform titles in 2017 and beyond.

 Our Products
 We develop and publish a portfolio of mobile games designed to appeal to a broad cross section of the users of smartphones and tablet devices.  Our portfolio of mobile games is spread across the following genres:
· | Fashion and Celebrity
--+----------------------


o | Covet Fashion, which we acquired as part of our acquisition of Crowdstar, is a top grossing fashion title that has grown annual revenue each year since its launch in 2013. Covet Fashion features continually changing content and daily events to help drive engagement and monetization of its users. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | We released Kim Kardashian: Hollywood in June 2014 and it continues to be one of our top five revenue-generating titles on an annual basis, demonstrating its continuing strength as an evergreen title. This title remained a top 200 grossing game on the Apple App Store’s U.S. iPhone games rankings throughout 2016 on a monthly basis. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Food
--+-----


o | Cooking Dash 2016, launched in June 2015, continued to be one of our top revenue-generating titles for 2016. We intend to release a significant update to this title during 2017 and believe that we have the potential to increase revenue from this title and for it to become a platform. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | Gordon Ramsay DASH, launched in June 2016, continued the success of Cooking Dash 2016 while increasing user retention and average revenue per daily active user. We intend to release a significant update to this title during 2017 and believe that we have the potential to increase revenue from this title and for it to become a platform. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Sports and Action
--+------------------


o | Tap Sports Baseball 2016, launched in March 2016, was the third installment in our popular Tap Sports Baseball franchise in which we partnered with the MLBPA and MLBPAA to include real-world baseball stars from each of the MLB’s 30 teams. Tap Sports Baseball 2016 was the highest ranked baseball title in the Apple App Store’s U.S. iPhone top grossing games rankings during 2016. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | Deer Hunter 2016, launched in September 2015, which we recently rebranded Deer Hunter 2017, remained one of our top action titles during 2016. We recently released two major updates to this title, one which added hunting dogs and the other which added an underwater hunting feature, which updates have helped increase revenue from this title. We believe that this is a good example of our ability to increase revenue from our evergreen titles and intend to apply these learnings to other titles. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | Our Racing Rivals game, originally released in the summer of 2013, was one of our top revenue–generating titles for 2016 and remained one of the highest ranked racing titles in the Apple App Store’s U.S. iPhone top grossing games rankings during 2016. In January 2017, we began transitioning the maintenance and daily operations of Racing Rivals to Carbonated and believe that Carbonated has the potential to increase revenue from this title during 2017. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Social Networking
--+------------------


o | QuizUp, released in 2013 by Plain Vanilla and acquired by us in December 2016, is a multiplayer trivia game where users can challenge friends to trivia games and create their own trivia competitions. It is one of the titles we believe has the potential to become a platform that generates growing and consistent revenue.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Home
--+-----


o | Design Home, launched in November 2016, was built on the Covet Fashion engine and we believe has the opportunity to become a successful platform title. It peaked at #28 on the Apple App Store’s U.S. iPhone top grossing games rankings during 2016 and remains the top home design game in the Apple App Store.

 The table below sets forth the title, release date, and genre for each of the games we developed and launched worldwide in 2016:  
    
Title | Release Date | Genre 
Kendall & Kylie | February 2016 | Fashion and Celebrity
Tap Sports Baseball 2016 | April 2016 | Action & Sports 
Britney Spears: American Dream | May 2016 | Fashion and Celebrity
Gordon Ramsay DASH | June 2016 | Food 
Rival Fire | July 2016 | Action and Sports 
Design Home | November 2016 | Home 
Nicki Minaj: The Empire | December 2016 | Fashion and Celebrity

      As part of our platform strategy, we plan to release fewer games in 2017 as compared to prior years and plan to focus our efforts on developing titles that have the potential to become platforms. During 2017, we plan to release:
    
· | a title featuring singer and songwriter Taylor Swift, which will be a departure from our previous celebrity titles and instead will be an innovative and novel platform for users and fans of Taylor Swift; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | MLB Tap Sports Baseball 2017, an update of Tap Sports Baseball 2016, which will feature current and former MLB players, as well as MLB clubs and uniforms, through partnerships with the MLB, MLBPA and MLBPAA and will incorporate platform features such as allowing users to form clans or clubs with other users and advance their progression through their clans.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  We may release additional titles during 2017 depending on their performance during beta testing.
 We work to ensure that our games have consistently high production values, are visually appealing and have engaging core gameplay.  These characteristics have typically helped to drive installs and awareness of our games and resulted in highly positive consumer reviews.     
 We continued to improve monetization in our games, with our most popular games remaining successful for longer periods of time. The longevity of our most successful games derives from strong core gameplay, regular content updates and social and community features, such as tournaments, player-versus-player gameplay and live events. 
 Our games historically have had “thick clients” due to their high production values and, in some cases, 3-D graphics.  A thick client game means that our games have a large file size, often 100 megabytes or more, that resides on the player’s device.  Because of the inherent limitations of the digital platforms and telecommunications networks, which, at best, only allow applications that are less than 100 megabytes to be downloaded over a carrier’s wireless network, users generally must download one of our games either via a wireless Internet (wifi) connection or initially to their computer and then load the game to their device.  
 Our Revenue
     We generate the majority of our revenue through “in-app-purchases,” with the balance of our revenue generated by offers and in-game advertising.  For certain of our games in which we incorporate licensed content, we share a portion of our revenue with the licensors featured in these titles. 
     In-App Purchases
     Although users can download and play our free-to-play games free of charge, they can purchase virtual currency or virtual items to enhance their gameplay experience – we refer to these as “in-app purchases” or “micro-transactions.”  Some of the benefits that players receive from their in-app purchases include:

· | Play Longer Through Better Equipment – We generally design our games to become significantly more
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

challenging as the player advances through the game. For a game like Cooking Dash 2016, players can purchase higher-quality ingredients and various boosts that can help them complete increasingly difficult levels more easily. 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Play Longer Through Energy Replenishment – We design some of our games, such as Deer Hunter 2017 and Kim Kardashian: Hollywood, to have short playing sessions, the duration of which are limited by the energy available for each session. Players of Deer Hunter 2017 and Kim Kardashian: Hollywood can use their virtual currency to purchase items that will replenish their energy and enable them to extend their gameplay session. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Accelerate Game Progress – Although some players are content to slowly “grind” their way through progressing in a game, others are willing to purchase items to accelerate their progression. For example, our Tap Sports Baseball titles enable players to spend their virtual currency to upgrade their roster of players and boost the effectiveness of such players, thus allowing the player to more quickly assemble a winning team. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Customization – Our games generally enable players to express themselves by customizing their character, the world the character inhabits or a room. For example, Covet Fashion and Design Home each allow users to customize the look of their avatar or room, respectively, by purchasing clothing or home design elements. While in Covet Fashion users own a clothing or accessory item indefinitely after it is purchased and can use it in multiple events, Design Home limits the player to five uses of any purchased design element. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

      We sell virtual currency to consumers at various prices ranging from $0.99 to $99.99 (adjusted for local currencies for sales to players in foreign countries), which is consistent with storefront pricing guidelines, with the significant majority of player purchases occurring at the lower price points.  The digital storefronts generally share with us 70% of the consumers’ payments for in-app purchases, although these rates are generally lower for Android-based platforms in China; we do not have any special agreement or arrangement with respect to pricing or terms with any of the digital storefronts.  Consumers may also acquire virtual currency and other virtual items through gameplay or by completing offers, as described below.
     Offers and In-Game Advertising
     In addition to in-app purchases of virtual currency, we also monetize our games through offers and in-game advertising.  Optimizing advertising revenue within our games requires us to continue taking advantage of positive trends in the mobile advertising space, particularly as brands continue to migrate budgets from web to mobile.  Offers enable users to acquire virtual currency without paying cash but by instead taking specified actions, such as downloading another application, watching a short video, subscribing to a service or completing a survey.  We work with third parties to provide these offers to players of our free-to-play games, and we receive a payment from the third party offer provider based on consumer response to these offers.  We also work with third party advertising aggregators who embed advertising, such as ads appearing within the game between content transitions and as pop-up ads; the aggregators typically pay us based on the number of impressions, which is the number of times an advertisement is shown to a player.  In addition, from time to time we work directly with other application developers to include advertising for their applications in our games, and the developers pay us based on either the number of impressions in our games or the number of users who download the developer’s application.  We have also begun to include virtual product integrations of goods directly into certain of our celebrity titles such as Kim Kardashian: Hollywood and expect that we may generate increasing advertising revenue from these types of product integrations in the future.
    
Licensed Content
     Following the success of Kim Kardashian: Hollywood and games incorporating licensed third-party brands and properties, like Racing Rivals and our Tap Sports Baseball 2016 titles, we increased our licensing efforts, both in terms of securing licenses to develop games based upon or significantly featuring specific licensed third-party intellectual property and for cameo appearances or to otherwise incorporate third-party intellectual property into our games.  In 2016, 2015, and 2014, games based on our own intellectual property accounted for approximately 39.7%, 42.1%, and 62.7% of our revenue, respectively.  The decrease from 2015 to 2016 was due to a higher percentage of our revenue being generated 

 
  9

 

from titles that include third-party licensed brands, properties or other content, such as Kim Kardashian: Hollywood, Kendall & Kylie, Gordon Ramsay DASH, Tap Sports Baseball 2016 and Racing Rivals, and lower revenue from our titles based on our own intellectual property.  The decrease from 2014 to 2015 was due to higher revenue from our Kim Kardashian: Hollywood and Racing Rivals titles, and lower revenue from certain of our titles based on our own intellectual property, including Deer Hunter, Dino Hunter: Deadly Shores and Frontline Commando. We expect that most, if not all, of our new titles launched in 2017 will include third-party licensed brands, properties or other content.
 For games based on or significantly incorporating licensed brands, properties or other content, we share a portion of our revenue with the respective licensors.  The average royalty rate that we paid on games based on licensed content (such as Kim Kardashian: Hollywood, Gordon Ramsay DASH and Kendall & Kylie) or significantly incorporating licensed content (such as Racing Rivals and Tap Sports Baseball 2016) was approximately 21.9% in 2016, 21.9% in 2015, and 21.3% in 2014 of gross revenue.  However, the individual royalty rates that we pay can be significantly above or below the average based on a variety of factors, such as the strength of the licensed brand, our development and porting obligations, and the platforms for which we are permitted to distribute the licensed content. Additionally, the individual royalty rate for our platform titles may increase in 2017 with the inclusion of additional licensed properties, such as we expect with our title featuring Taylor Swift and MLB Tap Sports Baseball 2017, due to the addition of licensed content from the MLB.
     Sales, Marketing and Distribution
     We market, sell and distribute our games primarily through direct-to-consumer digital storefronts, such as Apple’s App Store, the Google Play Store and Amazon’s Appstore.  In addition to publishing our smartphone games on direct-to-consumer digital storefronts, we also publish some of our titles on other platforms, such as the Mac App Store and Facebook.  The significant majority of our smartphone revenue has historically been derived from Apple’s iOS platform, which accounted for approximately 62.4%, 60.5%, and 61.8% of our total revenue in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.  We generated the majority of these iOS-related revenue from the Apple App Store, which represented 52.7%, 51.7%, and 52.2% of our total revenue in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, with the significant majority of such revenue derived from in-app purchases. We generated the balance of our iOS-related revenue from offers and advertisements in games distributed on the Apple App Store and, to a far lesser extent, sales of premium games.  In addition, we generated approximately 36.1%, 38.1%, and 35.4% of our total revenue in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, from the Android platform.  We generated the majority of our Android-related revenue from in-app purchases and sales of premium games made through the Google Play Store, which represented 27.6%, 27.4%, and 24.8% of our total revenue in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.  No other customer or digital storefront accounted for more than 10% of our total revenue in 2016, 2015 or 2014.  
     Because of the fragmentation inherent in the Android platform, we need to “port” – or convert into separate versions – our games for a significant percentage of the thousands of Android-based devices that are currently commercially available, many of which have different technical requirements.  Since the number and variety of Android-based smartphones and tablets shipped worldwide continues to grow, we must maintain and enhance our porting capabilities, which require, and will likely continue to require, us to invest considerable resources in this area.  
     As part of our efforts to successfully market our games on the direct-to-consumer digital storefronts, we attempt to educate the storefront owners about our title roadmap and seek to have our games featured or otherwise prominently placed within the storefront.  We believe that the featuring or prominent placement of our games facilitates organic user discovery and is likely to result in our games achieving a greater degree of commercial success.  We believe that a number of factors may influence the featuring or placement of a game, including:
    
· | the perceived attractiveness of the title or brand;
--+----------------------------------------------------


· | the quality of the game;
--+-------------------------


· | the level of critical or commercial success of the game or of other games previously introduced by a publisher;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
 
  10

 


    
· | incorporation of the storefront owner’s latest technology in the publisher’s title;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | how strong the consumer experience is on all of the devices that discover titles using any given digital storefront;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the publisher’s relationship with the applicable storefront owner and future pipeline of quality titles for it; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the current market share of the publisher.
--+-------------------------------------------

      The majority of our games have been featured on the Apple and Google storefronts when they were commercially released, which we believe is in part due to our efforts to be a consistently good partner with Apple and Google.  In addition to our efforts to secure prominent featuring or placement for our games, we have also undertaken a number of marketing initiatives designed to acquire players and increase downloads of our games and increase sales of virtual currency, including:
    
· | using social networking websites, such as Facebook and Twitter, to build a base of fans and followers to whom we can quickly and easily provide information about our games;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | paying third parties, including advertising networks, social media channels and social influencers, to advertise or incentivize consumers to download our games through offers or recommendations;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | using “push” notifications to alert users of sales on virtual currency or items in our games;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | cross-promoting our games through banner advertisements in our other games, as well as advertising our games in our competitors’ games;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | having our celebrity partners market their games to their fans through their social media channels; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | undertaking extensive outreach efforts with video game websites and related media outlets, such as providing reviewers with access to our games prior to launch.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

      In addition, certain of our games featuring celebrities or other licensed content like Kim Kardashian: Hollywood generate significant attention through word of mouth, particularly through social media channels.  We look to leverage existing social media presences in order to increase the virality and commercial success of our games.  In addition, in games like Racing Rivals, we are able to build and maintain a highly engaged community of players around the title.  Social-based methods for promoting our games include in-game events where players compete with and against each other, in-game social promotions and regular content updates, including in-game content that leverages real world events, such as holiday promotions or current events in the life of our celebrity partners.          We have also made significant investments in our proprietary analytics and in the development and implementation of various monetization techniques in our titles.  With our enhanced analytics capabilities, we intend to devote resources towards segmenting and learning more about the players of each of our franchises and further monetizing our highest spending and most engaged players.  We aim to connect the data, insights and knowledge gained from our analytics and monetization techniques to every element of our business – from marketing to merchandising – in order to improve player retention and monetization.
     Development Studios
 The internal studios that develop our games are located across the globe, including studio teams in San Francisco, Burlingame, San Mateo, and Long Beach, California; Portland, Oregon; Toronto, Canada; and Moscow,

Russia.  Our creative leaders have primary responsibility for overseeing game development for our platform and evergreen titles.  In addition, as part of our restructuring activities in 2016, as well as the acquisition of the QuizUp application from Plain Vanilla in December 2016, we moved certain of our catalog titles to our Hyderabad, India and Moscow, Russia locations to run live operations and produce content updates for such games. In addition, in 2017 we started to reduce the number of studios that operate outside of the San Francisco Bay Area.  As part of these efforts, in January 2017 we began to transition development and live operations of our Racing Rivals title to Carbonated while reducing headcount in our Long Beach, California studio. We believe that Carbonated has the skills and experience necessary to make Racing Rivals a platform and reverse revenue declines that were experienced by the title during 2016.  
 Our studios are generally supported by central services personnel in our San Francisco, California headquarters who provide expertise with respect to areas such as game design, monetization, production, user experience, data analytics and live operations, with each studio leveraging such central services to varying degrees.  
     Our game development process involves a significant amount of creativity, particularly with respect to developing original intellectual property franchises or games in which we license intellectual property from celebrities, Hollywood studios or other owners of brands, properties and other content.  Creative and technical studio expertise is necessary to design games that appeal to players who typically play in short bursts and to develop games that work well on mobile phones and tablets with their inherent limitations, such as small screen sizes and control buttons. During 2017, we plan to hire additional creative leaders and invest in technical studio expertise to drive content and features in our platform and evergreen titles and to prototype ideas that we believe can become hit platform titles. 
 Despite our actions in early 2017 to reduce our geographical footprint and consolidate studios, our development personnel are located in four different countries across three continents, which results in certain inherent complexities.  To address these issues, we instituted our Glu University training program.  Glu University is designed to increase interaction among our studio teams, including having international studio team members regularly spend time in our U.S. studios.  The goal of this program is to ensure that we increase the uniformity, quality and commercial success of our games.  In addition, we believe that our strategy of focusing our development efforts on building and maintaining platform and evergreen titles in the fashion and celebrity, food, sports and action, social networking and home genres will help ensure more efficient use of our talent and resources across our studios and further promote the sharing of expertise and best practices.    
     Product Development
     We have developed proprietary technologies and product development processes that are designed to enable us to rapidly and cost effectively develop and publish games that meet the expectations and preferences of consumers and the needs of our distributors. These technologies and processes include: 
· | core development platforms;
--+----------------------------


· | porting tools and processes;
--+-----------------------------


· | broad development capabilities;
--+--------------------------------


· | application hosting;
--+---------------------


· | provisioning and billing capabilities;
--+---------------------------------------


· | localization capabilities, including supporting multiple languages and customization for specific markets, such as China;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | capabilities for integrating and configuring third-party advertising plug-ins, including for maximization of advertising revenue through placements that complement game flow;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     
 
  12

 



· | networking technologies for supporting game saves, guilds, matchmaking, leaderboards, and in-game messaging; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | merchandising, monetization tools and marketing platforms.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------

      Since the markets for our products are characterized by rapid technological change, particularly in the technical capabilities of mobile phones and tablets, and changing end-user preferences, continuous investment is required to innovate and publish new games, regularly update our games, and modify existing games for distribution on new platforms.  Our Chief Technology Officer has primary responsibility for ensuring our development studios have the technology they need to build high-quality games in a timely and efficient manner.  
     We have continued to utilize measures designed to ensure that we publish and launch games that have a greater likelihood of being commercially successful, while identifying earlier in the development process game concepts and designs that are unlikely to produce hits.  Central technical and product oversight now comes via three mechanisms:
    
· | A rigorous greenlight process that includes a review of complex engineering modules, detailed plans for long-term retention features and a thorough understanding of the target demographic for each game.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | A rigorous six-gate milestone review system in which confidential feedback and voting from various executives is considered as part of the decision to allow a game to proceed in development.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | A Pixar-inspired “brain-trust” to provide critical and unbiased peer input.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------

      In addition, we plan to continue holding detailed post-mortems for all products to review and analyze the positive and negative results from each new game launch.  These are in addition to our regular Glu University training sessions where we formally share best practices and learnings amongst the leadership of all functions of our global studios.
     We use third-party development tools to create many of our games, including a game development engine licensed from Unity Technologies to create most of our newest games.  In addition, we rely on our own servers and third-party infrastructure to operate our games and to maintain and provide our analytics data.  In particular, a significant portion of game traffic is hosted by Amazon Web Services, which provides us server redundancy by using multiple locations on various distinct power grids, and we expect to continue utilizing Amazon for a significant portion of our hosting services for the foreseeable future.     
     Research and development expenses were $81.9 million, $72.9 million, and $64.3 million for 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.  
     Seasonality
     Many new smartphones and tablets are released in, or shortly before, the fourth calendar quarter to coincide with the holiday shopping season.  Because many players download our games soon after they purchase or receive their new devices, we generally experience seasonal sales increases based on the holiday selling period.  Although we believe that the majority of this holiday impact occurs during the fourth quarter, some of this seasonality also occurs for us in our first calendar quarter due to some lag between device purchases and game purchases.  However, the impact of this seasonality on our operating results is significantly affected by our title release schedule.  In addition, companies’ advertising budgets are generally highest during the fourth quarter and decline significantly in the first quarter of the following year, which affects the revenue we derive from advertisements and offers in our games.  Conversely, our marketing expenses also increase in the fourth quarter, since demand for marketing is higher during the holiday season and this increased demand drives up marketing costs.

 Competition
     Developing, distributing and selling mobile games is a highly competitive business, characterized by frequent product introductions and rapidly emerging new platforms, technologies and storefronts.  For players, we compete primarily on the basis of game quality, brand and customer reviews.  We also compete more generally for the time and attention of users of smartphones and tablet devices who are spending ever-increasing amounts of time on social media, messaging, and music, movie and television streaming applications.  We compete for promotional and digital storefront placement based on our relationship with the digital storefront owner, historical performance, game quality, perception of sales potential, customer reviews, and relationships with celebrities and other licensors of brands and other content.  For celebrities, brands and other content licensors, we compete based on royalty and other economic terms, historical financial performance of celebrity and other third-party licensed brand and property games, perceptions of development quality, porting abilities, speed of execution, distribution breadth and relationships with storefront owners.  We also compete for experienced and talented employees. 
 We compete with a continually increasing number of companies, including Activision (the parent company of King Digital Entertainment), DeNA, Disney, Electronic Arts (EA Mobile), Gameloft, Gamevil, GREE, GungHo Online Entertainment, Netmarble, Nexon, Warner Brothers, and Zynga and many well-funded private companies, including DoubleDown, Jam City, Machine Zone, Miniclip, Niantic, Pocket Gems, Rovio, Scopely, Storm 8/Team Lava, and Supercell.  In addition, we face competition from online game developers and distributors who are primarily focused on specific international markets.  We could also face increased competition if those companies choose to compete more directly in the United States or the other markets that are significant to us or if large companies with significant online presences such as Apple, Google, Amazon, Facebook, Microsoft or Yahoo, choose to enter or expand in the games space or develop competing games.  We also compete for downloads and time spent on mobile devices with companies that develop popular social media and messaging applications, such as Facebook (with its Facebook, Facebook Messenger, Instagram, WhatsApp and other applications), Pinterest, Reddit, Snapchat, Twitter, Vevo and YouTube, companies that develop streaming music, movie and television applications, such as Pandora, Spotify, Tidal, HBO Go, Netflix, Amazon Prime or Hulu, and with companies that create non-gaming related software applications for celebrities.  
 In addition, given the open nature of the development and distribution for smartphones and tablets and the relatively low barriers to entry, we also compete or will compete with a vast number of small companies and individuals who are able to create and launch games and other content for these devices using relatively limited resources and with relatively limited start-up time or expertise.  As an example of the competition that we face, it has been estimated that more than 3.0 million applications, including more than 750,000 active games, were available on Apple’s U.S. App Store as of February 28, 2017.  The proliferation of titles in these open developer channels makes it difficult for us to differentiate ourselves from other developers and to compete for players without substantially increasing our marketing expenses and development costs.
 Some of our competitors and our potential competitors have one or more advantages over us, either globally or in particular geographic markets, which include:
    
· | significantly greater financial resources;
--+-------------------------------------------


· | greater experience with free-to-play games, building and maintaining platform or evergreen titles, and building social and community features into mobile games, as well as more effective game monetization;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | stronger brand and consumer recognition regionally or worldwide;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------


· | the capacity to leverage their marketing expenditures across a broader portfolio of mobile and non-mobile products;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | larger installed user bases from their existing mobile games;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------

 
 
  14

 



· | larger installed user bases from related platforms, such as console gaming or social networking websites, to which they can market and sell mobile games;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | more substantial intellectual property of their own from which they can develop games without having to pay royalties;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | lower labor and development costs and better overall economies of scale;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | greater platform-specific focus, experience and expertise; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------


· | broader global distribution and presence.
--+------------------------------------------

      Intellectual Property
     Our intellectual property is an essential element of our business.  We use a combination of trademark, copyright, trade secret and other intellectual property laws, confidentiality agreements and license agreements to protect our intellectual property.  Our employees and independent contractors are required to sign agreements acknowledging that all inventions, trade secrets, works of authorship, developments and other processes generated by them on our behalf are our property, and assigning to us any ownership that they may claim in those works.  We also vigorously defend our intellectual property.  For example, in November 2014, we filed a complaint against Hothead Games, Inc., or Hothead, in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California alleging that Hothead had willfully infringed certain of our copyrights and trade dress contained in our Deer Hunter 2014 game through Hothead’s release of its game, Kill Shot. On August 3, 2015, we entered into a settlement agreement with Hothead in which Hothead agreed to make payments to us, including ongoing payments and we agreed to allow Hothead to continue to publish the Kill Shot game.  Despite our precautions, it may be possible for third parties to obtain and use without our consent intellectual property that we own or license.  Unauthorized use of our intellectual property by third parties, including piracy, and the expenses incurred in protecting our intellectual property rights, may adversely affect our business.  In addition, some of our competitors have in the past released games that are nearly identical to successful games released by their competitors in an effort to confuse the market and divert users from the competitor’s game to the copycat game.  To the extent that these tactics are employed with respect to any of our games, it could reduce our revenue.
     Our trademarks that have been registered with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office include Glu, Crowdstar, our 2-D ‘g’ character logo, our 3-D ‘g’ character logo and several of our game titles, including Blood & Glory, Contract Killer, Cooking Dash, Deer Hunter, Diner Dash, Eternity Warriors, Frontline Commando, Gun Bros, Heroes of Destiny, QuizUp, Racing Rivals and Tap Sports.  In addition, we have trademark applications pending with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office for other of our game titles.  For certain titles we do not yet have, and do not intend to seek, trademark registration.  We also own, or have applied to own, one or more registered trademarks in certain foreign countries, depending on the relevance of each brand to other markets. Registrations of both U.S. and foreign trademarks are renewable every ten years.
     We have five patents issued by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office and have seven patent applications pending.  In addition, we have two international patents issued through the Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT), which correspond to two of our five issued U.S. patents, and we have four international patent applications pending with the PCT, which correspond to four of our seven U.S. patent applications.
 We also use third-party development tools to create many of our games, including a game development engine licensed from Unity Technologies to create most of our newest games.  
 From time to time, we encounter disputes over rights and obligations concerning intellectual property.  If we do not prevail in these disputes, we may lose some or all of our intellectual property protection, be enjoined from further sales of our games or other applications determined to infringe the rights of others, and/or be forced to pay substantial royalties to a third party, any of which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

     Government Regulation    We are subject to various federal, state and international laws and regulations that affect our business, including those relating to the privacy and security of customer and employee personal information and those relating to the Internet, behavioral tracking, mobile applications, advertising and marketing activities, sweepstakes and contests, and gambling.  Additional laws in all of these areas are likely to be passed in the future, which could result in significant limitations on or changes to the ways in which we can collect, use, host, store or transmit the personal information and data of our customers or employees, communicate with our customers, and deliver products and services, or may significantly increase our compliance costs.  As our business expands to include new uses or collection of data that are subject to privacy or security regulations, our compliance requirements and costs will increase and we may be subject to increased regulatory scrutiny.
 Financial Information about Segments and Geographic Areas 
     We manage our operations and allocate resources as a single reportable segment.  Financial information about our segment and geographic areas is incorporated into this section by reference to Note 12 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this report.  In addition, financial information regarding our operations, assets and liabilities, including our total net revenue and net income / (loss) for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 and our total assets as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, is included in our Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this report.  Employees
     As of December 31, 2016, we had 754 employees, of which 507 were based in the United States and Canada, 129 were based in Europe and 118 were based in Asia.  Our employees in China are represented by a labor union.  We have not experienced any employment-related work stoppages and consider relations with our employees to be good.  We believe that our future success depends in part on our continued ability to hire, assimilate and retain qualified employees.  Executive Officers
