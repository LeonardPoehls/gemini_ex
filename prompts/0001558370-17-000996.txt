     AV Homes, Inc. is a homebuilder engaged in the business of homebuilding and community development in Florida, the Carolinas and Arizona. Our business focuses on the development and construction of (i) primary residential communities serving first-time and move-up buyers, including under our local Bonterra Builders and Royal Oak Homes brands, and (ii) active adult communities, which are age-restricted to the age 55 and over active adult demographic. As of December 31, 2016, we owned 4,675 developed residential lots, 2,531 partially developed residential lots, 7,914 undeveloped residential lots, and 6,979 acres of mixed-use, commercial, and industrial land. We utilize our deep experience, strong operating platform, and land inventory to capitalize on the strengthening housing environment and favorable demographic trends within our core markets. We are publicly held and our common stock is traded on the NASDAQ Stock Market under the symbol “AVHI.”
     Our performance in our core segments of Florida, the Carolinas and Arizona improved for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to prior years. We expanded our market presence and significantly increased the number of homes we have sold. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we closed on 2,465 homes at an average sales price of approximately $310,000 per closed home, generating approximately $764 million of homebuilding revenue, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015, in which we closed on 1,750 homes at an average sales price of approximately $285,000 per closed home, generating approximately $499 million of homebuilding revenue. The number of housing contracts (net of cancellations) signed in 2016 increased 16.4% to 2,369 as compared to 2015 and we had 703 homes in backlog with a sales value of approximately $236 million as of December 31, 2016 compared to 799 homes in backlog with a sales value of approximately $244 million as of December 31, 2015.

 Our Strengths
     We believe we are well-positioned to execute our core business strategies as a result of the following competitive strengths:
     Transformed from a land company to an efficient, process-driven homebuilder. Beginning in 2011, we implemented a strategic planning initiative to restructure our overhead costs and reposition the Company as a cost-efficient and process-driven homebuilder. Pursuant to this initiative, we re-aligned our business to capitalize on the demographic trends and homebuilding recovery in our core markets. Specifically, our management re-evaluated all of our land holdings to identify core assets for development and homebuilding activities, as well as non-core land positions to be sold in favorable market conditions. We also recruited a new team of senior and operating management with longstanding experience in the homebuilding industry, strengthening us to take advantage of the ongoing housing recovery. In addition, we repositioned and diversified our consumer market segmentation mix and broadened our geographical diversification to maximize our opportunity to drive profitable growth.
     Significant expertise in our core markets. We have significant geographic expertise in the Florida, the Carolinas and Arizona markets. In addition, as a result of our experience in developing communities for the active adult population for almost two decades, we have market expertise in serving the housing and lifestyle aspirations of the vast Baby Boomer population. Our management team has a deep understanding of the active adult and primary residential markets and the preferences of the buyers in these markets. We also supplement our expertise in our markets by utilizing a research-based approach to understanding the lifestyle preferences of these buyer markets.
     Favorable demographics and real estate market recovery. In the active adult market, we believe the demographic trends and lifestyle aspirations of aging Baby Boomers provide us with a favorable environment for future business.
     Reputation for unique high-quality homes in desirable locations. We believe that our reputation for delivering high-quality homes in desirable locations, coupled with our unique amenities and home designs emphasizing lifestyle and value, drive customers to our developments. We seek to provide the highest level of customer service to our homebuyers by involving them in multiple phases of the construction process. Homebuyer involvement allows our sales staff to enhance their knowledge and relationship with our buyers. Our selling process focuses on the homes’ features, benefits, quality, and design, as opposed to merely price and square footage. In order to ensure that our buyers are able to make informed decisions, we generally utilize customer-friendly design centers focused on meeting our customers’ range of needs as they move through the process of purchasing a home.
     Business Strategy
     Our primary business is homebuilding and community development, which includes the acquisition, development and building of active adult and primary residential home communities, in Florida, the Carolinas and Arizona. Our core business strategies, which we believe give us long-term competitive advantages relative to other builders, are intended to promote our growth, drive profitability and generate cash liquidity. Those strategies are summarized below.
     Strategically expand our primary segments to capitalize on market recoveries. We focus on strategic development of land and communities to ensure sales of homes in high buyer-demand environments, which will allow us to obtain higher home prices and gross margins, as well as yielding a strong pace of sales and higher returns. We employ a deliberate land acquisition strategy focused on making prudent investments in high-demand markets in addition to exploring opportunities to broaden our geographic footprint. We also intend to maximize near-term value through developing communities where appropriate on our existing buildable land positions.
     Serve the lifestyle and housing needs of the 55+ active adults. Millions of Baby Boomers will continue to age toward and reach retirement. This demographic supports a growing interest in lifestyle-oriented, age-qualified communities, especially throughout the Sun Belt. We serve the lifestyle and housing needs of these active adults with innovative communities uniquely tailored to their lifestyle ambitions through our Solivita and Vitalia at Tradition

communities in Florida, our CantaMia and Encore at Eastmark communities in Arizona, and our Creekside at Bethpage community in Raleigh, North Carolina.
     Maintain core focus on operational improvements to drive profitability while managing construction and labor costs. We utilize proven technologies and processes to drive profitability as well as strategies and procedures designed to streamline our homebuilding operations. With keen insight into our customers’ buying habits, we are simplifying processes and employing value-engineering practices to help us deliver high-quality, well-built homes with the value our customers expect and the margins that enhance our profitability. Additionally, as we gain scale in our markets, we work to unbundle the building materials to achieve further cost savings by bidding out individual cost components, with the goal of improving our profitability over time.
     Exercise prudent balance sheet management to maintain ample liquidity for growth. We believe that it is critical for us to maintain a strong balance sheet with ample liquidity so that we can service our debt obligations, support on-going homebuilding operations, and take advantage of growth opportunities in our core markets. As of December 31, 2016, we had $67.8 million of cash and cash equivalents, $1.2 million of restricted cash, an undrawn $190 million senior secured credit facility, and $280.0 million of outstanding debt.
     Profitably monetize non-core commercial and industrial land positions and scattered lots. We continue to opportunistically sell non-core commercial and industrial land positions, as well as scattered lot positions and land assets that are in excess of our needed supply in a given market. We sold $3.6 million under this plan in 2016 for a profit of $2.3 million, $6.5 million in 2015 for a profit of $5.6 million, and $32.6 million in 2014 for a profit of $10.6 million.
     Our Operations
     Our primary business is homebuilding, which includes the acquisition, development and building of active adult and primary residential home communities in Florida, the Carolinas and Arizona. For further information regarding our financial condition and results of operations, please see Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.     Key Operating Metrics
     We track the following key operating metrics in connection with our homebuilding operations:
     Contracts signed. Net contracts signed for a given period represents the number of contracts we have entered into with homebuyers for the purchase and sale of homes, less the number of contracts that were cancelled in the same period. We consider a home sales contract cancelled when the customer terminates the contract or when we provide notice of termination due to a failure on the part of the customer to close on the home or meet a contingency under the contract.
     Home starts. Home starts is the number of new homes on which we have started construction in a given period. Home starts are monitored by management in order to minimize the time between contract signing and closing.
     Closings. Closings represents the number of home sales closed in the period. We recognize revenue equal to the sales price of a home when the sales are closed and title passes to the purchasers.
     Backlog. Backlog is the number of homes we are building that are under contract for sale that have not closed as of the end of the period being presented. The dollar value of backlog is the revenue anticipated to be realized at closing equal to the purchase price provided in the applicable contract. Backlog is an important indicator of home closings and homebuilding revenues in future periods.
     Average sales price. Average sales price represents total homebuilding revenue for a given period divided by the number of closings for such period.

 Construction
     Construction time for our homes depends on the availability of labor and materials, the type and size of the home, location and weather conditions. Construction of a home in our active adult communities or primary residential communities is typically completed within five months following commencement of construction.
     We act as the general contractor for the construction of our homes and communities. We typically engage subcontractors on a project-by-project basis to complete construction at a negotiated fixed price. Agreements with our subcontractors and material suppliers are generally entered into after competitive bidding. Our subcontract agreements typically require the subcontractor to meet certain insurance requirements and to indemnify us against claims related to their work. Our project managers and superintendents supervise the construction of each home, schedule and manage the activities of subcontractors and suppliers, subject their materials and work to quality control standards and assure compliance with zoning and building codes.
     Purchase of Raw Materials
     We engage several suppliers in each region in order to eliminate or minimize any shortages in materials or labor. We also have national supplier contracts for certain items such as appliances where economies of scale can be leveraged. We choose each of our suppliers based on price, quality, reputation, scalability and ability to meet our construction timelines. We do not maintain inventories of construction materials except for materials being utilized just-in-time for homes under construction.
     Prices of materials may fluctuate due to various factors, including demand or supply shortages, which may be beyond the control of our suppliers. Although we have historically been able to offset increases in the costs of materials and labor with increases in the prices of our homes, we may not be able to do so in the future because sales of homes are frequently made in advance of construction. In the ordinary course of business, our construction budgets contain a contingency amount for price increases.
     Purchase of Land
     We buy improved lots and tracts of raw land or unimproved lots that require development. Generally, earnest money deposits on new land purchases have historically ranged from 5% to 20% of the final purchase price. Additionally, we will use option contracts to acquire lots on a metered basis. Our liability, in the event we do not perform as agreed in the terms of the option contract, is generally forfeiture of our earnest money deposit to the land seller. As of December 31, 2016, we had $4.2 million of earnest money deposits outstanding on new land purchases and land option contracts.     Marketing and Sales
     We market our homes through a variety of means, including our website, social media and other Internet channels, as well as the use of model homes, newspaper, magazine and billboard advertising. We also seek to customize our marketing efforts based on location to address the needs and preferences of local homebuyers. We employ sales professionals who are compensated through a combination of salaries and sales commissions to encourage and reward increased sales performance. We use a customer relationship management system to track our traffic and automate follow-up with our contact lists. We also use outside sales brokers in certain markets.
     We use model homes in our communities to provide homebuyers the opportunity to view fully furnished and landscaped homes. We typically use one or more model homes in each community. Additionally, in our active adult communities, we have homes that we use as Discovery Day units. These homes are used for prospective buyers to stay for short periods of time for exposure to the overall experience of the community.
     In order to provide a more tailored product, our homebuyers have the option of customizing their homes through our design center services. Each floor plan has available options that may be added or modified in order to suit the requirements of individual homebuyers.

     We report a home as sold pursuant to a written sales contract that usually requires the homebuyer to make a cash deposit. Such sales contracts often contain contingencies such as the ability to receive mortgage financing. We have preferred relationships with select vendors to provide customer financing and title services. In connection with our sales process, we generally require all of our buyers to pre-qualify with a preferred mortgage financing provider.
     We conduct pre-closing home orientation and post-closing surveys for the homebuyer, which we believe is an integral part of our customer service program. We conduct home orientations with homebuyers immediately before closing. Prior to these orientations, we inspect the home and create a list of unfinished construction items and address outstanding issues promptly. We believe that delivering a high-quality finished home to our homeowners enhances our reputation for quality and service. Typically, we engage an outside firm to conduct comprehensive follow-up surveys with our homeowners to determine their level of satisfaction several months after closing. These surveys provide us with valuable feedback on the quality of the homes we deliver and the services we provide.
     Primary Residential Community Development
     With our acquisition of the Royal Oak Homes business in 2014 and the Bonterra Builders business in 2015, we have significantly expanded our focus on the primary residential market, which continues to improve since the most recent housing downturn. We believe that continued investment in this segment will provide us with a balanced portfolio. In addition to our recent acquisitions, we have continued to expand organically in our existing Central Florida, Charlotte and greater Phoenix markets, while also expanding into the Jacksonville, Florida and Raleigh, North Carolina markets. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we had 1,770 home closings in the primary residential market compared to 1,236 home closings for the same period in 2015.      Active Adult Community Development
     A primary component of our business is the development of active adult communities and the construction and sales of residences within those communities. We intend to grow this component of our business and continue to seek and evaluate opportunities to expand our active adult operations both in terms of assets and geography. Our current major active adult communities include:     Solivita
     Solivita commenced active sales in 2000 and is comprised of 10,089 lots on 7,193 acres in Central Florida, south of the Orlando metropolitan area.

Solivita offers its residents numerous activities year-round through the community’s Lifestyles program, which includes approximately 148,000 square feet of recreation facilities. These facilities include two fitness centers, 14 heated swimming pools, restaurants, arts and crafts rooms, a billiard room, a café, and other meeting and ballroom facilities. We also developed and own two 18-hole championship golf courses. The community’s activity park houses a variety of sports and games facilities, including an official softball field, bocce ball courts, shuffleboard courts, pickleball courts, tennis courts, horseshoe pits, dog parks and an outdoor pavilion. Social activities at Solivita include over 300 clubs, including such diverse interests as dragon boats, photography, travel, pickleball, softball, theatre and motorcycle riding and Veterans affairs.
     CantaMia
     CantaMia is a 1,695 lot active adult community located on 541 acres in the Estrella Mountain Ranch master-planned community in Goodyear, Arizona, west of Phoenix. Residents have exclusive use of the 30,000 square foot recreation and lifestyle facility that has, as its focal point, an eighteen acre man-made lake system. Amenities include an exercise facility, indoor/outdoor swimming pools, a demonstration kitchen, a library, a technology center, an arts/crafts studio, rooms for games and club activities, a movement studio for yoga and aerobics, and a café. CantaMia also has outdoor sporting venues, including swimming, pickleball, bocce ball, tennis and horseshoes. As of December 31, 2016, a total of 546 homes have closed since we started selling in 2010.

     Segment Information
     Our reportable segment information regarding revenues, results of operations and assets is incorporated herein by reference to Note 13, Segment Information, to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II of this report.     Trademarks
     We have federally registered trademarks and service marks or pending applications for federal registration for several of our entities, operations and communities, including AV Homes®, Stonegate®, Solivita®, Royal Oak Homes®, CantaMia® and Vitalia®.     Employees

     Regulation

 Homes and residential communities that we build must comply with federal, state and local laws, regulations, and ordinances relating to, among other things, zoning, construction permits or entitlements, construction material requirements, density requirements, and requirements relating to building design and property elevation, building codes and the handling of waste. These laws and regulations are subject to frequent change and often result in increased construction or other costs related to our business. In some instances, we must comply with laws that require commitments from us to provide roads and other offsite infrastructure to be in place prior to the commencement of new construction. These laws and regulations may result in fees and assessments, including, without limitation, fees and assessments for schools, parks, streets and highways and other public improvements, the costs of which can be substantial.
     The residential homebuilding industry is also subject to a variety of federal, state and local statutes, ordinances, rules and regulations concerning the protection of human health and the environment. These environmental laws include such areas as storm water and surface water management, soil, groundwater, endangered or imperiled species, natural resources and wetlands protection, and air quality protection and enhancement. Complying with environmental laws for existing conditions may result in delays, may cause us to incur substantial compliance and other costs, and may prohibit or severely restrict homebuilding activity in environmentally sensitive regions or areas.
     Competition
     The homebuilding industry is highly competitive. Homebuilders compete not only for homebuyers, but also for desirable properties, financing, raw materials and skilled labor. We compete with other local, regional and national homebuilders, often within larger subdivisions, that are designed, planned and developed by such homebuilders. We also compete with the resale market, including within our own communities, as well as foreclosure sales and the rental market. In addition, the consolidation of some homebuilding companies may create additional competitors that have greater financial, marketing and sales resources than we do and thus are able to compete more effectively against us, and there may be new entrants in the markets in which we currently conduct business. These competitive conditions in the homebuilding industry can affect our business and financial results through lower sales, lower selling prices, increased selling incentives, lower profit margins, impairments in the value of inventory and other assets, difficulty in acquiring suitable land, raw materials, and skilled labor at acceptable prices or terms, and delays in construction of our homes.     Seasonality
     Our business is affected to some extent by the seasonality of home sales, which generally produce increased closings in the latter half of the year. However, periods of economic downturn in the industry can alter seasonal patterns.
