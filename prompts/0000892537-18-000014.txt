Our Employees
Our customer's success is the end result of the hard work of our talented and dedicated employees.  At year end, our workforce consisted of approximately 7,600 employees, 67% of whom hold security clearances and over 47% of whom are veterans.  In 2017, we continued to successfully attract, train, develop and retain highly skilled people across our organization by providing our employees with rewarding and challenging opportunities that meaningfully impact our customers’ missions.  
Our Customers
We derive the vast majority of our revenues from U.S. government customers. We have successful, long-standing relationships with these customers, having supported many of them for almost half a century. For each of the last three years we have derived approximately 98% of our annual revenues from our U.S. government customers, with at least 79% of our revenues each such year from intelligence and defense customers. 
Foreign Operations
We treat sales to U.S. government customers as sales within the U.S., regardless of where the services are performed. U.S. revenues were approximately 98%, 98% and 100% of our total revenues for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. International revenues were approximately 2%, 2% and 0% of our total revenues for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

Backlog
At December 31, 2017, our backlog was $7.1 billion, of which $1.4 billion was funded backlog. At December 31, 2016, our backlog was $4.9 billion, of which $1.0 billion was funded backlog. We expect that approximately 23% of our total backlog will be recognized as revenue prior to December 31, 2018.
We define backlog as our estimate of the remaining future revenue from existing signed contracts, assuming the exercise of all options relating to such contracts and including executed task orders issued under Indefinite Quantity/Indefinite Delivery (ID/IQ) contracts. We also include an estimate of revenue for solutions that we believe we will be asked to provide in the future under the terms of ID/IQ contracts for which there are established patterns of revenues.
We define funded backlog to be the portion of backlog for which funding currently is appropriated and allocated to the contract by the purchasing agency or otherwise authorized for payment by the customer upon completion of a specified portion of work. Our funded backlog does not include the full value of our contracts because Congress often appropriates funds for a particular program or contract on a yearly or quarterly basis, even though the contract may call for performance over a much longer period of time.
A variety of circumstances or events may cause changes in the amount of our backlog and funded backlog, including the execution of new contracts, the extension of existing contracts, the non-renewal or completion of current contracts, the early termination of contracts, and adjustments to estimates for previously included contracts. Changes in the amount of our funded backlog also are affected by the funding cycles of the government.
Patents, Trademarks, Trade Secrets and Licenses
We own a limited number of patents. We also maintain a number of trademarks and service marks to identify and distinguish the goods and services we offer. While we protect our patents, marks, trade secrets and vital confidential information, our business does not depend on the existence or protection of such intellectual property.
Seasonality
Our business is not seasonal. However, in order to avoid the loss of unexpended fiscal year funds it is not uncommon for U.S. government agencies to award extra tasks or complete other contract actions in the weeks before the end of the U.S. government's fiscal year (GFY), which begins on October 1 and ends on September 30. Additionally, our quarterly results are impacted by the number of working days in a given quarter. There are generally fewer working days for our employees to generate revenues in the first and fourth quarters of our fiscal year. 
Business Environment and Competitive Landscape
Our primary customer is the U.S. government, the largest consumer of services and solutions in the U.S. In U.S. GFY 2017, the U.S. government obligated approximately $306 billion on contracted services. Our principal focus is on the national security and defense of the U.S. homeland. The DoD is the largest purchaser of services and solutions in the U.S. government. With the U.S. GFY 2019 budget request of $686 billion, the DoD accounts for approximately 57% of the total discretionary budget. 
We compete in a market that is shaped by customer requirements and federal budget priorities and constraints. Our key competitors currently include divisions of large defense contractors, as well as a number of mid-size U.S. government contractors with specialized capabilities. Because of the diverse requirements of U.S. government customers and the highly competitive nature of large procurements, we frequently collaborate with these and other companies to compete for large contracts and we bid against these companies in other situations. 
The budget environment continued to improve in 2017. Federal spending grew in U.S. GFY 2017 for a second consecutive year following several years of budget constraints and uncertain funding levels. Congressional actions have alleviated much of the potential impact of sequestration historically but Budget Control Act (BCA) caps remain longer term. We are currently operating under a Continuing Resolution as Congress works to finalize the details of a bipartisan budget comprise, which would provide visibility into funding and spending levels for the GFY 2018 and GFY 2019 substantially above the BCA caps. The improved budget clarity resulted in our customers making more award decisions and procuring services to meet mission needs on a more regular and predictable basis. We also believe that our customers' use of lowest price/technically acceptable (LPTA) procurements, which contributed to pricing pressures and lower margins in prior years, has leveled off. Under the current Administration, we believe the defense budget outlook has improved meaningfully and we expect defense spending increases relative to prior years.

The Administration has cited significant global threats, readiness and force structure needs within the military, diplomatic, homeland and border security, and cyber aggressions by both state and non-state actors, as priorities in establishing federal policy and budgets. Although the Administration's priorities will be subject to Congressional debate, we believe that the U.S. government's spending will remain robust in key areas that we are well positioned to serve, including national and homeland security programs, cyber security, sophisticated intelligence gathering and information sharing activities.
