Item 1.                    Business.
General 

TIER REIT, Inc. is a self-managed, Dallas-based real estate investment trust focused on delivering outsized stockholder return through stock price appreciation and dividend growth while offering unparalleled tenant service. As used herein, “TIER REIT,” the “Company,” “we,” “us,” or “our” refers to TIER REIT, Inc. and its subsidiaries unless the context otherwise requires. TIER REIT’s investment strategy is to acquire, develop, and operate a portfolio of best-in-class office properties in select U.S. markets that consistently lead the nation in both population and office-using employment growth. Within these markets, we target TIER1 submarkets, which are primarily urban and amenity-rich locations. TIER REIT was incorporated in June 2002 as a Maryland corporation and has elected to be treated, and currently qualifies, as a real estate investment trust, or REIT, for federal income tax purposes.
Substantially all of our business is conducted through Tier Operating Partnership LP (“Tier OP”), a Texas limited partnership. Our wholly-owned subsidiary, Tier GP, Inc., a Delaware corporation, is the sole general partner of Tier OP. Our direct and indirect wholly-owned subsidiaries, Tier Business Trust, a Maryland business trust, and Tier Partners, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, are limited partners that together with Tier GP, Inc. own all of Tier OP. 
As of December 31, 2016, we owned interests in 29 operating office properties, one non-operating property, and one development property located in 13 markets throughout the United States. Our corporate offices are located at 5950 Sherry Lane, Suite 700, Dallas, Texas 75225, and our telephone number is (972) 483-2400.    
On June 2, 2015, we filed articles of amendment to our charter to effect a one-for-six reverse stock split of our existing common stock. The par value of our common stock remained at $0.0001 per share, and we recorded an adjustment to the common stock value with an offset to additional paid-in-capital to reflect the change for all periods presented. In accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”), all share information presented has been retroactively adjusted to reflect the reverse stock split. 
On July 23, 2015, we listed our shares of common stock on the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) under the ticker symbol “TIER.” 
Business Strategy
Our strategy is straightforward. Our vision is to be the premier owner and operator of best-in-class office properties in select submarkets within high-growth metropolitan areas. We focus on vibrant cities with local GDP and population growth above the national average and amenity-rich submarkets (“TIER1 submarkets”) that appeal to dynamic corporate users and highly educated, in-demand employees. Our mission is to provide unparalleled, TIER ONE Property Services to our tenants and outsized total return through stock price appreciation and dividend growth to our stockholders, although there can be no assurance of any such appreciation or growth.
Six years ago, our story was told in 36 markets across the United States. As of December 31, 2016, we owned properties in 13 markets, with the primary focus on our seven target growth markets of Austin, Dallas, Houston, Atlanta, Charlotte, Nashville, and Denver.
2017 Key Objectives
As we enter 2017, we have substantially completed the strengthening phase of our strategic plan, which has been our focus for the past two years, and have begun the recycling phase, which will reallocate our capital and efforts from properties outside our target growth markets to new opportunities inside them. Through prudent development and strategic acquisitions, we will seek to increase our influence and concentration within TIER1 submarkets, enhance the overall quality and reduce the average age of our portfolio, and position the Company for growth.
Our business strategy for 2017 is comprised of the following four objectives: (1) substantially complete portfolio repositioning while balancing relative market concentration; (2) manage capital expenditures to sustain dividend coverage; (3) maintain portfolio occupancy despite known challenges in the Houston market; and (4) continue our robust investor relations program.

Substantially Complete Portfolio Repositioning While Balancing Market Concentration
Provided capital market conditions remain advantageous, during 2017, we will work to exit four or more non-target markets yielding between $300 million and $400 million of proceeds that will be allocated to highly-selective strategic investment opportunities. Exiting these properties will allow us to substantially complete our portfolio repositioning and provide capital to reinvest into our target markets.
We will seek to invest between $100 million and $225 million in target growth markets through a combination of prudent development and our strategic acquisition efforts. We will continue the execution of our build-to-core development program, with the intent of placing into production one or more select parcels of land strategically located within our TIER1 submarkets. Additionally, we will remain disciplined as we seek to acquire additional properties that specifically align with our strategy, provide a competitive edge within TIER1 submarkets, and demonstrate a clear path to long-term value creation for our stockholders. 
Manage Capital Expenditures to Sustain Dividend Coverage
We intend to actively manage our capital expenditures with the objective of balancing leasing capital and competitive building improvements that we believe are important to maintain and/or create value with the goal of full and sustainable dividend coverage. We expect our recycling efforts will allow us to manage our capital expenditures by: (1) enhancing the overall quality of the portfolio; (2) reducing the average age of our real estate assets; and (3) leveraging the existing property management team, thereby resulting in operating efficiencies within each market.
Maintain Portfolio Occupancy Despite Known Challenges in the Houston Market
We are focused on maintaining occupancy across our portfolio despite upcoming known tenant vacancies in our Houston portfolio. The leasing environment remains strong in the majority of our markets, though risks exist in the following areas: (1) the pending known tenant move-out of approximately 111,000 square feet in our properties located in the energy corridor of Houston, Texas; and (2) general exposure to the Houston market that continues to be hampered by low oil prices, recent office deliveries, and sublease space. Despite the downside exposure from the known upcoming tenant vacancies in Houston, and the Houston market generally, we estimate the total portfolio should be between 88% and 90% occupied as of December 31, 2017. 
Continue Our Robust Investor Relations Progran
We believe our best-in-class, Class A office portfolio, focused investment strategy, in-house expertise, and our belief that we will be able to generate significant value through our reinvestment efforts in build-to-core developments and strategic acquisitions are attractive to institutional investors and differentiate us from other office REITs. To this end, we will continue a robust investor relations program that will communicate our strategy to a broad audience of institutional investors.
Competition
We are subject to significant competition in seeking tenants for our properties.  The competition for creditworthy tenants is intense, and we have been required to provide rent concessions, incur charges for tenant improvements, and provide other inducements at a high level.  Without these inducements, we may not be able to continue to lease vacant space timely, or at all, which would adversely impact our results of operations.  We also compete with sellers of similar properties when we sell properties, which may result in our receiving lower proceeds from the sale, or which may result in our not being able to sell such properties due to the lack of an acceptable investment return.  Further, we may compete with other developers and buyers who are interested in properties we may acquire or develop, which may result in an increase in the amount that we would pay for such properties or may result in us ultimately not being able to acquire or develop such properties.  Some of our competitors, including larger REITs, have greater financial resources than we do and generally may be able to accept more risk. They also may enjoy competitive advantages that result from, among other things, a lower cost of capital and enhanced operating efficiencies.
Regulations and Environmental Matters
Our properties and operations are subject to various federal, state, and local laws, ordinances and regulations, including, among other things, zoning regulations, land use controls, requirements related to access and use by disabled persons, environmental controls relating to air and water quality, noise pollution, and indirect environmental impacts such as increased motor vehicle activity.  We believe that we have all permits and approvals necessary under current law to operate our properties.
As an owner of real estate, we are subject to various environmental laws of federal, state, and local governments. Compliance with existing laws has not had a material adverse effect on our capital expenditures, earnings, or competitive position, and management does not believe it will have such an impact in the future.  However, we cannot predict the impact of unforeseen environmental contingencies or new or changed laws or regulations on our properties.

Financial Information About Industry Segments
Our current business consists of owning, acquiring, developing, operating, investing in, and disposing of real estate assets.  We internally evaluate operating performance on an individual property level and view each of our real estate assets as one individual operating segment. However, all of our properties are aggregated into one reportable segment as they have similar economic characteristics.
