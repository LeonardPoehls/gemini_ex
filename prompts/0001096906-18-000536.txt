Item 1.  Business
 
Las Vegas Railway Express, Inc. (the "Company", "we", "us", or "our"), formerly known as Liberty Capital Asset Management, Inc., acquired 100% of the issued and outstanding stock of Las Vegas Railway Express, a Nevada corporation on January 21, 2010.  In connection with the acquisition, the Company changed its name to Las Vegas Railway Express, Inc. and changed its business plan to one of developing passenger rail transportation and ancillary ticketing and reservation services between the Los Angeles area and Las Vegas, Nevada. In November 2012, the Company executed an agreement with Union Pacific Railroad which allowed the Company to operate its passenger service on their property from Daggett, California to Las Vegas, a distance of 175.8 miles.  In May 2013, the Company and Amtrak, which was planning to haul the Company's rail cars from Los Angeles to Las Vegas in regular service, was informed by BNSF Railway ("BNSF") that it would not approve Amtrak's request to operate on the BNSF system. Although the Company tried several alternative approaches to satisfy BNSF's denial, none were accepted and both Amtrak and the Company were forced to suspend their efforts to establish the planned service over the Cajon Pass route.
 
During the development period for the Los Angeles to Las Vegas route, the Company became visible in the press and several independently owned passenger rail companies discussed how the Company's Club X style railcars could be deployed on existing excursion lines. The Company began to focus its infrastructure towards acquiring independently owned passenger rail operations throughout the United States and providing upscale commuter Club X railcars for various state Department of Transportation municipal transportation agencies.
 
Company Overview
 
Our company, Las Vegas Railway Express, Inc., is establishing a new and innovative passenger train service between Las Vegas and the Los Angeles metropolitan area by hiring Amtrak to haul our passenger cars for a fee, between Los Angeles and Las Vegas. The proposed service, called the "X-Train," will introduce a "Las Vegas" style experience on the train, while traversing the route in approximately 5 ½ hours. We will be profitable on the very first run based on our pricing model.
 
We plan to offer our train service as a tour package in much the same way as cruise lines work with a package of train ticket, hotel, transfers and complimentary first cocktail on board. F&B offerings are not included. Customers can book their tour package with any one of several major hotels in Las Vegas via the X Train website www.vegasxtrain.com or via www.xtrainvacations.com.  X Train handles all the bookings and our choice hotels are MGM Resorts, The Wynn Resort, Caesars Resort, The Plaza Hotel and Mandalay Resorts. X Train captures 100% of the hotel bookings for which it receives a commission.
 
Our business plan emanates from a regional transportation feasibility study published in 2007, which suggested that a well-run rail service between Los Angeles and Las Vegas could garner up to 30% of the approximately 12 million passengers who regularly drive between these two metropolitan areas. See: www.rtcsouthernnevada.com.
 
Over the last 18 months, we have been engaged in activities designed to secure the necessary rights, equipment and facilities required to commence commercial service in the fall of 2015. These include: hiring Amtrak to provide regularly scheduled excursion charter services on the LA to Las Vegas route, purchasing or leasing appropriate locomotive and passenger cars designed to move passengers over the route in comfort; and securing leases on terminal facilities and passenger depots in Los Angeles and in Las Vegas.
 
We are assisted in this project by North Star Rail, LLC, which owns the rail set of passenger cars we plan to lease. We have an agreement with them to manage for us the charter process with Amtrak as well as leasing their rail car consist to run on our planned route.

 Our Competitive Strengths
 
We have developed a business model that focuses on leisure travelers between Los Angeles and Las Vegas.  We believe the following strengths will allow us to maintain a competitive advantage in the market we serve:
Large Untapped Market of 12 Million Drivers.  There has been no regular passenger rail service between the Los Angeles and Las Vegas areas for over 18 years. The only major highway between Los Angeles and Las Vegas is Interstate 15 ("I-15"). Of the more than 12,000,000 annual visitors from the Southern California/Los Angeles market, 94% use automobile transportation to Las Vegas via this corridor every year. We only need to capture 28,000 of these drivers (approximately 0.025 % of the total marketplace) to meet our plan on an operating basis.  As the LA population grows, so will the traffic on this highway; the forecast for traffic on I-15 is expected to be 17 million passengers by 2030. Congestion on I-15 is increasing, with motor vehicle travelers experiencing substantial delays during peak travel times (e.g., generally over 6 hours of drive time on Friday and Sunday afternoons). With increasing gasoline costs, increasingly restrictive highway capacity, and reduced air travel from LA to Las Vegas, a rail transportation product - with both First Class and Coach – should be an attractive and viable alternative. Our trains will offer a service that will set us apart from other travel options by extending our customers' "Las Vegas" experience while en route.
 Amtrak Charter Services. Amtrak recently began encouraging the use of its passenger rail services to private companies under an expanded charter services group. Private companies can hire Amtrak to charter a train for them, which will include locomotives, crew, on board services, logistics and scheduling and conductors for a market-based fee. There is no restriction to the routes where Amtrak will charter a train for a private event or service. Amtrak works with the railroads to co-ordinate logistics with the existing freight rail traffic to select available slots for the requested charter to run. Pricing for the X Train route will vary depending on departure location, car consist and on board services. Amtrak will provide us with locomotive engineers, conductors, train servicing, maintenance, and other services associated with the operations of the X-Train. Amtrak offers many charter type services to numerous rail charter companies in the US.
  "Las Vegas Style" Service. The focus of our approach is to create a unique, Vegas class, "must see" mode of travel that not only serves the functional purpose of transporting passengers to Las Vegas, but also integrates seamlessly into the traditional and iconic Las Vegas experience. To accomplish this goal, our award winning team of design professionals and staff has assembled an on-board product reflective of the "Las Vegas" theme, which is comprised of a comfortable, fun, upscale and provocative atmosphere with multiple on-board amenities. Each car will have two "Conductress', who will provide regular table services throughout the duration of each trip. In addition, each train ticket entitles a passenger to an assigned seat with a high-quality meal and an alcoholic beverage.
 Our "X-Train" model also includes many premium options to tailor our customers' experiences to their individual preferences. Each passenger car will be served by a bartender who will prepare premium alcoholic beverages not included in the base ticket fare. Snacks and various X-Train merchandising will also be offered for purchase through our free mobile application. Our "Ultra Lounge" cars will have tables that passengers and their travel companions can reserve at an additional charge.
 Oversize baggage, access to the on-board Wi-Fi network, and other premium options will also be available for additional ancillary fees. Commissions will be derived through our call centers, our website, and our on-board mobile application, where customers will be presented with the option to book ahead for various Vegas attractions and necessities such as hotels, shows, tours, restaurant reservations, and rental cars.

Low Equipment and Facilities Cost.  All locomotive equipment and maintenance costs are borne by Amtrak under our charter agreement. In a similar fashion, all of the costs of maintenance for the rail car consist of the "261" consist we are leasing, are borne by the owners of that consist, "The Friends of the 261". We are renovating the Amtrak station at the Plaza Hotel to accept train service for 2015.
 Experienced Management and Board of Directors.  We have a strong management team and board of directors comprised of both experienced industry professionals and successful entrepreneurs. Our CEO, Michael Barron has been a successful entrepreneur establishing and growing several companies over the past 30 years. Our board of directors is led by Dr. Harry Teng, Head of the School of Rail Engineering at UNLV in Las Vegas and Lou Schillinger, CEO of Short Line Insurance Company, with over 300 industry rail clients insured. Company management has operated passenger service on a railroad with our own Club X cars and staff.
Our Business Strategy
 To grow our business and increase our profitability, our strategy will be to provide a first class "Las Vegas" style travel experience at attractive fares together with a more moderate Coach Class for the economical visitor, while keeping our operating costs low and pursuing ways to make our operations more efficient.  We intend to grow by adding additional trains and increasing the number of trips from Los Angeles to Las Vegas, raising our average fare over time, expanding our relationships with premier leisure companies and growing the level of ancillary services provided to our customers.
 The following are the key elements of our strategy:
 Finalize Resources for Commencement of Service in Late 2015.  We have made a significant capital investment in this business opportunity and are now in the development stage of execution. Our capital investment in Las Vegas Railway Express, Inc. stands now at approximately $12 million and, subject to obtaining needed funding, we plan to invest an additional $2.5 million in 2015 to begin operations of our X-Train service beginning late 2015. The first train set of 10 passenger railcars has been arranged via a third party owner and will be available to run following this offering. We expect to complete station construction and the remaining components of our business plan upon funding.
Stimulate Demand Among Higher Budget Customers Who Drive.  We see the Southern California corporate environment as a lucrative one. There are over 50 Fortune 500 companies in California with most having significant employment populations within the two counties of the LA region. With the increasing Las Vegas convention penetration, the Southern California business community alone is diverse enough to provide a sufficient number of higher budget clientele to fill our travel offerings. We plan to undertake an aggressive marketing campaign targeted at the higher budget corporate clientele in the Los Angeles greater area. Additionally, we plan to have partnerships with several of the major Las Vegas casinos in order to jointly market our services. [Company to expand on casino partnerships/agreements]
Grow Non-Rail Revenues.  Traditional travel options have included many amenities built into their pricing models. With recent evolutions in the travel industry, the airline sector has begun to unbundle this pricing model to its benefit. In fact, several newer airline companies have eliminated this model in favor of a low priced "à la Carte" pricing model with little traveler resistance.  Traditional, higher fare legacy airlines have adopted parts of this strategy and are implementing them profitably.  Our business plan incorporates a premium all-inclusive pricing formula, yet plans to also benefit from a "à la Carte" pricing model by providing potential upgrades across several services, most noticeably with food and beverage. In addition, we expect to derive a meaningful portion of our revenue from the sale of ancillary items, such as hotel rooms, rental cars, show tickets, nightclub packages and other attractions. Importantly, most of our ancillary revenue will command high margins with low operating costs thus improving our profitability.
Build Partnerships with Key Institutions.  We have established relationships with several of the major Las Vegas casinos including the Plaza Hotel, Wynn Resort, Caesars Resorts and MGM Resorts and key institutions throughout Las Vegas.  Additionally, we have developed a co-operative plan with Metrolink. Metrolink operates commuter passenger rail service in the greater Los Angeles metro area and services over 12 million riders annually. Metrolink has 55 local train stations, which share the same right of way and/or connect to the X-Train. By joint venturing a marketing plan with Metrolink, X-Train gains access to its ridership for travel to Las Vegas.

Train Equipment and Service
 
Each of our trains will consist of two locomotives and one railcar set. Each railcar set will consist of ten cars. Trains can be expanded or contracted depending on the planned event/excursion and marketing & sales demand. X Train has contracted with The Friends of the 261, a private family business, which owns a finished rail set of cars suitable for the X Train, planned service. These cars are already certified to run on Amtrak trains and have been in charter service for over 100 charters all over the country. X train has contracted with the "261" team to manage the charter interface with Amtrak as they have greater experience with Amtrak. Their equipment is leased to X Train on a run by run basis and fees differ depending on the route mileage and services required.
Sales and Distribution
 We intend to distribute our product primarily through our website, X Train Vacations www.xtrainvacations.com and our call center/customer support group. We will additionally sell through third party distributors such as Expedia, Travelocity, Orbitz and other Internet travel agencies. We will also be able to use certain of the distribution links provided by the Amtrak network and website.
 We see the Southern California corporate environment as a lucrative one. There are over 50 Fortune 500 companies in California with most having significant employment populations within the two counties of the LA region. With the increasing Las Vegas convention penetration, the Southern California business community alone is diverse enough to provide a sufficient number of higher budget clientele to fill our travel offerings. We plan to market our services through advertising and promotions in billboards, newspapers, magazines, television and radio, Fun City rack cards, and through targeted public relations and promotional efforts in our target market. We also rely on public relations and word-of-mouth to promote our brand. We intend to run special promotions in coordination with peak periods and events, such as New Year's Eve, Super Bowl Weekend, Final Four Weekend, and Chinese New Year's and when boxing matches or tradeshows are held in Las Vegas.
 Our trains are also available to be connected via Metrolink, the commuter passenger rail service in the greater Los Angeles metro area that services over 12 million riders annually. Metrolink has 55 local train stations, which share the same right of way and/or connect to our planned station at Fullerton, California.

The Excursion Tour Product to Las Vegas from Los Angeles
 The company is preparing to operate a Los Angeles to Las Vegas "Party Train" concept it calls "Club X" which provides an entertaining and exciting trip by conventional passenger rail, from Los Angeles to Las Vegas. Las Vegas has many events which it hosts during the year and virtually every weekend is scheduled with some sort of convention, show, sports event or holiday party. Our trains are chartered by Las Vegas Railway Express, Inc. for customers who wish to come to these events via rail instead of driving or flying. Our market is the Los Angeles area resident that visits Las Vegas 1-3 times per year and usually drives the 300 miles on the I-15 highway.
 X Train packages will generally run for 3 days and 2 nights with amenities included at selected hotel and casino properties. The target customer for the service is in the $60,000 or more per year income bracket, likes gaming, and is between 35 – 60 years old.
 Amtrak Charter Services
 Upon request, Amtrak provides LVRE with trained engineering crews, to ensure safe and reliable passenger rail operations on our charter route. The Charter service offered by Amtrak is a form request for a private train car movement. Amtrak offers this service for a fee to anyone requesting such a service and where there are rails, regardless of whether or not Amtrak currently has passenger service in the route. Requests are processed and logistics are worked out with the impacted railroads and a schedule is formed to accommodate the requested train movement. Charters may not be rejected and are not regular train service. Each time our train will run, the route logistics must be applied for and the schedule for that run established. Once a schedule is established, LVRE will schedule its ticket sales.
 There are many companies in the U.S, which use charter services as a commercial enterprise for passenger rail. Companies such as the Rocky Mountaineer, Friends of the 261 (who manage our charter service interface with Amtrak) Key Holidays Reno Fun Train, Iowa Pacific's City of New Orleans operate under the Amtrak charter and run many trains on their routes each year. Each run requires the logistics to be worked out prior to operation. Charters are not regular commuter service and the LVRE schedules will vary depending on which events we plan to service via the X Train.

Pricing and Revenue Management
 Our fare structure is based on the Allegiant Air model which is a standard fare for tickets and all amenities are up sells. Ticket prices for coach are $199 per segment. All food and beverage and ancillary items are extra charges. Hotels and other events packages can be booked via X Train's call center. Margins on hotel rooms are up to 30%.
Ancillary Revenues
 In addition to the basic X-Train service offering, our business model also includes many premium options that will serve as sources of ancillary revenue. Each X-Train passenger car will have bartender who will prepare premium alcoholic beverages not included in the base ticket fare. Snacks and various X-Train merchandising will also be offered for purchase through our free mobile application. Our "Ultra Lounge" cars will offer tables that passengers and their travel companions can reserve at an additional charge. Oversize baggage, access to the on-board Wi-Fi network, movies, and other premium options will also be available for additional fees.
 We also aim to capture significant revenue as a "one stop" booking agent for our passengers' complete Las Vegas itinerary. In these activities, commissions will be derived through our call centers, our website, and our on-board mobile application, where customers will be allowed the option to book ahead for various Vegas attractions and necessities such as hotels, shows, tours, restaurant reservations, and rental cars.
 Depot Locations
 Our passenger rail terminals will provide features customarily found at a large airport today: a ticketing/customer service counter and electronic ticket machines; a station agent and employee area (including security); a baggage handling and storage area; a passenger waiting area; restrooms; a café and retail space to provide meals, snacks, and sundries; on-site parking (short- and long-term); a passenger pick-up and drop-off area; and a transit, taxi, resort shuttle pick-up and drop-off area.
 Los Angeles Union Station: As the Los Angeles departure and arrival points of our service, Union Station was chosen for a number of reasons, including its proximity to downtown for Las Vegas marketing efforts; its location in the second largest population county in the United States; its links to Los Angeles County via public roads, bus and rail routes; its very affluent and tourism-centric locale; and its connection to Metrolink services where there are over 15,000 daily boardings with easy connection to Union Station passengers.

Las Vegas Station:
 Our Las Vegas arrival station will be located within the historic Downtown Las Vegas gaming and resort district bordering the famous Fremont Street Experience. Adjacent to Union Pacific's main track line and Symphony Plaza, our re-modeled station (formally Amtrak's Las Vegas station) was chosen for its location along the Union Pacific Railroad mainline; its parking and local transportation ease of ingress and egress; its 10-minute drive from over 150,000 hotel rooms; its access to ridership views along the famous Las Vegas "Strip"; its strategic alliances with Fremont Street Experience, Downtown Redevelopment Agency and Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Agency; and its low cost proximity to traveling staff accommodations.

Conceptual future station rendering at the Plaza Hotel.



Train Operations
 The proposed route of the X-Train is approximately 338 miles beginning at LA Union Station, California and proceeding non-stop to the destination at Las Vegas, Nevada. The railroad rights-of-way (ROW), over which passenger train service could operate between Las Vegas and Los Angeles, include privately and publicly owned segments. The privately held portions are owned either by BNSF Railway (BNSF) or by Union Pacific Railroad (UPRR).
 Our charter agreement with Amtrak will give our X-Train the priority status needed to meet our scheduled travel times. In other words, the owners of the track will allow our X-Train to pass slower and longer freight trains by having those freight trains move to the numerous sidings along the route. Further, as an attractive and profitable railroad customer, they will ensure immediate and urgent maintenance of any and all track maintenance and other services that we would rely upon for prompt and safe service.
 
Proposed Operating Schedule
 Our Charter runs to Las Vegas from Los Angeles are planned around weekend events held in Las Vegas.  As such our operating schedule is not fixed and may vary depending on the event we are service, The operating table below is the general operations plan for the train movement of our consist and the placement, layover and operating times we generally expect. Actual results may vary.

Project Development Timeframe
 Below is our planned project development timeframe for initiating the service. The chart is an estimate of our development schedule and actual results may vary.

Maintenance Facilities
 Amtrak maintains their fleet, and the Friends of the 261 maintain their fleet under our lease agreement with them.
 Insurance
 Our agreement with Amtrak will provide liability insurance caps. Outside of our agreement, we are required through our conditional agreement with Union Pacific to maintain, during the life of the agreement, liability insurance with a limit of not less than $200 million; as well as other insurance policies we believe are of types customary in the industry and as required by the DOT and in amounts we believe are adequate to protect us against material loss. The policies principally provide coverage for public liability, passenger liability, baggage and cargo liability, property damage, including coverage for loss or damage to our rail equipment and workers' compensation insurance. There is no assurance, however, that the amount of insurance we carry will be sufficient to protect us from material loss.
Employees
 We currently have no employees other than our management team. Initially, we anticipate hiring a team of approximately 30 employees to assist in train and depot operations. Each train consist will require approximately 20 employees to operate it and the Las Vegas depot will require approximately 10 employees. Most of our train personnel will be classified as servers / entertainers and will not be covered by any collective bargaining agreements. Our other train operations personnel, including technical operations and maintenance, will be provided through our outsourcing agreement with Amtrak; and our food and beverage personnel will be provided on an outsourced basis.
Growth of Passenger Rail; Environment
 There is widespread acknowledgement that improved intercity passenger rail service will help address many major national transport challenges. Among the challenges faced are congested highways and airports, rising fuel costs and energy independence, and climate and environmental concerns.
 We are also aware of the urgency passenger rail service has established as evidenced by recent Congressional legislation, including the FY 2008 Appropriation Act, The Rail Safety Improvement Act of 2008 (RSIA), The Passenger Rail Investment and Improvement Act of 2008 (PRIIA), and The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA).
 Many higher density city pairs have been increasing their use of rail transportation over the last decade. Set forth below is a list of selected top city-pair markets for passenger rail transportation and the traffic in each of the last six years.

 12
 
Here in Las Vegas, the news regarding the prospect of high-speed rail has brought back into the public's consciousness the idea that intercity passenger rail service has returned as a viable alternative to existing modes of transportation. What has not been discussed, and is the strategic aim of our company, LVRE, is the popularization of conventional passenger rail service and the advantages it brings to the community.
 In addition, we are confident that we can advance the recent legislative efforts of Congress to improve our nation's transportation infrastructure by assisting in our nation's goal of diverting automobile traffic to intercity passenger rail. Such activities ought to: relieve increasingly congested highways by taking cars off the inter-state highways; demonstrate that there is a profitable market for intercity passenger rail; reduce overall CO2 emissions; eliminate an estimated total of 4.5 million automobiles from I-15 over a five year period; and reduce CO2 emissions on I-15 by an estimated amount of 42 million pounds in year one and 1.1 billion pounds over five years.
 Competition
 We will have no direct passenger rail service competition. Although there have been two proposed high speed rail alternatives announced, we believe these options will be economically infeasible in today's challenging fiscal environment.
 The Xpress West (formerly DesertXpress), which has a private Las Vegas sponsor, is a high-speed rail proposal for service from Las Vegas to Victorville, CA (85 miles from Los Angeles). This project requires an ambitious right-of-way acquisition, as well as $6 billion to construct a new rail system and 7-10 years to complete, if ever funded.
 The other proposal is the MagLev, a passenger train utilizing high-speed magnetic levitation technology. The MagLev would travel between Las Vegas and Anaheim, CA (25 miles from Los Angeles). This project, like the Xpress West, requires an ambitious right-of-way acquisition, $15 billion to construct, and 15 years to complete if ever funded.
 The Nevada Department of Transportation recently reviewed the proposals for rail service from Los Angeles to Las Vegas and has chosen to support the Las Vegas Railway Express proposed project. www.nvrailplan.com
 We will compete indirectly with a variety of transportation modes including automobiles, bus service, limousine service and air transportation. With the exception of automobiles, some portion of which we hope to replace, the other transportation modes are not seen as a material risk to our business strategy.
 Safety
 Passenger train service is among the safest form of travel in the country. In conjunction with our Class I railroad partners Burlington Northern Santa Fe, Union Pacific Railroad, Metrolink and our haulage partner, AMTRAK our commitment towards a safe method of travel will be paramount. Our ability to remove an estimated 4.5 million cars from I-15 will improve the safety of those traveling because this portion of I-15 is considered among the most dangerous stretches of road in the country.
THE LAS VEGAS / SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA TRANSPORT MARKET
 Las Vegas is a world-class leisure destination and one of the most sought after travel destinations within the United States, with its gaming attractions, convention facilities, various shows and entertainment, restaurants, hotels and golf courses. Currently, approximately 12 million people travel from Southern California to Las Vegas per year, 94% of those people do so by ground transportation, and the remaining 6% travel by commercial and private air transport. Las Vegas' global reach extends well beyond its approximately 38.9 million annual visitors, and is reflected in television travel programs, reality and poker shows, movies and celebrity visits that are consistently a part of daily media and pop culture.
  13
 
As a major leisure destination, Las Vegas tracks and reports a myriad of statistics about the profile of its visitors. Set forth below are important, selected market statistics about Southern Californian visitors to Las Vegas from the LVCVA 2011 Southern California Profile:
  17 million annual visitors from Southern California to Las Vegas
  94% of annual visitors to Las Vegas from Los Angeles, travel via ground transportation, 6% via air
  One-way ground travel between the cities can take up to 6 – 7 hours
  53% visit more than once a year
  Stay for an average of 2.9 nights and 3.9 days
  23% earn between $60,000 and $80,000 annually
  49% earn more than $80,000
  24% travel with more than 2 people in their party
  Spend an average of $371 gambling with 11% spending $600 or more
 When compared with other major resort markets in the United States, the Las Vegas market has shown consistent growth over both the near and long terms in both visitation and expenditures. We believe that recent growth in the Las Vegas market has been enhanced by the introduction of large luxury and thematic destination resorts and the increased capacity to host large-scale trade shows and conventions.

 The Regional Transportation Commission ("RTC") of Southern Nevada completed a transportation study and feasibility plan, which analyzed the possibility of a conventional passenger rail service between Las Vegas and Los Angeles. The study was completed in June of 2007 with a supplement completed in 2008. In that document the RTC and participating authorities concluded that passenger rail service was viable within the LA to Las Vegas corridor and that up to 4 million people could and would switch from traveling by automobile to traveling by rail if a reliable passenger rail service could be established.
 
Recently, the University of Nevada, Las Vegas (UNLV)'s Rail Engineering Department, headed by Dr. Harry Teng, completed a rail study of the LA to Las Vegas rail corridor. In the UNLV study, the logistics of running a series of passenger trains through this corridor was determined that the railroads affected would have sufficient capacity to easily manage the proposed frequency of the X Train, once a week charter service.
