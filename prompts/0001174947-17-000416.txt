General
 
Wayne Savings Bancshares, Inc.
 
Wayne Savings Bancshares, Inc. (the “Company”), is a unitary thrift holding company for Wayne Savings Community Bank (the “Bank”). The only significant asset of the Company is its investment in the Bank. The Bank conducts its business from eleven full-service locations. The Company’s principal office is located at 151 North Market Street, Wooster, Ohio, and its telephone number at that address is (330) 264-5767. At December 31, 2016, the Company had total assets of $454.8 million, total deposits of $383.7 million, and stockholders’ equity of $41.0 million, or 9.0% of total assets.
Wayne Savings Community Bank
 
The Bank is an Ohio-chartered stock savings and loan association headquartered in Wooster, Ohio. The Bank’s deposits are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”). The Bank has been a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank (“FHLB”) System since 1937.
 
The Bank is a community-oriented institution offering a full range of consumer and business financial services to the local community. The Bank’s primary lending and deposit gathering area includes Wayne, Holmes, Ashland, Medina and Stark counties, where it operates eleven full-service offices. This contiguous five-county area is located in northeast Ohio, and is an active manufacturing and agricultural market. The Bank’s principal business activities consist of originating one-to-four family residential real estate loans, multi-family residential, commercial and nonresidential real estate loans. The Bank also originates non-real estate, secured commercial loans, consumer loans, and to a lesser extent, construction loans. The Bank also invests in mortgage-backed securities, obligations issued by state and political subdivisions and a small position of private-label collateralized mortgage obligations and other liquid investments, such as United States Government securities, federal funds, and deposits in other financial institutions.
 
The Bank’s primary objective for the loan portfolio is to pursue and maintain a diversified composition of mortgage, commercial and consumer loans to manage both risk and return, while meeting the needs of the markets we serve. A secondary objective is to continue shifting the longer duration, lower yielding mortgage loans and securities into adjustable rate commercial loans. Mortgage loans and refinancing caused by the continued low interest rate environment generated a $32.5 million increase in one-to-four family residential mortgage loans from $160.9 million, or 63.3% of the total loan portfolio at December 31, 2012, to $193.4 million, or 56.8% of the total loan portfolio, at December 31, 2016. This increase was mainly due to growth in our 15 year fixed-rate mortgage product and our 30 year one-to-four family residential construction loans as interest rates remained at their historic low levels during the period. Over the previous five year-end periods, commercial business lending and commercial lending collateralized by multi-family properties increased by $8.9 million and $1.6 million, respectively. Nonresidential real estate loans and commercial loans generally carry higher yields and shorter terms than one-to-four family loans. The increased emphasis on commercial lending has diversified the loan portfolio, expanded the Company’s product offerings and broadened the Company’s customer base and its corresponding ability to cross sell its varied product offerings. This change in emphasis has also resulted in increased staffing expense and, in the current economic environment, increased provisions for loan losses due to the higher inherent risk associated with commercial lending activities. Loan demand increased during the current year due to the low interest rate environment and increased sales efforts in the commercial lending division resulting in an increase in the loan portfolio funded by a decrease in cash and cash equivalents and increased deposit balances.

Market Area/Local Economy
 
The Bank, headquartered in Wooster, Ohio, operates in Wayne, Ashland, Medina, Holmes and Stark Counties in northeast Ohio. Wooster is located in Wayne County and is approximately midway between Cleveland and Columbus, Ohio.
 
Wayne County is characterized by a diverse economic base, which is not dependent on any particular industry. It is one of the leading agricultural counties in the state. Since 1892, Wooster has been the headquarters of the Ohio Agricultural Research and Development Center, the agricultural research arm of The Ohio State University. In addition, Wayne County is also the home base of several nationally known companies including The J.M. Smucker Company, and the Wooster Brush Company. It is also the home of many industrial plants, including LuK USA, Artiflex, JLG Industries and Gerber Industries. The City of Wooster has a regional medical center, with a successful city-owned hospital and significant commitment by the world-renowned Cleveland Clinic through state of the art medical facilities. Wayne County is also known for its excellence in education. The College of Wooster was founded in 1866 and serves 2,100 students during the school season. Other quality educational opportunities are offered by the Agricultural Technical Institute of The Ohio State University, and Wayne College, a branch of The University of Akron. In Wayne County, the Bank operates four full-service offices in Wooster, one stand-alone drive-thru facility and one full-service office in each of Rittman and Creston, both in northern Wayne County, adjacent to Medina County.
 
Ashland County, which is located due west of Wayne County, also has a diverse economic base. In addition to its agricultural segment, Ashland County has manufacturing plants producing rubber and plastics, machinery, transportation equipment, chemicals, apparel, and other items. Ashland is also the home of Ashland University, which was founded in 1878 and serves approximately 6,600 students. The City of Ashland is the county seat and the location of two of the Bank’s branch offices, one of which is an in-store branch.
 
Medina County, located just north of Wayne County, is the center of a fertile agricultural region. While farming remains the largest industry in the county in terms of dollar value of goods produced, over 100 small manufacturing firms also operate in the county. The City of Medina is located in the center of the Cleveland-Akron-Lorain Standard Consolidated Statistical Marketing Area. Medina is located approximately 30 miles south of Cleveland and 15 miles west of Akron. Due to its proximity to Akron and Cleveland, a majority of Medina County’s labor force is employed in these two cities. The Bank operates one full-service office in Medina County, which is located in the Village of Lodi, in the southernmost part of the county, adjacent to Wayne County.
 
Holmes County, located directly south of Wayne County, has a mostly rural economy. The local economy depends mostly upon agriculture, light manufacturing, fabrics, and wood products. Because of the scenic beauty and a large Amish community, revenues from tourism are becoming increasingly significant. The county is also noted for its many fine cheese-making operations. A large number of Holmes County residents are employed in Wayne County. The City of Millersburg is the county seat and the location of one of the Bank’s branch offices.
 
Stark County, located directly east of Wayne County, is characterized by a diverse economy that includes a rich manufacturing heritage, which results in the production of a wide variety of products. In addition to manufacturing, Stark County also has a strong agricultural base including the production of dairy products. The major employers in North Canton are Diebold Incorporated (a major manufacturer of bank security products and automated teller machines), the Timken Company (a world-wide manufacturer of tapered roller bearings and power transmission components and systems) and the Timken Steel Company (a world-wide manufacturer specialty steels). Jackson Township is the home to the Westfield Belden Village

Shopping Center, while Plain Township is a residential and agricultural area with a few widely scattered light industries. North Canton is the location of one of the Bank’s branches.
Lending Activities
 
General. Historically, the principal lending activity of the Company was the origination of fixed and adjustable rate mortgage (“ARM”) loans collateralized by one-to-four family residential properties located in its market area. The Company originated ARM loans for retention in its portfolio, and fixed-rate loans eligible for resale in the secondary mortgage market. The Company continues to originate residential mortgage loans but is increasing the emphasis on the origination of loans collateralized by nonresidential and multi-family residential real estate, as well as commercial business loans. In addition, the Company is increasing its emphasis on the origination of consumer loans to broaden services offered to customers.
 
The Company has sought to make its interest-earning assets more interest rate sensitive by originating adjustable rate loans, such as ARM loans, home equity loans, and medium-term consumer loans. The Company also purchases mortgage-backed securities generally with estimated remaining average lives of five years or less. At December 31, 2016, approximately $173.6 million, or 50.9%, of the Company’s total loans consisted of loans with adjustable interest rates.
 
The Company continues to actively originate fixed-rate mortgage loans, generally with 15 to 30 year terms to maturity, collateralized by one-to-four family residential properties. One-to-four family fixed-rate residential mortgage loans generally are originated and underwritten according to standards that allow the Company to sell such loans in the secondary mortgage market for purposes of managing interest rate risk and liquidity. From November 2005 until January 2009, the Company decided to retain all one-to-four family, fixed-rate residential mortgage loan originations with terms of 15 and 30 years to manage the size of the portfolio and to provide higher yields as compared to alternative investments. In accordance with a policy adopted by the Bank’s Asset/Liability Committee (“ALCO”) that permits limited loan sales to address interest rate risk and liquidity concerns, during the years ended December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company sold $5.5 million and $5.9 million, respectively, of fixed-rate residential mortgage loans into the secondary market to limit the buildup of interest rate risk and to provide pipeline funding during a period where a large number of originations were occurring due to refinancing activity by consumers. The Company retains servicing on its sold mortgage loans. The Company also originates interim construction loans on one-to-four family residential properties.
 
The Company has continued to develop the commercial business loan program in order to increase the Company’s interest rate sensitive assets, increase interest income and diversify both the loan portfolio and the Company’s customer base. The Company has four experienced commercial lenders to manage this portfolio. The Company targets small local businesses with loan amounts in the $50,000 - $1.0 million range with a majority of loans under $500,000. Overall, commercial business loans increased to $23.2 million at December 31, 2016, compared to $14.2 million at December 31, 2012, nonresidential real estate and land loans increased from $65.8 million, or 25.9% of the total loan portfolio at December 31, 2012, to $107.8 million, or 31.6% of the total loan portfolio at December 31, 2016.

One-to-Four Family Residential Real Estate Loans. A significant part of the Company’s lending activity consists of the origination of one-to-four family, owner-occupied, residential mortgage loans on properties located in the Company’s market area. The Company also originates loans to commercial customers secured by one-to-four family non-owner occupied properties. The Company generally does not originate one-to-four family residential loans secured by properties outside of its market area. At December 31, 2016, the Company had $193.4 million, or 56.8%, of its total loan portfolio invested in loans secured by one-to-four family residential mortgage properties.

Index
The Company’s fixed-rate loans generally are originated and underwritten according to standards that permit resale in the secondary mortgage market (so-called “conforming mortgages”) and, in accordance with the “Qualified Mortgage” (“QM”) rules that became effective January 10, 2014 as issued by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (“CFPB”) will be considered to be Qualified Mortgages. Certain loans may be originated with certain exceptions that make the loans non-conforming and not qualified mortgages. These loans are limited in number and are reported to the Bank’s Board of Directors on a quarterly basis as exceptions to the Bank’s Loan Policy.
 
Whether the Company can or will sell fixed-rate loans into the secondary market, however, depends on a number of factors including the Company’s portfolio mix, interest rate risk and liquidity positions, and market conditions. The Company’s fixed-rate mortgage loans are amortized on a monthly basis with principal and interest due each month. One-to-four family residential real estate loans often remain outstanding for significantly shorter periods than their contractual terms because borrowers may refinance or prepay loans at their option. The Company’s one-to-four family residential portfolio has increased $13.7 million or 7.6%, from December 31, 2015, to December 31, 2016. Sales into the secondary market were $5.5 million and $5.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Such sales generally constituted current period originations. There were no loans identified as held for sale for any of the five years presented.
 
The Company currently offers one-to-four family residential mortgage loans with terms typically ranging from 15 to 30 years, and with adjustable or fixed interest rates. Originations of fixed-rate mortgage loans versus ARM loans are monitored on an ongoing basis and are affected significantly by the level of market interest rates, customer preference, the Company’s interest rate risk position, and loan products offered by the Company’s competitors. The low interest rate environment over the last few years has resulted in a strong customer preference for fixed-rate mortgage loans.
 
The Company offers one ARM loan product. The Treasury ARM loan adjusts annually with interest rate adjustment limitations of 2% per year and with a cap of 3% or 5% on total rate increases or decreases over the life of the loan. The index on the Treasury ARM loan is the weekly average yield on U.S. Treasury securities, adjusted to a constant maturity of one year plus a margin. However, these loans are underwritten at the fully indexed interest rate. All loans require monthly principal and interest payments and negative amortization is not permitted. One-to-four family residential ARM loans totaled $46.5 million, or 13.6% of the Company’s total loan portfolio at December 31, 2016.
 
The primary purpose of offering ARM loans is to make the Company’s loan portfolio more interest rate sensitive. However, as the interest income earned on ARM loans varies with prevailing interest rates, such loans do not offer the Company as predictable cash flows compared to long-term, fixed-rate loans. ARM loans carry increased credit risk associated with potentially higher monthly payments by borrowers as general market interest rates increase. It is possible, therefore, that during periods of rising interest rates, the risk of default on ARM loans may increase due to the upward adjustment of interest costs to the borrower. Management believes that the Company’s credit risk associated with its ARM loans is reduced because the Company has either a 3% or 5% cap on interest rate increases during the life of its ARM loans.
 
The Company also offers home equity loans and equity lines of credit collateralized by a second mortgage on the borrower’s principal residence. In underwriting these home equity loans, the Company requires that the maximum loan-to-value ratios, including the principal balances of both the first and second mortgage loans, not exceed 85%. The home equity loan portfolio consists of adjustable rate loans which use the prime rate as published in The Wall Street Journal as the interest rate index. Home equity loans include fixed term adjustable rate loans, as well as lines of credit. As of December 31, 2016, the Company’s home equity loan portfolio totaled $15.8 million, or 8.2%, of its one-to-four family mortgage loan portfolio.

Index
The Company’s one-to-four family residential first mortgage loans customarily include due-on-sale clauses, which are provisions giving the Company the right to declare a loan immediately due and payable in the event, among other things, that the borrower sells or otherwise disposes of the underlying real property serving as security for the loan. Due-on-sale clauses are an important means of adjusting the rates on the Company’s fixed-rate mortgage loan portfolio.
 
Regulations limit the amount that a savings association may lend relative to the appraised value of the real estate securing the loan, as determined by an appraisal at the time of loan origination. The Company’s lending policies limit the maximum loan-to-value ratio on both fixed-rate and ARM loans without private mortgage insurance to 80% of the lesser of the appraised value or the purchase price of the property to serve as collateral for the loan. However, the Company makes one-to-four family real estate loans with loan-to-value ratios in excess of 80% which require private mortgage insurance. The Company requires fire and casualty insurance, on all properties securing real estate loans made by the Company and flood insurance, where applicable. The Company requires title insurance on all properties securing real estate except the 10 year loan product and lot loans.
 
Multi-Family Residential Real Estate Loans. Loans secured by multi-family real estate constituted approximately $11.4 million, or 3.4%, of the Company’s total loan portfolio at December 31, 2016. The Company’s multi-family real estate loans are secured by multi-family residences, such as apartment buildings. At December 31, 2016, most of the Company’s multi-family loans were secured by properties located within the Company’s market area with an average balance of $497,000 At December 31, 2016, the Company’s largest multi-family real estate loan had a principal balance of $2.7 million. Multi-family real estate loans currently are offered with adjustable interest rates or short-term balloon maturities, although in the past the Company originated fixed-rate long-term multi-family real estate loans. The terms of each multi-family loan are negotiated on a case-by-case basis, although such loans typically have adjustable interest rates tied to a market index, and amortize over 15 to 25 years. The Company currently does not have any multi-family real estate construction loans.
 
Loans secured by multi-family real estate generally involve a greater degree of credit risk than one-to-four family residential mortgage loans and carry larger loan balances. This increased credit risk is a result of several factors, including the concentration of principal in a limited number of loans and borrowers, the effects of general economic conditions on income-producing properties, and the increased difficulty of evaluating and monitoring these types of loans. Furthermore, the repayment of loans secured by multi-family real estate is typically dependent upon the successful operation of the related real estate property. If the cash flow from the project is reduced, the borrower’s ability to repay the loan may be impaired.
 
Nonresidential Real Estate and Land Loans. Loans secured by nonresidential real estate constituted approximately $102.9 million, or 30.2%, of the Company’s total loan portfolio at December 31, 2016 compared to $82.9 million or 27.2% of the total loan portfolio at December 31, 2015. The Company has continued its strategy to diversify the loan portfolio and has experienced growth in loan demand over the past year. The Company’s nonresidential real estate loans are secured by improved property such as offices, small business facilities, and other nonresidential buildings. At December 31, 2016, approximately $62.9 million, or 61.1%, of these loans are borrower occupied. At December 31, 2016, most of the Company’s nonresidential real estate loans were secured by properties located within the Company’s market area. The Company’s largest nonresidential real estate loan at December 31, 2016 had a principal balance of $2.8 million and the average balance of such loans was $383,000. The terms of each nonresidential real estate loan are negotiated on a case-by-case basis. Nonresidential real estate loans are currently offered with adjustable interest rates or short-term balloon maturities, although in the past the Company has originated fixed-rate, long-term, nonresidential real estate loans. Nonresidential real estate loans originated by the Company generally amortize over 15 to 25 years. The Company currently does not emphasize nonresidential real estate construction loans. Included in the loan tables above are nonresidential construction loans totaling $3.2 million which were undisbursed at December 31, 2016.

Loans secured by nonresidential real estate generally involve a greater degree of risk than one-to- four family residential mortgage loans and carry larger loan balances. This increased credit risk is a result of several factors, including the concentration of principal in a limited number of loans and borrowers, the effects of general economic conditions on income-producing properties, and the increased difficulty of evaluating and monitoring these types of loans. Furthermore, the repayment of loans secured by non-residential real estate is typically dependent upon the successful operation of the related real estate project. If the cash flow from the project is reduced, the borrower’s ability to repay the loan may be impaired.
 
The Company also originates a limited number of land loans secured by individual improved and unimproved lots for future residential construction. In addition, the Company originates loans to commercial customers with land held as the collateral. Also included in this total were developed building lots of approximately $721,000. Land loans totaled $4.2 million at December 31, 2016.
 
Residential Construction Loans. To a lesser extent, the Company originates loans to finance the construction of one-to-four family residential property. At December 31, 2016, the Company had $2.7 million of its total loan portfolio invested in construction loans. The Company makes construction loans to private individuals and to builders. Loan proceeds are disbursed in increments as construction progresses and as inspections warrant. Construction loans are typically structured as permanent one-to-four family loans originated by the Company with a 12-month construction phase. Accordingly, upon completion of the construction phase, there is no change in interest rate or term to maturity of the original construction loan, nor is a new permanent loan originated.
Commercial Business Loans. Commercial business loans totaled $23.2 million, or 6.8% of the Company’s total loan portfolio at December 31, 2016. The Company has four experienced commercial lenders and plans to pursue commercial lending growth as part of the Company’s strategic plan to diversify the loan portfolio.
 
Commercial loans carry a higher degree of risk than one-to-four family residential loans. Such lending typically involves large loan balances concentrated in a single borrower or groups of related borrowers for rental or business properties. In addition, the payment experience on loans secured by income-producing properties is typically dependent on the success of the operation of the related project and thus is typically affected by adverse conditions in the real estate market and in the economy. The Company originates commercial loans generally in the $50,000 to $1.0 million range with the majority of these loans being under $500,000. Commercial loans are generally underwritten based on the borrower’s ability to pay and assets such as buildings, land and equipment are taken as additional loan collateral. Each loan is evaluated for a level of risk and assigned a rating from “1” (the highest quality rating) to “7” (the lowest quality rating).
 
Consumer Loans. Ohio savings associations are authorized to invest in secured and unsecured consumer loans in an aggregate amount which, when combined with investments in commercial paper and corporate debt securities, does not exceed 20% of an association’s assets. In addition, an Ohio savings association is permitted to invest up to 5% of its assets in loans for educational purposes.
 
As of December 31, 2016, consumer loans totaled $2.2 million, or 0.6%, of the Company’s total loan portfolio. The principal types of consumer loans offered by the Company are second mortgage loans, fixed-rate auto and truck loans, unsecured personal loans, and loans secured by deposit accounts. Consumer loans are offered primarily on a fixed-rate basis with maturities generally less than ten years.
 
The Company’s second mortgage consumer loans are secured by the borrower’s principal residence with a maximum loan-to-value ratio, including the principal balances of both the first and second mortgage

loans, of 85% or less. Such loans are offered on a fixed-rate basis with terms of up to ten years. At December 31, 2016, second mortgage loans totaled $217,000, or 0.1%, of one-to-four family mortgage loans.
 
The underwriting standards employed by the Company for consumer loans include a determination of the applicant’s credit history and an assessment of the applicant’s ability to meet existing obligations and payments on the proposed loan. The quality and stability of the applicant’s monthly income are determined by analyzing the gross monthly income from primary employment, and additionally from any verifiable secondary income. Creditworthiness of the applicant is of primary consideration. However, where applicable, the underwriting process also includes a comparison of the value of the collateral in relation to the proposed loan amount.
 
Consumer loans entail greater credit risk than one-to-four family residential mortgage loans, particularly in the case of consumer loans that are unsecured or secured by assets that depreciate rapidly, such as automobiles, mobile homes, boats, and recreational vehicles. In such cases, repossessed collateral for a defaulted consumer loan may not provide an adequate source of repayment for the outstanding loan and the remaining deficiency often does not warrant further substantial collection efforts against the borrower. In particular, amounts realizable on the sale of repossessed automobiles may be significantly reduced based upon the condition of the automobiles and the current level of demand for used automobiles. The Company adds a general provision on a regular basis to its consumer loan loss allowance, based on, among other factors, general economic conditions and prior loss experience. See “—Delinquencies and Classified Assets—Nonperforming and Impaired Assets,” and “—Classification of Assets” for information regarding the Company’s loan loss experience and reserve policy.
 
Loan Originations, Solicitation, Processing and Commitments. Loan originations are derived from a number of sources such as real estate agent referrals, existing customers, borrowers, builders, attorneys and walk-in customers. The Company has also entered into a number of participation loans with high quality lead lenders. The participations are outside the Company’s normal lending area and diversify the loan portfolio. Upon receiving a loan application, the Company obtains a credit report and employment verification to verify specific information relating to the applicant’s employment, income, and credit standing. In the case of a real estate loan, an appraiser approved by the Company appraises the real estate intended to secure the proposed loan. An underwriter in the Company’s loan department checks the loan application file for accuracy and completeness, and verifies the information provided. Conventional mortgage loans up to $240,000 can be approved by the mortgage loan underwriter. The mortgage department manager and mortgage department underwriter can also both approve loans that meet all requirements to be sold on the secondary market and comply with Freddie Mac underwriting of up to $417,000. All loans up to $300,000 can be approved by the Vice President, Commercial Lending. Any loans between $300,000 and $500,000 must be approved by the Senior Vice President/Senior Loan Officer or the President and Chief Executive Officer. The Loan Committee must approve loans from $500,000 to $3.0 million and loans in excess of $3.0 million must be approved by the Board of Directors. The Loan Committee meets once a week to review and verify that loan officer approvals of loans are made within the scope of management’s authority. All approvals are subsequently ratified monthly by the full Board of Directors. Fire and casualty insurance is required at the time the loan is made and throughout the term of the loan. After the loan is approved, a loan commitment letter is promptly issued to the borrower. At December 31, 2016, the Company had commitments to originate $1.6 million of loans.
 
The commitment letter specifies the terms and conditions of the proposed loan including the amount of the loan, interest rate, amortization term, a brief description of the required collateral, and required insurance coverage. The borrower must provide proof of fire and casualty insurance on the property serving as collateral, which insurance must be maintained during the full term of the loan. A title search of the property is required on all loans secured by real property.

Loan Origination Fees and Other Income. In addition to interest earned on loans, the Company generally receives loan origination fees. The Company accounts for loan origination fees in accordance with FASB ASC 310-20. To the extent that loans are originated or acquired for the Company’s portfolio, FASB ASC 310-20 requires that the Company defer loan origination fees and costs and amortize such amounts as an adjustment of yield over the life of the loan by use of the level yield method. FASB ASC 310-20 reduces the amount of revenue recognized by many financial institutions at the time such loans are originated or acquired. Fees deferred under FASB ASC 310-20 are recognized into income immediately upon prepayment or the sale of the related loan. At December 31, 2016, the Company had $747,000 in deferred loan origination fees. Loan origination fees are volatile sources of income. Such fees vary with the volume and type of loans and commitments made and purchased, principal repayments, and competitive conditions in the mortgage markets, which in turn respond to the demand for and availability of money.
 
The Company receives other operating income that consists primarily of, ATM fees, merchant fees, late charges, income from REO operations, and other miscellaneous income and fees. The Company recognized other operating income of $464,000 for the year ended December 31, 2016, and $459,000 for the year ended December 31, 2015.
 
Loans to One Borrower. Savings associations are subject to the same limits as those applicable to national banks, which under current regulations restrict loans to one borrower to an amount equal to 15% of unimpaired capital and unimpaired surplus on an unsecured basis, and an additional amount equal to 10% of unimpaired capital and unimpaired surplus if the loan is secured by readily marketable collateral (generally, financial instruments and bullion, but not real estate). At December 31, 2016, the Company’s largest concentration of loans to one borrower totaled $4.7 million. All of the loans in this concentration were 
  10
Index
current in accordance with their original terms at December 31, 2016. The Company had no loans at December 31, 2016, which exceeded the loans to one borrower regulations.
 
Delinquencies and Classified Assets
 
Delinquencies. The Company’s collection procedures provide that when a loan is 15 days past due, a computer-generated late charge notice is sent to the borrower requesting payment, plus a late charge. This notice is followed with a letter again requesting payment when the payment becomes 20 days past due. If delinquency continues, at 30 days another collection letter is sent and personal contact efforts are attempted, either in person or by telephone, to strengthen the collection process and obtain reasons for the delinquency. Also, a repayment plan is established. If a loan becomes 60 days past due, the loan becomes subject to possible legal action if suitable arrangements to repay have not been made. In addition, for residential mortgage loans the borrower is given information which provides access to consumer counseling services, to the extent required by HUD regulations. When a loan continues in a delinquent status for 90 days or more, and a repayment schedule has not been established or adhered to by the borrower, a notice of intent to foreclose is sent to the borrower, giving 30 days to cure the delinquency. If not cured, foreclosure proceedings are initiated.
Nonperforming and Impaired Assets. Loans are reviewed on a regular basis and are placed on a non-accrual status when, in the opinion of management, the collection of additional interest is doubtful. Mortgage loans are placed on non-accrual status generally when either principal or interest is 90 days or more past due and management considers the interest uncollectible. Interest accrued and unpaid at the time a loan is placed on non-accrual status is charged against interest income.
 
Under the provisions of FASB ASC 310-10, a loan is defined as impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that a creditor will be unable to collect all amounts due under the contractual terms of the loan agreement. In applying the provisions of FASB ASC 310-10, the Bank considers one-to-four family residential loans and consumer installment loans to be homogeneous and therefore excluded from separate identification for evaluation of impairment. The exception to this rule is a Troubled Debt Restructured loan or “TDR”. A loan is considered a TDR when the Bank concedes to terms normally not extended to a borrower experiencing a financial hardship. With respect to the Bank’s multi-family, commercial and nonresidential loans, and the evaluation of impairment thereof, such loans are collateral dependent and, as a result, are carried at the lower of cost or fair value. At December 31, 2016, the Company had $3.1 million of impaired loans, of which $2.3 million were performing in accordance with their terms at such date.
 
At December 31, 2016, the Company had nonperforming loans totaling $1.6 million comprised of $1.5 million in one-to-four family residential mortgage loans and $85,000 in nonresidential real estate loans. The ratio of nonperforming and impaired loans to loans receivable was 1.2% at December 31, 2016. At December 31, 2016, the largest nonperforming residential real estate loan totaled $212,000. In the opinion of management, as of December 31, 2016, no significant unreserved loss is anticipated on any nonperforming loan. At December 31, 2015, the Company had nonperforming loans of $1.9 million and a ratio of nonperforming and impaired loans to loans receivable of 1.7%. Of the nonperforming loans at December 31, 2015, $1.7 million were one-to-four family residential mortgage loans and $208,000 were nonresidential real estate loans. The Company has historically realized limited losses on such loans primarily because these loans are underwritten with a maximum 85% loan-to-value ratio.
 
Real estate acquired by the Company as a result of foreclosure or by deed in lieu of foreclosure (“REO”) is deemed REO until such time as it is sold. When REO is acquired, it is recorded at fair value, less estimated selling expenses. Valuations are periodically performed by management, and any subsequent decline in fair value is charged to operations.

Classification of Assets. Federal regulations provide for the classification of loans and other assets such as debt and equity securities considered by the FDIC to be of lesser quality as “substandard,” “doubtful,” or “loss” assets. An asset is considered “substandard” if it is inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged, if any. “Substandard” assets include those characterized by the “distinct possibility” that the savings institution will sustain “some loss” if the deficiencies are not corrected. Assets classified as “doubtful” have all of the weaknesses inherent in those classified “substandard,” with the added characteristic that the weaknesses present make “collection or liquidation in full,” on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions, and values, “highly questionable and improbable.” Assets classified as “loss” are those considered “uncollectible” and of such little value that their continuance as assets without the establishment of a specific loss reserve is not warranted. Assets that do not expose the savings institution to risk sufficient to warrant classification in one of the aforementioned categories, but which possess some weaknesses, are required to be designated “special mention” by management.
 
When a savings institution classifies problem assets as either substandard or doubtful, it is required to establish general allowances for loan losses in an amount deemed prudent by management. General allowances represent loss allowances that have been established to recognize the inherent risk associated with lending activities, but which, unlike specific allowances, have not been allocated to particular problem assets. When a savings institution classifies problem assets as “loss,” it is required either to establish a specific allowance for losses equal to 100% of the amount of the assets so classified, or to charge-off such amount. A savings institution’s determination as to the classification of its assets and the amount of its valuation allowances is subject to review by the FDIC, which can order the establishment of additional general or specific loss allowances. The Company regularly reviews the problem loans in its portfolio to determine whether any loans require classification in accordance with applicable regulations.
 
The following table sets forth the aggregate amount of the Company’s classified assets at the dates indicated.

Allowance for Loan Losses. In determining the amount of the allowance for loan losses at any point in time, management and the Board of Directors apply a systematic process focusing on the risk of loss in the loan portfolio. First, delinquent nonresidential, multi-family and commercial loans are evaluated individually for potential impairment in their carrying value. Second, management applies historic loss experience to the individual loan types in the portfolio. In addition to the historic loss percentage, management employs an additional risk percentage based on factors identified by management as representative of the overall risk in the economy. However, the analysis of the allowance for loan losses requires an element of judgment and is subject to the possibility that the allowance may need to be increased, with the corresponding reduction in earnings.
 
During the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, the Company added $365,000, $1,175,000 and $333,000, respectively, to the provision for loan losses. The Company’s allowance for loan losses totaled $3.0 million, $2.8 million, and $2.8 million for the three years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 respectively. The provision for loan losses in the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 
  13
Index
was based on the level of nonperforming loans and charge-offs, as well as the size and risk profile of the loan portfolio and assessments of internal and external factors as prescribed by regulation. While management believes that the Company’s current allowance for loan losses is adequate, there can be no assurance that the allowance for loan losses will be adequate to cover losses that may in fact be realized in the future or that additional provisions for loan losses will not be required. To the best of management’s knowledge, all known losses as of December 31, 2016, have been recorded.

Investment Activities
 
The Company’s cash and cash equivalents, consisting of cash and due from banks and interest-bearing deposits due from other financial institutions with original maturities of three months or less, totaled $16.8 million at December 31, 2016, compared to $11.2 million at December 31, 2015, an increase of $5.6 million. The Company’s investment portfolio is comprised of investment securities, and state and local obligations classified as either held-to-maturity or available-for-sale. The carrying value of the Company’s investment securities totaled $20.9 million at December 31, 2016, compared to $26.2 million at December 31, 2015. The carrying value of the investment securities classified as held-to-maturity is carried at their back value, while those classified as available-for-sale are carried at their fair market value.
 
Liquidity levels may be increased or decreased depending upon the yields on investment alternatives and upon management’s judgment as to the attractiveness of the yields then available in relation to other opportunities and its expectation of the level of yield that will be available in the future, as well as management’s projections as to the short-term demand for funds to be used in the Company’s loan origination and other activities.
 
The Company also invests in mortgage-backed securities generally issued or guaranteed by the United States Government or agencies thereof or meeting investment grade credit quality standards in accordance with the Board-approved investment policy and regulatory guidance that is intended to increase earnings over lower yielding cash equivalents, reduce interest rate risk relative to longer duration whole loan alternatives, to provide liquidity to the institution primarily through monthly cash flows while limiting credit risk and meet Community Reinvestment Act (“CRA”) requirements by investing in specified loan pools. Investments in mortgage-backed securities are made either directly or by exchanging mortgage loans in the Company’s portfolio for such securities. These securities consist primarily of adjustable rate or shorter duration mortgage-backed securities issued or guaranteed by the Federal National Mortgage Association (“FNMA”), Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (“FHLMC”), and the Government National Mortgage Association (“GNMA”). Total mortgage-backed securities, including those designated as available-for-sale, decreased to $59.3 million at December 31, 2016 from $77.2 million at December 31, 2015, primarily due to using the cash flow from principal reductions to fund loan growth during the current year period.
 
The Company’s holdings of private-label collateralized mortgage obligations totaled $40,000 at December 31, 2016 compared to $277,000 at December 31, 2015. All such securities were rated AAA at the time of purchase and the remaining two holdings continue to be of investment grade. These positions contain collateral that was originated during 2003 or earlier. In addition, management reviews a monthly analysis of actual and projected cash flows for these securities to determine whether or not any other-than-temporary impairment (“OTTI”) exists. At December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, no OTTI was identified with respect to these securities.
 
The Company’s objectives in investing in mortgage-backed securities vary from time to time depending upon market interest rates, local mortgage loan demand, the Company’s level of liquidity and the need for CRA investments. Mortgage-backed securities are more liquid than whole loans, can be readily sold in response to market conditions and changes in interest rates and provide monthly principal and interest cash flows that can be used to fund loan demand or reinvested in the securities portfolio. Mortgage-backed securities purchased by the Company also have lower credit risk because principal and interest are generally either insured or guaranteed by the United States Government or agencies thereof.
 
Investments in state and municipal obligations are made to generate tax-exempt income, to manage interest rate risk through call protection, to diversify security types in the investment portfolio and to meet the requirements of CRA for investments in the Bank’s CRA assessment area. Credit analysis of state and municipal obligations is completed in compliance with regulatory requirements to avoid reliance on ratings published by Nationally Recognized Statistical Ratings Organizations (“NRSRO”).

Index
The portfolio of state and municipal obligations is reviewed on a regular basis for classification and impairment in accordance with regulatory and accounting guidance. No impairment was recognized in the portfolio at December 31, 2016 or December 31, 2015 and no obligations were classified at either date.

Sources of Funds
 
General. The Company receives cash for the annual ESOP loan payment and dividends from the Bank for the company to fund operating expenses, tax settlement, cash dividends to shareholders and stock repurchases. Dividends from the Bank to the Company are subject to regulatory approval as discussed under “Federal Regulation – Limitations on Capital Distributions” below.
 
Deposits are the major source of the Bank’s funds for lending and other investment purposes. In addition to deposits, the Bank derives funds from the amortization, prepayment or sale of loans and mortgage-backed securities, the sale or maturity of investment securities, operations and, if needed, advances from the FHLB, the Federal Reserve discount window, brokered CD’s and Certificate of Deposit Account Registry Service “CDARS”. Scheduled loan principal repayments are a relatively stable source of funds, while deposit inflows and outflows and loan and mortgage-backed security prepayments are influenced significantly by general interest rates and market conditions. Borrowings may be used on a short-term basis to compensate for reductions in the availability of funds from other sources or on a longer term basis for general business purposes, particularly the management of interest rate risk.
 
Deposits. Consumer and commercial deposits are attracted principally from within the Bank’s market area through the offering of a broad selection of deposit instruments including checking accounts, savings accounts, money market accounts, term certificate of deposit accounts and individual retirement accounts. The Bank accepts deposits of $100,000 or more and offers negotiated interest rates on such deposits. Deposit account terms vary according to the minimum balance required, the period of time during which the funds must remain on deposit and the interest rate, among other factors. The Bank regularly evaluates its internal cost of funds, surveys rates offered by competing institutions, reviews the Bank’s cash flow requirements for lending and liquidity, and executes rate changes when deemed appropriate.
Deposit Portfolio. Savings and other deposits in the Company as of December 31, 2016, were comprised of the following:

Borrowings
 
Deposits are the primary source of funds for the Company’s lending and investment activities and for its general business purposes. The Bank may rely upon advances from the FHLB and the Federal Reserve Bank discount window to supplement its supply of lendable funds, to meet deposit withdrawal requirements and to extend liability duration for interest rate risk management purposes. Advances from the FHLB typically are collateralized by stock in the FHLB and a portion of first mortgage loans held by the Bank. At December 31, 2016, the Company had $18.0 million in advances outstanding.
 
21
Index
The FHLB functions as a central reserve bank providing credit for member financial institutions. Members of the FHLB are required to own capital stock in the FHLB and are authorized to apply for advances on the security of such stock and certain home mortgages and other assets (principally, securities that are obligations of, or guaranteed by, the United States) provided certain standards related to creditworthiness have been met. Advances are made pursuant to several different programs. Each credit program has its own interest rate and range of maturities. Depending on the program, limitations on the amount of advances are based on a fixed percentage of a member institution’s net worth, the FHLB’s assessment of the institution’s creditworthiness, or the amount of collateral available to secure additional borrowings.
 
Other short-term borrowings consist of repurchase agreements executed with customers as part of a commercial account sweep program. A portion of the Bank’s securities portfolio is used to support this program.

Competition
 
The Company encounters strong competition both in attracting deposits and in originating real estate and other loans. The Bank’s most direct competition for deposits has come historically from commercial banks, other savings associations, and credit unions in its market area, and the Company expects continued strong competition from such financial institutions in the foreseeable future. The Company’s market area includes branches of several commercial banks that are substantially larger than the Company in terms of state-wide deposits. The Company competes for savings by offering depositors a high level of personal service and expertise together with a wide range of financial services.
 
The competition for real estate and other loans comes principally from commercial banks, mortgage banking companies, and other savings associations. This competition for loans has increased substantially in 
  22
Index
recent years as a result of the large number of institutions competing in the Company’s market area as well as the increased efforts by commercial banks to expand mortgage loan originations.
 
The Company competes for loans primarily through the interest rates and loan fees it charges and the efficiency and quality of services, particularly local decision making, it provides borrowers, real estate brokers, and builders. Factors that affect competition include general and local economic conditions, current interest rate levels and volatility of the mortgage markets.
 
Subsidiaries
 
At December 31, 2016, the Company did not have any direct unconsolidated subsidiaries.
 
Total Employees
 
The Company had 101 full-time employees and 9 part-time employees at December 31, 2016. None of these employees are represented by a collective bargaining agent, and the Company believes that it enjoys good relations with its personnel.
Regulation 
 
The regulatory environment for both the Company and the Bank changed significantly on July 21, 2011 in accordance with provisions of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (“Dodd-Frank Act”).  On July 21, 2011, the regulatory responsibilities of the Office of Thrift Supervision (the “OTS”), formerly the primary federal regulator of both the Company and the Bank were transferred to other regulatory agencies. As a Savings and Loan Holding Company, the Company became subject to examination, supervision and extensive regulation by the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland (the “FRB”).  With respect to the Bank, the federal examination responsibilities formerly held by the OTS were transferred to the FDIC.  In addition, federal savings and loan associations are subject to regulations and rules as promulgated by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (the “OCC”). As part of the regulatory transition from the OTS to the FDIC, the Bank was required to transition from the OTS Thrift Financial Report to the Call Report used by the FDIC effective with the March 31, 2012 quarterly filing.
 
As a state-chartered, FDIC-insured institution, the Bank is subject to examination, supervision and extensive regulation by the Ohio Department of Commerce, Division of Financial Institutions (“ODFI”), and the FDIC. The Bank is a member of, and owns stock in, the FHLB of Cincinnati, which is one of the twelve regional banks in the Federal Home Loan Bank System. This regulation and supervision establishes a comprehensive framework of activities in which an institution can engage and is intended primarily for the protection of the insurance fund and depositors. The FDIC and ODFI regularly examine the Bank and prepare reports of examination addressed to the Company’s Board of Directors regarding any deficiencies that they may find in the Company’s operations. The FDIC also may examine the Bank in its role as the administrator of the Deposit Insurance Fund (“DIF”). The Bank’s relationship with its depositors and borrowers also is regulated to a great extent by both federal and state laws especially in such matters as the ownership of savings accounts and the form and content of the Bank’s mortgage documents. Any change in such regulation, whether by the FDIC, ODFI, or Congress, could have a material adverse impact on the Company, the Bank and their operations.
 
Federal Regulation of Savings and Loan Holding Companies
 
In accordance with the provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act, the OTS was abolished on July 21, 2011.  The supervisory responsibilities formerly assigned to the OTS with respect to the Company were transferred to the FRB.  As a unitary thrift holding company, the Company is deemed to be “non-complex” by the FRB.  As a non-complex holding company, the supervision of the Company is largely determined by the 
  23
Index
examination ratings given to the Bank by the FDIC.  As part of the regulatory transition from the OTS to the FRB, the Company transitioned from the OTS reporting formats to the FRB reporting format.

The activities of savings associations are governed by the Home Owners’ Loan Act, as amended (the “HOLA”) and, in certain respects, the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (the “FDI Act”). These federal statutes, among other things, (1) limit the types of loans a savings association may make and (2)  restrict the aggregate amount of loans secured by nonresidential real estate property to 400% of capital. The description of statutory provisions and regulations applicable to savings associations set forth herein does not purport to be a complete description of such statutes and regulations and their effect on the Company or the Bank.
 
The Dodd-Frank Act created a new, independent federal agency, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (“CFPB”), which was granted broad rulemaking, supervisory and enforcement powers under various federal consumer financial protection laws, fair lending laws and certain other statues.
 
The CFPB has examination and enforcement authority with respect to depository institutions with $10 billion or more in assets, their service providers and certain non-depository entities such as debt collectors and consumer reporting agencies. Although the Bank has less than $10 billion in assets, the impact of the formation of the CFPB has caused a ripple effect across all bank regulatory agencies, and placed a renewed focus on consumer protection and compliance efforts. For examples of this new authority, the CFPB has authority to prevent unfair, deceptive or abusive practices in connection with the offering of consumer financial products. The Dodd-Frank Act authorizes the CFPB to establish certain minimum standards for the origination of residential mortgages including a determination of the borrower’s ability to repay. In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act allows borrowers to raise certain defenses to foreclosure if they receive any loan other than a “qualified mortgage” as defined by the CFPB. The Dodd-Frank Act permits states to adopt consumer protection laws and standards that are more stringent than those adopted at the federal level and, in certain circumstances, permits state attorneys general to enforce compliance with both the state and federal laws and regulations.
 
Loans to One Borrower. Under the HOLA, savings institutions are generally subject to the national bank limits on loans to one borrower. Generally, savings institutions may not make a loan or extend credit to a single or related group of borrowers in excess of 15% of the institution’s unimpaired capital and surplus. An additional amount may be lent, equal to 10% of unimpaired capital and surplus, if such loan is secured by readily-marketable collateral, which is defined to include certain securities and bullion, but generally does not include real estate. See “—Lending Activities—Loans to One Borrower.”
Qualified Thrift Lender Test. The HOLA requires savings associations to meet a qualified thrift lender (“QTL”) test. Under the QTL test, a savings association is required to maintain at least 65% of its “portfolio assets” (total assets less (i) specified liquid assets up to 20% of total assets, (ii) intangibles, including goodwill, and (iii) the value of property used to conduct business) in certain “qualified thrift investments,” primarily residential mortgages and related investments, including certain mortgage-backed and related securities on a monthly basis in 9 out of every 12 months.
 
A savings association that fails the QTL test must either convert to a bank charter or operate under certain restrictions. The Dodd-Frank Act made noncompliance with the QTL test subject to enforcement action for a violation of the law. As of December 31, 2016, the Company maintained 68.3% of its portfolio assets in qualified thrift investments and, therefore, met the QTL test.
 
Limitation on Capital Distributions. Regulations impose limitations upon all capital distributions by savings institutions, such as cash dividends, payments to repurchase or otherwise acquire its shares, payments to stockholders of another institution in a cash-out merger and other distributions charged against

capital. A “well-capitalized” institution can, after prior notice and non-objection by the regulatory authorities, make capital distributions during a calendar year in an amount up to 100% of its net income during the calendar year, plus its retained net income for the preceding two years. As of December 31, 2016, the Bank was a “well-capitalized” institution.
Community Reinvestment. Under the Community Reinvestment Act (the “CRA”), as implemented by federal regulations, a savings institution has a continuing and affirmative obligation, consistent with its safe and sound operation, to help meet the credit needs of its entire community, including low and moderate income neighborhoods. The CRA does not establish specific lending requirements or programs for financial institutions, nor does it limit an institution’s discretion to develop the types of products and services that it believes are best suited to its particular community, consistent with the CRA. The CRA requires the FDIC, in connection with its examination of a savings institution, to assess the institution’s record of meeting the credit needs of its community and to take such record into account in its evaluation of certain applications by such institution. The CRA also requires all institutions to make public disclosure of their CRA ratings. The Company received a “satisfactory” CRA rating under the current CRA regulations in its most recently completed performance evaluation received during the first quarter of 2017.
 
Transactions with Related Parties. The Bank’s authority to engage in transactions with related parties or “affiliates” (i.e., any company that controls or is under common control with an institution, including the Company) is limited by Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act (“FRA”). Section 23A limits the aggregate amount of transactions with any individual affiliate to 10% of the capital and surplus of the savings institution and also limits the aggregate amount of transactions with all affiliates to 20% of the savings institution’s capital and surplus. Certain transactions with affiliates are required to be secured by collateral in an amount and of a type described in Section 23A and the purchase of low quality assets from affiliates is generally prohibited. Section 23B provides that certain transactions with affiliates, including loans and asset purchases, must be on terms and under circumstances, including credit standards, that are substantially the same or at least as favorable to the institution as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with non-affiliated companies. In addition, savings institutions are prohibited from lending to any affiliate that is engaged in activities that are not permissible for bank holding companies and no savings institution may purchase the securities of any affiliate other than a subsidiary.
 
The Bank’s authority to extend credit to its directors, executive officers and 10% stockholders, as well as to entities controlled by such persons, is currently governed by the requirements of Sections 22(g) and 22(h) of the Federal Reserve Act and Regulation O of the Federal Reserve Board. Among other things, these provisions generally require that extensions of credit to insiders be made on terms that are substantially the same as, and follow credit underwriting procedures that are not less stringent than, those prevailing for comparable transactions with unaffiliated persons and that do not involve more than the normal risk of repayment or present other unfavorable features. Extensions of credit to insiders also may not exceed certain limitations on the amount of credit extended to such persons, individually and in the aggregate, which limits are based, in part, on the amount of the savings institution’s capital. In addition, extensions of credit in excess of certain limits must be approved by the savings institution’s loan committee or board of directors. Extensions of credit to executive officers are subject to additional limits based on the type of extension involved.
 
Enforcement. Under the FDI Act, the FDIC has primary enforcement responsibility over state-chartered savings institutions and has the authority to bring enforcement action against all “institution-related parties,” including stockholders, and any attorneys, appraisers and accountants who knowingly or recklessly participate in wrongful action likely to have an adverse effect on an insured institution. Formal enforcement action may range from the issuance of a capital directive or cease-and-desist order to removal of officers and/or directors of the institutions, receivership, conservatorship or the termination of deposit insurance. Civil penalties cover a wide range of violations and actions, and range up to $25,000 per day, unless a finding of reckless disregard is made, in which case penalties may be as high as $1 million per day. Criminal penalties for most financial institution crimes include fines of up to $1 million and imprisonment for up to 30 years.

Standards for Safety and Soundness. The federal banking agencies have adopted a final regulation and Interagency Guidelines Prescribing Standards for Safety and Soundness (“Guidelines”) to implement the safety and soundness standards required under the FDI Act. The Guidelines set forth the safety and soundness standards that the federal banking agencies use to identify and address problems at insured depository institutions before capital becomes impaired. The standards set forth in the Guidelines address internal controls and information systems; internal audit system; credit underwriting; loan documentation; interest rate risk exposure; asset growth; and compensation, fees and benefits. If the appropriate federal banking agency determines that an institution fails to meet any standard prescribed by the Guidelines, the agency may require the institution to submit to the agency an acceptable plan to achieve compliance with the standard, as required by the FDI Act. The final regulations establish deadlines for the submission and review of such safety and soundness compliance plans.
Capital Requirements. In July 2013, the bank regulatory agencies issued a final rule that revised the leverage and risk-based capital requirements and methods for calculating risk-weighted assets in accordance with the Basel Committee. The final rule established minimum capital guidelines requiring savings institutions to maintain certain capital ratios: a 4.0% Tier I capital to average assets ratio (leverage ratio), a 4.5% Tier 1 common equity capital (CET1) to risk-weighted assets ratio, a 6.0% Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets ratio, and an 8.0% Total risk-based capital to risk-weighted assets ratio (total capital). Total Capital (risk-based) consists of two types of capital elements: core capital elements (Tier 1) and supplementary capital elements (Tier 2). Tier 1 capital is defined as common stockholders’ equity (including retained earnings), certain non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock and related surplus, minority interests in equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries less intangibles other than certain qualifying supervisory goodwill and certain mortgage servicing rights. The regulations also require that, in meeting the core, leverage and risk-based capital ratios, institutions must deduct investments in and loans to subsidiaries engaged in activities not permissible for a national bank.
 
The components of Tier 2 capital currently include qualifying subordinated debt and redeemable preferred stock, cumulative perpetual preferred stock, allowance for loan and lease losses, and unrealized gains on available-for-sale equity securities. Allowance for loan and lease losses includable in Tier 2 capital is limited to a maximum of 1.25% of total risk-weighted assets. In addition an institution’s risk-weighted assets, including certain off-balance sheet assets, are multiplied by a risk weight assigned by the capital regulations based on the risks which are inherent in the type of asset. The final rule included a one-time “opt-in” or “opt-out” provision to include accumulated other comprehensive income in regulatory capital. Management elected to “opt out” on the March 2015 Call Report remaining consistent with the past reporting.
 
In addition to the minimum CET1, Tier 1 and total capital ratios, the Bank will be required to maintain a capital conservation buffer consisting of additional CETI capital greater than 2.5% of risk-weighted assets above the required minimum levels in order to avoid limitations on paying dividends or paying discretionary bonuses based on percentages of eligible retained income that could be utilized for such actions. This new capital conservation buffer requirement is being phased in beginning in January 2016 at 0.625% of risk-weighted assets and increasing each year until fully implemented in January 2019.
 
Prompt Corrective Regulatory Action
 
Under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action regulations, the FDIC is required to take certain supervisory actions against undercapitalized institutions, the severity of which depends upon the institution’s degree of capitalization. Generally, a savings institution that has total risk-based capital of less than 8.0%,a Tier 1 capital ratio that is less than 4.0%, or a leverage ratio that is less than 4.0% (or less than 3.0% if the institution is rated composite 1 under the CAMELS rating system) is considered to be undercapitalized for 2016. At December 31, 2016 the Bank satisfied all requirements for inclusion in the “well-capitalized” category.

Insurance of Accounts and Regulation by the FDIC
 
The Deposit Insurance Fund of the FDIC insures deposits at insured depository institutions such as the Bank. Deposit accounts in the Bank are insured by the FDIC generally up to a maximum of $250,000 per separately insured depositor.
 
The FDIC has developed a risk-based assessment system providing that the assessment rate for an insured depository institution varies according to the level of risk incurred in its activities. Institutions are classified into one of four risk categories. The FDIC is able to assess higher rates to institutions with a significant reliance on secured liabilities or a significant reliance on brokered deposits but, for well-managed and well-capitalized institutions, only when accompanied by rapid asset growth.
 
Assessments are based on the average consolidated total assets less tangible equity capital of a financial institution. Assessment rates historically ranged from 2.5 to 9 basis points on the broader assessment base for banks in the lowest risk category (“well capitalized” and CAMELS I or II) and up to 30 to 45 basis points for banks in the highest risk category.
 
Effective July 1, 2016, the FDIC changed the way that small banks are assessed for deposit insurance. The FDIC has eliminated the risk categories for banks, such as the Bank, that have been FDIC insured for at least five years and have less than $10 billion in total assets, and assessments are now based on financial measures and supervisory ratings derived from statistical modeling estimating the probability of failure within three years. In conjunction with the Deposit Insurance Fund reserve ratio achieving 1.15%, the assessment range (inclusive of possible adjustments) for established small banks with CAMELS I or II ratings has been reduced to 1.5 to 16 basis points and the maximum assessment rate for established small banks with CAMELS III through V ratings is 30 basis points.
 
The FDIC has authority to increase insurance assessments. Any significant increases would have an adverse effect on the operating expenses and results of operations of the Bank. Management cannot predict what assessment rates will be in the future.
 
The FDIC may terminate the deposit insurance of any insured depository institution, including the Bank, if it determines after a hearing that the institution has engaged or is engaging in unsafe or unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations, or has violated any applicable law, regulation, order or any condition imposed by an agreement with the FDIC. It also may suspend deposit insurance temporarily during the hearing process for the permanent termination of insurance, if the institution has no tangible capital. If insurance of accounts is terminated, the accounts at the institution at the time of the termination, less subsequent withdrawals, shall continue to be insured for a period of six months to two years, as determined by the FDIC. Management is aware of no existing circumstances which would result in termination of the deposit insurance of the Bank.
 
Federal Home Loan Bank System
 The Bank is a member of the FHLB System, which consists of 11 regional FHLBs. The FHLB provides a central credit facility primarily for member institutions. The Bank, as a member of the FHLB, is required to acquire and hold shares of capital stock in that FHLB in an amount at least equal to 1% of the aggregate principal amount of its unpaid residential mortgage loans and similar obligations at the beginning of each year, or 1/20 of its advances (borrowings) from the FHLB, whichever is greater. The Bank was in compliance with this requirement with an investment in FHLB-Cincinnati stock, at December 31, 2016, of $4.2 million. The FHLBs are required to provide funds for the resolution of insolvent thrifts and to contribute funds for affordable housing programs. These requirements could reduce the amount of dividends that the FHLBs pay to their members and could also result in the FHLBs imposing a higher rate of interest on advances to their members. FHLB dividends were 4.0% for the year ended December 31, 2016.

In the event that dividends are reduced, or interest on future FHLB-Cincinnati advances is increased, the Bank’s net interest income will decline.
 
Ohio Regulation
 
As a savings and loan association organized under the laws of the State of Ohio, the Bank is subject to regulation by the ODFI. Regulation by the ODFI affects the Bank’s internal organization as well as its savings, mortgage lending, and other investment activities. Periodic examinations by the ODFI can be conducted on a joint basis with the FDIC but may also be conducted on an alternating basis. The Bank’s most recent examination as of December 31, 2015, was conducted by the ODFI during the quarter ending March 31, 2016. Ohio law requires that the Bank maintain federal deposit insurance as a condition of doing business.
 
Under Ohio law, an Ohio-chartered savings association may buy any obligation representing a loan that would be a legal loan if originated by the Bank, subject to various requirements including: loans secured by liens on income-producing real estate may not exceed 20% of an association’s assets; consumer loans, commercial paper, and corporate debt securities may not exceed 20% of an association’s assets; loans for commercial, corporate, business, or agricultural purposes may not exceed 30% of an association’s assets, provided that an association’s required reserve must increase proportionately; certain other types of loans may be made for lesser percentages of the association’s assets; and, with certain limitations and exceptions, certain additional loans may be made if not in excess of 3% of the association’s total assets. In addition, no association may make real estate acquisition and development loans for primarily residential use to one borrower in excess of 2% of assets. The total investments in commercial paper or corporate debt of any issuer cannot exceed 1% of an association’s assets, with certain exceptions.
 
Ohio law authorizes Ohio-chartered savings associations to, among other things: (i) invest up to 15% of assets in the capital stock, obligations, and other securities of service corporations organized under the laws of Ohio, and an additional 20% of net worth may be invested in loans to majority-owned service corporations; (ii) invest up to 10% of assets in corporate equity securities, bonds, debentures, notes, or other evidence of indebtedness; (iii) exceed limits otherwise applicable to certain types of investments (other than investments in service corporations) by and between 3% and 10% of assets, depending upon the level of the institution’s permanent stock, general reserves, surplus, and undivided profits; and (iv) invest up to 15% of assets in any loans or investments not otherwise specifically authorized or prohibited, subject to authorization by the institution’s board of directors.
 
An Ohio-chartered savings association may invest in such real property or interests therein as its board of directors deems necessary or convenient for the conduct of the business of the association, but the amount so invested may not exceed the net worth of the association at the time the investment is made. Additionally, an association may invest an amount equal to 10% of its assets in any other real estate. This limitation does not apply, however, to real estate acquired by foreclosure, conveyance in lieu of foreclosure, or other legal proceedings in relation to loan security interests.
 
Notwithstanding the above powers authorized under Ohio law and regulation, a state-chartered savings association, such as the Bank, is subject to certain limitations on its permitted activities and investments under federal law, which may restrict the ability of an Ohio-chartered association to engage in activities and make investments otherwise authorized under Ohio law.
 
Ohio has adopted statutory limitations on the acquisition of control of an Ohio savings and loan association by requiring the written approval of the ODFI prior to the acquisition by any person or company, as defined under the Ohio Revised Code, of a controlling interest in an Ohio-chartered savings association. Control exists, for purposes of Ohio law, when any person or company, either directly, indirectly, or acting in concert with one or more other persons or companies (a) acquires 15% of any class of voting stock, irrevocable proxies, or any combination thereof, (b) directs the election of a majority of directors, (c) 
  28
Index
becomes the general partner of the savings and loan association, (d) has influence over the management and policies of the savings and loan association, (e) has the ability to direct shareholder votes, or (f) anything else deemed to be control by the ODFI. The ODFI’s written permission is required when the total amount of control held by the acquiror was less than or equal to 25% control before the acquisition and more than 25% control after the acquisition, or when the total amount of control held by the acquiror was less than 50% before the acquisition and more than 50% after the acquisition. Ohio law also prescribes other situations in which the ODFI must be notified of the acquisition even though prior approval is not required. Any person or company, which would include a director, will not be deemed to be in control by virtue of an annual solicitation of proxies voted as directed by a majority of the board of directors.
 
Under certain circumstances, interstate mergers and acquisitions involving associations incorporated under Ohio law are permitted by Ohio law. A savings and loan association or savings and loan holding company with its principal place of business in another state may acquire a savings and loan association or savings and loan holding company incorporated under Ohio law if the laws of such other state permit an Ohio savings and loan association or an Ohio holding company reciprocal rights. Additionally, legislation permits interstate branching by savings and loan associations incorporated under Ohio law.
 
Ohio law requires prior written approval of the ODFI for a merger of an Ohio-chartered savings association with another savings and loan association or a holding company affiliate.
 
Holding Company Regulation
 
Holding Company Acquisitions. The Company is a registered savings and loan holding company within the meaning of Section 10 of the HOLA, and is subject to FRB examination and supervision as well as certain reporting requirements. Federal law generally prohibits a savings and loan holding company, without prior FRB approval, from acquiring the ownership or control of any other savings institution or savings and loan holding company, or all, or substantially all, of the assets or more than 5% of the voting shares thereof. These provisions also prohibit, among other things, any director or officer of a savings and loan holding company, or any individual who owns or controls more than 25% of the voting shares of such holding company, from acquiring control of any savings institution not a subsidiary of such savings and loan holding company, unless the acquisition is approved by the FRB.
Holding Company Activities. The Company operates as a unitary savings and loan holding company. The activities of the Company and its non-savings institution subsidiaries are restricted to activities traditionally permitted to multiple savings and loan holding companies and to financial holding companies under provisions of the Bank Holding Company Act. Multiple savings and loan holding companies may:

· | furnish or perform management services for a savings association subsidiary of a savings and loan holding company;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | hold, manage or liquidate assets owned or acquired from a savings association subsidiary of a savings and loan holding company;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | hold or manage properties used or occupied by a savings association subsidiary of a savings and loan holding company;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | engage in activities determined by the Federal Reserve to be closely related to banking and a proper incident thereto; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | engage in services and activities previously determined by the Federal Home Loan Bank Board by regulation to be permissible for a multiple savings and loan holding company as of March 5, 1987.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
29
Index
The activities financial holding companies may engage in include:
 

· | lending, exchanging, transferring or investing for others, or safeguarding money or securities;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | insuring, guaranteeing or indemnifying others, issuing annuities, and acting as principal, agent or broker for purposes of the foregoing;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | providing financial, investment or economic advisory services, including advising an investment company;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | issuing or selling interests in pooled assets that a bank could hold directly;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | underwriting, dealing in or making a market in securities; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------


· | merchant banking activities.
--+-----------------------------

 
If the regulator determines that there is reasonable cause to believe that the continuation by a savings and loan holding company of an activity constitutes a serious risk to the financial safety, soundness or stability of its subsidiary savings institution, the regulator may impose such restrictions as deemed necessary to address such risk. These restrictions include limiting the following:
 

· | the payment of dividends by the savings institution;
--+-----------------------------------------------------


· | transactions between the savings institution and its affiliates; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------


· | any activities of the savings institution that might create a serious risk that the liabilities of the holding company and its affiliates may be imposed on the savings institution.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Federal Securities Laws. The Company registered its common stock with the Securities and Exchange Commission under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (“Exchange Act”). The Company is subject to the proxy and tender offer rules, insider trading reporting requirements and restrictions, and certain other requirements under the Exchange Act. Since the passage of the Highway Transportation bill in December 2015, savings and loan holding companies are now permitted to delist if they have less than 1,200 shareholders.
Federal and State Taxation
 
Federal Taxation. Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method which requires recognition of deferred tax liabilities and assets for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements or tax returns. Under this method deferred tax liabilities and assets are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse.
 
Retained earnings as of December 31, 2016 include approximately $2.7 million for which no provision for Federal income tax has been made. This reserve (base year and supplemental) is frozen/not forgiven as certain events could trigger a recapture such as stock redemption or distributions to shareholders in excess of current or accumulated earnings and profits.
 
The Company’s federal income tax returns through December 31, 2011 have been closed by statute or examination.
 
Ohio Taxation. Effective in 2014, the Corporation and the Bank began remitting the Financial Institutions Tax (“FIT”) as a replacement for the Ohio Franchise Tax, which the Bank had filed through 2013. The amount of the “FIT” is 0.8%, based on total equity capital, compared to the Franchise Tax of 1.3% of taxable net worth. The Bank is not currently under audit with respect to its Ohio franchise tax returns.

Delaware Taxation. As a Delaware holding company not earning income in Delaware, the Company is exempt from Delaware corporate income tax but is required to file an annual report with and pay an annual franchise tax to the State of Delaware. The tax is imposed as a percentage of the capital base of the Company with an annual maximum of $180,000. The Company paid Delaware franchise taxes of $34,000 for the year ended December 31, 2016.
