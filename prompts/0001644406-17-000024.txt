ITEM 1. Business
Company Overview
Hostess® has been an iconic American brand for generations. We offer a variety of new and classic treats under the Hostess® brand including Twinkies®, Cupcakes, Ding Dongs®, Ho Hos®, Donettes®, and Zingers® among others. In April 2013, we acquired the Hostess® and Dolly Madison® brands out of the bankruptcy liquidation proceedings of its prior owners, free and clear of all prior liabilities, contracts, deferred taxes and other “legacy” issues. After a brief hiatus in production, we began providing Hostess products to retailer partners and consumers nationwide in July 2013. By combining Hostess’ strong reputation with innovative technology and a Direct-To-Warehouse (“DTW”) business model, we rapidly recaptured market share. In nearly four years, we have invested approximately $160 million to upgrade our manufacturing footprint, implement new IT systems and enhance production efficiency through the installation of automated baking and packaging lines. These investments, combined with our DTW distribution model, have reestablished Hostess’ leading, premium brand position in the $6.5 billion U.S. Sweet Baked Goods (“SBG”) category¹ and have increased our distribution channels and paved new growth opportunities for the Company. 
Our DTW distribution model uses centralized distribution centers and common carriers to fill orders, with products generally delivered to our customers’ warehouses. This model has eliminated the need for Direct-Store-Delivery (“DSD”) routes and drivers which has allowed us to expand our core distribution while gaining access to new channels (e.g., further penetration into convenience, drug store, dollar, foodservice, and cash & carry). We have both renewed and added relationships with trusted retailers around the country. 
As a highly fragmented category in both the United States and internationally, SBG represents a significant opportunity for further consolidation. Our business model and efficient DTW route-to-market strategy, along with highly sophisticated and modern systems, provide an ideal platform for adding other branded snacks to our portfolio. We maintain a highly-disciplined outlook on acquisitions, focusing on opportunities with large addressable markets. In addition, we believe our expertise in managing brands (led by our Executive Chairman, Dean Metropoulos) and experience in operating packaged food businesses (under the leadership of our President and Chief Executive Officer, Bill Toler) gives us the specialized tools to position the Company as an attractive vehicle for future growth within the snacking universe.
We have been actively investing in new product development and pursuing acquisitions to further leverage our strong brand and to expand into new categories and markets to drive incremental growth. In April 2015, we launched Hostess® branded bread and buns to capitalize on the strength of our brand and to expand our product assortment in the small format channels, including convenience and drug channels.
In May 2016, we purchased 100% of the stock of Superior Cake Products, Inc. (“Superior”), to expand into the in-store bakery (“ISB”) section of grocery and club retailers. Retailers are increasingly utilizing in-store bakery goods to provide a differentiated shopping experience and to showcase product offerings. Superior manufactures eclairs, madeleines, brownies, and iced cookies, and also offers preservative-free and gluten-free products. We believe there is growth potential by expanding Hostess® product offerings within the ISB section of grocery and club retailers.

¹Historically, we utilized Nielsen’s Total Universe data via the Nitro platform to gather U.S. retail sales and to measure our market share. In December 2016, we upgraded from Nielsen’s Nitro platform to Answers on Demand (“AOD”). Under AOD, certain products that were previously categorized as SBG in the Nitro platform database are now reported in the In-Store Bakery (“ISB”) category under the AOD platform. This change has resulted in lower total U.S. SBG category retail sales which were previously reported at $6.8 billion and is now reported at $6.5 billion. In addition, this switch has also resulted in certain Hostess items (primarily seasonal) being included in the overall results and our share of the market that previously were not part of the underlying data set.
As a result of these changes, our respective market share percentages previously reported have all been retroactively restated in this Annual Report on Form 10-K to reflect measurements from the AOD platform. In certain instances, our share of the market may appear to be higher than previously reported due to the change in the baseline (for example, lower total SBG retail sales).
These restatements are indicated by an asterisk (*) throughout this section, Item 1, Business, of the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K.

The Industry Where Hostess Operates: Large and Attractive
Snacking is ubiquitous in the U.S. and continues to grow.
Nearly all U.S. consumers eat snacks at least once per day. According to Information Resources, Inc. (“IRI”), the average number of snacks consumed per person per day in the United States increased over 40%, from 1.9 to 2.7 between 2010 and 2015. The U.S. SBG category is one of the largest categories within the broader $110 billion U.S. snacking universe, with estimated retail sales of $6.5 billion in 2016 according to Nielsen* U.S. total universe for the 52 weeks ended December 31, 2016. The SBG category includes breakfast items (e.g., donuts, breakfast danishes, and muffins) and all-day snacking items (e.g., snack cakes, pies, bars, brownies, blondies, and cookies). According to The Nielsen Company, the Sweet Snacks category (Candy, Cookies, SBG) accounted for 50.4% of the Total Snacks category dollars, and is growing at 1.3% compared to Total Food & Beverage sales growth of 0.1% in 2016 vs the prior year. Hostess’ product offerings within the SBG category are characterized by highly impulse-driven purchase decisions, low price elasticity, and continued appeal across economic cycles. Hostess’ products benefit from increased snacking frequency driven by today’s busy lifestyles. According to IRI’s snacking survey, over 90% of consumers state that taste is important when looking for snacks, and Hostess is one of the leading providers of delectable and satisfying snack cakes in America. According to IRI’s 2016 “State of the Snack Food Industry” report, retail dollar sales of indulgent snacks in the U.S. grew 3.4% year over year, in-line with growth of the broader core snacks category and faster than the total retail food & beverage industry (2.9%). In fact, according to IRI, Hostess’ products participate in some of the fastest growing industry segments, such as Bakery Snacks (6.9% 2015 over 2014 growth) and donuts / pastries (6.7% 2015 over 2014 growth).
Hostess is a category and segment leader.
Hostess® is the second leading brand by market share within SBG. For the 52-week period ended December 31, 2016 our market share was 16.7% per Nielsen’s* U.S. SBG category data. We have a #1 leading market position within the two largest SBG Segments; Donut Segment and Snack Cake Segment, and have a #2 leading market position in total Sweet Baked Goods, according to Nielsen* U.S. total universe for the 52 weeks ended December 31, 2016. The Donut and Snack Cake Segments together account for 49% of the SBG categories’ total dollar sales. We believe that our importance to the SBG category is clearly evident through the sales decline the category experienced while Hostess® products were off store shelves. The U.S. SBG category contracted 8% during our hiatus, but subsequently grew to a 14% increase-a 22% point swing-during the 52 weeks ended December 31, 2016 period following our return. We have accounted for 72% of the category’s growth from the 52 weeks ending July 31, 2013 to the 52 weeks ending December 31, 2016. We account for 100.5% of the category’s growth in the latest 52 weeks ending December 31, 2016* vs the prior year. All other brands contributed (0.5)% vs. one year ago.

Competitive landscape.
Hostess® is #2 in the U.S. SBG category. The top three brands account for 59% of the SBG retail sales according to Nielsen1, while the rest of the category remains fairly fragmented. With limited private label penetration within the category (4% market share1 vs. 18%1 for overall packaged food), consumers have shown a strong preference for trusted brands within the SBG category. The leading positions are solidified through extensive product portfolios, strong brand awareness, established distribution capabilities and long-standing relationships with critical high-volume retailers. Furthermore, high levels of capital investment are required to establish manufacturing and distribution capabilities of meaningful scale, providing additional barriers to entry. 
Consumers favor on-the-go breakfast consumption.
Over 50% of the $6.5 billion SBG category is the breakfast sub-category, consisting of donuts ($1.5 billion), breakfast sweet goods ($1.3 billion) and muffins ($479 million) according to Nielsen* U.S. total universe for the 52 weeks ended December 31, 2016. Convenience and brand preference continue to influence snack selection, as over half of U.S. consumers rate portability as a key attribute in breakfast items as according to Mintel. These consumption trends play to our strengths as our products conveniently come packaged in both single-serve and multipack varieties. In addition, we have launched a line of Hostess whole grain mini muffins, jumbo muffins, danishes, and glazed donuts, which have been well-received as new breakfast offerings.

Our Competitive Strengths
Leading brands synonymous with American snacking.
We believe that we have maintained our brand power and category awareness for nearly a century by satisfying consumers’ need for fun, light-hearted treats. We believe our portfolio of highly recognized products is synonymous with American snacking, and there is perhaps no better indicator of this than our 90%+ brand awareness, according to a Harman Atchison study in 2014. We believe that we have established our leadership position in the SBG segment through the strength and quality of our products, developing and promoting a brand that unites our loyal consumer base and by pricing our products at a reasonable premium to other snacking alternatives.
We take great pride in baking an assortment of classic American treats such as Twinkies®, Donettes®, Cupcakes, Sno Balls ®, Ding Dongs ®, Zingers ®, Ho Hos ® and Suzy Qs ®. Each brand has established its own identity and fan base, with brands appearing in movies, TV shows and other pop culture venues. We believe the Hostess brand is perceived as fun, dynamic, innovative and part of American popular culture. Our most famous brand, Twinkies ®, continues to gain visibility as a cultural icon including through successful campaigns around movie releases including X-Men, The Minions and the 2016 summer movie release, Ghostbusters. We currently have over 1.1 million Facebook fans and approximately 92,800 Twitter followers as well as prominent visibility on YouTube and Instagram. 
Strong position at retailers.
We believe consumers and retailers alike recognize Hostess, and our breadth of products, as a leading brand and umbrella for the whole category. Our broad product portfolio offers the unique opportunity to expand shelf space, particularly in newly obtained and newly accessible channels. While Old Hostess was limited by its DSD model, we have been able to leverage the DTW model to expand our core distribution while gaining access to other whitespace channels (i.e., certain convenience, drug, dollar, foodservice, and cash & carry). As a result, we have both renewed and added relationships with trusted retailers around the country, once again stocking shelves with our products. We believe that our DTW model, along with the strength of our premium positioning, allows us to offer retailers attractive margins that incentivize further distribution of our products.
The New Hostess is an innovation engine.
When we relaunched Hostess, we set out to challenge the status quo business model of our competitors. We established our innovative DTW distribution model and heavily invested in machinery and equipment at our bakeries, which has resulted in energy, labor and time savings, along with the ability to achieve efficiently made quality products. These investments paved the way for new product innovation. Unlike Old Hostess, whose DSD model required new products to be manufactured on various lines in multiple facilities in order to facilitate distribution across the country, we can now leverage our existing infrastructure and produce new products on one line in one facility. Centralized production allows us to continually innovate and bring new products to market while not disrupting the production of our existing product portfolio.
We are devoted to maintaining our iconic brands while contemporizing in order to stay relevant with consumers into the future. We believe that to support our premium position, we must continually evolve with changing consumer preferences and trends. As such, we have created an infrastructure that allows us to remain flexible. Our new pre-built, retail-ready corrugated displays allow retailers to take full or partial pallets of product through our warehouses and have them ready for display. We continue to develop new flavors and platforms, and have a robust innovation pipeline that expands the Hostess brand across categories. Recent product launches include whole grain mini muffins, Suzy Qs® snack cakes (a product re-launch), and Hostess Sweet Shop™ brownies. In August 2016, we launched a line of Deep Fried Twinkies® in the freezer aisle. Collectively, we believe our product launches have been successful and augmented our top line growth. Product launches in 2016 have resulted in pro forma combined net revenue of $44.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. In addition, the recent acquisition of Superior provides us a presence in the ISB category. Net revenue for Superior was $26.7 million for the period from the acquisition date of May 10, 2016 through December 31, 2016, and accounted for 4% of our pro forma combined net revenue for 2016.

DTW Distribution Model.
We believe our DTW distribution model has created a substantial whitespace opportunity, which is one of the key drivers that we expect to fuel our future growth. We have greater access to convenience, drug and dollar stores. Distributing to these channels under a DSD model can be inefficient due to small average drop size. Similarly, we have an opportunity to continue building distribution in the drug store channel after having successfully established a strong presence. Historically, DSD snack cake companies have competed with candy and tobacco distributors; however, our DTW model has enabled us to partner with these third-party distributors who can profitably penetrate both the convenience store and drug store channels and who are looking for opportunities to gain share in the SBG category. For 2016, convenience and drug stores accounted for 34.4% of pro forma combined net revenues. We have established a strong presence and market share in the drug store channel and are focused on continuously expanding coverage of convenience stores. These partnerships further expand our distribution reach in a highly efficient manner and we believe they will add to our growth potential going forward.
Highly efficient and profitable business model.
The DTW distribution model is a significant change from Old Hostess’ DSD system, which utilized company owned trucks and company employed union drivers to serve over 5,500 routes. Today all transportation and shipping is done through third-parties to warehouse locations. Transportation and distribution costs as a percentage of net sales have been reduced by nearly 1800 basis points, historically ~34% and now running ~16% of net revenue.² We are investing heavily in automation, which allows for improved product quality, consistency and efficiency. However, the benefits of our industry redefining model are felt even after our products leave the bakery. By shipping products using prebuilt, shippable display cases through our DTW network, we believe we now offer retailers an enhanced merchandising asset and the ability to execute nationwide marketing campaigns with retail-ready displays placed in stores across the country all on the same day. Given the impulse driven nature of the category, in-store displays are a key differentiator in driving sales velocities.
Our new business model is supported by cost-advantaged manufacturing and distribution, expanded channel / retail store reach, enhanced in-store merchandising capabilities, and offers retailers attractive margins that incentivize further distribution of our products.
² Based on internal data, transportation and delivery costs include freight, brokerage, bracket and pickup allowance, distribution centers and stock transport order costs. Net revenue may not be directly comparable due to differences in pricing structure and levels at the Company compared to Old Hostess.

Experienced team with an entrepreneurial spirit.
We believe our Company culture is an integral part of our strategy, built on entrepreneurship, innovation, collaboration and a competitive spirit. Embodying these tenets is a strong and experienced management team, led by our CEO, Bill Toler, and our Executive Chairman, Dean Metropoulos. Bill Toler has over 30 years of industry experience and previously served as CEO of AdvancePierre Foods. Dean Metropoulos has been involved in many successful transactions involving brands such as Chef Boyardee, Duncan Hines, Ghirardelli Chocolate, Bumble Bee Tuna, Pabst Blue Ribbon, Premier Foods (the biggest UK food company), and Mumm and Perrier Jouet Champagnes. Dean Metropoulos has over 30 years of experience revamping iconic brands throughout the consumer space. In addition, we believe we have a strong supporting cast of senior leaders working in tandem with our management team. Key team members have on average over 19 years of industry experience and expertise across all business functions.
Our management team is complimented by an experienced Board of Directors, of which all have senior executive leadership and bring with them extensive consumer products knowledge. Our board members include: 

• | Dean Metropolous


• | Andrew Jhawar


• | Mark R. Stone


• | Laurence Bodner


• | Neil P. DeFeo


• | Jerry D. Kaminski


• | Craig D. Steeneck

Our Growth Strategy
Our strategy is to be the premium sweet baked goods market leader in the United States by driving industry leading growth that outpaces our SBG peers.  This growth will be driven by rebuilding the core business, innovation and line extensions and taking advantage of whitespace opportunities.
Rebuilding the Core Business.
We plan to capitalize on the strength of the Hostess brand, positive market trends, and our attractive retailer economics in order to generate new customers and increase the number of stores carrying our products. Unlike Old Hostess, we now have the ability to unlock the potential afforded by the extended reach of warehouse distribution. Continued distribution and market share gains are expected to come from traditional channels (“core expansion”), with the remainder expected to come from untapped or under-developed whitespace channels (“whitespace opportunity”).
Our master brand strategy, combined with investments in highly effective marketing and brand-building, has resulted in what we believe to be one of the strongest brand equities in snacking.
While we have re-established and grown Hostess’ presence throughout the traditional channels in which Old Hostess previously operated, there remains further opportunity to close the gap in market share relative to Old Hostess’ penetration. By expanding points of distribution, increasing SKU assortments and recapturing shelf space in existing retailers, we plan to continue our sales growth. Our top three products (Donettes®, Twinkies® and Cupcakes) have All Commodity Volume (“ACV”) distribution rates in core channels that are 25% to 50% (based on Nielsen* 52 weeks ending December 31, 2016) higher than the average rate achieved by other products in our portfolio. These high levels are directly correlated to the focused approach we implemented on these three products during the relaunch. By applying this tailored and focused approach to our other existing product lines, we will work with retailers to expand the average number of SKUs offered and attempt to materially reduce this gap. The average number of products selling at core retailers today is approximately 22 and we have a number of retailers that have substantially larger shelf sets than the average.

One area of focus is the previously under-served channel of independent convenience stores and small grocery stores. Similarly, we have an opportunity to continue to build distribution in the drug store and club channels. Importantly, the DTW model enables us to partner with third party distributors (e.g., McLane, Core-Mark) who can profitably penetrate both the convenience and drug store channels and who are looking for opportunities to gain share in the SBG category. Our transition to DTW has created a significant opportunity for distributors to enter the SBG category and partnerships with leading distributors are expected to add materially to our growth going forward.
We believe that impulse purchase decisions are another fundamental driver of retail sales in the SBG category, which makes prominent in-store placement an essential growth lever. The DTW model provides us with a competitive advantage through the ability to utilize retail-ready corrugated displays. These pre-built displays are visually impactful, produced economically, and require minimal in-store labor to assemble or load, thus providing cost-efficient display vehicles that benefit both the retailer and us alike. Preloaded displays also allow us full control over our brand marketing, which allows us to execute retailer-wide campaigns regionally or nationally in a consistent manner, providing a unique competitive advantage across the entire SBG category, which is predominantly DSD-served.
Innovation and Line Extensions.
We understand the need to continually evolve while maintaining the tradition and offerings our loyal consumer base has come to know and love. We have been actively investing in new product development and building our long-term pipeline, leveraging our innovation pipeline and commercialization process to bring new products to market in a timely fashion. Our product innovation strategy is organized around four key objectives:

• | Complementing our existing product offering by launching classic products not yet launched or entirely new products in SBG sub-segments where we currently do not compete;


• | Launching line extensions to drive sub-brand reach;


• | Unlocking new consumer segments with new benefits and / or occasions; and


• | Expanding into new categories and markets to drive highly incremental growth.

New product innovation is designed to further leverage our brand equity with consumers, while also further penetrating retailers’ shelves. For example, in 2015 we developed a portfolio of bread products under the Hostess label. The Hostess bread launch was designed for small format channels, (e.g., convenience, drug and dollar) that often cannot get full or consistent service and pricing across their total retail footprint from independent DSD drivers. With extended shelf life (“ESL”) bread via DTW, we can now provide a consistent branded solution to bread service and pricing. In just one year after launch, we have grown our bread share of total combined convenience and drug store channels to 21%, making us the number one selling bread brand, behind private label, in these combined channels for the 52 weeks ended December 31, 2016. 
We continue to research “better-for-you” concepts, while being true to the indulgent nature of our products. We are exploring opportunities to remove certain negatives (e.g., partially hydrogenated oils, artificial flavors and colors) in our products while increasing the positive nutritional elements. In 2016, we launched Hostess® Mini Muffins with Whole Grain as a differentiator within the category.
Whitespace opportunity.
Our warehouse distribution model has created the potential for us to profitably distribute our products with a significantly further reach than Old Hostess. We are penetrating the grocery channel with our Frozen Retail business, supported by our Deep Fried Twinkies ® and licensing arrangements. We will seek to grow our business within food service through a relationship with a national distributor. We have products that are now packaged for sale in Mexico, the United Kingdom and Canada. Our products are also sold on various e-commerce platforms. 
In May 2016, we acquired Superior in order to expand our market and product offerings in the In-Store Bakery (ISB) section of the grocery and club retailers. Retailers are increasingly utilizing in-store bakery goods to provide a differentiated shopping experience and to showcase product offerings. Superior manufactures eclairs, madeleines, brownies, and iced cookies, and also offers preservative free and gluten free products. We believe there is also a strong growth potential by expanding Superior’s product offerings within the ISB section of grocery and club retailers.
10

Platform for future acquisitions.
We believe we serve as a platform for growth within the broader branded snacking universe. Within the highly fragmented SBG category, there exists the opportunity to drive value creation through acquisitions by leveraging our platform, infrastructure and performance driven management culture. Our highly skilled and seasoned leadership is committed to seeking-out opportunities that add new capabilities and product attributes (e.g., Better-for-you) to our already broad offerings. Our experienced management includes several individuals with a proven track-record of successfully managing and acquiring consumer businesses. We believe our scale, access to capital and management experience will allow us to consider both small and large acquisitions in the future and to integrate them in a seamless fashion.

Production
We produce Hostess® and Dolly Madison® products at three baking facilities located in Emporia, Kansas; Columbus, Georgia; and Indianapolis, Indiana. Superior products are produced at two baking facilities located in Southbridge, Massachusetts. We have invested heavily in baking and packaging technology to improve productivity and efficiency, including installing two Autobake systems and a fully-automated packaging system. A portion of our products are co-manufactured and packaged under our brands and sold through our distribution facilities. 
Our state of the art Autobake technologies have resulted in significant energy, labor and time savings. The technology provides fully-automated industrial baking ovens and systems, combining cost efficient, compact and continuous baking solutions that can be custom configured. The first Autobake, which exclusively produces Twinkies ®, was installed in Emporia, Kansas in July 2014. Its capabilities include equipment that fully-automates the packaging process (from wrapping to palletizing). We installed the second Autobake in Emporia in March 2015, which exclusively produces cupcakes. 
We currently anticipate investing $30 million to $40 million during 2017 in support of consolidation of production lines, expanding capacity and expanding our flavor portfolio. 
Raw Materials
Our principal raw materials are flour, sweeteners, edible oils and compound coating, as well as corrugate and films used to package our products. We utilize various buying strategies to lock in prices for various raw materials and packaging to reduce the impact of commodity price fluctuations.
In addition, we are dependent on natural gas as fuel for firing our ovens. Our third-party common carriers use gasoline and diesel as fuel for their trucks.
11

We have strategic, long-term relationships with our key suppliers for our raw materials and packaging that help leverage our buying power. While the cost of some raw materials has, and may continue to, increase or decrease over time, we believe that we will be able to purchase an adequate supply of raw materials as needed. We also sole source certain raw materials. In addition, we have multiple vendors that meet the Company’s supply requirements with the sole sourced materials, except in the case of the enzymes used in our ESL technology. With respect to the enzymes, we are in the process of confirming a secondary vendor to maintain business and flexibility. 
Distribution
We utilize a DTW distribution system, using centralized distribution centers and common carriers. From our five baking facilities, products are shipped to three distribution centers located in Shorewood, Illinois, Carthage, Missouri and Worcester, Massachusetts. Each distribution center is owned and operated by third parties. The distribution centers are able to fill customer orders and reduce inventory on hand as a result of this centralized consolidation of inventory. Products are delivered to customers’ warehouses from the distribution centers using common carriers. A small number of our customers pick up their orders directly from our distribution centers.
     The DTW model is enabled by our ESL technology. Some of our products are shipped frozen at the request of certain retailers. As a result of our DTW model, we do not keep a significant backlog of finished goods inventory, as our fresh bakery products are promptly shipped to our distribution centers after being produced.
Customers
Our top 10 customers in 2016 accounted for 60.6% of total pro forma combined net revenue. During 2016, our largest customer, Wal-Mart, represented 21.1% of our pro forma combined net revenue. No other customer accounted for more than 10% of our pro forma combined net revenue in 2016. The loss of, or a material negative change in, our relationship with Wal-Mart or any of our other top 10 customers could have a material adverse effect on our business. Our customers include mass merchandisers, supermarkets and other retailers, distributors, convenience, drug and dollar stores.
Competition
We face competition from other brands, large national bakeries, smaller regional operators, supermarket chains with their own private label brands, and grocery stores with their own in-store bakery departments. The key competitive factors in the industry include product quality, price, customer service, brand recognition and loyalty, promotional activities, access to retail outlets, sufficient shelf-space and ability to identify and satisfy consumer preferences. Some of our largest national competitors include Flowers Foods, Inc., Group Bimbo, S.A. and McKee Foods Corporation. In addition, we also compete with regional sweet goods branded manufacturers and other companies, including in the ISB space, that produce cookies, candies and other sweet snacks. At times, we experience pricing pressure in certain of our markets from competitor promotions and other pricing practices. However, we believe our brand recognition, product quality and innovation have generated consumer loyalty to many of our products help mitigate this impact.
Trademarks and Other Intellectual Property
We believe that our intellectual property has substantial value and has contributed to the success of our business. In particular, our trademarks, including our registered Hostess® and Dolly Madison® brand trademarks and our sub-brand trademarks, including Twinkies®, Ding Dongs®, Ho Hos®, Zingers®, Sno Balls®, and Donettes®, are valuable assets that we believe reinforces our consumers’ favorable perception of our products.
From time to time, third parties have used names similar to ours, have applied to register trademarks similar to ours and, we believe, have infringed or misappropriated our intellectual property rights. Third parties have also, from time to time, opposed our trademarks and challenged our intellectual property rights. We respond to these actions on a case-by-case basis.
We rely on laws and regulations, as well as contractual restrictions, to protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights.
12

Government Regulation 
Our operations, including the manufacturing, processing, formulating, packaging, labeling and advertising of products, are subject to regulation by various federal agencies, including the Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”), the Federal Trade Commission (the “FTC”), and the Environmental Protection Agency (the “EPA”). Our products are subject to various local, state, and federal laws, regulations and administrative practices affecting our business. We must comply with provisions regulating registrations and licensing, health and sanitation standards, current Good Manufacturing Practices and traceability, food labeling, equal employment, wage and hour requirements, and environmental protection, among others. We take compliance and the safety of our products seriously and take all steps that we consider necessary or appropriate to comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations. 
Food. The FDA has comprehensive authority to regulate the safety of food and food ingredients (other than meat and poultry products), as well as dietary supplements. Food additives and food contact substances are subject to pre-market approvals or notification requirements. The FDA’s overall food safety authority was dramatically enhanced in 2011 with the passage of the Food Safety Modernization Act (“FSMA”). FSMA required the FDA to issue regulations mandating hazard analyses and risk-based preventive controls for most food producers, implementation of science-based minimum standards for the safe growing, harvesting, packing, and holding of fruits and vegetables, development and implementation of hazard analyses and risk-based controls for ingredients and food products being imported, with adequate documentation to support the foreign facilities’ processes, and institution of procedures for the sanitary transportation of food and food products. To date, all of FSMA final rules have been implemented, with compliance dates for the hazard analysis final rule for human food already in effect. The broad authority to regulate food applies to domestic food facilities and, by way of imported food supplier verification requirements, to foreign facilities that supply food products to the U.S. market. In addition, FSMA requires the FDA to identify “high risk” foods and “high risk” facilities, and instructs the FDA to set goals for the frequency of FDA inspections of such facilities. Goals for inspection are also required for non-high risk facilities and foreign facilities from which food is imported into the United States. Though guidance for these programs is still under development, the FSMA has had a significant impact on the food industry in the past five years. We continue to develop our internal processes and procedures to comply with the FSMA requirements and ensure we are in line with industry practices.
For example, FSMA meaningfully augments the FDA’s ability to access foreign and domestic producers’ records and suppliers’ records. FSMA gives the FDA authority to require food producers, distributors, and sellers to recall adulterated or misbranded food if the FDA determines that there is a reasonable probability that the food will cause serious adverse health consequences to persons or animals. Additionally, the FSMA increases the FDA’s authority to institute administrative detentions of adulterated and misbranded foods. The FSMA also results in enhanced tracking and tracing of food requirements and, as a result, increases discipline of recordkeeping for our suppliers and contract manufacturers.
The FDA also exercises broad jurisdiction over the labeling and promotion of food. Labeling is a broad concept that, under certain circumstances, extends to product-related claims and representations made on a company’s website or similar printed or graphic medium. All foods must bear labeling that provides consumers with essential information with respect to ingredients and allergens, product weight, manufacturer/distributor location, etc. In May 2016, the FDA issued a Final Rule revising the nutrition and supplement facts panel (the “NFP” and “SFP” respectively) requirements on food products, as well as a related final rule updating serving sizes customarily consumed. Importantly for our products, one substantial new requirement is the inclusion of “Added Sugars” amounts within the NFP. The compliance date for the updated NFP labeling is May 2018. 
FDA Enforcement. The FDA has broad authority to enforce the provisions of the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (the “FDCA”) applicable to the safety, labeling, manufacturing, distribution, and promotion of foods, including powers to issue a public warning letter to a company, publicize information about illegal products, institute an administrative detention of food, request or order a recall of illegal products from the market, and request the Department of Justice to initiate a seizure action, an injunction action, or a criminal prosecution in the U.S. courts. Pursuant to FSMA, the FDA also has the power to refuse the import of any food from a foreign supplier that is not appropriately verified as in compliance with all FDA laws and regulations. Moreover, the FDA has the authority to administratively suspend the registration of any facility producing food deemed to present a reasonable probability of causing serious adverse health consequences.

Food Advertising. Since 1954, the FTC and the FDA have operated under a Memorandum of Understanding (“the MOU”) under which the FTC has assumed primary responsibility for regulating food advertising, while the FDA has taken primary responsibility for regulating food labeling. The FTC exercises jurisdiction over the advertising of foods under its statutory authority to prohibit deceptive acts or practices under Section 5, and prohibit any false advertisement that is misleading in any material respect under Sections 12 and 15, of the Federal Trade Commission Act (“the FTC Act”). The FTC has the power to institute monetary sanctions and the imposition of “consent decrees” and penalties that can severely limit a company’s business practices.
Current Events. There are a variety of regulatory reform initiatives within the FDA, FTC, EPA, and Congress that may affect regulations and/or respective effective or compliance dates applicable to our products. 
Employees
As of December 31, 2016, we employed approximately 1,350 people. Of our total workforce, approximately 1,180 were located at our bakery facilities. The remaining workers comprised functions including operations management, sales and supply chain, among others. In early 2015, we entered into collective bargaining agreements with the local unions of the Bakery, Confectionary, Tobacco Workers and Grain Millers Union in Indianapolis, Indiana and Columbus, Georgia. Approximately 420 employees are covered by these collective bargaining agreements.
We consider our relations with employees to be good and have not experienced a strike or significant work stoppage. 
Employee Safety and Environmental Sustainability
We are committed to keeping our employees safe, protecting the environment and providing developmental opportunities for our employees.  We endeavor to be a company of energized people and to be a good corporate citizen.
Our goal is to create a higher standard of living and quality of life for our employees and our communities. New automation, safety investments and behavioral safety training have resulted in higher employee engagement and low workers’ compensation costs. We meet periodically with local and state leaders to discuss business planning and ways to become a better community partner with educational, municipal and regulatory agencies.  We promote participation in charitable organizations and make philanthropic donations in some of the communities where we operate.
We also routinely donate a portion of our excess production to food banks in areas we operate.
