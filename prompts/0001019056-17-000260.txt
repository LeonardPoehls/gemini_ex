See “Competition-Competitive Data” below.
Competition
 General Competitive Factors. In order to compete with the financial institutions in their primary service areas, community banks such as the Bank, use, to the fullest extent possible, the flexibility which is accorded by their independent status. This includes an emphasis on specialized services, local promotional activity, and personal contacts by their respective officers, directors and employees. The Bank’s management and employees develop a thorough knowledge of local businesses and markets.
 Community banks also seek to provide special services and programs for individuals in their primary service area who are employed in the agricultural, professional and business fields, such as loans for equipment, furniture and tools of the trade or expansion of practices or businesses. In the event there are customers whose loan demands exceed their respective lending limits, they seek to arrange for such loans on a participation basis with other financial institutions. They also assist those customers requiring services not available at such banks to obtain such services from correspondent banks.
 Banking is a business that depends on interest rate differentials. In general, the difference between the interest rate paid by a bank to obtain their deposits and other borrowings and the interest rate received by a bank on loans extended to customers and on securities held in a bank’s investment portfolio comprise the major portion of a bank’s earnings. The Bank competes with savings and loan associations, credit unions, other financial institutions and other entities for funds.
 The Bank also competes for loans with savings and loan associations, credit unions, consumer finance companies, banking and other financial institutions, mortgage companies and other lending institutions.
 The interest rate differentials of a bank, and therefore its earnings, are affected not only by general economic conditions, but also by statutes, as implemented by federal agencies. The Federal Reserve Board can and does implement national monetary policy, such as seeking to curb inflation and combat recession, by its open market operations in United States government securities, and adjustments to the discount rates applicable to borrowing by banks from the Federal Reserve Banks.

These activities influence the growth of bank loans, investments and deposits and also affect interest rates charged on loans and paid on deposits. The nature and timing of any future changes in monetary policies and their impact on the Bank are not predictable.
 Competitive Data. In its market areas, the Bank competes for deposit and loan customers with other banks (including those with much greater resources), thrifts and, to a lesser extent, credit unions, finance companies and other financial service providers. Larger banks may have a competitive advantage because of higher lending limits and major advertising and marketing campaigns, along with significant investment banking, trust and insurance operations. The Bank has made arrangements with its correspondent banks and with others to provide some of these services for its customers.
 For borrowers requiring loans in excess of the Bank’s legal lending limits, the Bank has offered, and intends to offer in the future, such loans on a participating basis with other insured financial institutions, retaining the portion of such loans which is within its lending limits.
 As of December 31, 2016, the Bank’s aggregate legal lending limits to a single borrower and such borrower’s related parties were $17,937,000 on an unsecured basis and $29,895,000 on a fully secured basis, based on regulatory Total Risk-Based Capital of $119,582,000. The Bank’s business is concentrated in its service area, which primarily encompasses San Mateo County, Santa Clara County and the City and County of San Francisco. The economy of the Bank’s service area is dependent upon government, manufacturing, tourism, retail sales, population growth and smaller service oriented businesses.
 Based upon the most recent information made available by the FDIC Summary of Deposits at June 30, 2016, there were 30 commercial and savings banking institutions in San Mateo County with a total of $34,316,533,000 in deposits at June 30, 2016. The Bank had a total of 8 offices in San Mateo County with total deposits of $800,783,000 at the same date, or 2.33% of the San Mateo County totals. There were 46 banking and savings institutions in the City and County of San Francisco with a total of $204,323,373,000 in deposits at June 30, 2016. The Bank had a total of 4 offices in the City and County of San Francisco with total deposits of $175,480,000, or 0.09% of the City and County of San Francisco totals. There were 47 commercial and savings banking institutions in Santa Clara County with a total of $123,789,242,000 in deposits at June 30, 2016.

The common stock of the Company is subject to the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and the qualification requirements of the California Corporate Securities Law of 1968, as amended. FNB Bancorp has registered its common stock under Section 12 (g) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. The Company is also subject to the periodic reporting requirements of Section 13 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, which include, but are not limited to, annual, quarterly and other current reports required to be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The common stock of the Company is traded over-the-counter and is quoted on the OTCQB marketplace under the trading symbol, “FNBG.”
 The California Corporate Disclosure Act requires publicly traded corporations incorporated or qualified to do business in California to disclose information about their past history, auditors, directors and officers. Consequently, the Company files disclosures annually with the California Secretary of State as to the name of the Company’s independent auditor, the compensation paid to each of its directors and the five most highly compensated non-director executive officers, any loans made to a director or executive officer at a “preferential” loan rate, whether any director or executive officer has been convicted of fraud or has filed in bankruptcy and any material pending legal proceedings other than ordinary routine litigation.
 The Company is required to obtain the approval of the Board of Governors before it may acquire all or substantially all of the assets of any bank, or ownership or control of the voting shares of any bank if, after giving effect to such acquisition of shares, the Company would own or control more than 5% of the voting shares of such bank. The Bank Holding Company Act prohibits the Company from acquiring any voting shares of, or interest in, all or substantially all of the assets of a bank located outside the State of California unless such an acquisition is specifically authorized by the laws of the state in which such bank is located. Any such interstate acquisition is also subject to the provisions of the Riegle-Neal Interstate Banking and Branching Efficiency Act of 1994.
 The Company, and any non-bank subsidiary which it may acquire or organize, are deemed to be “affiliates” of the Bank within the meaning of that term as defined in the Federal Reserve Act. This means, for example, that there are limitations (a) on loans by the Bank to its affiliates, and (b) on investments by the Bank in affiliates’ stock as collateral for loans to any borrower. The Company and the Bank are also subject to certain restrictions with respect to engaging in the underwriting, public sale and distribution of securities.
 In addition, regulations of the Board of Governors under the Federal Reserve Act require that reserves be maintained by the Bank in conjunction with any liability of the Company under any obligation (promissory note, acknowledgment of advance, banker’s acceptance or similar obligation) with a weighted average maturity of less than seven (7) years to the extent that the proceeds of such obligations are used for the purpose of supplying funds to the Bank for use in its banking business, or to maintain the availability of such funds.
 As provided in the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, a bank holding company (such as the Company) must serve as a source of financial strength for any subsidiary of the bank holding company that is a depository institution (such as the Bank) and the federal banking agencies are directed to issue joint rules to carry out this mandate. The term “source of financial strength” means the ability to provide financial assistance to the depository institution in the event of the financial distress of the institution. See “Impact of Certain Legislation and Regulation – Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010” below.
 First National Bank of Northern California. As a national banking association licensed under the national banking laws of the United States, the Bank is regularly examined by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and is further subject to supervision and regulation by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.
 This supervision and regulation includes comprehensive reviews of all major aspects of the Bank’s business and condition, including its capital ratios, allowance for possible loan losses and other factors. However, no inference should be drawn that such authorities have approved any such factors. The Bank is required to file reports with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. The Bank’s deposits are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation up to the applicable legal limits.

The Company and the Bank are also subject to the applicable provisions of California law to the extent those provisions are not in conflict with or preempted by Federal banking law. This includes regulations of the California Department of Business Oversight.
 General. Bank holding companies, such as the Company, and commercial banks, such as the Bank, are subject to extensive supervision and regulation by federal and state regulators. Various and multiple requirements and restrictions under federal and state law affect our operations, as summarized below.
 Capital Standards
 Risk-Based Capital. The Board of Governors, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation have adopted risk-based capital guidelines for evaluating the capital adequacy of bank holding companies and banks. The guidelines were designed to make capital requirements sensitive to differences in risk profiles among banking organizations, to take into account off-balance sheet exposures and to aid in making the definition of bank capital uniform internationally. Under the risk-based guidelines and prior to amendments to the capital rules effective January 1, 2015, as described below in “Basel III - New Capital and Prompt Corrective Action Regulations,” the Company and the Bank were required to maintain capital equal to at least 8% of its assets and commitments to extend credit, weighted by risk, of which at least 4% was required to consist primarily of common equity (including retained earnings) and the remainder was to consist of subordinated debt, cumulative preferred stock, or a limited amount of loan and lease loss reserves.
 Assets, commitments to extend credit, and off-balance sheet items were categorized according to risk and certain assets considered to present less risk than others permitted maintenance of capital at less than the 8% ratio. For example, most home mortgage loans were placed in a 50% risk category and therefore required maintenance of capital equal to 4% of those loans, while commercial loans were placed in a 100% risk category and therefore required maintenance of capital equal to 8% of those loans.
 Under the risk-based capital guidelines, assets reported on an institution’s balance sheet and certain off-balance sheet items are assigned to risk categories, each of which has an assigned risk weight. Capital ratios are calculated by dividing the institution’s qualifying capital by its period-end risk-weighted assets. The guidelines established two categories of qualifying capital: Tier 1 capital (core capital including common shareholders’ equity and noncumulative perpetual preferred stock) and Tier 2 capital (supplementary capital which includes, among other items, limited life (and in the case of banks, cumulative) preferred stock, mandatory convertible securities, subordinated debt and a limited amount of reserve for credit losses. Each institution was required to maintain a minimum risk-based capital ratio (including Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital) of 8%, of which at least half was to be Tier 1 capital.
 
A leverage capital standard was adopted as a supplement to the risk-weighted capital guidelines. Under the leverage capital standard, an institution was required to maintain a minimum ratio of Tier 1 capital to the sum of its quarterly average total assets and quarterly average reserve for loan losses, less intangible assets not included in Tier 1 capital. Period-end assets may be used in place of quarterly average total assets on a case-by-case basis. A minimum leverage ratio was also adopted for bank holding companies as a supplement to the risk-weighted capital guidelines. The leverage ratio establishes a minimum Tier 1 ratio of 3% (Tier 1 capital to total assets) for the highest rated bank holding companies or those that have implemented the risk-based capital market risk measure. All other bank holding companies must maintain a minimum Tier 1 leverage ratio of 4% with higher leverage capital ratios required for bank holding companies that have significant financial and/or operational weakness, a high-risk profile, or are undergoing or anticipating rapid growth.
 Effective January 1, 2015, the risk-based capital regulations described above were amended to the extent described below in “Basel III - New Capital and Prompt Corrective Action Regulations.”
 Basel III – New Capital and Prompt Corrective Action Regulations. “Basel III” refers to a comprehensive set of reform measures developed by the Bank for International Settlements to strengthen the regulation, supervision and risk management of the banking sector. In July 2013, the federal bank regulatory agencies issued interim final rules that revised and replaced the risk-based capital requirements (summarized above) in order to implement the Basel III regulatory capital reforms released by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and changes required by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010. The Basel III reforms reflected in the final rules include an increase in the risk-based capital requirements and certain changes to capital components, as well as changes to the calculation and categories of risk-weighted assets. For example, changes to risk weighted assets include increasing the original risk weight to 150% on assets past due 90 days or more or on nonaccrual, utilizing loan to value ratios in the risk weighting of mortgage loans and assigning a 150% risk weight to certain higher risk commercial real estate loans.

Effective January 1, 2015, bank holding companies with consolidated assets of $1 billion or more and banks like the Bank must comply with new minimum capital ratio requirements to be phased-in between January 1, 2015 and January 1, 2019, which consist of the following: (i) a new common equity Tier 1 capital to total risk weighted assets ratio of 4.5%; (ii) a Tier 1 capital to total risk weighted assets ratio of 6% (increased from 4%); (iii) a total capital to total risk weighted assets ratio of 8% (unchanged); and (iv) a Tier 1 capital to adjusted average total assets (“leverage”) ratio of 4%.
 
In addition, a “capital conservation buffer” is established which when fully phased-in will require maintenance of a minimum of 2.5% of common equity Tier 1 capital to total risk weighted assets in excess of the regulatory minimum capital ratio requirements described above. The 2.5% buffer will increase the minimum capital ratios to (i) a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 7%, (ii) a Tier 1 capital ratio of 8.5%, and (iii) a total capital ratio of 10.5%. The new buffer requirement will be phased-in between January 1, 2016 and January 1, 2019. If the capital ratio levels of a banking organization fall below the capital conservation buffer amount, the organization will be subject to limitations on (i) the payment of dividends; (ii) discretionary bonus payments; (iii) discretionary payments under Tier 1 instruments; and (iv) engaging in share repurchases.
 
The federal bank regulatory agencies also implemented changes to the prompt corrective action framework, described below in “Prompt Corrective Action,” which is designed to place restrictions on insured depository institutions if their capital ratios begin to show signs of weakness. These changes took effect beginning January 1, 2015 and require insured depository institutions to meet the following increased capital ratio requirements in order to qualify as “well capitalized:” (i) a new common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 6.5%; (ii) a Tier 1 capital ratio of 8%; (iii) a total capital ratio of 10%; and (iv) a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 5%. In order to qualify as “adequately capitalized,” institutions must have (i) a new common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 4.5%; (ii) a Tier 1 capital ratio of 6%; (iii) a total capital ratio of 8%; and (iv) a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 4%. See also the additional requirements of the prompt corrective action framework discussed below in “Prompt Corrective Action.”
 
Management believes that the Bank is in compliance with the minimum capital requirements, including the fully phased-in capital conservation buffer requirement, based upon its capital position at December 31, 2016. See “Capital” under “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and the Results of Operations” set forth in Item 7 below and Note 19 “Regulatory Matters” in the “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” set forth in Item 8 below.
 
Prompt Corrective Action
 The Board of Governors, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation have adopted regulations implementing a system of prompt corrective action pursuant to Section 38 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act and Section 131 of the FDIC Improvement Act of 1991 (“FDICIA”). Prior to amendments to the capital rules effective January 1, 2015, as described above in “Basel III - New Capital and Prompt Corrective Action Regulations,” the regulations established five capital categories with the following characteristics: (1) “Well capitalized” - consisting of institutions with a total risk-based capital ratio of 10% or greater, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6% or greater and a leverage ratio of 5% or greater, and the institution is not subject to an order, written agreement, capital directive or prompt corrective action directive; (2) “Adequately capitalized” - consisting of institutions with a total risk-based capital ratio of 8% or greater, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 4% or greater and a leverage ratio of 4% or greater, and the institution does not meet the definition of a “well capitalized” institution; (3) “Undercapitalized” - consisting of institutions with a total risk-based capital ratio less than 8%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 4%, or a leverage ratio of less than 4%; (4) “Significantly undercapitalized” - consisting of institutions with a total risk-based capital ratio of less than 6%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 3%, or a leverage ratio of less than 3%; (5) “Critically undercapitalized” - consisting of an institution with a ratio of tangible equity to total assets that is equal to or less than 2%.

The regulations established procedures for classification of financial institutions within the capital categories, and for filing and reviewing capital restoration plans required under the regulations and procedures for issuance of directives by the appropriate regulatory agency, among other matters. The regulations imposed restrictions upon all institutions to refrain from certain actions which would cause an institution to be classified within any one of the three “undercapitalized” categories, such as declaration of dividends or other capital distributions or payment of management fees, if following the distribution or payment the institution would be classified within one of the “undercapitalized” categories. In addition, institutions which are classified in one of the three “undercapitalized” categories are subject to certain mandatory and discretionary supervisory actions. Mandatory supervisory actions include (1) increased monitoring and review by the appropriate federal banking agency; (2) implementation of a capital restoration plan; (3) total asset growth restrictions; and (4) limitations upon acquisitions, branch expansion, and new business activities without prior approval of the appropriate federal banking agency. Discretionary supervisory actions may include (a) requirements to augment capital; (b) restrictions upon affiliate transactions; (c) restrictions upon deposit gathering activities and interest rates paid; (d) replacement of senior executive officers and directors; (e) restrictions upon activities of the institution and its affiliates; (f) requiring divestiture or sale of the institution; and (g) any other supervisory action that the appropriate federal banking agency determines is necessary to further the purposes of the regulations. Further, the federal banking agencies may not accept a capital restoration plan without determining, among other things, that the plan is based on realistic assumptions and is likely to succeed in restoring the depository institution’s capital. In addition, for a capital restoration plan to be acceptable, the depository institution’s parent holding company must guarantee that the institution will comply with such capital restoration plan. The aggregate liability of the parent holding company under the guaranty is limited to the lesser of (i) an amount equal to 5 percent of the depository institution’s total assets at the time it became undercapitalized, and (ii) the amount that is necessary (or would have been necessary) to bring the institution into compliance with all capital standards applicable with respect to such institution as of the time it fails to comply with the plan. If a depository institution fails to submit an acceptable plan, it is treated as if it were “significantly undercapitalized.” FDICIA also restricts the solicitation and acceptance of and interest rates payable on brokered deposits by insured depository institutions that are not “well capitalized.” An “undercapitalized” institution is not allowed to solicit deposits by offering rates of interest that are significantly higher than the prevailing rates of interest on insured deposits in the particular institution’s normal market areas or in the market areas in which such deposits would otherwise be accepted.
 Any financial institution which is classified as “critically undercapitalized” must be placed in conservatorship or receivership within ninety days of such determination unless it is also determined that some other course of action would better serve the purposes of the regulations. Critically undercapitalized institutions are also prohibited from making (but not accruing) any payment of principal or interest on subordinated debt without prior regulatory approval and regulators must prohibit a critically undercapitalized institution from taking certain other actions without prior approval, including (1) entering into any material transaction other than in the usual course of business, including investment expansion, acquisition, sale of assets or other similar actions; (2) extending credit for any highly leveraged transaction; (3) amending articles or bylaws unless required to do so to comply with any law, regulation or order; (4) making any material change in accounting methods; (5) engaging in certain affiliate transactions; (6) paying excessive compensation or bonuses; and (7) paying interest on new or renewed liabilities at rates which would increase the weighted average costs of funds beyond prevailing rates in the institution’s normal market areas.
 On November 18, 2014, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation adopted the “Assessments Final Rule” which revises the FDIC’s risk-based deposit insurance assessment system to reflect changes in the regulatory capital rules, effective commencing January 1, 2015. For smaller financial institutions (with total assets less than $1 billion and which are not custodial banks), the Assessments Final Rule revised and conformed capital ratios and ratio thresholds to the new prompt corrective action capital ratios and ratio thresholds for “well capitalized” and “adequately capitalized” evaluations which were adopted by the federal banking agencies as part of the Basel III capital regulations. Consequently, effective January 1, 2015, the prompt corrective action regulations were amended to the extent described above in “Basel III – New Capital and Prompt Corrective Action Regulations.”
 Uniform Rating System
 The Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (“FFIEC”) utilizes the Uniform Financial Institutions Rating System (“UFIRS”), commonly referred to as “CAMELS,” to classify and evaluate the soundness of financial institutions. Bank examiners use the CAMELS measurements to evaluate capital adequacy, asset quality, management, earnings, liquidity and sensitivity to market risk.

Effective January 1, 2005, bank holding companies such as the Company became subject to evaluation and examination under a revised bank holding company rating system.
 
The federal financial institution agencies have established bases for analysis and standards for assessing financial institution’s capital adequacy in conjunction with the risk-based and Basel III capital guidelines, including analysis of interest rate risk, concentrations of credit risk, risk posed by non-traditional activities, and factors affecting overall safety and soundness. The safety and soundness standards for insured financial institutions include analysis of (1) internal controls, information systems and internal audit systems; (2) loan documentation; (3) credit underwriting; (4) interest rate exposure; (5) asset growth; (6) compensation, fees and benefits; and (7) excessive compensation for executive officers, directors or principal shareholders which could lead to material financial loss. If an agency determines that an institution fails to meet any standard, the agency may require the financial institution to submit to the agency an acceptable plan to achieve compliance with the standard. If the agency requires submission of a compliance plan and the institution fails to timely submit an acceptable plan or to implement an accepted plan, the agency will require the institution to correct the deficiency. The agencies may elect to initiate enforcement action in certain cases rather than rely on an existing plan, particularly where failure to meet one or more of the standards could threaten the safe and sound operation of the institution.
 CRA Compliance
 Community Reinvestment Act (“CRA”) regulations evaluate banks’ lending to low and moderate income individuals and businesses across a four-point scale from “outstanding” to “substantial noncompliance,” and are a factor in regulatory review of applications to merge, establish new branches or form bank holding companies. In addition, any bank rated in “substantial noncompliance” with the CRA regulations may be subject to enforcement proceedings. The Bank has a current rating of “satisfactory” for CRA compliance.
 FDIC Insurance
 The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) is an independent federal agency that insures deposits of federally insured banks (such as the Bank) and savings institutions up to prescribed limits through the Deposit Insurance Fund (“DIF”). All depository accounts of the Bank are covered by FDIC insurance up to established maximum limits (currently $250,000 per separately insured depositor). The amount of FDIC assessments paid by each DIF member institution for insurance coverage is based on its risk profile as measured by regulatory capital ratios and other supervisory factors. In 2011, as required by the Dodd-Frank Act, the FDIC revised the assessment rates and the deposit insurance assessment base used to calculate premiums paid to DIF.
 On June 16, 2015, the FDIC proposed changes to the deposit insurance assessments for small insured banks having total assets less than $10 billion which have been insured for at least five years, based upon experience with bank failures. The changes, among other matters, revise the financial ratios method of determining assessments to reflect a statistical model estimating the probability of failure over three years and updating the financial measures used in the financial ratios method consistent with the statistical model. The FDIC proposed additional changes on October 22, 2015 to require banks with over $10 billion in assets to be responsible for the recapitalization of the DIF to 1.35% of insured deposits after achieving a 1.15% reserve ratio. On January 21, 2016, the FDIC proposed further revisions to the small insured bank assessments as the result of comments and recommendations received in response to its earlier proposal. The FDIC proposed that a final rule would go into effect the quarter after adoption but the amendments would not become operative until the quarter after the DIF reserve ratio reached 1.15%. The DIF achieved a reserve ratio of 1.17% on June 30, 2016. Among the effects of the amendments was a reduction in the initial assessment rates for all banks.
 If economic conditions negatively impact financial institutions and there are additional bank and other financial institution failures, or if the FDIC otherwise determines, the Bank may be required to pay higher FDIC insurance premiums in the future (including the possibility of special assessments and the requirement to prepay estimated quarterly risk-based assessments), which could have a material and adverse effect on the earnings of the Bank and the Company.

Dividends
 FNB Bancorp. The Company’s ability to pay cash dividends is subject to restrictions set forth in the California General Corporation Law. Funds for payment of any cash dividends by the Company could be obtained from its investments, equity sales or dividends received from the Bank. The Bank’s ability to pay cash dividends to the Company is subject to restrictions imposed under the National Bank Act and regulations promulgated by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. The Company has paid cash dividends for each quarter of operations commencing with the second quarter of 2002. Future dividends will continue to be determined after consideration of the Company’s earnings, financial condition, future capital funds, regulatory requirements and other relevant factors.
 The California General Corporation Law provides that neither a corporation nor any of its subsidiaries shall make a distribution to the corporation’s shareholders unless the board of directors has determined in good faith either of the following: (1) the amount of retained earnings of the corporation immediately prior to the distribution equals or exceeds the sum of (A) the amount of the proposed distribution plus (B) the preferential dividends arrears amount; or (2) immediately after the distribution, the value of the corporation’s assets would equal or exceed the sum of its total liabilities plus the preferential rights amount. The good faith determination of the board of directors may be based upon (1) financial statements prepared on the basis of reasonable accounting practices and principles, (2) a fair valuation, or (3) any other method reasonable under the circumstances; provided, that a distribution may not be made if the corporation or subsidiary making the distribution is, or is likely to be, unable to meet its liabilities (except those whose payment is otherwise adequately provided for) as they mature. The term “preferential dividends arrears amount” means the amount, if any, of cumulative dividends in arrears on all shares having a preference with respect to payment of dividends over the class or series to which the applicable distribution is being made, provided that if the articles of incorporation provide that a distribution can be made without regard to preferential dividends arrears amount, then the preferential dividends arrears amount shall be zero. The term “preferential rights amount” means the amount that would be needed if the corporation were to be dissolved at the time of the distribution to satisfy the preferential rights, including accrued but unpaid dividends, of other shareholders upon dissolution that are superior to the rights of the shareholders receiving the distribution, provided that if the articles of incorporation provide that a distribution can be made without regard to any preferential rights, then the preferential rights amount shall be zero.
 The Board of Governors generally prohibits a bank holding company from declaring or paying a cash dividend which would impose undue pressure on the capital of subsidiary banks or would be funded only through borrowing or other arrangements that might adversely affect a bank holding company’s financial position. The Federal Reserve Board policy is that a bank holding company should not continue its existing rate of cash dividends on its common stock unless its net income is sufficient to fully fund each dividend and its prospective rate of earnings retention appears consistent with its capital needs, asset quality and overall financial condition.
 First National Bank of Northern California. As the Bank’s sole shareholder, the Company is entitled to receive dividends when and as declared by the Bank’s Board of Directors, out of funds legally available therefore, subject to the restrictions set forth in the National Bank Act.
 The payment of cash dividends by the Bank may be subject to the approval of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, as well as restrictions established by federal banking law and the FDIC. Approval of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency is required if the total of all dividends declared by the Bank’s Board of Directors in any calendar year will exceed the Bank’s net profits for that year combined with its retained net profits for the preceding two years, less any required transfers to surplus or to a fund for the retirement of preferred stock.
 Additionally, the FDIC and/or the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, might, under some circumstances, place restrictions on the ability of a bank to pay dividends.
 Impact of Certain Legislation and Regulation
 Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999. The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 (the “GLB Act”) eliminated most of the remaining depression-era “firewalls” between banks, securities firms and insurance companies which were established by the Banking Act of 1933, also known as the Glass-Steagall Act (“Glass-Steagall”). Glass-Steagall sought to insulate banks as depository institutions from the perceived risks of securities dealing and underwriting, and related activities. The GLB Act repealed Section 20 of Glass-Steagall, which prohibited banks from affiliating with securities firms. Bank holding companies that can qualify as “financial holding companies” can now, among other matters, acquire securities firms or create them as subsidiaries, and securities firms can now acquire banks or start banking activities through a financial holding company. The GLB Act includes provisions which permit national banks to conduct financial activities through a subsidiary that are permissible for a national bank to engage in directly, as well as certain activities authorized by statute, or that are financial in nature or incidental to financial activities to the same extent as permitted to a “financial holding company” or its affiliates. This liberalization of United States banking and financial services regulation applies both to domestic institutions and foreign institutions conducting business in the United States. Consequently, the common ownership of banks, securities firms and insurance is now possible, as is the conduct of commercial banking, merchant banking, and investment management, securities underwriting and insurance within a single financial institution using a structure authorized by the GLB Act. Neither the Company nor the Bank has determined whether or when it may seek to acquire and exercise new powers or activities under the GLB Act.

Financial holding companies are also permitted to engage in activities that are complementary to financial activities if the Board of Governors determines that the activity does not pose a substantial risk to the safety or soundness of depository institutions or the financial system in general. These standards expand upon the list of activities “closely related to banking” which have defined the permissible activities of bank holding companies under the Bank Holding Company Act. One further effect of the Act was to require that federal financial institution and securities regulatory agencies prescribe regulation to implement the policy that financial institutions must respect the privacy of their customers and protect the security and confidentiality of customers’ non-public personal information. These regulations require, in general, that financial institutions (1) may not disclose non-public information of customers to non-affiliated third parties without notice to their customers, who must have an opportunity to direct that such information not be disclosed; (2) may not disclose customer account numbers except to consumer reporting agencies; and (3) must give prior disclosure of their privacy policies before establishing new customer relationships.
 The Patriot Act. On October 26, 2001, President Bush signed the USA Patriot Act (the “Patriot Act”), which included provisions pertaining to domestic security, surveillance procedures, border protection, and terrorism laws to be administered by the Secretary of the Treasury. Title III of the Patriot Act entitled, “International Money Laundering Abatement and Anti-Terrorist Financing Act of 2001” includes amendments to the Bank Secrecy Act which expand the responsibilities of financial institutions in regard to anti-money laundering activities with particular emphasis upon international money laundering and terrorism financing activities through designated correspondent and private banking accounts.
 The Patriot Act contains various provisions that affect the operations of financial institutions by encouraging cooperation among financial institutions, regulatory authorities and law enforcement authorities with respect to individuals, entities and organizations engaged in, or reasonably suspected of engaging in, terrorist acts or money laundering activities. The Company and the Bank are not currently aware of any account relationships between the Bank and any foreign bank or other person or entity which would not be in compliance with the Patriot Act.
 Certain surveillance provisions of the Patriot Act expired on June 1, 2015, but were renewed the next day by the passage of the USA Freedom Act on June 2, 2015 and extended through 2019. However, the provision under which the National Security Agency (“NSA”) conducted mass phone data collection on individuals was changed to require the NSA to seek permission from a federal court in order to obtain such data from phone companies.
 The effects which the Patriot Act and any amendments to the Patriot Act or any additional legislation enacted by Congress may have upon financial institutions is uncertain; however, such legislation could increase compliance costs and thereby potentially may have an adverse effect upon the Company’s results of operations.
 Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. On July 30, 2002, President Bush signed into law the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (“Sarbanes-Oxley”), legislation designed to address certain issues of corporate governance and accountability. Among other matters, key provisions of Sarbanes-Oxley and rules promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to Sarbanes-Oxley include enhancement of financial disclosures and related certification requirements, rules related to audit committees, auditor independence, ethics requirements, securities trading prohibitions, securities reporting requirements, and securities listing requirements. The Company’s common stock is not currently listed on any exchange. The common stock is traded over-the-counter and quoted on the OTCQB marketplace. If the Company were to be listed on the Nasdaq Stock Market, the Company would be required to comply with the Nasdaq listing standards in addition to the rules promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to Sarbanes-Oxley. The effect of Sarbanes-Oxley on the Company is uncertain; however, the Company has incurred and it is anticipated that it will continue to incur costs to comply with Sarbanes-Oxley and the rules and regulations promulgated pursuant to Sarbanes-Oxley by the Securities and Exchange Commission and other regulatory agencies having jurisdiction over the Company on the issuance and listing of its securities. The Company does not currently anticipate, however, that compliance with Sarbanes-Oxley and such rules and regulations will have a material effect upon its financial position or results of its operations or its cash flows.

Small Business Jobs Act of 2010. On September 27, 2010, President Obama signed into law the Small Business Jobs Act of 2010 (the “SBJ Act”), which, among other matters, authorized the U.S. Treasury to buy preferred stock or subordinated debt issued by community banks with assets less than $10 billion. On September 15, 2011, as part of the Small Business Lending Fund program established under the SBJ Act, the Company issued and sold to the Secretary of the Treasury a total of 12,600 shares of the Company’s Senior Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series C (the “Series C Preferred Stock”) for a purchase price of $12,600,000. The Series C Preferred Stock qualified as Tier 1 capital. All of the $12,600,000 proceeds from the Company’s sale of its Series C Preferred Stock were immediately applied to the Company’s repurchase of outstanding shares of preferred stock which had been issued to the United States Department of the Treasury on February 27, 2009, pursuant to the TARP Capital Purchase Program authorized by the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008, as amended by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. On May 6, 2013, the Company redeemed 25% of the original issue $12,600,000 of Series C Preferred Stock for a cash payment of $3,150,000. Subsequently, on January 23, 2014, the remaining $9,450,000 of Series C Preferred Stock was redeemed by the Company, also in a cash transaction.
 Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010. On July 21, 2010, President Obama signed into law the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (the “Dodd-Frank Act”). The Dodd-Frank Act is intended to restructure the regulation of the financial services sector by, among other things, (i) establishing a framework to identify systemic risks in the financial system implemented by a newly created Financial Stability Oversight Council and other federal banking agencies; (ii) expanding the resolution authority of the federal banking agencies over troubled financial institutions; (iii) authorizing changes to capital and liquidity requirements; (iv) changing deposit insurance assessments; and (v) enhancing regulatory supervision to improve the safety and soundness of the financial services sector. The Dodd-Frank Act has had, and is expected to continue to have, a significant impact upon our business as such provisions are implemented over time. Below is a summary of certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act which, directly or indirectly, may affect the Company and the Bank.
 
· | Changes to Capital Requirements. The federal banking agencies are required to establish minimum leverage and risk-based capital requirements for banks and bank holding companies which will not be lower and could be higher than established regulatory capital and leverage standards for insured depository institutions. Under these requirements, trust preferred securities will be excluded from Tier 1 capital unless such securities were issued prior to May 19, 2010 by a bank holding company with less than $15 billion in assets. The Company has no trust preferred securities outstanding. The Dodd-Frank Act requires capital increases in times of economic expansion and decreases in times of economic contraction consistent with safety and soundness.

· | Enhanced Regulatory Supervision. The Dodd-Frank Act increases regulatory oversight, supervision and examination of banks, bank holding companies and their respective subsidiaries by the appropriate regulatory agency. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Consumer Protection. The Dodd-Frank Act created the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (“CFPB”) within the Federal Reserve System. The CFPB is responsible for establishing and implementing rules and regulations under various federal consumer protection laws governing certain consumer products and services. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


The CFPB has primary enforcement authority over large financial institutions with assets of $10 billion or more, while smaller institutions will be subject to the CFPB’s rules and regulations through the enforcement authority of the federal banking agencies. States are permitted to adopt consumer protection laws and regulations that are more stringent than those laws and regulations adopted by the CFPB and state attorneys general are permitted to enforce consumer protection laws and regulations adopted by the CFPB. 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

· | Deposit Insurance. The Dodd-Frank Act permanently increased the deposit insurance limit for insured deposits to $250,000 per depositor and extended unlimited deposit insurance to non-interest bearing transaction accounts until December 31, 2012. Other deposit insurance changes under the Dodd-Frank Act include (i) amendment of the assessment base used to calculate an insured depository institution’s deposit insurance premiums paid to the Deposit Insurance Fund (“DIF”) by elimination of deposits and substitution of average consolidated total assets less average tangible equity during the assessment period as the revised assessment base; (ii) increasing the minimum designated reserve ratio of the DIF from 1.15% to 1.35% of the estimated amount of total insured deposits; (iii) eliminating the requirement that the FDIC pay dividends to depository institutions when the reserve ratio exceeds certain thresholds; and (iv) repeal of the prohibition upon the payment of interest on demand deposits to be effective one year after the date of enactment of the Dodd-Frank Act. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Note: The FDIC has proposed further changes to the deposit insurance assessments applicable to small insured depository institutions with assets less than $10 billion and additional DIF capitalization obligations for insured depository institutions with more than $10 billion in assets. See the discussion of these changes above in “FDIC Insurance.” 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Transactions with Affiliates. The Dodd-Frank Act enhanced the requirements for certain transactions with affiliates under Section 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act, including an expansion of the definition of “covered transactions” and increasing the amount of time for which collateral requirements regarding covered transactions must be maintained. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Transactions with Insiders. Insider transaction limitations were expanded through the strengthening of loan restrictions to insiders and the expansion of the types of transactions subject to various limits, including derivative transactions, repurchase agreements, reverse repurchase agreements and securities lending or borrowing transactions. Restrictions were also placed on certain asset sales to and from an insider to an institution, including requirements that such sales be on market terms and, in certain circumstances, approved by the institution’s board of directors. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Enhanced Lending Limitations. The Dodd-Frank Act strengthened the existing limits on a depository institution’s credit exposure to include credit exposure arising from derivative transactions, repurchase agreements, and securities lending and borrowing transactions. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Debit Card Interchange Fees. The Dodd-Frank Act required that the amount of any interchange fee charged by a debit card issuer with respect to a debit card transaction must be reasonable and proportional to the cost incurred by the issuer. Within nine months of enactment of the Dodd-Frank Act, the Federal Reserve Board was required to establish standards for reasonable and proportional fees which may take into account the costs of preventing fraud. The restrictions on interchange fees, however, do not apply to banks that, together with their affiliates, have assets of less than $10 billion. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Interstate Branching. The Dodd-Frank Act authorized national and state banks to establish branches in other states to the same extent as a bank chartered by that state would be permitted to branch. Previously, banks could only establish branches in other states if the host state expressly permitted out-of-state banks to establish branches in that state. Accordingly, banks will be able to enter new markets more freely. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Charter Conversions. Effective one year after enactment of the Dodd-Frank Act, depository institutions that are subject to a cease and desist order or certain other enforcement actions issued with respect to a significant supervisory matter were prohibited from changing their federal or state charters, except in accordance with certain notice, application and other procedures involving the applicable regulatory agencies. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Compensation Practices. The Dodd-Frank Act provided that the appropriate federal banking regulators must establish standards prohibiting as an unsafe and unsound practice any compensation plan of a bank holding company or other “covered financial institution” that provides an insider or other employee with “excessive compensation” or could lead to a material financial loss to such firm. In June 2010, prior to the enactment of the Dodd-Frank Act, the federal bank regulatory agencies jointly issued the Interagency Guidance on Sound Incentive Compensation Policies (“Guidance”), which requires that financial institutions establish metrics for measuring the risk to the financial institution of such loss from incentive compensation arrangements and implement policies to prohibit inappropriate risk taking that may lead to material financial loss to the institution. Together, the Frank-Dodd Act and the Guidance may impact the Company’s compensation policies and arrangements.

· | Corporate Governance. The Dodd-Frank Act has enhanced corporate governance requirements to include (i) requiring publicly traded companies to give shareholders a non-binding vote on executive compensation at their first annual meeting taking place six months after the enactment and at least every three years thereafter and on so-called “golden parachute” payments in connection with approvals of mergers and acquisitions unless previously voted on by shareholders; (ii) authorizing the SEC to promulgate rules that would allow shareholders to nominate their own candidates for election as directors using a company’s proxy materials; (iii) directing the federal banking regulators to promulgate rules prohibiting excessive compensation paid to executives of depository institutions and their holding companies with assets in excess of $1.0 billion, regardless of whether or not the company is publicly traded; and (iv) authorizing the SEC to prohibit broker discretionary voting on the election of directors and on executive compensation matters. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Many of the requirements under the Dodd-Frank Act are being implemented over an extended period of time and therefore, the nature and extent of regulations that will be issued by various regulatory agencies and the impact such regulations will have on the operations of financial institutions such as the Company and the Bank is unclear. Such regulations resulting from the Dodd-Frank Act may impact the profitability of our business activities, require changes to certain of our business practices, impose upon us more stringent capital, liquidity and leverage ratio requirements or otherwise adversely affect our business. These changes may also require us to invest significant management attention and resources to evaluate and make necessary changes in order to comply with new statutory and regulatory requirements.
 Volcker Rule. On December 10, 2013, the federal banking agencies jointly issued a final rule implementing the so-called “Volcker Rule” (set forth in Section 619 of the Dodd-Frank Act). The Volcker rule prohibits depository institutions, companies that control such institutions, bank holding companies, and the affiliates and subsidiaries of such banking entities, from engaging as principal for the trading account of the banking entity in any purchase or sale of one or more covered financial instruments (so-called “proprietary trading”) and imposes limitations upon retaining interests in, sponsoring, investing in and transacting with certain investment funds, including hedge funds and private equity funds. The effective date of the final rule restricting proprietary trading was extended to July 21, 2015, and certain other matters were extended to July 21, 2017. Neither the Company nor the Bank engages in activities prohibited by the Volcker Rule and management does not expect the Volcker Rule to have a material impact upon the Company or the Bank.
 Future Legislation and Regulations
 Certain legislative and regulatory proposals that could affect the Company, the Bank, and the banking business in general are periodically introduced before the United States Congress, the California State Legislature and federal and state government agencies. It is not known to what extent, if any, legislative proposals will be enacted and what effect such legislation would have on the structure, regulation and competitive relationships of financial institutions. It is likely, however, that such legislation could subject the Company and the Bank to increased regulation, disclosure and reporting requirements, more competition, and increased costs of doing business. In addition to legislative changes, the various federal and state financial institution regulatory agencies frequently propose rules and regulations to implement and enforce already existing legislation. It cannot be predicted whether or in what form any such rules or regulations will be enacted or the effect that such regulations may have on the Company and the Bank.
 
Under FDICIA, the federal financial institution agencies have adopted regulations which require institutions to establish and maintain comprehensive written real estate policies which address certain lending considerations, including loan-to-value limits, loan administrative policies, portfolio diversification standards, and documentation, approval and reporting requirements. FDICIA further generally prohibits an insured bank from engaging as a principal in any activity that is impermissible for a national bank, absent Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation determination that the activity would not pose a significant risk to the Bank Insurance Fund, and that such bank is, and will continue to be, within applicable capital standards.

Effective January 1, 2015, the risk-based-capital regulations and prompt corrective regulations, described above under “Capital Standards” and in “Prompt Corrective Action,” were amended to the extent described below under “Basel III Capital”.
 Basel III Capital
 In July 2013, the federal bank regulatory agencies issued interim final rules that revise and replace the current risk-based capital requirements. These rules implement the “Basel III” regulatory capital reforms released by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and changes required by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. The Basel III reforms reflected in the final rules include an increase in the risk-based capital requirements and certain changes to capital components and the calculation of risk-weighted assets.
 Effective January 1, 2015, bank holding companies with consolidated assets of $1 billion or more and organizations like the Bank must comply with new minimum capital ratio requirements to be phased in between January 1, 2015 and January 1, 2019, which consist of the following: (i) a new common equity Tier 1 capital to total risk weighted assets ratio of 4.5%; (ii) a total capital to total risk weighted assets ratio of 6% (increased from 4%); (iii) a total capital to total risk weighted assets ratio of 8% (unchanged from current rules); and (iv) a Tier 1 capital to adjusted average total assets (“leverage”) ratio of 4%.
 In addition, a “capital conservation buffer” is established which when fully phased-in will require maintenance of a minimum of 2.5% of common equity Tier 1 capital to total risk weighted assets in excess of the regulatory minimum capital ratio requirements described above. The 2.5% buffer would increase the minimum capital ratios to (i) a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 7%, (ii) a Tier 1 capital ratio of 8.5%, and (iii) a total capital ratio of 10.5%. The new buffer requirement would be phased in between January 2016 and January 2019. An institution would be subject to limitations on paying dividends, engaging in share repurchases, discretionary payments under Tier 1 instruments and paying discretionary bonuses if its capital ratio level fell below the buffer amount.
 The federal bank regulatory agencies have also proposed changes to the prompt corrective action framework (described above under “Prompt Corrective Action”) which is designed to place restrictions on insured depository institutions if their capital ratios begin to show signs of weakness. These changes took effect beginning on January 1, 2015 and will require insured depository institutions to meet the following increased capital ratio requirements in order to qualify as “well capitalized:” (i) a new common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 6.5%; (ii) a Tier 1 capital ratio of 8%; (iii) a total capital ratio of 10%; and (iv) a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 5%.
 Management believes that the Bank is in compliance with the minimum capital requirements, including the fully phased-in “capital conservation buffer” requirement, based upon its capital position at December 31, 2016.

Uniform Rating System
 The Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (“FFIEC”) utilizes the Uniform Financial Institutions Rating System (“UFIRS”), commonly referred to as “CAMELS,” to classify and evaluate the soundness of financial institutions. Bank examiners use the CAMELS measurements to evaluate capital adequacy, asset quality, management, earnings, liquidity and sensitivity to market risk.
 Effective January 1, 2005, bank holding companies such as the Company became subject to evaluation and examination under a revised bank holding company rating system.
 
The federal financial institution agencies have established bases for analysis and standards for assessing financial institution’s capital adequacy in conjunction with the risk-based capital guidelines, including analysis of interest rate risk, concentrations of credit risk, risk posed by non-traditional activities, and factors affecting overall safety and soundness. If an agency determines that an institution fails to meet any standard, the agency may require the financial institution to submit to the agency an acceptable plan to achieve compliance with the standard. If the agency requires submission of a compliance plan and the institution fails to timely submit an acceptable plan or to implement an accepted plan, the agency will require the institution to correct the deficiency. The agencies may elect to initiate enforcement action in certain cases rather than rely on an existing plan, particularly where failure to meet one or more of the standards could threaten the safe and sound operation of the institution.
 CRA Compliance
 Community Reinvestment Act (“CRA”) regulations evaluate banks’ lending to low and moderate income individuals and businesses across a four-point scale from “outstanding” to “substantial noncompliance,” and are a factor in regulatory review of applications to merge, establish new branches or form bank holding companies. In addition, any bank rated in “substantial noncompliance” with the CRA regulations may be subject to enforcement proceedings. The Bank has a current rating of “satisfactory” for CRA compliance.
 FDIC Insurance
 The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) is an independent federal agency that insures deposits of federally insured banks (such as the Bank) and savings institutions up to prescribed limits through the Deposit Insurance Fund (“DIF”). All depository accounts of the Bank are covered by FDIC insurance up to established maximum limits.

The amount of FDIC assessments paid by each DIF member institution for insurance coverage is based on its risk profile as measured by regulatory capital ratios and other supervisory factors. In 2011, as required by the Dodd-Frank Act, the FDIC revised the assessment rates and the deposit insurance assessment base used to calculate premiums paid to DIF. The FDIC also increased the minimum designated reserve ratio (“DRR”) to 2.0 percent, which has remained in effect.
 On June 16, 2015, the FDIC proposed changes to the deposit insurance assessments for small insured banks having total assets less than $10 billion which have been insured for at least five years, based upon experience with bank failures. The changes, among other matters, revise the financial ratios method of determining assessments to reflect a statistical model estimating the probability of failure over three years and updating the financial measures used in the financial ratios method consistent with the statistical model. The FDIC proposed additional changes on October 25, 2015 to require banks with over $10 billion in assets to be responsible for the recapitalization of the DIF to 1.35 percent of insured deposits after achieving a1.15 percent reserve ratio. On January 21, 2016, the FDIC proposed further revisions to the small insured bank assessments as the result of comments and recommendations received in response to its earlier proposal. The FDIC proposes that a final rule would go into effect the quarter after adoptions, but the amendments would not become operative until the quarter after the DIF reserve ratio reaches 1.15 percent.
 If economic conditions continue to negatively impact financial institutions and there are additional bank and other financial institutions failures, or if the FDIC otherwise determines, the Bank may be required to pay higher FDIC premiums in the future (including the possibility of special assessments and the requirement to prepay estimated quarterly risk-based assessments), which could have a material and adverse effect on the earnings of the Company.
 Limitation on Dividends
 FNB Bancorp. The Company’s ability to pay cash dividends is subject to restrictions set forth in the California General Corporation Law. See discussion under “Small Business Jobs Act of 2010,” below.
 Funds for payment of any cash dividends by the Company could be obtained from its investments, equity sales or dividends received from the Bank. The Bank’s ability to pay cash dividends is subject to restrictions imposed under the National Bank Act and regulations promulgated by the OCC.
 The Company has paid quarterly dividends for each quarter commencing with the second quarter of 2002. Future dividends will continue to be determined after consideration of the Company’s earnings, financial condition, future capital funds, regulatory requirements and other relevant factors.
 The California General Corporation Law provides that neither a corporation nor any of its subsidiaries shall make a distribution to the corporation’s shareholders unless the board of directors has determined in good faith either of the following: (1) the amount of retained earnings of the corporation immediately prior to the distribution equals or exceeds the sum of (A) the amount of the proposed distribution plus (B) the preferential dividends arrears amount; or (2) immediately after the distribution, the value of the corporation’s assets would equal or exceed the sum of its total liabilities plus the preferential rights amount. The good faith determination of the board of directors may be based upon (1) financial statements prepared on the basis of reasonable accounting practices and principles, (2) a fair valuation, or (3) any other method reasonable under the circumstances; provided, that a distribution may not be made if the corporation or subsidiary making the distribution is, or is likely to be, unable to meet its liabilities (except those whose payment is otherwise adequately provided for) as they mature. The term “preferential dividends arrears amount” means the amount, if any, of cumulative dividends in arrears on all shares having a preference with respect to payment of dividends over the class or series to which the applicable distribution is being made, provided that if the articles of incorporation provide that a distribution can be made without regard to preferential dividends arrears amount, then the preferential dividends arrears amount shall be zero. The term “preferential rights amount” means the amount that would be needed if the corporation were to be dissolved at the time of the distribution to satisfy the preferential rights, including accrued but unpaid dividends, of other shareholders upon dissolution that are superior to the rights of the shareholders receiving the distribution, provided that if the articles of incorporation provide that a distribution can be made without regard to any preferential rights, then the preferential rights amount shall be zero.

The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System generally prohibits a bank holding company from declaring or paying a cash dividend which would impose undue pressure on the capital of subsidiary banks or would be funded only through borrowing or other arrangements that might adversely affect a bank holding company’s financial position. The Federal Reserve Board policy is that a bank holding company should not continue its existing rate of cash dividends on its common stock unless its net income is sufficient to fully fund each dividend and its prospective rate of earnings retention appears consistent with its capital needs, asset quality and overall financial condition.
 First National Bank of Northern California. As the Bank’s sole shareholder, the Company is entitled to receive dividends when and as declared by the Bank’s Board of Directors, out of funds legally available therefore, subject to the restrictions set forth in the National Bank Act.
 The payment of cash dividends by the Bank may be subject to the approval of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, as well as restrictions established by federal banking law and the FDIC. Approval of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency is required if the total of all dividends declared by the Bank’s Board of Directors in any calendar year will exceed the Bank’s net profits for that year combined with its retained net profits for the preceding two years, less any required transfers to surplus or to a fund for the retirement of preferred stock.
 Additionally, the FDIC and/or the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, might, under some circumstances, place restrictions on the ability of a bank to pay dividends.
 Competitive Data
 In its market area, the Bank competes for deposit and loan customers with other banks (including those with much greater resources), thrifts and, to a lesser extent, credit unions, finance companies and other financial service providers.
 Larger banks may have a competitive advantage because of higher lending limits and major advertising and marketing campaigns, along with significant investment banking, trust and insurance operations. The Bank has made arrangements with its correspondent banks and with others to provide some of these services for its customers.
 For borrowers requiring loans in excess of the Bank’s legal lending limits, the Bank has offered, and intends to offer in the future, such loans on a participating basis with other insured financial institutions, retaining the portion of such loans which is within its lending limits.
 As of December 31, 2016, the Bank’s aggregate legal lending limits to a single borrower and such borrower’s related parties were $17,937,000 on an unsecured basis and $29,895,000 on a fully secured basis, based on regulatory Total Risk-Based Capital of $119,582,000. The Bank’s business is concentrated in its service area, which primarily encompasses San Mateo County, Santa Clara County and the City and County of San Francisco. The economy of the Bank’s service area is dependent upon government, manufacturing, tourism, retail sales, population growth and smaller service oriented businesses.
 Based upon the most recent information made available by the FDIC Summary of Deposits at June 30, 2016, there were 30 commercial and savings banking institutions in San Mateo County with a total of $34,316,533,000 in deposits at June 30, 2016. The Bank had a total of 8 offices in the county with total deposits of $800,783,000 at the same date, or 2.33% of the San Mateo County totals. There were 46 banking and savings institutions in the City and County of San Francisco with a total of $204,323,373,000 in deposits at June 30, 2016. The Bank had a total of 4 offices in the county with total deposits of $175,480,000, or 0.09% of the County of San Francisco totals. There were 47 commercial and savings banking institutions in Santa Clara County with a total of $123,789,242,000 in deposits at June 30, 2016. The Bank had a total of one office in the county, opened in April, 2014, with total deposits of $33,010,000 or 0.03% of the Santa Clara County totals at June 30, 2016. Offices of the Bank in San Mateo County, Santa Clara and the City and County of San Francisco have averaged annual deposit growth of 11.72% over the two-year period ended June 30, 2016.
 General Competitive Factors
 In order to compete with the financial institutions in their primary service areas, community banks such as the Bank, use, to the fullest extent possible, the flexibility which is accorded by their independent status. This includes an emphasis on specialized services, local promotional activity, and personal contacts by their respective officers, directors and employees. The Bank’s management and employees develop a thorough knowledge of local businesses and markets.

20
--

Community banks also seek to provide special services and programs for individuals in their primary service area who are employed in the agricultural, professional and business fields, such as loans for equipment, furniture and tools of the trade or expansion of practices or businesses. In the event there are customers whose loan demands exceed their respective lending limits, they seek to arrange for such loans on a participation basis with other financial institutions. They also assist those customers requiring services not available at such banks to obtain such services from correspondent banks.
 Banking is a business that depends on interest rate differentials. In general, the difference between the interest rate paid by a bank to obtain their deposits and other borrowings and the interest rate received by a bank on loans extended to customers and on securities held in a bank’s investment portfolio comprise the major portion of a bank’s earnings. The Bank competes with savings and loan associations, credit unions, other financial institutions and other entities for funds.
 The Bank also competes for loans with savings and loan associations, credit unions, consumer finance companies, banking and other financial institutions, mortgage companies and other lending institutions.
 The interest rate differentials of a bank, and therefore its earnings, are affected not only by general economic conditions, but also by statutes, as implemented by federal agencies. The Federal Reserve Board can and does implement national monetary policy, such as seeking to curb inflation and combat recession, by its open market operations in United States government securities, and adjustments to the discount rates applicable to borrowing by banks from the Federal Reserve Banks.
 These activities influence the growth of bank loans, investments and deposits and also affect interest rates charged on loans and paid on deposits. The nature and timing of any future changes in monetary policies and their impact on the Bank are not predictable.
 Impact of Certain Legislation and Regulation
 National banks that are well capitalized, have a high overall rating and a satisfactory CRA rating, and are not subject to an enforcement order may engage in activities related to banking through operating subsidiaries subject to an expedited application process. In addition, a national bank may apply to the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency to engage in an activity through a subsidiary in which the Bank itself may not engage.
 The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 (the “Act”), eliminated most of the remaining depression-era “firewalls” between banks, securities firms and insurance companies which were established by the Banking Act of 1933, also known as the Glass-Steagall Act (“Glass-Steagall”).
 Glass-Steagall sought to insulate banks as depository institutions from the perceived risks of securities dealing and underwriting, and related activities. The Act repealed Section 20 of Glass-Steagall, which prohibited banks from affiliating with securities firms. Bank holding companies that can qualify as “financial holding companies” can now, among other matters, acquire securities firms or create them as subsidiaries, and securities firms can now acquire banks or start banking activities through a financial holding company. The Act includes provisions which permit national banks to conduct financial activities through a subsidiary that are permissible for a national bank to engage in directly, as well as certain activities authorized by statute, or that are financial in nature or incidental to financial activities to the same extent as permitted to a “financial holding company” or its affiliates. This liberalization of United States banking and financial services regulation applies both to domestic institutions and foreign institutions conducting business in the United States. Consequently, the common ownership of banks, securities firms and insurance is now possible, as is the conduct of commercial banking, merchant banking, and investment management, securities underwriting and insurance within a single financial institution using a structure authorized by the Act.
 The Act removed these restrictions and substantially eliminated the prohibitions under the Bank Holding Company Act on affiliations between banks and insurance companies. Bank holding companies which qualify as financial holding companies can now, among other matters, insure, guarantee, or indemnify against loss, harm, damage, illness, disability, or death; issue annuities; and act as a principal, agent, or broker regarding such insurance services.

--

A bank holding company will qualify if (i) its banking subsidiaries are “well capitalized” and “well managed” and (ii) it files with the Board of Governors a certification to such an effect and a declaration that it elects to become a financial holding company. The amendment of the Bank Holding Company Act now permits financial holding companies to engage in activities, and acquire companies engaged in activities, that are financial in nature or incidental to such financial activities.
 Financial holding companies are also permitted to engage in activities that are complementary to financial activities if the Board of Governors determines that the activity does not pose a substantial risk to the safety or soundness of depository institutions or the financial system in general. These standards expand upon the list of activities “closely related to banking” which to date have defined the permissible activities of bank holding companies under the Bank Holding Company Act. One further effect of the Act was to require that federal financial institution and securities regulatory agencies prescribe regulation to implement the policy that financial institutions must respect the privacy of their customers and protect the security and confidentiality of customers’ non-public personal information. These regulations require, in general, that financial institutions (1) may not disclose non-public information of customers to non-affiliated third parties without notice to their customers, who must have an opportunity to direct that such information not be disclosed; (2) may not disclose customer account numbers except to consumer reporting agencies; and (3) must give prior disclosure of their privacy policies before establishing new customer relationships. Neither the Company nor the Bank has determined whether or when it may seek to acquire and exercise new powers or activities under the Act.
 Volcker Rule
 On December 10, 2013, the federal banking agencies jointly issued a final rule implementing the so-called “Volcker Rule” (set forth in Section 619 of the Dodd-Frank Act). The Volcker rule prohibits depository institutions, companies that control such institutions, bank holding companies, and the affiliates and subsidiaries of such banking entities, from engaging as principal for the trading account of the banking entity in any purchase or sale of one or more covered financial instruments (so-called “proprietary trading”) and imposes limitations upon retaining interests in, sponsoring, investing in and transacting with certain investment funds, including hedge funds and private equity funds. Certain activities involving underwriting, risk mitigation hedging, and transactions on behalf of customers as a fiduciary or riskless principal are not prohibited proprietary trading, including purchases and sales of financial instruments which are either obligations of or issued or guaranteed by (i) the United States or agencies thereof; (ii) a State or political subdivision including municipal securities; or (iii) the FDIC. Notwithstanding these permissible activities, no such activities are permitted if they would (i) involve or result in a material conflict of interest between the banking entity and its clients, customers, or counterparties; (ii) result, directly or indirectly, in a material exposure by the banking entity to a high-risk asset or a high-risk trading strategy; or (iii) pose a threat to the safety and soundness of the banking entity or the financial stability of the United States. Neither the Company nor the Bank engages in activities prohibited by the Volcker Rule and management does not expect the Volcker Rule to have a material impact upon the Company or the Bank.
The Patriot Act
 On October 26, 2001, President Bush signed the USA Patriot Act (the “Patriot Act”), which included provisions pertaining to domestic security, surveillance procedures, border protection, and terrorism laws to be administered by the Secretary of the Treasury.
 
Title III of the Patriot Act entitled, “International Money Laundering Abatement and Anti-Terrorist Financing Act of 2001” includes amendments to the Bank Secrecy Act which expand the responsibilities of financial institutions in regard to anti-money laundering activities with particular emphasis upon international money laundering and terrorism financing activities through designated correspondent and private banking accounts.
 Effective December 25, 2001, Section 313(a) of the Patriot Act prohibits any insured financial institution such as the Bank, from providing correspondent accounts to foreign banks which do not have a physical presence in any country (designated as “shell banks”), subject to certain exceptions for regulated affiliates of foreign banks. Section 313(a) also requires financial institutions to take reasonable steps to ensure that foreign bank correspondent accounts are not being used to indirectly provide banking services to foreign shell banks, and Section 319(b) requires financial institutions to maintain records of the owners and agent for service of process of any such foreign banks with whom correspondent accounts have been established.
  
22
--

Effective July 23, 2002, Section 312 of the Patriot Act created a requirement for special due diligence for correspondent accounts and private banking accounts. Under Section 312, each financial institution that establishes, maintains, administers, or manages a private banking account or a correspondent account in the United States for a non-United States person, including a foreign individual visiting the United States, or a representative of a non-United States person, shall establish appropriate, specific, and, where necessary, enhanced, due diligence policies, procedures, and controls that are reasonably designed to detect and record instances of money laundering through those accounts.
 The Patriot Act contains various provisions in addition to Sections 312 and 313(a) that affect the operations of financial institutions by encouraging cooperation among financial institutions, regulatory authorities and law enforcement authorities with respect to individuals, entities and organizations engaged in, or reasonably suspected of engaging in, terrorist acts or money laundering activities. The Company and the Bank are not currently aware of any account relationships between the Bank and any foreign bank or other person or entity as described above under Sections 312 or 313(a) of the Patriot Act.
 Certain surveillance provisions of the Patriot Act, scheduled to expire, were extended by President Bush. Then, in May 2011, President Obama signed a further four-year extension of the surveillance provisions. Some surveillance provisions of the Patriot Act expired on June 1, 2015, but were renewed the next day by the passage of the USA Freedom Act on June 2, 2015 and extended through 2019. However, the provision under which the National Security Agency(“NSA”) conducted mass phone data collection on individuals was changed to require the NSA to seek permission from a federal court in order to obtain such data from phone companies.
 The effect which the Patriot Act and any amendments to the Patriot Act or any additional legislation enacted by Congress may have upon financial institutions is uncertain; however, such legislation could increase compliance costs and thereby potentially may have an adverse effect upon the Company’s results of operations.
 Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002
 On July 30, 2002, President George W. Bush signed into law the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the “Act”), legislation designed to address certain issues of corporate governance and accountability. The key provisions of the Act and the rules promulgated by the SEC pursuant to the Act include the following:

 The Company’s common stock is not currently listed on any exchange. The common stock is quoted and traded on the OTC market. If the Company were to be listed on NASDAQ, in addition to the rules promulgated by the SEC pursuant to the Act, the Company would be required to comply with the listing standards applicable to all exchange listed companies.
 The Company has incurred and it is anticipated that it will continue to incur costs to comply with the Act and the rules and regulations promulgated pursuant to the Act by the Securities and Exchange Commission and other regulatory agencies having jurisdiction over the Company on the issuance and listing of its securities. The Company does not currently anticipate, however, that compliance with the Act and such rules and regulations will have a material effect upon its financial position or results of its operations or its cash flows.
 California Corporate Disclosure Act
 Effective January 1, 2003, the California Corporate Disclosure Act (the “CCD Act”) required publicly traded corporations incorporated or qualified to do business in California to disclose information about their past history, auditors, directors and officers. Effective September 28, 2004, the CCD Act, as currently in effect and codified at California Corporations Code Section 1502.1, requires such companies (including the Company) to file with the California Secretary of State and disclose within 150 days after the end of its fiscal year certain information including the following:

• | The name of a company’s independent auditor and a description of services, if any, performed for a company during the previous two fiscal years and the period from the end of the most recent fiscal year to the date of filing;

The Company does not currently anticipate that compliance with the CCD Act will have a material adverse effect upon its financial position or results of its operations.
 Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008
 On October 3, 2008, the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 (the “EESA”) was signed into law. Pursuant to the EESA, the United States Department of the Treasury (the “U.S. Treasury”) was granted the authority to take a range of actions for the purpose of stabilizing and providing liquidity to the U.S. financial markets and has implemented several programs, including the purchase by the U.S. Treasury of certain troubled assets from financial institutions under the Troubled Asset Relief Program” (the “TARP”) and the direct purchase by the U.S. Treasury of equity securities of financial institutions under the Capital Purchase Program (the “CPP”). The Company no longer participates in the CPP.
American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
 On February 17, 2009, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (the “ARRA”) was signed into law. Section 7001 of the ARRA amended Section 111 of the EESA in its entirety.
 While the U.S. Treasury was required to promulgate regulations to implement the restrictions and standards set forth in Section 7001, the ARRA, among other things, significantly expands the executive compensation restrictions previously imposed by the EESA. Such restrictions apply to any entity that has received or will receive financial assistance under the TARP, and shall generally continue to apply for as long as any obligation arising from financial assistance provided under the TARP, including preferred stock issued under the CPP, remains outstanding. These ARRA restrictions do not apply to any TARP recipient during such time when the federal government (i) only holds any warrants to purchase common stock of such recipient or (ii) holds no preferred stock or warrants to purchase common stock of such recipient.
 Small Business Jobs Act of 2010
 On September 27, 2010, President Obama signed into law the Small Business Jobs Act of 2010 (the “SBJ Act”), which, among other matters, authorizes the U.S. Treasury to buy up to $30 billion in preferred stock or subordinated debt issued by community banks (or their bank holding companies provided 90% of the funds received are down-streamed to the bank subsidiary) with assets less than $10 billion pursuant to the Small Business Lending Fund (the “SBLF”) created under the SBJ Act. Funds received as capital investments will qualify as Tier 1 capital. The SBLF investments are intended to increase the availability of credit for small businesses and thereby induce the creation of jobs in support of economic recovery. The participating banks (or bank holding companies) will pay an annual dividend on the preferred stock or subordinated debt purchased by the U.S. Treasury in an amount which ranges between 5% and 1% during the initial measurement period of approximately two years determined by reducing the dividend rate 1% for every 2.5% increase in the bank’s small business lending up to a lending increase of 10%. The dividend rate will be adjusted quarterly during the initial period. If a participant’s lending activity does not increase in the initial period, the dividend rate will increase thereafter to 7%. After 4.5 years, the dividend rate i On September 15, 2011, as part of the Small Business Lending Fund (“SBLF”) program established under the Small Business Jobs Act of 2010, the Company entered into and consummated a SBLF Securities Purchase Agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”) with the Secretary of the Treasury (“Treasury”), pursuant to which the Company (i) issued and sold to Treasury a total of 12,600 shares of the Company’s Senior Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series C (the “Series C Preferred Stock”), having a liquidation preference amount of $1,000 per share, for a purchase price of $12,600,000. The Series C Preferred Stock qualifies as Tier 1 capital.
 All of the $12,600,000 proceeds from the Company’s sale of its Series C Preferred Stock were immediately applied to the Company’s repurchase of outstanding shares of preferred stock which were issued to the United States Department of the Treasury on February 27, 2009, pursuant to the TARP Capital Purchase Program authorized by the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008, as amended by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. The aggregate redemption price for the outstanding shares of preferred stock was $12,654,500. The $54,500 price differential was paid by the Company in cash.
 On September 15, 2011, as part of the Small Business Lending Fund (“SBLF”) program established under the Small Business Jobs Act of 2010, the Company entered into and consummated a SBLF Securities Purchase Agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”) with the Secretary of the Treasury (“Treasury”), pursuant to which the Company (i) issued and sold to Treasury a total of 12,600 shares of the Company’s Senior Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series C (the “Series C Preferred Stock”), having a liquidation preference amount of $1,000 per share, for a purchase price of $12,600,000. The Series C Preferred Stock qualifies as Tier 1 capital.

All of the $12,600,000 proceeds from the Company’s sale of its Series C Preferred Stock were immediately applied to the Company’s repurchase of outstanding shares of preferred stock which were issued to the United States Department of the Treasury on February 27, 2009, pursuant to the TARP Capital Purchase Program authorized by the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008, as amended by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. The aggregate redemption price for the outstanding shares of preferred stock was $12,654,500. The $54,500 price differential was paid by the Company in cash.
 Subject to the prior approval of the appropriate Federal Banking Agency, the Series C Preferred Stock may be redeemed, in whole or in part, at any time at the option of the Company, at a redemption price of 100% of the liquidation preference amount plus any accrued and unpaid dividends for the then current period, to the date of redemption.
 On May 6, 2013, the Company redeemed 25% of the original issue $12,600,000 of Series C Preferred Stock for a cash payment of $3,150,000. Subsequently, on January 23, 2014, the remaining $9,450,000 of Series C Preferred Stock was redeemed by the Company, also in a cash transaction.
 The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010
 On July 21, 2010, President Obama signed into law the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (the “Dodd-Frank Act”). The Dodd-Frank act is intended to restructure the regulation of the financial services sector by, among other things, (i) establishing a framework to identify systemic risks in the financial system implemented by a newly created Financial Stability Oversight Council and other federal banking agencies; (ii) expanding the resolution authority of the federal banking agencies over troubled financial institutions; (iii) authorizing changes to capital and liquidity requirements; (iv) changing deposit insurance assessments; and (v) enhancing regulatory supervision to improve the safety and soundness of the financial services sector. The Dodd-Frank Act is expected to have a significant impact upon our business as its provisions are implemented over time. Below is a summary of certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act which, directly or indirectly, may affect the Company and the Bank.
 Changes to Capital Requirements. The federal banking agencies are required to establish minimum leverage and risk-based capital requirements for banks and bank holding companies which will not be lower and could be higher than current regulatory capital and leverage standards for insured depository institutions. Under these requirements, trust preferred securities will be excluded from Tier 1 capital unless such securities were issued prior to May 19, 2010 by a bank holding company with less than $15 billion in assets. The Company has no trust preferred securities outstanding. The Dodd-Frank Act requires capital increases in times of economic expansion and decreases in times of economic contraction consistent with safety and soundness.
 Enhanced Regulatory Supervision. The Dodd-Frank Act increases regulatory oversight, supervision and examination of banks, bank holding companies and their respective subsidiaries by the appropriate regulatory agency.
 Consumer Protection. The Dodd-Frank Act created the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (“CFPB”) within the Federal Reserve System. The CFPB is responsible for establishing and implementing rules and regulations under various federal consumer protection laws governing certain consumer products and services.
 The CFPB has primary enforcement authority over large financial institutions with assets of $10 billion or more, while smaller institutions will be subject to the CFPB’s rules and regulations through the enforcement authority of the federal banking agencies. States are permitted to adopt consumer protection laws and regulations that are more stringent than those laws and regulations adopted by the CFPB and state attorneys general are permitted to enforce consumer protection laws and regulations adopted by the CFPB.
 Deposit Insurance. The Dodd-Frank Act permanently increased the deposit insurance limit for insured deposits to $250,000 per depositor and extended unlimited deposit insurance to non-interest bearing transaction accounts until December 31, 2012. Other deposit insurance changes under the Dodd-Frank Act include (i) amendment of the assessment base used to calculate an insured depository institution’s deposit insurance premiums paid to the Deposit Insurance Fund (“DIF”) by elimination of deposits and substitution of average consolidated total assets less average tangible equity during the assessment period as the revised assessment base; (ii) increasing the minimum designated reserve ratio (“DRR”) of the DIF from 1.15 percent to 1.35 percent of the estimated amount of total insured deposits; (iii) eliminating the requirement that the FDIC pay dividends to depository institutions when the reserve ratio exceeds certain thresholds; and (iv) repeal of the prohibition upon the payment of interest on demand deposits to be effective one year after the date of enactment of the Dodd-Frank Act. In December 2010, pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, the FDIC increased the reserve ratio of the DIF to 2.0 percent effective January 1, 2011, which has remained in effect.

Transactions with Affiliates. The Dodd-Frank Act enhanced the requirements for certain transactions with affiliates under Section 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act, including an expansion of the definition of “covered transactions” and increasing the amount of time for which collateral requirements regarding covered transactions must be maintained.
 Transactions with Insiders. Insider transaction limitations were expanded through the strengthening of loan restrictions to insiders and the expansion of the types of transactions subject to various limits, including derivative transactions, repurchase agreements, reverse repurchase agreements and securities lending or borrowing transactions. Restrictions were also placed on certain asset sales to and from an insider to an institution, including requirements that such sales be on market terms and, in certain circumstances, approved by the institution’s board of directors.
 Enhanced Lending Limitations. The Dodd-Frank Act strengthened the existing limits on a depository institution’s credit exposure to include credit exposure arising from derivative transactions, repurchase agreements, and securities lending and borrowing transactions.
 Debit Card Interchange Fees. The Dodd-Frank Act required that the amount of any interchange fee charged by a debit card issuer with respect to a debit card transaction must be reasonable and proportional to the cost incurred by the issuer. Within nine months of enactment of the Dodd-Frank Act, the Federal Reserve Board was required to establish standards for reasonable and proportional fees which may take into account the costs of preventing fraud. The restrictions on interchange fees, however, do not apply to banks that, together with their affiliates, have assets of less than $10 billion.
 Interstate Branching. The Dodd-Frank Act authorized national and state banks to establish branches in other states to the same extent as a bank chartered by that state would be permitted to branch. Previously, banks could only establish branches in other states if the host state expressly permitted out-of-state banks to establish branches in that state. Accordingly, banks will be able to enter new markets more freely.
 Charter Conversions. Effective one year after enactment of the Dodd-Frank Act, depository institutions that are subject to a cease and desist order or certain other enforcement actions issued with respect to a significant supervisory matter were prohibited from changing their federal or state charters, except in accordance with certain notice, application and other procedures involving the applicable regulatory agencies.
 Compensation Practices. The Dodd-Frank Act provided that the appropriate federal banking regulators must establish standards prohibiting as an unsafe and unsound practice any compensation plan of a bank holding company or other “covered financial institution” that provides an insider or other employee with “excessive compensation” or could lead to a material financial loss to such firm. In June 2010, prior to the enactment of the Dodd-Frank Act, the federal bank regulatory agencies jointly issued the Interagency Guidance on Sound Incentive Compensation Policies (“Guidance”), which requires that financial institutions establish metrics for measuring the risk to the financial institution of such loss from incentive compensation arrangements and implement policies to prohibit inappropriate risk taking that may lead to material financial loss to the institution. Together, the Frank-Dodd Act and the Guidance may impact the Company’s compensation policies and arrangements.
 Corporate Governance. The Dodd-Frank Act has enhanced corporate governance requirements to include (i) requiring publicly traded companies to give shareholders a non-binding vote on executive compensation at their first annual meeting taking place six months after the enactment and at least every three years thereafter and on so-called “golden parachute” payments in connection with approvals of mergers and acquisitions unless previously voted on by shareholders; (ii) authorizing the SEC to promulgate rules that would allow shareholders to nominate their own candidates for election as directors using a company’s proxy materials; (iii) directing the federal banking regulators to promulgate rules prohibiting excessive compensation paid to executives of depository institutions and their holding companies with assets in excess of $1.0 billion, regardless of whether or not the company is publicly traded; and (iv) authorizing the SEC to prohibit broker discretionary voting on the election of directors and on executive compensation matters.

Many of the requirements under the Dodd-Frank Act will be implemented over an extended period of time and therefore, the nature and extent of regulations that will be issued by various regulatory agencies and the impact such regulations will have on the operations of financial institutions such as the Company and the Bank is unclear. Such regulations resulting from the Dodd-Frank Act may impact the profitability of our business activities, require changes to certain of our business practices, impose upon us more stringent capital, liquidity and leverage ratio requirements or otherwise adversely affect our business. These changes may also require us to invest significant management attention and resources to evaluate and make necessary changes in order to comply with new statutory and regulatory requirements.
 Future Legislation and Regulations
 Certain legislative and regulatory proposals that could affect the Company, the Bank, and the banking business in general are periodically introduced before the United States Congress, the California State Legislature and federal and state government agencies. It is not known to what extent, if any, legislative proposals will be enacted and what effect such legislation would have on the structure, regulation and competitive relationships of financial institutions. It is likely, however, that such legislation could subject the Company and the Bank to increased regulation, disclosure and reporting requirements, competition, and costs of doing business.
 In addition to legislative changes, the various federal and state financial institution regulatory agencies frequently propose rules and regulations to implement and enforce already existing legislation. It cannot be predicted whether or in what form any such rules or regulations will be enacted or the effect that such regulations may have on the Company and the Bank.
 ITEM 1 A. RISK FACTORS
 In addition to the risks associated with the business of banking generally, as described above under Item 1 (Description of Business), the Company’s business, financial condition, operating results, future prospects and stock price can be adversely impacted by certain risk factors, as set forth below, any of which could cause the Company’s actual results to vary materially from the recent results or from the Company’s anticipated future results.
 Extensive Regulation of Banking. The Company’s operations are subject to extensive regulation by federal, state and local governmental authorities and are subject to various laws and judicial and administrative decisions imposing requirements and restrictions on part or all of its operations. The Company believes that it is in substantial compliance in all material respects with laws, rules and regulations applicable to the conduct of its business. Because the Company’s business is highly regulated, the laws, rules and regulations applicable to it are subject to regular modification and change. There can be no assurance that these laws, rules and regulations, or any other laws, rules or regulations, will not be adopted in the future, which could make compliance much more difficult or expensive, restrict the Company’s ability to originate, broker or sell loans, further limit or restrict the amount of commissions, interest or other charges earned on loans originated or sold by the Company, or otherwise adversely affect the Company’s results of operations, financial condition, or future prospects.
 Governmental Fiscal and Monetary Policies. The business of banking is affected significantly by the fiscal and monetary policies of the federal government and its agencies. Such policies are beyond the control of the Company. The Company is particularly affected by the policies established by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System in relation to the supply of money and credit in the United States, and the target federal funds rate.
 The instruments of monetary policy available to the Board of Governors can be used in varying degrees and combinations to directly affect the availability of bank loans and deposits, as well as the interest rates charged on loans and paid on deposits, and this can and does have a material effect on the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition. Federal monetary policy may also affect the longer-term inflation rate which directly affects the national and local economy.
 The Effects of Legislation in Response to Credit Conditions. Legislation passed at the federal level and/or by the State of California in response to conditions affecting credit markets could cause the Company to experience higher credit losses if such legislation reduces the amount that borrowers are otherwise contractually required to pay under existing loan contracts with the Bank. Such legislation could also result in the imposition of limitations upon the Bank’s ability to foreclose on property or other collateral or make foreclosure less economically feasible. Such events could result in increased loan losses and require a material increase in the allowance for loan losses and thereby adversely affect the Company’s results of operations, financial condition, future prospects, profitability and stock price.

Geographic Concentration. All of the banking offices of the Company are located in the Northern California Counties of San Mateo, Santa Clara and San Francisco. The Company and the Bank conduct business primarily in the San Francisco Bay Area. As a result, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows are subject to changes in the economic conditions in this area. Our success depends upon the business activity, population, income levels, deposits and real estate activity in these markets, and adverse economic conditions could reduce our growth rate, or affect the ability of our customers to repay their loans, and generally impact our financial condition and results of operations. Economic conditions in the State of California are subject to various uncertainties at this time, including the budgetary and fiscal difficulties facing the State government.
 Competition. Increased competition in the market areas served by the Bank may result in reduced loans and deposits. Ultimately, the Bank may not be able to compete successfully against current and future bank and non-bank competitors.
 Many competitors offer the banking services that are offered by the Bank in its service area. These competitors include national and super-regional banks, finance companies, investment banking and brokerage firms, credit unions, government-assisted farm credit programs, other community banks and technology-oriented financial institutions offering online services. In particular, the Bank’s competitors include several major financial companies whose greater resources may afford them a marketplace advantage by enabling them to maintain numerous banking locations and mount extensive promotional and advertising campaigns. Additionally, banks and other financial institutions with larger capitalization and financial intermediaries not subject to bank regulatory restrictions have larger lending limits and are thereby able to serve the credit needs of larger customers. Areas of competition include interest rates for loans and deposits, efforts to obtain deposits, and range and quality of products and services provided, including new technology-driven products and services. Technological innovation continues to contribute to greater competition in domestic and international financial services markets as technological advances, such as Internet-based banking services that cross traditional geographic bounds, enable more companies to provide financial services.
 The Effects of Changes to FDIC Insurance Assessments. FDIC insurance assessments are uncertain and increased premiums may adversely affect the Bank’s earnings. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation charges insured financial institutions premiums to maintain the Deposit Insurance Fund. Bank failures increased significantly during the recent economic downturn, causing the FDIC to take control of the failed institutions and guarantee the payment of deposits up to applicable insured limits from the Deposit Insurance Fund. The sustainability of the current economic recovery is uncertain and a deterioration of economic conditions may cause losses which require premium increases to replenish the Deposit Insurance Fund and such increases could adversely impact the Bank’s earnings.
 On November 9, 2010, the FDIC issued a final rule implementing section 343 of the Dodd-Frank Act that made permanent a $250,000 deposit insurance limit per depositor. In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act also made other deposit insurance changes which may affect our insurance premium assessments to include (i) amendment of the assessment base used to calculate an insured depository institution’s deposit insurance premiums paid to the DIF by elimination of deposits and substitution of average consolidated total assets less average tangible equity during the assessment period as the revised assessment base; (ii) increasing the minimum designated reserve ratio of the DIF; (iii) eliminating the requirement that the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation pay dividends to depository institutions when the reserve ratio exceeds certain thresholds; and (iv) repeal of the prohibition upon the payment of interest on demand deposits to be effective one year after the date of enactment of the Dodd-Frank Act.
 Interest Rate Risk. Our earnings and cash flows are largely dependent upon our net interest income. Net interest income is the difference between interest income earned on interest-earning assets, such as loans and securities, and interest expense paid on interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits and borrowed funds.
 Interest rates are sensitive to many factors outside our control, including general economic conditions and policies of various governmental and regulatory agencies and, in particular, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, which regulates the supply of money and credit in the United States. Changes in monetary policy, including changes in interest rates, could influence not only the interest we receive on loans and securities and interest we pay on deposits and borrowings, but could also affect (i) our ability to originate loans and obtain deposits, (ii) the fair value of our financial assets and liabilities, and (iii) the average duration of our mortgage-backed securities portfolio. Our portfolio of securities is subject to interest rate risk and will generally decline in value if market interest rates increase, and generally increase in value if market interest rates decline.

Technology and Technological Change. The financial services industry is continually undergoing rapid technological change with frequent introductions of new technology-driven products and services. The effective use of technology will enable efficiency and meeting customers’ changing needs. Our future success depends, in part, upon our ability to address the needs of our customers by using technology to provide products and services that will satisfy customer demands, as well as to create additional efficiencies in our operations. Many of our competitors have substantially greater resources to invest in technological improvements. We may not be able to effectively implement new technology-driven products and services or be successful in marketing these products and services to retain and compete for customers. Failure to successfully keep pace with technological change affecting the financial services industry could have a material adverse impact of the long-term aspect of our business and, in turn, our financial condition and results of operations.
 Dependence on Key Officers and Employees. We are dependent on the successful recruitment and retention of highly qualified personnel. Our ability to implement our business strategies is closely tied to the strengths of our executive officers who have extensive experience in the banking industry but who are not easily replaced. In addition, business banking, one of the Company’s principal lines of business, is dependent on relationship banking, in which the Bank personnel develop professional relationships with small business owners and officers of larger business customers who are responsible for the financial management of the companies they represent. If these employees were to leave the Bank and become employed by a local competing bank, we could potentially lose business customers. In addition, we rely on our customer service staff to effectively serve the needs of our consumer customers. We actively recruit for all open positions and management believes that its relations with employees are good.
 Growth strategy. The Company continues to pursue a growth strategy which depends primarily on generating an increasing level of loans and deposits at acceptable risk levels. We may not be able to sustain our growth strategy without establishing new branches or developing new products. We may attempt to expand by opening new branch offices or acquiring other financial institutions or branch offices or through a purchase, in whole or in part, of other financial institutions. This expansion may require significant investments in equipment, technology, personnel and site locations. We cannot assure you of our success in implementing our growth strategy either through expansion of our existing branch system or through mergers and acquisitions, and there may be significant increases in our noninterest expenses, without any corresponding balance sheet growth. Mergers and acquisitions may not add to the growth of the Bank’s loans, deposits or the Bank’s profitability due to integration problems, collateral differences, changes in business conditions, or other unforeseen circumstances.

Commercial loans. As of December 31, 2016, approximately 7% of our loan portfolio consisted of commercial business loans, which could have a higher degree of risk than other types of loans. Commercial lending is dependent on borrowers making payments on their loans and lines of credit in accordance with the terms of their notes. Worsening economic conditions could make it difficult for many commercial borrowers to make their required loan payments. This credit risk is increased when there is a concentration of principal in a limited number of loans and borrowers, the mobility of collateral, and the increased difficulty of evaluating and monitoring these types of loans. The availability of funds for the repayment of commercial business loans may be substantially dependent on the success of the business itself and the general economic environment. If the cash flow from business operations is reduced, the borrower’s ability to repay the loan may be impaired.
 In addition, unlike residential mortgage loans, which generally are made on the basis of the borrower’s ability to make repayment from his or her employment and other income and which are secured by real property whose value tends to be more easily ascertainable, commercial business loans typically are made on the basis of the borrower’s ability to make repayment from the cash flow of the borrower’s business. If the Bank is required to repossess equipment or pursue collection efforts under personal guarantees, there could be a substantial decrease in value of collateral, if any, increased legal costs, and an increased risk of loss on the amount outstanding.

Real Estate Values. A large portion of the loan portfolio of the Company is dependent on the performance of our real estate portfolio. At December 31, 2016, real estate (including construction loans) served as the principal source of collateral with respect to approximately 93% of the Company’s loan portfolio.
 A substantial decline in the economy in general, coupled with a continued decline in real estate values in the Company’s primary operating market areas could have an adverse effect on the demand for new loans, the ability of borrowers to repay outstanding loans, and the value of real estate and other collateral securing loans. Real estate values have declined, due in part to reduced construction lending, tighter underwriting requirements, and reduced borrower ability to make payments. Real estate loans may pose collection problems, resulting in increased collection expenses, and delays in the ultimate collection of these loans. In addition, acts of nature, including fires, earthquakes and floods, which may cause uninsured damage and other loss of value to real estate that secures these loans, may also negatively impact the Company’s financial condition.
 Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses. The Company maintains an allowance for loan losses to provide for inherent loan defaults and non-performance, but its allowance for loan losses may not be adequate to cover actual loan and lease losses. In addition, future provisions for loan and lease losses could materially and adversely affect the Company and therefore the Company’s operating results. The Company’s allowance for loan and lease losses is based on prior experience, as well as an evaluation of the risks in the current portfolio. The amount of future losses is susceptible to changes in economic, operating and other conditions, including changes in interest rates that may be beyond the Company’s control, and these losses current estimates. Federal regulatory agencies, as an integral part of their examination process, review the Company’s loans and the allowance for loan and lease losses. Although we believe that the Company’s allowance for loan and lease losses is adequate to cover inherent future losses, we cannot assure you that we will not further increase the allowance for loan and lease losses or that the regulators will not require us to increase this allowance. Either of these occurrences could materially and adversely affect the Company’s earnings.
 Other Real Estate Owned (“OREO”). Real estate acquired through, or in lieu of, loan foreclosures is expected to be sold and is recorded at its fair value less estimated costs to sell (fair value). The amount, if any, by which the recorded amount of the loan exceeds the fair value (less estimated costs to sell) are charged to the allowance for loan or lease losses, if necessary. The Company’s earnings could be materially and adversely affected by various expenses associated with OREO, including legal expenses, personnel costs, insurance and taxes, completion and repair costs, valuation adjustments, and other expenses associated with property ownership. Also, any further decrease in market prices of real estate in our market areas may lead to additional OREO write downs, with a corresponding expense in our income statement. At December 31, 2016 and 2015, our OREO totaled $1,427,000 and $1,026,000, respectively.
 Environmental Liabilities. In the course of our business, we may foreclose and take title to real estate, and could become subject to environmental liabilities with respect to these properties. We may be held liable to a governmental entity or third parties for property damage, personal injury, investigation and clean-up costs incurred by these parties in connection with environmental contamination, or may be required to investigate or clean up hazardous or toxic substances, or chemical releases at a property. The costs associated with investigations or remediation activities could be substantial. In addition, as the owner or former owner of a contaminated site, we could become subject to common law claims by third parties based on damages and costs resulting from environmental contamination emanating from the property. If we ever become subject to significant environmental liabilities, our business prospects, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations and stock price could be materially and adversely affected.
 Limited Trading in our Common Stock and Dilution. The common stock of the Company is not listed on any exchange. Over-the-counter trades are quoted on the OTCQB marketplace under the trading symbol “FNBG” and our trading volume is less than that of larger financial institutions.
 We are not restricted from issuing additional shares of common stock, or securities that are convertible into or exchangeable for or that represent the right to receive common stock, including stock options. The issuance of substantial amounts of the Company’s newly issued common stock in the public market could be substantially dilutive to shareholders of our common stock and could adversely affect the market price of the Company’s common stock. The Articles of Incorporation of the Company authorize the issuance of 10,000,000 shares of common stock, of which 4,853,415 were outstanding at December 31, 2016. Pursuant to its 1997, 2002 and 2008 Stock Option Plans, at December 31, 2016, the Company had outstanding options to purchase a total of 448,855 shares of common stock. As of December 31, 2016, 346,000 shares of common stock remained available for grants under the 2008 Stock Option Plan.

Controls and Procedures. Management regularly reviews and updates the Company’s internal control over financial reporting, disclosure controls and procedures, and corporate governance policies and procedures. We maintain controls and procedures to mitigate risks such as processing system failures or errors and customer or employee fraud, and we maintain insurance coverage for certain of these risks. Any system of controls and procedures, however well designed and operated, is based in part on certain assumptions and provides only reasonable, not absolute, certainty that the objectives of the system will be met. Events could occur which are not prevented or detected by our internal controls, are not insured against, or are in excess of our insurance limits. Any failure or circumvention of our controls and procedures, or failure to comply with regulations related to controls and procedures, could have an adverse effect on our business.
 Cybersecurity Losses. The Company is subject to certain operations risks, including, but not limited to, data processing system or cybersecurity failures and customer or employee fraud. The Company maintains a system of internal controls to mitigate against such occurrences and maintains insurance coverage for such risks, but should such an event occur that is not prevented or detected by the Company’s internal controls, uninsured or in excess of applicable insurance limits, it could have a significant adverse impact on the Company’s business, financial condition or results of operations. Additionally, the Company is dependent on network and computer systems. If these systems and their back-up systems were to fail or were breached, the Company could be adversely affected. The company cannot be certain that the continued implementation of safeguards will eliminate the risk of vulnerability to technological difficulties or failures or ensure the absence of a breach of information or security, including as a result of a cybersecurity breach. The bank regulatory agencies have recently emphasized cybersecurity as a critical challenge facing the financial services industry in light of the frequency and sophistication of cyber attacks. The Company and the Bank will continue to enhance their information security programs consistent with regulatory requirements, including reliance on the services of various vendors who provide data processing and communications services to the financial services industry. Nonetheless, if information security is compromised or other technology difficulties or failures occur at the Bank or with one of its vendors, information may be lost or misappropriared, services and operations may be interrupted and the Bank could be exposed to claims from its customers.
 Business Confidence Uncertainty. Terrorist activities in the future and the actions taken by the United States and its allies in combating terrorism on a worldwide basis could adversely impact the Company and the extent of such impact is uncertain. Even more so, the problems in the mortgage and credit markets, the government conservatorship of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, as well as large write-offs at some major financial institutions have had a negative impact on the entire financial services industry. Such events have had an adverse effect on the economy in the Company’s market areas.
 Federal Home Loan Bank Risk. The failure of the Federal Home Loan Bank (“FHLB”) of San Francisco or the national Federal Home Loan Bank System may have a material negative impact on our earnings and liquidity.
 Even though the FHLB of San Francisco has announced it does not anticipate that additional capital will be necessary, nor does it believe that its capital level is inadequate to support realized losses in the future, the FHLB of San Francisco could require its members, including the Bank, to contribute additional capital in order to return the FHLB of San Francisco to compliance with capital guidelines.
 At December 31, 2016, the Bank held $5.6 million of common stock in the FHLB of San Francisco. Should the FHLB of San Francisco fail, we anticipate that our investment in the FHLB’s common stock would be “other than temporarily” impaired and may have limited value. The common stock is not publicly traded and the U.S. Government does not guarantee, directly or indirectly, the debt securities or other obligations of the FHLB of San Francisco or the Federal Home Loan Bank System.
 At December 31, 2016, the Bank maintained a line of credit with the FHLB of San Francisco with a maximum borrowing capacity of $452,319,000, of which $380,809,000 was available. Advances under the line of credit are secured by a blanket collateral agreement, a pledge of our FHLB common stock and certain other qualifying collateral, such as commercial and mortgage loans. The Bank is highly dependent on the FHLB of San Francisco as the primary source of wholesale funding for immediate liquidity and borrowing needs. The failure of the FHLB of San Francisco or the FHLB system in general, may materially impair our ability to meet our growth plans or to meet short and long term liquidity demands.
