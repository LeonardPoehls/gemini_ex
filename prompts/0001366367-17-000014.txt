ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Organization
Yadkin Financial Corporation (the "Company" or "Yadkin") is a bank holding company incorporated under the laws of North Carolina on March 2, 2006. The Company is headquartered in Raleigh, North Carolina, and conducts its business primarily through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Yadkin Bank, a North Carolina-chartered commercial bank. Yadkin Bank’s primary business is providing banking, mortgage, investment and insurance services to businesses and consumers across the Carolinas. Yadkin Bank began operations in 1968.
On March 1, 2016, Yadkin completed its acquisition of NewBridge Bancorp (“NewBridge”), pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated October 12, 2015 (the “NewBridge Merger Agreement”), by and among, the Company, Navy Merger Sub Corp., a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company (“Merger Sub”), and NewBridge. At closing, Merger Sub merged with and into NewBridge, with NewBridge surviving and, immediately thereafter, NewBridge merged with and into the Company (the “Integrated Mergers”), with the Company surviving. Pursuant to the NewBridge Merger Agreement, each share of NewBridge Class A common stock and Class B common stock was converted into the right to receive 0.50 shares of the common stock of the Company. Immediately following the Integrated Mergers, NewBridge Bank, a North Carolina-chartered commercial bank, merged with and into Yadkin Bank (together with the Integrated Mergers, the “NewBridge Acquisition”), with Yadkin Bank surviving such merger. 
On July 20, 2016, the Company entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “FNB Merger Agreement”) with F.N.B. Corporation, a Florida corporation (“FNB”). The FNB Merger Agreement provides that, upon the terms and conditions set forth therein, the Company will merge with and into FNB (the “FNB Merger”), with FNB continuing as the surviving corporation. As soon as practicable following consummation of the Merger, the Company’s wholly-owned subsidiary, Yadkin Bank, will merge with and into FNB’s wholly-owned subsidiary, First National Bank of Pennsylvania ("FNB Bank"), with FNB Bank continuing as the surviving entity (the “FNB Bank Merger”). 
Subject to the terms and conditions of the FNB Merger Agreement, at the effective time of the FNB Merger, the Company’s shareholders will have the right to receive 2.16 shares of FNB common stock, par value $0.01, for each share of the Company’s common stock. 
The Company is currently the fourth largest bank headquartered in North Carolina and ranks first by North Carolina deposit market share among community banks. The Company now operates 98 full-service banking locations in its North Carolina and South Carolina banking network and has a significant presence in all major North Carolina markets, including Charlotte, the Raleigh-Durham-Chapel Hill Triangle, the Piedmont Triad, and Wilmington. 
Financial Information Regarding Business Segments
The Company has a single operating segment, which is providing general commercial banking and financial services to individuals and businesses located in North Carolina and South Carolina, and to customers in various states through its U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) lending program. See the Company’s Financial Statements and accompanying Notes in Item 8.

Competition

Commercial banking in North Carolina is highly competitive. The Company competes in its market areas with large regional and national banking organizations, other federally and state chartered financial institutions such as savings and loan institutions and credit unions, consumer finance companies, mortgage companies and other lenders engaged in the business of extending credit. Many competitors have broader geographic markets and higher lending limits than the Company and are also able to provide more services and make greater use of media advertising. All markets in which the Company has a banking office are also served by branches of the largest banks in North Carolina and South Carolina as well as national and international banks.

Despite the competition in its market areas, the Company believes that it has certain competitive advantages that distinguish it from its competition. The Company serves the needs of businesses, business owners, and professionals by creating mutually beneficial and deeply ingrained relationships with its customers and positively impacting its communities. In addition to offering standard banking products and services, the Company's associates build relationships with customers by understanding their personal and business challenges and goals, and providing tangible solutions. The Company offers customers modern banking services and technology with prompt, personal service and friendliness. The Company believes its approach to business builds goodwill among customers, shareholders, and the communities it serves that results in referrals from shareholders and satisfied customers. The Company also relies on traditional marketing to attract new customers. To enhance a positive image in the community, the Company supports and participates in local events, and its officers and directors serve on boards of local civic and charitable organizations.

Merger and Acquisition Strategy
The Company's growth in business, profitability, and market share has historically been enhanced by strategic mergers and acquisitions. The Company has focused on maintaining a merger and acquisition approach that involved disciplined targeting and pricing as well as extensive credit, financial, legal, information technology, and operational due diligence. The Company has also recognized the importance of successfully integrating management teams, policies and procedures, branch networks, systems, and balance sheets. The Company's merger and acquisition process is governed by its Board of Directors and is subject to shareholder and regulatory approvals.
Employees

The Company employed 1,112 full-time and 101 part-time employees as of December 31, 2016, none of which are covered by a collective bargaining agreement. The Company believes that relations with its employees are good.

SUPERVISION AND REGULATION
Bank holding companies and state commercial banks are extensively regulated under both federal and state law. The following is a brief summary of certain statutes and rules and regulations that affect or will affect the Company and the Bank. This summary contains what management believes to be the material information related to the supervision and regulation of the Company and the Bank, but is not intended to be an exhaustive description of the statutes or regulations applicable to their respective businesses. Supervision, regulation and examination of the Company and the Bank by regulatory agencies are intended primarily for the protection of depositors rather than shareholders of the Company. The Company cannot predict whether or in what form any proposed statute or regulation will be adopted or the extent to which the business of the Company and the Bank may be affected by a statute or regulation. The discussion is qualified in its entirety by reference to applicable laws and regulations. Changes in such laws and regulations may have a material effect on our business and prospects.
Bank Holding Company Regulation and Structure
As a bank holding company, the Company is subject to regulation under the Bank Holding Company Act (the “BHCA”) and to the supervision, examination and reporting requirements of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, or the Federal Reserve. The Bank has a North Carolina state charter and is subject to regulation, supervision and examination by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the “FDIC”) and the North Carolina Commissioner of Banks (the “NCCOB”).
The BHCA requires every bank holding company to obtain the prior approval of the Federal Reserve before:

• | it may acquire direct or indirect ownership or control of any voting shares of any other bank holding company if, after the acquisition, the bank holding company will directly or indirectly own or control more than 5 percent of the voting shares of the other bank holding company;


• | it may acquire direct or indirect ownership or control of any voting shares of any bank if, after the acquisition, the bank holding company will directly or indirectly own or control more than 5 percent of the voting shares of the bank;


• | it or any of its subsidiaries, other than a bank, may acquire all or substantially all of the assets of any bank; or


• | it may merge or consolidate with any other bank holding company.

The BHCA further provides that the Federal Reserve may not approve any transaction that would result in a monopoly or that would substantially lessen competition in the banking business, unless the public interest in meeting the needs of the communities to be served outweighs the anti-competitive effects. The Federal Reserve is also required to consider the financial and managerial resources and future prospects of the bank holding companies and banks involved and the convenience and needs of the communities to be served. Consideration of financial resources generally focuses on capital adequacy, and consideration of convenience and needs issues focuses, in part, on the performance under the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 (the “CRA”), both of which are discussed elsewhere in more detail.
Subject to various exceptions, the BHCA and the Change in Bank Control Act, together with related regulations, require Federal Reserve approval prior to any person or company acquiring “control” of a bank holding company. Control is conclusively presumed to exist if an individual or company acquires 25 percent or more of any class of voting securities of a bank holding company. Control is also presumed to exist, although rebuttable, if a person or company acquires 10 percent or more, but less than 25 percent, of any class of voting securities and either:

• | the bank holding company has registered securities under Section 12 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”); or


• | no other person owns a greater percentage of that class of voting securities immediately after the transaction.

The Company’s common stock is registered under Section 12 of the Exchange Act. The regulations provide a procedure for challenging rebuttable presumptions of control.

Historically, the activities of bank holding companies were limited to the business of banking and activities closely related or incidental to banking. Bank holding companies were generally prohibited from acquiring control of any company that was not a bank and from engaging in any business other than the business of banking or managing and controlling banks. The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, which took effect on March 12, 2000, dismantled many Depression-era restrictions against affiliations between banking, securities and insurance firms by permitting bank holding companies to engage in a broader range of financial activities, so long as certain safeguards are observed. Specifically, bank holding companies may elect to become “financial holding companies” that may affiliate with securities firms and insurance companies and engage in other activities that are financial in nature or incidental to a financial activity. The election must be accompanied by a certification that all of the company’s insured depository institution subsidiaries are “well capitalized” and “well managed.” Additionally, the CRA rating of each subsidiary bank must be satisfactory or better. If, after becoming a financial holding company and undertaking activities not permissible for a bank holding company, the company fails to continue to meet any of the prerequisites for financial holding company status, the company must enter into an agreement with the Federal Reserve to comply with all applicable capital and management requirements. If the company does not return to compliance within 180 days, the Federal Reserve may order the company to divest its subsidiary banks, or the company may discontinue or divest investments in companies engaged in activities permissible only for a bank holding company that has elected to be treated as a financial holding company. The Company has not elected to be treated as a financial holding company. 
The Company is required to act as a source of financial strength for the Bank and to commit resources to support the Bank. This support may be required at times when the Company might not be inclined to provide it. In addition, any capital loans made by the Company to the Bank will be repaid only after its deposits and various other obligations are repaid in full.
Bank Merger Act
Section 18(c) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, commonly known as the “Bank Merger Act,” requires the prior written approval of the FDIC before any bank may (i) merge or consolidate with, (ii) purchase or otherwise acquire the assets of, or (iii) assume the deposit liabilities of, another bank if the resulting institution is to be a state nonmember bank.
The Bank Merger Act prohibits the FDIC from approving any proposed merger transaction that would result in a monopoly or would further a combination or conspiracy to monopolize or to attempt to monopolize the business of banking in any part of the United States. Similarly, the Bank Merger Act prohibits the FDIC from approving a proposed merger transaction whose effect in any section of the country may be substantially to lessen competition, or to tend to create a monopoly, or which in any other manner would be in restraint of trade. An exception may be made in the case of a merger transaction whose effect would be to substantially lessen competition, tend to create a monopoly, or otherwise restrain trade, if the FDIC finds that the anticompetitive effects of the proposed transaction are clearly outweighed by the probable effect of the transaction in meeting the convenience and needs of the community to be served.
In every proposed merger transaction, the FDIC must also consider the financial and managerial resources and future prospects of the existing and proposed institutions, the convenience and needs of the communities to be served, and the effectiveness of each insured depository institution involved in the proposed merger transaction in combating money-laundering activities, including in overseas branches.
State Law
The Bank is subject to extensive supervision and regulation by the NCCOB. The NCCOB oversees state laws that set specific requirements for bank capital and that regulate deposits in, and loans and investments by, banks, including the amounts, types, and in some cases, rates. The NCCOB supervises and performs periodic examinations of North Carolina-chartered banks to assure compliance with state banking statutes and regulations, and banks are required to make regular reports to the NCCOB describing in detail their resources, assets, liabilities, and financial condition. Among other things, the NCCOB regulates mergers and consolidations of state-chartered banks, capital requirements for banks, loans to officers and directors, record keeping, types and amounts of loans and investments, and the establishment of branches.
The NCCOB has extensive enforcement authority over North Carolina banks. Such authority includes the ability to issue cease and desist orders and to seek civil money penalties. The NCCOB may also take possession of a North Carolina bank in various circumstances, including for a violation of its charter or of applicable laws, operating in an unsafe and unsound manner, or as a result of an impairment of its capital. The NCCOB also has authority to appoint a receiver.

On October 1, 2012, the North Carolina Banking Law Modernization Act became effective and many of the state banking laws to which the Bank is subject were amended, including laws impacting capital requirements, authorized activities, permissible investments, and numerous operational functions. It is not possible to predict fully the future effects that this legislation may have on the business and earnings of the Bank.
The Bank is also subject to numerous state and federal statutes and regulations that affect its businesses, activities and operations and are supervised and examined by state and federal bank regulatory agencies. The FDIC and the NCCOB regularly examine the operations of the Bank and are given the authority to approve or disapprove mergers, consolidations, the establishment of branches and similar corporate actions.
Capital Adequacy Requirements Under Basel III
The Company must comply with the Federal Reserve’s established capital adequacy standards, and the Bank is required to comply with the capital adequacy standards established by the FDIC. The Federal Reserve has promulgated two basic measures of capital adequacy for bank holding companies: a risk-based measure and a leverage measure. A bank holding company must satisfy all applicable capital standards to be considered in compliance. The Federal Reserve's current capital standards implement the international regulatory capital framework adopted by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision in December 2010, referred to as the "Basel III Rules." The Basel III Rules apply to both depository institutions and (subject to certain exceptions not applicable to the Company) their holding companies. Although parts of the Basel III Rules apply only to large, complex financial institutions, substantial portions of the Basel III Rules apply to the Company and the Bank. Subject to a phase-in period for certain provisions, the Basel III Rules became effective on January 1, 2015.
The Basel III Rules are designed to make regulatory capital requirements more sensitive to differences in risk profile among banks and bank holding companies, account for off-balance-sheet exposure and minimize disincentives for holding liquid assets.
Assets and off-balance-sheet items are assigned to broad risk categories, each with appropriate weights. The resulting capital ratios represent capital as a percentage of total risk-weighted assets and off-balance-sheet items. Under Basel III Rules, there are three categories of capital: (i) common equity Tier 1 Capital, which is common stock, retained earnings, accumulated other comprehensive income ("AOCI") as reported under GAAP, and certain minority interests in the equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries; (ii) additional Tier 1 Capital, which is certain noncumulative perpetual preferred stock and certain minority interests in the equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries which do not qualify for common equity Tier 1 Capital, and together with common equity Tier 1 Capital constitutes Tier 1 Capital; and (iii) Tier 2 Capital, which is subordinated debt, other preferred stock and a limited amount of loan loss reserves.
The minimum capital level requirements applicable to the Company and the Bank under the Basel III Rules are: (i) a ratio of common equity Tier 1 risk-based capital to total assets of 4.5 percent; (ii) a ratio of Tier 1 risk-based capital to total assets of 6 percent; and (iii) a ratio of total risk-based capital to total assets of 8 percent.
The Basel III Rules also establish a “capital conservation buffer” of 2.5 percent above the new regulatory minimum risk-based capital requirements. The conservation buffer, when added to the capital requirements, will result in the following minimum ratios: (i) a common equity Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 7.0 percent, (ii) a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 8.5 percent, and (iii) a total risk-based capital ratio of 10.5 percent. The new capital conservation buffer requirement is to be phased in beginning in January 2016 at 0.625 percent of risk-weighted assets and will increase by that amount each year until fully implemented in January 2019. An institution would be subject to limitations on certain activities including payment of dividends, share repurchases and discretionary bonuses to executive officers if its capital level is below the buffer amount.
As of December 31, 2016, the Company had a common equity Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 10.85 percent, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 11.31 percent, and a total risk-based capital ratio of 12.49 percent.
The Basel III Rules also establish minimum leverage ratio guidelines for bank holding companies. These guidelines provide for a minimum ratio of Tier 1 capital to average assets, less goodwill and certain other intangible assets, of 3 percent for bank holding companies that meet certain criteria. All other bank holding companies generally are required to maintain a minimum leverage ratio of 4 percent. The Company's Tier 1 leverage ratio as of December 31, 2016 was 9.83 percent compared with 9.42 percent as of December 31, 2015. The guidelines also provide that bank holding companies experiencing internal growth or making acquisitions will be expected to maintain strong capital positions substantially above the minimum supervisory levels without significant reliance on intangible assets. Furthermore, the Federal Reserve has indicated that it will consider a "tangible Tier 1 Capital leverage ratio" and other indications of capital strength in evaluating proposals for expansion or new activities. The Federal Reserve has not advised the Company of any additional specific minimum leverage ratio or tangible Tier 1 capital leverage ratio applicable to it.

The Basel III Rules implement certain changes from prior Federal Reserve capital rules in the methods of calculating certain risk-weighted assets, which in turn affects the calculation of risk based ratios. Under the Basel III Rules, higher or more sensitive risk weights are assigned to various categories of assets, including, certain credit facilities that finance the acquisition, development or construction of real property, certain exposures or credits that are 90 days past due or on nonaccrual, foreign exposures and certain corporate exposures. In addition, the Basel III Rules include (i) alternative standards of credit worthiness consistent with the Dodd-Frank Act; (ii) greater recognition of collateral and guarantees; and (iii) revised capital treatment for derivatives and repo-style transactions. 
In addition, the Basel III Rules include certain exemptions to address concerns about the regulatory burden on community banks. For example, banking organizations with less than $15 billion in consolidated assets as of December 31, 2009, are permitted to include in Tier 1 capital trust preferred securities and cumulative perpetual preferred stock issued and included in Tier 1 capital prior to May 19, 2010, on a permanent basis, without any phase out. Community banks were also allowed to elect on a one time basis in to opt-out out of the requirement to include most AOCI components in the calculation of CET1 capital and, in effect, retain the AOCI treatment under the current capital rules. Under the Basel III Rules, the Company may make a one-time, permanent election to continue to exclude accumulated other comprehensive income from capital. If the Company did not make this election, unrealized gains and losses would thereafter be included in the calculation of its regulatory capital. The Company made this election in its March 31, 2015 quarterly financial filings.
Failure to meet capital guidelines could subject a bank to a variety of enforcement remedies, including issuance of a capital directive, the termination of deposit insurance by the FDIC, a prohibition on taking brokered deposits and certain other restrictions on its business. As described below, the FDIC can impose substantial additional restrictions upon FDIC-insured depository institutions that fail to meet applicable capital requirements.
The Federal Deposit Insurance Act, or the FDI Act, requires the federal regulatory agencies to take “prompt corrective action” if a depository institution does not meet minimum capital requirements. The FDI Act establishes five capital tiers: “well capitalized,” “adequately capitalized,” “undercapitalized,” “significantly undercapitalized” and “critically undercapitalized.” A depository institution’s capital tier will depend upon how its capital levels compare to various relevant capital measures and certain other factors, as established by regulation.
The federal bank regulatory agencies have adopted regulations establishing relevant capital measures and relevant capital levels applicable to FDIC-insured banks. The relevant capital measures are the Total Risk-Based Capital ratio, Tier 1 Risk-Based Capital ratio and the leverage ratio. Under the regulations, a FDIC-insured bank will be:

• | “well capitalized” if it has a Total Risk-Based Capital ratio of 10 percent or greater, a Tier 1 Risk-Based Capital ratio of 6 percent or greater and a leverage ratio of 5 percent or greater and is not subject to any order or written directive by the appropriate regulatory authority to meet and maintain a specific capital level for any capital measure;


• | “adequately capitalized” if it has a Total Risk-Based Capital ratio of 8 percent or greater, a Tier 1 Risk-Based Capital ratio of 4 percent or greater and a leverage ratio of 4 percent or greater (3 percent in certain circumstances) and is not “well capitalized;”


• | “undercapitalized” if it has a Total Risk-Based Capital ratio of less than 8 percent, a Tier 1 Risk-Based Capital ratio of less than 4 percent or a leverage ratio of less than 4 percent (3 percent in certain circumstances);


• | “significantly undercapitalized” if it has a Total Risk-Based Capital ratio of less than 6 percent, a Tier 1 Risk-Based Capital ratio of less than 3 percent or a leverage ratio of less than 3 percent; and


• | “critically undercapitalized” if its tangible equity is equal to or less than 2 percent of average quarterly tangible assets.

An institution may be downgraded to, or deemed to be in, a capital category that is lower than is indicated by its capital ratios if it is determined to be in an unsafe or unsound condition or if it receives an unsatisfactory examination rating with respect to certain matters. As of December 31, 2016, the Bank had capital levels that qualify as “well capitalized” under such regulations.
- 10 -

The FDI Act generally prohibits an FDIC-insured bank from making a capital distribution (including payment of a dividend) or paying any management fee to its holding company if the bank would thereafter be “undercapitalized.” “Undercapitalized” banks are subject to growth limitations and are required to submit a capital restoration plan. The federal regulators may not accept a capital plan without determining, among other things, that the plan is based on realistic assumptions and is likely to succeed in restoring the bank’s capital. In addition, for a capital restoration plan to be acceptable to regulators, the bank’s parent holding company must guarantee that the institution will comply with such capital restoration plan. The aggregate liability of the parent holding company is limited to the lesser of: (i) an amount equal to 5 percent of the bank’s total assets at the time it became “undercapitalized”; and (ii) the amount which is necessary (or would have been necessary) to bring the institution into compliance with all capital standards applicable with respect to such institution as of the time it fails to comply with the plan. If a bank fails to submit an acceptable plan, it is treated as if it is “significantly undercapitalized.”
“Significantly undercapitalized” insured banks may be subject to a number of requirements and restrictions, including orders to sell sufficient voting stock to become “adequately capitalized,” requirements to reduce total assets and the cessation of receipt of deposits from correspondent banks. “Critically undercapitalized” institutions are subject to the appointment of a receiver or conservator. A bank that is not “well capitalized” is also subject to certain limitations relating to brokered deposits.
FDIC Insurance Assessments
The FDIC, through the Deposit Insurance Fund (“DIF”), insures the deposits of the Bank up to prescribed limits for each depositor, (currently, $250,000 per depositor). The assessment paid by each DIF member institution is based on its relative risk of default as measured by regulatory capital ratios and other factors. Specifically, the assessment rate is based on the institution’s capitalization risk category and supervisory subgroup category. An institution’s capitalization risk category is based on the FDIC’s determination of whether the institution is well capitalized, adequately capitalized or less than adequately capitalized. The Company’s insurance assessments during 2016 and 2015 were $4.1 million and $2.9 million, respectively. 
In addition, the FDIC can impose special assessments to cover shortages in the DIF. In October 2010, the FDIC adopted a new Restoration Plan for the DIF to ensure that the fund reserve ratio reaches 1.35 percent by September 30, 2020, as required by the Dodd-Frank Act. At least semi-annually, the FDIC will update its loss and income projections for the DIF and, if needed, will increase or decrease assessment rates, following notice-and-comment rulemaking, if required. The Dodd-Frank Act also eliminated the requirement that the FDIC pay dividends to insured depository institutions when the reserve ratio exceeds certain thresholds. The Dodd-Frank Act requires the FDIC to offset the effect of increasing the reserve ratio on institutions with total consolidated assets of less than $10 billion, such as the Company.
As required by the Dodd-Frank Act, the FDIC also revised the deposit insurance assessment system, effective April 1, 2011, to base assessments on the average total consolidated assets of insured depository institutions during the assessment period, less the average tangible equity of the institution during the assessment period as opposed to solely bank deposits at an institution. This base assessment change necessitated that the FDIC adjust the assessment rates to ensure that the revenue collected under the new assessment system will approximately equal that under the existing assessment system.
Each of these changes may increase the rate of FDIC insurance assessments to maintain or replenish the FDIC’s DIF. This could, in turn, raise the Bank’s future deposit insurance assessment costs. On the other hand, the law changes the deposit insurance assessment base so that it will generally be equal to consolidated assets less tangible equity. This change of the assessment base from an emphasis on deposits to an emphasis on assets is generally considered likely to cause larger banking organizations to pay a disproportionately higher portion of future deposit insurance assessments, which may, correspondingly, lower the level of deposit insurance assessments that smaller community banks such as the Bank may otherwise have to pay in the future. While it is likely that the new law will increase the Company’s future deposit insurance assessment costs, the specific amount by which the new law’s combined changes will affect the Company’s deposit insurance assessment costs is hard to predict, particularly because the new law gives the FDIC enhanced discretion to set assessment rate levels.
The FDIC also collects a deposit-based assessment from insured financial institutions on behalf of the Financing Corporation, or FICO. The funds from these assessments are used to service debt issued by FICO in its capacity as a financial vehicle for the Federal Savings & Loan Insurance Corporation. The FICO assessment rate is set quarterly and will continue until the debt matures from 2017 through 2019.

Payment of Dividends and Other Restrictions
The Company is a legal entity separate and distinct from the Bank. While there are various legal and regulatory limitations under federal and state law governing the extent to which banks can pay dividends or otherwise supply funds to holding companies, the principal source of cash revenues for the Company is dividends from the Bank. The relevant federal and state regulatory agencies also have authority to prohibit a state bank, savings bank or bank holding company from engaging in conduct that, in the opinion of such regulatory body, constitutes an unsafe or unsound practice in conducting its business. The payment of dividends could, depending upon the financial condition of a bank, be deemed to constitute an unsafe or unsound practice in conducting its business.
Insured depository institutions, such as the Bank, are prohibited from making capital distributions, including the payment of dividends, if, after making such distribution, the institution would become “undercapitalized” (as such term is defined in the applicable law and regulations).
The Federal Reserve has issued a policy statement on the payment of cash dividends by bank holding companies, which expresses the Federal Reserve’s view that a bank holding company should pay cash dividends only to the extent that the holding company’s net income for the past year is sufficient to cover both the cash dividends and a rate of earning retention that is consistent with the holding company’s capital needs, asset quality and overall financial condition. The Federal Reserve also indicated that it would be inappropriate for a holding company experiencing serious financial problems to borrow funds to pay dividends. Furthermore, under the prompt corrective action regulations adopted by the Federal Reserve, the Federal Reserve may prohibit a bank holding company from paying any dividends if one or more of the holding company’s bank subsidiaries are classified as undercapitalized.
During 2015, the Company initiated a quarterly cash dividend on its unrestricted common stock. 
A bank holding company is required to give the Federal Reserve prior written notice of any purchase or redemption of its outstanding equity securities if the gross consideration for the purchase or redemption, when combined with the net consideration paid for all such purchases or redemptions during the preceding 12 months, is equal to 10 percent or more of its consolidated net worth. The Federal Reserve may disapprove such a purchase or redemption if it determines that the proposal would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice or would violate any law, regulation, Federal Reserve order or any condition imposed by, or written agreement with, the Federal Reserve.
Acquisitions
As mentioned above, under the BHCA, a bank holding company may not directly or indirectly acquire ownership or control of more than 5 percent of the voting shares or substantially all of the assets of any bank or merge or consolidate with another bank holding company without the prior approval of the Federal Reserve. Further, the Bank Merger Act requires approval from the FDIC prior to the Bank merging with or acquiring the deposits of another bank. Subject to certain reciprocity provisions, current federal law authorizes interstate acquisitions of banks and bank holding companies without geographic limitation. Generally, a bank headquartered in one state is authorized to merge with a bank headquartered in another state, as long as neither of the states has opted out of such interstate merger authority prior to such date, and subject to any state requirement that the target bank shall have been in existence and operating for a minimum period of time, not to exceed five years, and to certain deposit market-share limitations.
Interstate Banking and Branching 
Effective June 1, 1997, the Riegle-Neal Interstate Banking and Branching Efficiency Act of 1994 amended the Federal Deposit Insurance Act and certain other statutes to permit state and national banks with different home states to merge across state lines, with approval of the appropriate federal banking agency, unless the home state of a participating bank had passed legislation prior to May 31, 1997, expressly prohibiting interstate mergers. Under the Riegle-Neal Act amendments, once a state or national bank has established branches in a state, that bank may establish and acquire additional branches at any location in the state at which any bank involved in the interstate merger transaction could have established or acquired branches under applicable federal or state law. If a state opts out of interstate branching within the specified time period, no bank in any other state may establish a branch in the state which has opted out, whether through an acquisition or de novo.
However, under the Dodd-Frank Act, the national branching requirements have been relaxed and national banks and state banks are able to establish branches in any state if that state would permit the establishment of the branch by a state bank chartered in that state.

The Federal Deposit Insurance Act, or FDIA, requires that the FDIC review (1) any merger or consolidation by or with an insured bank, or (2) any establishment of branches by an insured bank. Additionally, the NCCOB accepts applications for interstate merger and branching transactions, subject to certain limitations on ages of the banks to be acquired and the total amount of deposits within the state a bank or financial holding company may control. Since our primary service area is North Carolina, we do not expect that the ability to operate in other states will have any material impact on our growth strategy. We may, however, face increased competition from out-of-state banks that branch or make acquisitions in our primary markets in North Carolina.
Affiliate Transactions
The Federal Reserve Act, the FDIA and the rules adopted under these statutes restrict the extent to which we can borrow or otherwise obtain credit from, or engage in certain other transactions with, our subsidiaries. These laws regulate “covered transactions” between insured depository institutions and their subsidiaries, on the one hand, and their nondepository affiliates, on the other hand. The Dodd-Frank Act expanded the definition of affiliate to make any investment fund, including a mutual fund, for which a depository institution or its affiliates serve as investment advisor an affiliate of the depository institution. “Covered transactions” include a loan or extension of credit to a nondepository affiliate, a purchase of securities issued by such an affiliate, a purchase of assets from such an affiliate (unless otherwise exempted by the Federal Reserve Board), an acceptance of securities issued by such an affiliate as collateral for a loan, and an issuance of a guarantee, acceptance, or letter of credit for the benefit of such an affiliate. The Dodd-Frank Act extended the limitations to derivative transactions, repurchase agreements and securities lending and borrowing transactions that create credit exposure to an affiliate or an insider. The “covered transactions” that an insured depository institution and its subsidiaries are permitted to engage in with their nondepository affiliates are limited to the following amounts: (1) in the case of any one such affiliate, the aggregate amount of “covered transactions” cannot exceed ten percent of the capital stock and the surplus of the insured depository institution; and (2) in the case of all affiliates, the aggregate amount of “covered transactions” cannot exceed twenty percent of the capital stock and surplus of the insured depository institution. In addition, extensions of credit that constitute “covered transactions” must be collateralized in prescribed amounts. Further, a bank holding company and its subsidiaries are prohibited from engaging in certain tie-in arrangements in connection with any extension of credit, lease or sale of property or furnishing of services. Finally, when we and our subsidiaries conduct transactions internally among us, we are required to do so at arm’s length.
Loans to Directors, Executive Officers and Principal Shareholders
The authority of the Bank to extend credit to our directors, executive officers and principal shareholders, including their immediate family members, corporations and other entities that they control, is subject to substantial restrictions and requirements under Sections 22(g) and 22(h) of the Federal Reserve Act and Regulation O promulgated thereunder, as well as the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. These statutes and regulations impose specific limits on the amount of loans the Bank may make to directors and other insiders, and specified approval procedures must be followed in making loans that exceed certain amounts. In addition, all loans the Bank makes to directors and other insiders must satisfy the following requirements: 

• | the loans must be made on substantially the same terms, including interest rates and collateral, as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with persons not affiliated with us or the Bank;


• | the subsidiary bank must follow credit underwriting procedures at least as stringent as those applicable to comparable transactions with persons who are not affiliated with us or the Bank; and


• | the loans must not involve a greater than normal risk of non-payment or include other features not favorable to the Bank.

Furthermore, the Bank must periodically report all loans made to directors and other insiders to the bank regulators, and these loans are closely scrutinized by the regulators for compliance with Sections 22(g) and 22(h) of the Federal Reserve Act and Regulation O. Each loan to directors or other insiders must be pre-approved by the bank’s board of directors with the interested director abstaining from voting. 
Community Reinvestment Act
The CRA requires federal bank regulatory agencies to encourage financial institutions to meet the credit needs of low and moderate-income borrowers in their local communities. An institution’s size and business strategy determines the type of examination that it will receive. Large, retail-oriented institutions are examined using a performance-based lending, investment and service test. Small institutions are examined using a streamlined approach. All institutions may opt to be evaluated under a strategic plan formulated with community input and pre-approved by the bank regulatory agency.
- 13 -

The CRA regulations provide for certain disclosure obligations. Each institution must post a notice advising the public of its right to comment to the institution and its regulator on the institution’s CRA performance and to review the institution’s CRA public file. Each lending institution must maintain for public inspection a file that includes a listing of branch locations and services, a summary of lending activity, a map of its communities and any written comments from the public on its performance in meeting community credit needs. The CRA requires public disclosure of a financial institution’s written CRA evaluations. This requirement promotes enforcement of CRA principles by providing the public with the status of a particular institution’s community reinvestment record.
The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act made various changes to the CRA. Among other changes, CRA agreements with private parties must be disclosed, and annual CRA reports must be made available to a bank’s primary federal regulator. A bank holding company will not be permitted to become a financial holding company and no new activities authorized under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act may be commenced by a holding company or by a bank financial subsidiary if any of its bank subsidiaries received less than a satisfactory CRA rating in its latest examination. The Bank received a “Satisfactory” rating in its last CRA examination which was conducted during March 2015. 
Consumer Laws and Regulations
We are also subject to certain consumer laws and regulations that are designed to protect consumers in transactions with banks. While the following list is not exhaustive, these laws and regulations include the Truth in Lending Act, the Truth in Savings Act, the Electronic Funds Transfer Act, the Expedited Funds Availability Act, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, The Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act, The Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act and the Fair Housing Act, among others. These laws and regulations, among other things, prohibit discrimination on the basis of race, gender or other designated characteristics and mandate various disclosure requirements and regulate the manner in which financial institutions must deal with customers when taking deposits or making loans to such customers. These and other laws also limit finance charges or other fees or charges earned in our activities. We must comply with the applicable provisions of these consumer protection laws and regulations as part of our ongoing customer relations.
Consumer Financial Protection Bureau
The Dodd-Frank Act creates a new, independent federal agency called the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (“CFPB”), which is granted broad rulemaking, supervisory and enforcement powers under various federal consumer financial protection laws, including the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, Truth in Lending Act, Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, Fair Credit Reporting Act, Fair Debt Collection Act, the Consumer Financial Privacy provisions of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act and certain other statutes. The CFPB has examination and primary enforcement authority with respect to depository institutions with $10 billion or more in assets. Smaller institutions are subject to rules promulgated by the CFPB but continue to be examined and supervised by federal banking regulators for consumer compliance purposes. The CFPB has authority to prevent unfair, deceptive or abusive practices in connection with the offering of consumer financial products. The Dodd-Frank Act permits states to adopt consumer protection laws and standards that are more stringent than those adopted at the federal level and, in certain circumstances, permits the state attorney general to enforce compliance with both the state and federal laws and regulations.
The CFPB has already finalized rules relating to, among other things, remittance transfers under the Electronic Fund Transfer Act, which requires companies to provide consumers with certain disclosures before the consumer pays for a remittance transfer. These new rules became effective in October 2013. The CFPB has also amended certain rules under Regulation C relating to home mortgage disclosure to reflect a change in the asset-size exemption threshold for depository institutions based on the annual percentage change in the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers. In addition, on January 10, 2013, the CFPB released its final “Ability-to-Repay/Qualified Mortgage” rules, which amend the Truth in Lending Act (Regulation Z). Regulation Z currently prohibits a creditor from making a higher-priced mortgage loan without regard to the consumer’s ability to repay the loan. The final rule implements sections 1411 and 1412 of the Dodd-Frank Act, which generally require creditors to make a reasonable, good faith determination of a consumer’s ability to repay any consumer credit transaction secured by a dwelling (excluding an open-end credit plan, timeshare plan, reverse mortgage, or temporary loan) and establishes certain protections from liability under this requirement for “qualified mortgages.” The final rule also implements section 1414 of the Dodd-Frank Act, which limits prepayment penalties. Finally, the final rule requires creditors to retain evidence of compliance with the rule for three years after a covered loan is consummated. This rule became effective January 10, 2014.

Technology Risk Management and Consumer Privacy
State and federal banking regulators have issued various policy statements emphasizing the importance of technology risk management and supervision in evaluating the safety and soundness of depository institutions with respect to banks that contract with outside vendors to provide data processing and core banking functions. The use of technology-related products, services, delivery channels and processes exposes a bank to various risks, particularly operational, privacy, security, strategic, reputation and compliance risk. Banks are generally expected to prudently manage technology-related risks as part of their comprehensive risk management policies by identifying, measuring, monitoring and controlling risks associated with the use of technology.
Under Section 501 of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, the federal banking agencies have established appropriate standards for financial institutions regarding the implementation of safeguards to ensure the security and confidentiality of customer records and information, protection against any anticipated threats or hazards to the security or integrity of such records and protection against unauthorized access to or use of such records or information in a way that could result in substantial harm or inconvenience to a customer. Among other matters, the rules require each bank to implement a comprehensive written information security program that includes administrative, technical and physical safeguards relating to customer information.
Under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, a financial institution must also provide its customers with a notice of privacy policies and practices. Section 502 prohibits a financial institution from disclosing nonpublic personal information about a customer to nonaffiliated third parties unless the institution satisfies various notice and opt-out requirements and the customer has not elected to opt out of the disclosure. Under Section 504, the agencies are authorized to issue regulations as necessary to implement notice requirements and restrictions on a financial institution’s ability to disclose nonpublic personal information about customers to nonaffiliated third parties. Under the final rule the regulators adopted, all banks must develop initial and annual privacy notices which describe in general terms the bank’s information sharing practices. Banks that share nonpublic personal information about customers with nonaffiliated third parties must also provide customers with an opt-out notice and a reasonable period of time for the customer to opt out of any such disclosure (with certain exceptions). Limitations are placed on the extent to which a bank can disclose an account number or access code for credit card, deposit or transaction accounts to any nonaffiliated third party for use in marketing.
UDAP and UDAAP
Recently, banking regulatory agencies have increasingly used a general consumer protection statute to address “unethical” or otherwise “bad” business practices that may not necessarily fall directly under the purview of a specific banking or consumer finance law. The law of choice for enforcement against such business practices has been Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act, referred to as the FTC Act, which is the primary federal law that prohibits unfair or deceptive acts or practices, referred to as UDAP, and unfair methods of competition in or affecting commerce. “Unjustified consumer injury” is the principal focus of the FTC Act. Prior to the Dodd-Frank Act, there was little formal guidance to provide insight to the parameters for compliance with UDAP laws and regulations. However, UDAP laws and regulations have been expanded under the Dodd-Frank Act to apply to “unfair, deceptive or abusive acts or practices,” referred to as UDAAP, which have been delegated to the CFPB for supervision. The CFPB has published its first Supervision and Examination Manual that addresses compliance with and the examination of UDAAP
Monitoring and Reporting Suspicious Activity
Under the Bank Secrecy Act, or BSA, we are required to monitor and report unusual or suspicious account activity that might signify money laundering, tax evasion or other criminal activities, as well as transactions involving the transfer or withdrawal of amounts in excess of prescribed limits. Several anti-money laundering laws, including provisions in Title III of the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001, have been enacted up to the present to amend the BSA. Under the USA PATRIOT Act, financial institutions are subject to prohibitions against specified financial transactions and account relationships as well as enhanced due diligence and “know your customer” standards in their dealings with financial institutions and foreign customers. For example, the enhanced due diligence policies, procedures and controls generally require financial institutions to take reasonable steps: 

• | to conduct enhanced scrutiny of account relationships to guard against money laundering and report any suspicious transaction;


• | to ascertain the identity of the nominal and beneficial owners of, and the source of funds deposited into, each account as needed to guard against money laundering and report any suspicious transactions;


• | to ascertain for any foreign bank, the shares of which are not publicly traded, the identity of the owners of the foreign bank, and the nature and extent of the ownership interest of each such owner; and


• | to ascertain whether any foreign bank provides correspondent accounts to other foreign banks and, if so, the identity of those foreign banks and related due diligence information.

- 15 -

Under the USA PATRIOT Act, financial institutions are also required to establish anti-money laundering programs. The USA PATRIOT Act sets forth minimum standards for these programs, including: 

• | the development of internal policies, procedures, and controls;


• | the designation of a compliance officer;


• | an ongoing employee training program; and


• | an independent audit function to test the programs.

In addition, under the USA PATRIOT Act, the Secretary of the U.S. Department of the Treasury, or Treasury, has adopted rules addressing a number of related issues, including increasing the cooperation and information sharing between financial institutions, regulators, and law enforcement authorities regarding individuals, entities and organizations engaged in, or reasonably suspected based on credible evidence of engaging in, terrorist acts or money laundering activities. Any financial institution complying with these rules will not be deemed to violate the privacy provisions of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act that are discussed above. Finally, under the regulations of the Office of Foreign Asset Control, or OFAC, we are required to monitor and block transactions with certain “specially designated nationals” who OFAC has determined pose a risk to U.S. national security.
The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002
The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or Sarbanes-Oxley, mandates for public companies such as the Company, a variety of reforms intended to address corporate and accounting fraud and provides for the establishment of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, or the PCAOB, which enforces auditing, quality control and independence standards for firms that audit SEC-reporting companies. Sarbanes-Oxley imposes higher standards for auditor independence and restricts the provision of consulting services by auditing firms to companies they audit and requires that certain audit partners be rotated periodically. The law also requires chief executive officers and chief financial officers, or their equivalents, to certify the accuracy of periodic reports filed with the SEC, subject to civil and criminal penalties if they knowingly or willfully violate this certification requirement, and increases the oversight and authority of audit committees of publicly traded companies.
Fiscal and Monetary Policy
Banking is a business which depends on interest rate differentials for success. In general, the difference between the interest paid by a bank on its deposits and its other borrowings, and the interest received by a bank on its loans and securities holdings, constitutes the major portion of a bank’s earnings. Thus, the earnings and growth of the Company and the Bank will be subject to the influence of economic conditions generally, both domestic and foreign, and also to the monetary and fiscal policies of the United States and its agencies, particularly the Federal Reserve. The Federal Reserve regulates the supply of money through various means, including open market dealings in United States government securities, the discount rate at which banks may borrow from the Federal Reserve and the reserve requirements on deposits. The nature and timing of any changes in such policies and their effect on the Company and the Bank cannot be predicted.
Current and future legislation and the policies established by federal and state regulatory authorities will affect the future operations of the Company and the Bank. Banking legislation and regulations may limit the Company’s and the Bank’s growth and the return to their investors by restricting certain of their activities.
In addition, capital requirements could be changed and have the effect of restricting the activities of the Company and the Bank, or requiring additional capital to be maintained. We cannot predict with certainty what changes, if any, will be made to existing federal and state legislation and regulations or the effect that such changes may have on the business of the Company or the Bank.
Real Estate Lending Evaluations
The federal regulators have adopted uniform standards for evaluations of loans secured by real estate or made to finance improvements to real estate. Banks are required to establish and maintain written internal real estate lending policies consistent with safe and sound banking practices and appropriate to the size of the institution and the nature and scope of its operations. The regulations establish loan to value ratio limitations on real estate loans. The Bank’s loan policies establish limits on loan to value ratios that are equal to or less than those established in such regulations.
- 16 -

Commercial Real Estate Concentrations
The Company’s lending operations may be subject to enhanced scrutiny by federal banking regulators based on its concentration of commercial real estate loans. On December 6, 2006, the federal banking regulators issued final guidance to remind financial institutions of the risk posed by commercial real estate, or CRE, lending concentrations. CRE loans generally include land development, construction loans, and loans secured by multifamily property, and nonfarm, nonresidential real property where the primary source of repayment is derived from rental income associated with the property. The guidance prescribes the following standards for its examiners to help identify institutions that are potentially exposed to significant CRE risk and may warrant greater supervisory scrutiny:

• | total reported loans for construction, land development and other land, or C&D, represent 100 percent or more of the institution’s total capital; or


• | total CRE loans represent 300 percent or more of the institution’s total capital, and the outstanding balance of the institution’s CRE loan portfolio has increased by 50 percent or more.

As of December 31, 2016, the Bank’s C&D concentration as a percentage of risk based capital totaled 99.2 percent and the Bank’s CRE concentration as a percentage of risk based capital totaled 276.6 percent.
Limitations on Incentive Compensation
In June 2010, the Federal Reserve Board and FDIC issued comprehensive final guidance on incentive compensation policies intended to ensure that the incentive compensation policies of banking organizations do not undermine the safety and soundness of such organizations by encouraging excessive risk-taking. The guidance, which covers all employees that have the ability to materially affect the risk profile of an organization, either individually or as part of a group, is based upon the key principles that a banking organization’s incentive compensation arrangements should (i) provide incentives that do not encourage risk-taking beyond the organization’s ability to effectively identify and manage risks, (ii) be compatible with effective internal controls and risk management, and (iii) be supported by strong corporate governance, including active and effective oversight by the organization’s board of directors.
The Federal Reserve Board will review, as part of the regular, risk-focused examination process, the incentive compensation arrangements of banking organizations, such as the Company, that are not “large, complex banking organizations.” These reviews will be tailored to each organization based on the scope and complexity of the organization’s activities and the prevalence of incentive compensation arrangements. The findings of the supervisory initiatives will be included in reports of examination. Deficiencies will be incorporated into the organization’s supervisory ratings, which can affect the organization’s ability to make acquisitions and take other actions. Enforcement actions may be taken against a banking organization if its incentive compensation arrangements, or related risk-management control or governance processes, pose a risk to the organization’s safety and soundness and the organization is not taking prompt and effective measures to correct the deficiencies.
In addition, Section 956 of the Dodd-Frank Act required certain regulators (including the FDIC, SEC and Federal Reserve Board) to adopt requirements or guidelines prohibiting excessive compensation. On April 14, 2011, these regulators published a joint proposed rulemaking to implement Section 956 of the Dodd-Frank Act for depository institutions, their holding companies and various other financial institutions with $1 billion or more in assets. The proposed rule would (i) prohibit incentive-based compensation arrangements for covered persons that would encourage inappropriate risks by providing excess compensation; (ii) prohibit incentive-based compensation arrangements for covered persons that would expose the institution to inappropriate risks by providing compensation that could lead to a material financial loss; (iii) require policies and procedures for incentive-based compensation arrangements that are commensurate with the size and complexity of the institutions; and (iv) require annual reports on incentive compensation structures to the institution’s appropriate federal regulator. The comment period to the proposed rule ended on March 31, 2011. As of the date of this document, the final rule has not yet been published by these regulators.
In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act requires publicly traded companies to give shareholders a non-binding vote on executive compensation at their first annual meeting taking place six months after the date of enactment and at least every three years thereafter and on so-called “golden parachute” payments in connection with approvals of mergers and acquisitions unless previously voted on by shareholders. The new legislation also authorizes the SEC to promulgate rules that would allow shareholders to nominate their own candidates using a company’s proxy materials. Additionally, the Dodd-Frank Act directs the federal banking regulators to promulgate rules prohibiting excessive compensation paid to executives of depository institutions and their holding companies with assets in excess of $1.0 billion, regardless of whether the company is publicly traded or not. The Dodd-Frank Act gives the SEC authority to prohibit broker discretionary voting on elections of directors and executive compensation matters.

Economic Environment
The policies of regulatory authorities, including the monetary policy of the Federal Reserve, have a significant effect on the operating results of bank holding companies and their subsidiaries. Among the means available to the Federal Reserve to affect the money supply are open market operations in U.S. government securities, changes in the discount rate on member bank borrowings and changes in reserve requirements against member bank deposits. These means are used in varying combinations to influence overall growth and distribution of bank loans, investments and deposits, and their use may affect interest rates charged on loans or paid on deposits.
The Federal Reserve’s monetary policies have materially affected the operating results of commercial banks in the past and are expected to continue to do so in the future. The nature of future monetary policies and the effect of these policies on the business and earnings of the Company and the Bank cannot be predicted.
Regulatory Reform and Legislation
From time to time, various legislative and regulatory initiatives are introduced in Congress and state legislatures, as well as by regulatory agencies. Such initiatives may include proposals to expand or contract the powers of bank holding companies and depository institutions or proposals to substantially change the financial institution regulatory system. Such legislation could change banking statutes and the operating environment of the Company in substantial and unpredictable ways. If enacted, such legislation could increase or decrease the cost of doing business, limit or expand permissible activities or affect the competitive balance among banks, savings associations, credit unions, and other financial institutions. The Company cannot predict whether any such legislation will be enacted, and, if enacted, the effect that it, or any implementing regulations, would have on the financial condition or results of operations of the Company. A change in statutes, regulations or regulatory policies applicable to the Company or our subsidiaries could have a material effect on the Company’s business, financial condition and results of operations.
