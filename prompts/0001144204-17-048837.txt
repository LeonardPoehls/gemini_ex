Item 1. Business.
Overview
 
Concurrent is a global software and solutions company that develops advanced applications focused on storing, protecting, transforming, and delivering visual media. Concurrent enables the world’s leading innovators in visual media to entertain, inform, and communicate, by providing the tools to help them unlock their creativity and share it with the world. We accomplish this by developing open software solutions that make the world’s visual media available online, when and where it is needed around the globe. Our business is comprised of one operating segment for financial reporting purposes, content delivery.
 
Our content delivery solutions consist of software, hardware and services for intelligently storing, processing and streaming video content to a variety of consumer devices. Our streaming, video processing and storage products and services are deployed by service providers to support consumer-facing video applications including live broadcast video, video-on-demand (“VOD”) and time-shifted television services such as cloud-based digital video recording (“cDVR”). In fiscal year 2016, we introduced Aquari, our software-defined scale-out storage solution that is ideally suited for a wide-range of applications in the media delivery value chain that require advanced performance, very large storage capacity, and a high degree of configuration flexibility.
 
In September 2015, we sold our multi-screen video analytics product line for collecting and analyzing data related to content delivery applications (see Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements). In May 2017, we sold our Real-Time solutions business (“Real-Time business”) to Battery Ventures for gross proceeds of $35 million. The Real-Time business provided real-time Linux operating system variants, development and performance optimization tools, simulation software and other system software combined, in many cases, with computer platforms and services. The Real-Time sale transaction was the culmination of a strategic process disclosed in our Form 10-K filed on August 30, 2016 which consisted of evaluating strategic alternatives and focusing on Concurrent’s other, and now the remaining, content delivery business. Prior to the sale, Concurrent sold the Real-Time business products to a wide variety of companies seeking high performance, real-time computer solutions in the defense, aerospace, financial and automotive markets around the world. Results of our Real-Time business are retrospectively reflected as a discontinued operation in our consolidated financial statements for all periods presented (see Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements). Unless otherwise noted, discussion of our business and results of operations in this Annual Report on Form 10-K refers to our continuing operations.
 
We were incorporated in Delaware in 1981 under the name Massachusetts Computer Corporation.
 
As soon as reasonably practicable after filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), we make our annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to those reports available, free of charge, on the Investors page of our website (www.concurrent.com), under the ‘Company’ tab then ‘Investors’ in the SEC Filings section. We have adopted a code of ethics that is applicable to all employees as well as a code of ethics applicable to our principal executive, financial, and accounting officers. Both of these ethics policies are posted on the Investors page of our website (www.concurrent.com), under the ‘Company’ tab then ‘Investors’ in the Corporate Governance section. Copies of these documents will be furnished upon written request delivered to the following address: Attn: Corporate Secretary, 4375 River Green Parkway, Suite 100, Duluth, Georgia 30096. If we amend or change our code of ethics applicable to our principal executive, financial and accounting officers or grant a waiver under such code, we will disclose these events through our website. No information from our website is incorporated within this filing.
 
The Content Delivery Market 
 
Our content delivery solutions are used by cable, telecommunications and Internet service providers to offer live broadcast, VOD and time-shifted television services to their end-customers. Digital video consumption has grown steadily year-over-year and streaming services have become a critical source of revenue for video service providers around the world. By 2020, video is expected to account for 79% of all global Internet traffic, according to a Cisco forecast for 2015 to 2020. Binge-watching has also become a major VOD trend, according to research by Deloitte, with 73% of consumers reporting that they have binge-watched an average of five hours of video content per sitting.

Consumer use of Internet-based subscription video services is also on the rise. According to research by Deloitte, subscription streaming video services were used in nearly 50% of all U.S. households in 2016, an increase of 6% relative to 2014. According to the NPD Group’s Connected Intelligence Smartphone and Tablet Usage Report, as of March 2016, streaming video is now used by 81% of all U.S. smartphone users on their mobile devices.
 
New services like cDVR are also beginning to roll out, enabling consumers to record and store live video programming in a remote digital network and watch it whenever they choose, on any device, over both fixed and wireless networks. According to market research from Technavio, the global cDVR market is expected to grow at a compounded annual growth rate (“CAGR”) of almost 31% between 2016 and 2020.
 
The Software-defined Storage Market 
 
Software-defined storage (“SDS”) is a network-attached storage architecture in which a cluster of general purpose computer systems is loaded with software that organizes the servers and the disk space in them into a reliable and expandable storage system. The total amount of storage space can be expanded through the addition of computer systems, and the data stored on the cluster is intelligently coded and spread across the systems such that failure of a disk or entire computer system will not result in a loss of data. The market for SDS is growing rapidly. According to research firm Grand View Research, the global SDS market crossed the $2 billion mark in 2016, and is estimated to be nearly $20 billion in 2024. Growth in the SDS media & entertainment market is driven by a variety of factors, including the need for:

· | increasingly larger capacities to support larger libraries of content and higher quality video types; the need to store different types of video for set top boxes “(STBs”), smart TVs and mobile consumption as demanded by end-users;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | more modern “object” storage technologies that can effectively store massive scale libraries that traditional “file” technologies cannot handle; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | more elastic storage architectures than can cost-effectively enable the consolidation of multiple, specialized storage systems onto a single common storage platform.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
A study by Gartner, Inc. predicts that SDS systems sales will surpass traditional storage systems revenue by 2020, with 70% to 80% of unstructured data being stored in SDS systems.

Products and Services
 
Our business is comprised of one segment for financial reporting purposes: Content Delivery. Our products fall into four principal categories: video origin servers, video caches, video transcoders, and storage. In addition, we provide technical support for our products. For fiscal year 2017, our products accounted for 62% of our revenue and our services accounted for 38% of our revenue.
 
Concurrent’s products are all software-based and utilize our expertise and innovations in video ingesting, recording, processing, storage and delivery, combined with standard commercial hardware sourced from leading original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”). Our products allow content providers to simplify the processing and storage of video assets as they prepare them for delivery to an increasingly complex set of distribution options. Our products also allow video service providers to build regional, national and global content delivery networks (“CDNs”) to stream video to any screen. We believe our modular, software-based approach provides our customers with the ability to more easily deploy new systems, expand those deployments and add services over time. Our unified solution provides a common software framework for delivering video to traditional STBs as well as Internet connected devices over both private and public networks. Our design goal is to provide seamless processing and delivery for end-user viewing of the highest quality on any device and to offer a seamless migration path for content providers and service providers that are evolving their traditional workflows toward more flexible IP-based technologies and hybrid private- and public-cloud service models.
 
Our software is integrated with standard commercial hardware components such as servers, disk arrays, solid state storage arrays, and network switching equipment. Our products are compatible with a wide range of video workflow technologies, including Media Asset Managers (“MAM”), digital head-end equipment, network transport, IP routers/switches, QAMs, DSL technologies, CMTS, STBs, and IP-connected consumer devices.
 
Origin Product
 
Zephyr™ Origin is Concurrent’s industry proven solution for ingesting, hosting and delivering video services.

Customers
 
We derive revenue from a limited number of customers. Our products are typically assembled and shipped in the same quarter the purchase order is received, and as a result, we typically have minimal backlog. Our backlog for content delivery and storage products and services at June 30, 2017 totaled $8.9 million compared to $4.2 million at June 30, 2016.
 
We have purchase agreements with many customers, but these agreements typically do not require minimum purchases of our products. As a result, sales to specific customers tend to, and are expected to continue to, vary from year-to-year, depending on such customers’ budgets for capital expenditures and new product introductions.
 
A significant portion of our content delivery solutions revenue has come from, and is expected to continue to come from, sales to service providers. Charter Communications/Time Warner Cable (“Charter/TWC”; Charter Communications and Time Warner Cable merged in May 2016) represented 29% and 36% of our total revenue from continuing operations for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Jupiter Communications (“J:COM”) represented 17% and 11% of our total revenue from continuing operations for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Cox Communications, Inc. (“Cox”) represented 16% and 14% of our total revenue from continuing operations for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Videotron represented less than 10% and 10% of our total revenue from continuing operations for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively. No other content delivery customer accounted for more than 10% of our total revenue during fiscal years 2017 and 2016.

Competition
 
Our products are sold into highly-competitive environments, driven by rapid technological innovation. All of the product groups compete based upon features, reliability, scalability, service and price. Due in part to the range of performance and application capabilities of our products, we compete in various markets against a number of companies.
 
The major competitors of our origin and cache solutions currently include the following: Adobe Systems Incorporated, Akamai Technologies, ARRIS Group, Inc., Broadpeak, Cisco Systems, Inc., Edgeware AB, Ericsson AB, Harmonic, Inc., Nokia Corporation and Wowza Media Systems, LLC.
 
The major competitors to our transcode solutions include Harmonic Inc., Ateme SA, and Amazon.com, Inc.
 
Our storage solutions compete with offerings sold by Dell EMC, NetApp, Quantum Corporation, Scality, Inc. and Qumulo.
 
Additional competitors with significant market presence and financial resources, including computer hardware and software companies, content providers, television equipment manufacturers and digital STB manufacturers, may enter our markets, thereby further intensifying competition. Potential future competitors may also include one or more of the parties with whom we currently have a strategic relationship. Although we have copyright and other intellectual property rights with respect to much of the technology incorporated into our products, our strategic partners have not agreed to refrain from competing against us. Increased competition could result in price reductions that would adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Many of our current and potential future competitors have significantly greater financial, technical, sales, marketing and other resources than we do, and greater brand name recognition. In addition, many of our competitors have well-established relationships with our current and potential customers and have extensive knowledge of our markets.
 
Intellectual Property
 
We rely on a combination of contracts and copyright, trademark, patent and trade secret laws to establish and protect our proprietary rights in our technology. We distribute our products under purchase agreements or purchase terms that contain various provisions protecting our ownership and confidentiality of any licensed technology. The source code of our products is protected as a trade secret and as an unpublished copyright work. However, some of our products utilize open source code that provides limited copyright protection. In addition, in certain instances, we license our products under licenses that give licensees limited access to the source code of certain of our products, particularly in connection with our strategic alliances.
 
Despite the precautions we have taken, there can be no assurance that our products or technology will not be copied or otherwise obtained and used without authorization. In addition, effective copyright and trade secret protection may be unavailable or limited in certain foreign countries and with respect to open source code utilized in certain of our products. We believe that, due to the rapid pace of innovation within our industry, factors such as the technological and creative skills of our personnel are more important in establishing and maintaining a technology leadership position within the industry than are the various legal protections for our technology.
 
We own twelve U.S. patents: Nos. 7,877,468, 8,079,052, 8,505,057, 8,522,268, 8,650,601, 8,695,031, 8,763,044, 8,943,218, 8,972,600, 9,241,174, 9,288,536 and 9,113,233 and have multiple patent applications pending in the U.S. We have also obtained a patent license to a patent portfolio (13 patents, 29 patent applications, and all additions, divisionals, continuations, continuations-in-part, extensions, reissues and foreign counterparts thereof) which is owned by Alcatel-Lucent, now part of Nokia Corporation (the “Patent License”). These patents cover multiple interactive television, targeted advertising, and on-demand technologies.
 
We have entered into licensing agreements with several third-party software developers and suppliers. Generally, such agreements grant us non-exclusive, worldwide term licenses to distribute software as part of the solutions we market.

Suppliers
 
We sometimes purchase product components or subcontract assembled components from a single supplier in order to obtain the required technology and the most favorable price and delivery terms. These components include systems, system boards, memory, CPUs, mother boards, storage devices, software, and chassis. We purchase product components from the following single suppliers: Avnet, Inc. (“Avnet”), CSP, Inc., Dell, Inc. (“Dell”), General Electric, MBX Systems (“MBX”), igolgi Inc., Oracle Corporation, Seagate Cloud Systems, Inc. (“Seagate Cloud Systems” and acquirer of Dot Hill Systems Corporation), and Super Micro Computer, Inc. Comparable products are available from other sources and would conform to our system specifications with moderate engineering effort. Single-source suppliers accounting for 10% or more of these purchases during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017 were Dell (34%), MBX (29%) and Seagate Cloud Systems (10%). During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016, Avnet (31%), MBX (26%) and Dell (18%), were the only single-source suppliers accounting for 10% or more of these purchases.
Seasonality
 
We have experienced variations in revenue, expenses and operating results from quarter-to-quarter, and it is probable that these variations will continue. We believe that fluctuations in the number of orders for our content delivery products being placed from quarter-to-quarter are principally attributable to the buying patterns and budgeting cycles of our customers. In addition, orders are often not finalized until the end of a quarter. However, we do not believe seasonality is a significant factor at this time.
Governmental Regulation
 
We are subject to various international, U.S. federal, state and local laws affecting our business. Any finding that we have been or are in noncompliance with such laws could result in, among other things, governmental penalties. Further, changes in existing laws or new laws may adversely affect our business.
 
Our business is subject to government regulation based on the products we sell, such as obtaining an export license or an end-use certificate from the buyer in certain circumstances. In the U.S., these requirements include, among others, the U.S. Export Administration Regulations, International Traffic in Arms Regulations and the economic sanctions and embargo laws enforced by the Office of Foreign Assets Control. If a government audit uncovers improper or illegal activities, we may be subject to civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions, including termination of contracts, forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments, or fines.
 
Several countries where our systems are shipped have adopted rules and regulations governing the labeling of computer hardware which apply to our products. Specifically, we must comply with the Waste of Electronic and Electrical Equipment (“WEEE”) and Restriction of Hazardous Substances Directive (“RoHS”) enacted in the European Union.
 
Industries we serve are subject to extensive regulation in the U.S. and other countries. Our content delivery business is dependent upon the continued growth of video services in the U.S. and internationally. Broadband companies in the U.S. are subject to extensive government regulation by the Federal Communications Commission (“FCC”) and other federal and state regulatory agencies. Additional regulations could have the effect of limiting capital expenditures by our customers and thus could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The enactment by federal, state or international governments of new laws or regulations could adversely affect our customers, and thereby materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. In particular, the adoption of the EU Data Protection Regulation Compliance enacted by the European Union, contains various data privacy related requirements which we may be required to comply with by May 25, 2018 and such compliance requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Environmental Matters
 
We export our products around the world where there are environmental regulations. These laws could have the effect of limiting our capital expenditures and thus could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Violations of such laws may result in the imposition of substantial remediation costs and penalties. We believe we are in compliance with all material environmental laws and regulations.
Employees
 
As of June 30, 2017, we had 110 employees and contractors worldwide. Of these employees and contractors, 94 were located in the U.S. and 16 were located internationally. Our employees are not unionized.
Financial Information About Foreign And Domestic Operations And Export Sales
 
A summary of our revenue and long-lived assets by geographic area attributable to our foreign and domestic continuing operations for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2017 and 2016 is presented in Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements included herein.
