Item 1. Business
OUR COMPANY
Versum is a global provider of innovative solutions to the semiconductor and display industries with expertise in the development, manufacturing, transportation and handling of specialty materials. We employ expertise in molecular design and synthesis, purification, advanced analytics, formulation development and containers and delivery systems for the handling of high purity materials to deliver leading edge solutions and critical process support to our customers. Versum’s business consists of two operating segments, Materials and Delivery Systems and Services (“DS&S”), under which we manage our operations and assess performance, and a Corporate segment. Our two operating segments are not aggregated, and are reported separately.
We are a leading global supplier of critical materials through our Materials segment, including high purity specialty process gases, cleaners and etchants, slurries, organosilanes and organometallics deposition films, and through equipment in our DS&S segment, which we provide to the semiconductor and display industries. Our technical capabilities enable us to foster strong customer relationships which are critical to collaborative development. Unique product positioning and a strong global infrastructure with flexible manufacturing and supply chain capabilities are fundamental to our businesses. Our Corporate segment includes certain administrative costs associated with operating a public company, non-core operating activities, foreign exchange gains and losses, and other income and expense that cannot be directly associated with the operating segments.
Throughout its history, the business has been known for innovative product development and as a safe, reliable and sustainable supplier of materials needed to fabricate semiconductors and displays. Our business is supported by an in-depth knowledge of the chemistries and technologies which underlie the manufacturing process for these electronic devices. We first invested in the electronic materials business to provide specialty gas supply to the semiconductor industry in the 1980s to address the emerging need for higher purity materials. Over the years, we have grown our business both organically and through acquisitions into a supplier of broad based materials for the industry.
On October 1, 2016, Air Products completed the Separation by means of a tax-free spin-off to Air Products stockholders. As a result of the Distribution, Versum is now an independent public company and its common stock is listed under the symbol “VSM” on the New York Stock Exchange.
As an independent company, we believe Versum is well positioned to benefit from secular growth trends and a leading position in the semiconductor materials market, supported by its global manufacturing and research infrastructure, product innovation capabilities, a strong new product pipeline and low capital intensity. Our competitive strengths have enabled us to achieve strong earnings and cash flow. For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2017, our net sales were $1,126.9 million; operating income was $300.1 million, or 26.6% of sales; net income was $193.0 million; and Adjusted EBITDA was $371.6 million, or 33.0% of sales. For an explanation of Adjusted EBITDA and a reconciliation to generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America ("GAAP") net income, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures” in Part II, Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Our Competitive Strengths
Innovative Product Development
Collaborative product development, a high level of technical innovation, products vetted through customers’ rigorous qualification processes and safe, consistent and reliable supply and distribution have enabled the business to establish strong positions in key product areas. Using Versum products, semiconductor manufacturers create faster, smaller and more efficient devices for both the logic and memory market segments. Our innovative products deliver differentiated performance to our customers’ fabrication processes by enhancing their productivity, quality, and yield; yet they constitute in relative terms a small fraction of the overall costs to develop and manufacture the end product. 
Longstanding Relationships with Key Industry Leaders
Versum has maintained long-term relationships, often spanning decades, with Integrated Device Manufacturers (“IDMs”), foundries and Original Equipment Manufacturers (“OEMs”). These collaborative relationships position us to understand the future requirements of our customers and to jointly develop innovative solutions that enable the development and manufacture of new products including next generation nodes. These relationships also position us to supply product delivery systems and on-site services to our customers.
Technology Leadership
To be an innovative supplier to the semiconductor industry requires a substantial long-term commitment of investing in technology. Our customers continually seek to introduce new generations of semiconductors and we often collaborate with them to develop new molecules, formulations and technological improvement to satisfy their needs. Historically, over the past four years, approximately 31% of annual revenues in our advanced materials product lines of our Materials segment were based on new products or applications introduced within the last five years. Versum currently has approximately 1,600 patents worldwide and has a highly qualified workforce comprising approximately 380 research scientists, lab technicians 
5

and engineers that allow us to sustain our competitive advantage.
Positioned to Take Advantage of Secular Growth Trends
Our business supplies materials used in the manufacture of semiconductors and displays supporting a wide range of electronic consumer products providing us with a diversified portfolio of growth opportunities into the future. We believe we will continue to witness the proliferation of semiconductors and displays into durable goods and other devices and growth will be further enhanced by the following secular trends:

• | The continued drive for chip productivity through improved scaling which we expect to drive the shift to new nodes and the need for new enabling materials;


• | Strong bit demand growth which we expect will continue to fuel underlying growth in the memory market, first increasing the demand for legacy materials and then driving the need for new materials as structural complexity increases;


• | The “Internet of Things”, cloud computing, need for data monitoring and storage which we expect will continue to drive the demand for semiconductors especially impacting legacy materials demand; and


• | Semiconductor growth in China and ultimately in other parts of the world which we expect will drive increased demand for future innovation and materials.

Strategically Located Global Manufacturing Footprint and Infrastructure
Versum has a well-established global infrastructure with fourteen strategically located manufacturing and seven research and development facilities in the Americas and Asia. We believe Versum’s global network of production and research facilities are geographically positioned to serve high growth areas and enable us to collaborate with our customers. Our manufacturing facilities include locations in the United States, South Korea and Taiwan. 
Strong Financial Performance and Cash Flow Generation
Versum has a strong financial profile with net income of $193.0 million, operating margin of 26.6% and Adjusted EBITDA margin of 33.0% for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2017. We expect these strong margins to enable the business to service its debt obligations and generate significant cash flow to drive both future organic and inorganic growth. For an explanation of Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin and a reconciliation to GAAP net income, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures” in Part II, Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
6

Net income attributable to Versum was $193.0 million in 2017, $212.0 million in 2016, and $184.1 million in 2015. Our Adjusted EBITDA and EBITDA margins are as follows:
Capital expenditures for the business have averaged approximately $41 million per year over the last three years including maintenance capital to support the business of about 1.5 - 2.0% of sales. Given the anticipated increasing market demand for new products combined with our own increased opportunities to enhance our geographic, cost and capacity positions, we expect to increase our level of growth capital in fiscal year 2018.
The combination of strong operating margins and low maintenance capital needs should allow us to generate substantial cash flow even with the increased level of expected growth capital opportunities.
Experienced Management Team
We have a strong management team which combines individuals with long-standing industry experience and leadership in specialty chemicals, materials and the semiconductor industry with key outside hires who bring a diverse perspective to the business from various other companies. Of our top seven senior leaders, five spent the majority of their careers with these businesses within Air Products while two joined our team from outside. Guillermo Novo, our Chief Executive Officer, has 30 years of materials industry operating and executive experience at Rohm & Haas Company and Dow Chemical Company. 
Business Strategies
Drive Operational Excellence and Asset Efficiency
Driving operational excellence, including a commitment to safety, environmental stewardship and supply chain reliability, are critical to the success of our business. We maintain rigorous environmental, health and safety processes and believe excellence in safety performance translates to excellence in operational and financial performance. We also expect to continue to implement various initiatives to improve the efficiency, effectiveness and reliability of our operations including investing in state of the art manufacturing facilities, locating capacity and research capability close to our customers and continually globalizing our supply chain. 
Maintain Strong Customer Focus
A key element of our success has been our ability to establish long-standing working relationships with most of the key semiconductor manufacturers as well as with OEMs. Our understanding and anticipation of our customer’s needs and our ability to develop innovative product solutions in a timely manner, together with providing safe and reliable supply, high 
7

quality products and analytical capabilities, have been critical in developing these long-term relationships. 
Leverage our Leadership to Drive Growth
We have invested approximately 4% to 5% of total sales in new technology, primarily for our advanced materials business, over the last three years and expect to continue a similar level of spending to deliver innovative solutions for our customers. We expect our leadership position, together with the strength of our product portfolio, to drive growth in the markets we compete in. We also believe there are significant opportunities for us to invest capital in strategic acquisitions to strengthen our businesses, broaden our product offerings and geographic positioning, and expand our technology portfolio.
Focus on Cash-Flow Generation
Versum has a successful track record of delivering strong financial results. Given the low capital intensity of our business, this results in significant cash flow generation. We believe our anticipated strong future cash flow will enable us to service our debt obligations, fund organic and inorganic growth opportunities, return capital to stockholders or reduce leverage. 
Operating Segments
Materials Segment
The Materials segment provides leading edge specialty materials focusing on IC and flat-panel display customers. Its products include specialty chemicals and materials utilized in the latest generation of semiconductors as well as high-purity specialty gases used in the semiconductor manufacturing process. These products include organosilanes, organometallics and other specialty precursors for thin film deposition, CMP slurries and post CMP cleans, formulated products for post etch and advanced packaging cleaning, process gases for deposition and metallization, chamber cleaning and etchant gases, as well as high purity gases that are used in ion implantation to alter the electrical properties of thin films. The semiconductor industry accounts for more than 80% of segment sales. Materials operates in two product categories: advanced materials and process materials. The segment benefits from synergies across the business units, including serving the same customer base, developing joint market strategies, sharing common supply chain processes and infrastructure, and utilizing common commercial resources.
Through our global network, our Materials segment positions its research, manufacturing and technical support close to customer facilities, enabling supply chain optimization and rapid response times to product and service needs. Many of our products have undergone rigorous product performance and quality reviews by our customers to be qualified for use in their products or manufacturing processes. Once these qualification processes are completed and our products are designated by our customers for use in their processes or products, it is often time consuming and costly for our customers to change suppliers. Our products perform critical tasks in customers’ products or manufacturing processes, yet typically represent a very small portion of the cost to manufacture the end products. Over nearly three decades, our Materials segment has developed strong customer relationships with the majority of the industry-leading IDMs, foundries and OEMs through joint product development and providing on-site service and technical personnel at our customers’ facilities.

Materials sales were $829.7 million, $756.7 million, and $743.4 million for fiscal years 2017, 2016 and 2015 respectively. Materials operating income was $274.4 million, $252.3 million, and $213.7 million for fiscal years 2017, 2016 and 2015 respectively. Materials adjusted EBITDA was $317.5 million, $296.9 million, and $262.8 million for fiscal years 2017, 2016 and 2015 respectively. Materials products are sold on a global basis, with revenue by business unit (Process Materials “PM” and Advanced Materials “AM”) and destination region as follows:
The Materials segment has approximately 1,000 employees, operates 12 production and 7 research and development facilities and serves more than 225 customers.
Materials Product Categories
Advanced Materials. Advanced materials supplies products and services through three key product platforms that are employed in the fabrication of ICs:

• | Advanced deposition materials (“ADM”) products include high purity specialty gases and chemicals, such as organosilane and organometallic precursors that are used to deposit thin films which comprise an IC;


• | Planarization (“PLA”) products include CMP slurries and post CMP cleans that are used to prepare chips with deposited thin films for the next stage of fabrication; and


• | Surface prep and clean (“SP&C”) formulated products are designed to selectively etch and remove debris and contamination during many stages of the wafer fabrication process including the advanced packaging activity.

For fiscal year 2017, approximately 85% of our advanced materials sales are based on proprietary or patent-protected positions. Product innovation is a key differentiator for advanced materials. For example, an organosilane precursor, which we developed in collaboration with a leading OEM, is an enabler for self-aligned double patterning, a process that has allowed device size to decrease far beyond expectations using present day lithography. We believe the move to more advanced transistors has created needs for new innovation in polishing dielectric materials. Our shallow trench isolation CMP slurries are exceeding the requirements for dishing control, selectivity, removal rate, and most importantly reduction in defects.
Advanced materials has seven technology centers strategically located near our customers, with four in the United States and three in Asia. Our focused research and development efforts offer customers the opportunity to collaborate on the joint development of new materials, align new materials requirements with their product technology cycles and enhance the quality and scale of their specialty material needs.

In fiscal year 2018 we expect to continue to invest in enhancing our innovation capabilities including adding additional research and manufacturing capabilities in Korea. 
Process Materials. Process materials supplies products such as high-purity gases and chemicals utilized in the processes of cleaning, etching, doping, and film deposition for our semiconductor, displays and light emitting diode (“LED”) customers. Our cleaning and etchant gases, like nitrogen trifluoride (NF3) and hexafluorobutadiene (C4F6), are used for chamber cleaning and high aspect etching applications in the production of semiconductors. Our process gases for deposition and metallization, such as tungsten hexafluoride (WF6) are used in the process of depositing film layers to enable the continued advancement of the semiconductor industry. Our dopants such as arsine (AsH3) are used for ion implantation for semiconductors and our hydride gases such as ammonia (NH3) support applications in display and LEDs. Our process materials’ products are used in a wide variety of LCD-based displays and LED-based displays, and logic and memory technology. We supply these products to our customers throughout the U.S., Asia and Europe.
Process materials leverages its geographically situated asset capabilities and strong safety performance to maintain its position as a reliable and sustainable supplier of high purity specialty gases and chemicals. In fiscal year 2018 we expect to invest to improve our cost position and increase capacity in certain key products.

Competition. The semiconductor market is global in scope with nearly all major semiconductor manufacturers having operations in multiple countries. We serve our customers across three continents and participate in the specialty gases and materials space spanning six of the seven critical processes steps required for semiconductor manufacturing.
The competitive landscape is varied, from multinational chemical companies to small regional, narrow-portfolio focused companies. Overall, competitive trends are supporting the need for localized, cost competitive supply chains, which is especially critical for larger volume customers.
Because of our breadth, we do not believe there are any global competitors that compete with us across the full range of our product offerings. Many of our competitors are local companies that participate in only a few products or in specific geographies. While there are other broad-based materials suppliers, many are concentrated in specific product areas, such as CMP pads, photoresists or liquid crystals. Key competitors include Adeka, Air Liquide, Cabot Microelectronics, Dow/DuPont, Entegris, FujiFilm, Hyosung, Avantor, Merck EM, and SK Materials.
Customers
We primarily serve the semiconductor industry for both memory and logic. The semiconductor industry is characterized by large scale global players and, while we serve a variety of customers from smaller technology firms to OEMs to multinational semiconductor companies, the majority of our sales are concentrated to these large scale global players. In fiscal 2017, the top 20 customers accounted for 83% of our total sales with the top three, Intel, Samsung and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company accounting for 48% of sales.
Sales, Marketing & Distribution
We sell our products and services globally through our direct sales force primarily directed to end use customers but also to OEMs. The direct sales force is organized based on geographic region and business units with coordinated teams for key industry players. As of September 30, 2017, total in-house sales forces consisted of approximately 200 personnel worldwide.
12

Raw Materials
We purchase raw materials and chemical intermediates from a large number of third parties. Major requirements for our key raw materials and energy are typically satisfied pursuant to contractual agreements ranging from purchase orders to long-term relationships with suppliers. We are generally not dependent on any one supplier for a significant portion of our raw material requirements, but due to the specialty nature of our products there are a limited or a sole number of suppliers that are qualified to supply raw materials for use in our customers’ products. Where we have limited sources of supply, or a sole supplier, we generally have developed contingency plans to minimize the effect of interruption or reduction in supply, such as developing alternative or back-up suppliers, sourcing from suppliers with multiple facilities or utilizing alternative formulations.
Temporary shortages of raw materials may occasionally occur due to several factors such as supply-demand imbalances, supplier outages or regional market shifts. In recent years, these shortages have not resulted in long-term unavailability of raw materials. However, the continuing availability and price of raw materials are affected by other factors such as unscheduled plant interruptions occurring during periods of high demand, domestic and world market and political conditions, as well as the direct or indirect effect of governmental regulations. During periods of high demand, some raw materials may be subject to significant price fluctuations, and such fluctuations may have an adverse impact on the results of operations of our business. The impact of any future raw material shortages or price fluctuations on our business as a whole or in specific geographic regions or in specific business lines cannot be accurately predicted.
We have a broad raw material base with the cost of no single raw material representing more than 3% of our cost of goods sold in 2017. Raw material costs in total constituted 24% of our sales in our Materials segment in 2017. The table below lists the key raw materials and the principal product category for which the materials were used.

Raw Material | Segment | Principal Product Category
Specialty Silanes | Materials | Advanced Materials 
Tungsten Powder | Materials | Process Materials 
Metallic Oxide Abrasives | Materials | Advanced Materials 
Controllers | DS&S | Equipment 
Hydrogen Chloride | Materials | Process Materials 
Hydrogen Fluoride | Materials | Process Materials 
Etchant Gases | Materials | Process Materials 
Nitrous Oxide | Materials | Process Materials 
Phosphine | Materials | Process Materials 
Ammonia | Materials | Process Materials 

Specialty silanes are sourced from multiple sources under multi-year contracts. We source several types of silanes depending upon the application and prices are generally fixed for the term of the contract.
Tungsten powder is supplied from multiple sources under multi-year contracts. Prices are generally subject to periodic adjustments based upon pricing for a derivative of tungsten ore. A majority of tungsten resources are located in China, and supply and pricing is subject to fluctuation. There have been significant fluctuations in pricing in recent years.
Metallic oxide abrasives are sourced under multi-year contracts. We source different types of abrasives each from a single source. Pricing is generally subject to market conditions.
Controllers are critical to the operation of our delivery systems units. We source different types of controller units from a single source under a multi-year contract. These control units are built by the supplier to our design specifications. We believe there are other sources of supply for these controllers.
Hydrogen chloride is sourced in the U.S. through a production joint venture and in Asia through a sole supplier. Our sole supply in the U.S. is a by-product of another chemical production process and sold through our joint venture. Our hydrogen chloride in Asia is produced as a by-product of another chemical process of a major chemical company. Both supply arrangements are under multi-year contracts.
13

Hydrogen fluoride is sourced in two countries from multiple suppliers under multi-year contracts. Prices under these contracts vary from fixed to market-based pricing.
Etchant gases are sourced from multiple suppliers under multi-year contracts. We have previously experienced some supply tightness for certain etchant gases and prices are generally subject to annual adjustment.
We source different grades of nitrous oxide in multiple countries from multiple sources under multi-year contracts. However, a customer may choose to qualify only one of those sources for its use. Our pricing is generally fixed for the term of such arrangements.
Phosphine is sourced from a single source under a multi-year contract. Our pricing is subject to periodic adjustment.
Ammonia is sourced from multiple sources under multi-year contracts. We believe there are a number of available sources. Pricing is generally tied to market conditions.
Key materials in our Delivery Systems & Services operating segment include valves, fittings and other components necessary to design and build our delivery systems and devices. We also purchase returnable containers that are a critical part of the quality and safe transportation, handling and use of our materials. We believe most of these materials are readily available from numerous sources.
Working Capital
Versum maintains inventory where required to facilitate the supply of products to customers on a specified delivery schedule. In some cases, higher inventory levels of certain products are maintained to manage specific supply chain risks and to meet customer requirements for responsiveness. For example, for some of the products, a higher level of inventory is maintained to mitigate the risk associated with a single manufacturing plant or single source of a critical raw material. A majority of our product inventory is maintained at warehouses in close proximity to our customers’ manufacturing locations to provide the responsiveness expected by our semiconductor customers.
Seasonality
Versum’s businesses are typically slightly stronger in fiscal third and fourth quarters due to the industry ramp up in advance of the holiday season. However, semiconductor industry technology ramps and materials market supply and demand dynamics can alter these seasonal trends. A portion of our DS&S segment is susceptible to the cyclical nature of capital investment in the semiconductor industry.
Employees
As of September 30, 2017, Versum and its subsidiaries had approximately 2,200 employees. Of our employees, approximately 200 are subject to collective bargaining agreements or other similar arrangements.
We observe local customs, legislation and practice in labor relations. Management believes that its relations with employees and their representatives are good. We have not suffered any material work stoppages or strikes in our worldwide operations in the last five years.
14

Environmental and Regulatory Matters
Versum is subject to various environmental laws and regulations in the countries in which it has operations. Compliance with these laws and regulations results in capital expenditures and costs. Our expense related to compliance with environmental laws and regulations totaled $10.2 million, $9.5 million, and $11.0 million in 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively. These amounts represent an estimate of expenses for compliance with environmental laws and activities undertaken to meet internal company standards.
Some of our operations are within jurisdictions that have or are developing regulations governing emissions of greenhouse gases (“GHG”). The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency is regulating GHG emissions for new construction and major modifications to existing facilities. Increased public awareness and concern may result in more international, U.S. federal, and regional requirements to reduce or mitigate the effects of GHG. Although uncertain, these developments could increase our costs related to consumption of electric power and the production of certain products, such as fluorinated gases. We believe we may be able to mitigate some of the potential costs through our contractual terms; however, we are unable to predict the impact of any potential changes in regulation or future regulation of GHG. Any legislation that limits or taxes GHG emissions from our facilities could impact our results of operations by increasing our operating costs or reducing demand for certain of our products.
The company is also subject to the Homeland Security Agency’s regulations, which address chemical plant safety and vulnerability. Similarly, the Frank R. Lautenberg Chemical Safety for the 21st Century Act, reforms the Toxic Control Substances Act (“TSCA”) by requiring the United States Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) to prioritize and evaluate the environmental and health risks of existing chemicals and providing EPA with greater authority to regulate chemicals posing unreasonable risks. The law also requires that EPA make an affirmative finding that a new chemical will not pose an unreasonable risk before such chemical can be manufactured or imported. TSCA reform also incorporates additional thresholds and checks to substantiate Confidential Business Information (“CBI”) claims. These reforms update TSCA so that it operates in a similar fashion to the Registration, Evaluation, and Authorization of Chemicals (“REACH”) legislation in Europe. Regulations similar to REACH have been enacted in South Korea and Taiwan. Based upon currently available information, the company does not believe that these regulations will have a material impact on its financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.
Research & Development
Versum is committed to further investing in its businesses through research and development. The objective of our research and development effort is to develop innovative chemistries and technologies with applications relevant within targeted key markets. Our technology spending comprised mainly of research and development costs were approximately 4% of our total sales in fiscal 2017. We staff our research and development resources based on the needs and requirements of each business line to develop innovative products. Research and development costs are charged to expense, as incurred. Such costs were $45.1 million, $43.9 million and $40.7 million for the years ended September 30, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
Research and development efforts are generally focused on both product and process development, which is the stage at which products move from development to manufacturing, and new product development.
Each of our segments manages its own research and development effort and has separate research and development facilities dedicated to its specific area. However, where technologically feasible, advances and findings are shared between business lines to foster greater cross-fertilization of ideas and applications. In certain cases, we conduct research and development efforts with third parties, including universities, customers and other entities. We endeavor to obtain ownership of or license to intellectual property developed with a third party on terms favorable to us.
Versum owns approximately 400 United States patents and 1,200 foreign patents, 600 pending patent applications globally and is a licensee under certain patents owned by others. While the patents and licenses are considered important, the company does not consider its business as a whole to be materially dependent upon any particular patent, patent license, or group of patents or licenses.
