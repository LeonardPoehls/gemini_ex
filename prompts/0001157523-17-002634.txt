Description of Business
 
Background
 
Aurum, Inc. is an exploration stage company and was incorporated in Florida to initially develop and market financial software systems for banks, brokerage firms, pension funds, family offices, and hedge funds.
 
In July 2009, Golden Target Pty Ltd, an Australian corporation ("Golden") acquired a 96% interest in Aurum from Daniel McKelvey and certain other stockholders. Mr. McKelvey resigned as Sole Director and Officer of Aurum, Joseph Gutnick was appointed President, Chief Executive Officer and a Director and Peter Lee was appointed Chief Financial Officer and Secretary.
 
Commencing August 2009, the Company decided to focus on mineral exploration for gold and copper in the Lao Peoples Democratic Republic. The Company's planned operations have not commenced and are considered to be in the exploration stage.
 
On January 20, 2010, the Company re-incorporated in the State of Delaware (the "Reincorporation") through a merger involving Liquid Financial Engines, Inc. ("Liquid") and Aurum, Inc., a Delaware Corporation that was a wholly owned subsidiary of Liquid. The Reincorporation was effected by merging Liquid with Aurum, with Aurum being the surviving entity. For purposes of the Company's reporting status with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Aurum is deemed a successor to Liquid.
 
Corporate Developments
 
In December 2010, the Company executed a Management and Shareholders Agreement with Argonaut Overseas Investments Ltd ("AOI"), an indirectly wholly owned subsidiary of Argonaut Resources N.L., in respect to Argonaut's 70% held, 55,105 acre Century Concession in Laos.
 
The agreement appointed Aurum as the manager of the Century Thrust Joint Venture Agreement, which existed between Argonaut and two other parties, and gave the Company the right to earn 72.86% of AOI's interest in the Joint Venture which was equivalent to a 51% beneficial interest in the Century Concession. In order to acquire this interest, Aurum was required to spend US$6.5 million on exploration within five years.
 
The Century Concession has expired and the Company had been negotiating with the Lao Government to renew the Concession. The Company has recently been advised that the Government does not intend to renew the Concession. As a result, the Company no longer has any exploration interests in Laos.
 
On April 1, 2016 the Company announced that it had entered into an agreement with an Israeli company, PayItSimple Ltd and its subsidiaries (PayItSimple) whereby the Company would invest $15 million directly into PayItSimple by September 5, 2016 to acquire a 30% interest in PayItSimple, and a further $7.5 million into PayItSimple over 18 months to acquire a further 10% interest in PayItSimple, taking its holding to 40% of interest in PayItSimple. PayItSimple owns a business known as Splitit. On April 6, 2016 the Company terminated the proposed acquisition of PayItSimple.

The investment would take place in unconditional instalments over a period of 24 months following the closing. The closing of the merger was subject to certain closing conditions, including the investment in Humavox of the first instalment of the investment in the amount of $5.5 million. On July 29, 2016 the Company terminated the proposed acquisition of Humavox.
