Item 1. Business
Company Overview
 
REGENT TECHNOLOGIES, INC., formerly Regent Petroleum Corporation, was incorporated under the laws of the State of Colorado on January 18, 1980.   We provide energy solutions through our two subsidiaries:  Regent Natural Resources Co. (“Regent NRCo” or “RNRC”) and Regent SPV LLC (“RSPV”).  Regent NRCo has been engaged in the testing of enhancement technologies for the production of oil and natural gas.  In 2013, the Company organized RSPV and it will operate as an unregulated company that invests in, owns and operates distributed solar power ventures, including commercial and residential solar installation.  The plans for RSPV are based on the development of the assets of Solar Logic Inc. (“Solar Logic”) acquired in December 2015.
Our Approach
 
Strategy
 
Regent’s commitment is to create long-term shareholder value and generate returns on invested capital in excess of its weighted average cost of capital over that time horizon. We are focusing on markets and energy applications in which solar power can be a least-cost solution, particularly in regions with high solar resources, significant current or projected electricity demand, and/or relatively high existing electricity prices. We will differentiate our product offerings by geographic market and localize the solution, as needed.  We will also enter into joint ventures or strategic arrangements with customers or other entities to maximize the value of particular projects. Some of these arrangements involve, and are expected in the future to involve, significant investments or other allocations of capital. Depending on the market opportunity, our sales offerings may range from module-only sales, to module sales with a range of development to full turn-key solar thermal power system sales. We expect these offerings to continue to evolve over time as we work with our customers to optimize how our solar and clean energy solutions can best meet our customers’ energy and economic needs.
 
Our solar assets managed through Solar Logic are centered on a Concentrated Solar Power (CSP) system with supplemental use of natural gas to achieve a continuous output.  Solar Logic provides a complete turn-key distributed CSP solution with the ability to operate as a steady-state system by supplemental firing of natural gas when solar thermal energy is not adequate. The electric power output of our smallest system is estimated to be 10 kilowatts (kW) operating via solar heat over 90% of the time during acceptable daylight hours, and is dry cooled during all times of operation.  The installed cost of this system is estimated to be $20,000.  This system has an estimated Levelized Cost of Energy (LCOE) lower than photovoltaic (PV) solar energy solutions, when run during normal operating hours, or a solar/natural gas mix using extended operating hours. Future designs include a 25 kW and 50 kW systems as well as a mobile unit for military or disaster relief.  For continuous output or 24/7 energy production, a simple natural gas connection or gas supply is all that is needed.

Business Segments
 
We plan to operate our business in two segments.   We plan to manufacture and market our turbine driven distributed CSP electric power generation systems with natural gas (NG) as a supplemental (optional) heat source.  We have a target electrical power output of 10 kW, which is above the typical household use of photovoltaic (PV) but toward the lower end of commercial use.  However, our Solar Logic systems can be installed in multiples, facilitating larger and scalable output from 10 – 150 kW for industry applications.  The system uses eight to ten parabolic troughs, approximately four feet by twelve feet each, and an integral power block. The power block consists of a small steam turbine/generator assembly, gas boiler, and system controls for a closed-loop, dry-cooled design, thereby requiring no additional water or working fluids once operational.  This segment is our fully integrated systems business (“systems segment”), through which we provide complete turn-key solar thermal power systems, or solar solutions, that draw upon our project development and service capabilities.  Our second segment is a derivative of the first in that we plan to offer our systems for the generation of electricity using exclusively stranded natural gas or other heat sources such as biomass or geothermal.  The flexibility of our solar thermal capability allows our solar system to be combined with any heat source for maximum efficiency within the DG Solar environment.
Regulation
 
Our operations may be subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations governing the occupational health and safety of our employees, wage regulations and environmental regulations.  This includes the requirements of the federal Occupational Safety and Health Act, as amended, or OSHA, and comparable state laws that protect and regulate employee health and safety. We are not a regulated utility but for certain projects we expect to receive public funds for installations of our systems on government facilities. There are wage requirements enforced by regulatory agencies for publicly funded projects which may impact our operations. In certain situations, interconnection agreements may be required from the local utility which utilize a standard agreement without the need for additional regulatory approvals.
Market and Competition
 
We believe we have over 3.6 million light commercial candidates for our solar thermal business just within the US Sunbelt states with the expressed need and desire to reduce their high energy consumption costs via clean energy technologies.  Solar energy is a growing form of renewable energy domestically and internationally with numerous economic and environmental benefits that make it an attractive complement to, and/or substitute for, traditional forms of electricity generation. The solar industry continues to be characterized by pricing competition and we believe manufacturers of solar energy solutions have significant installed production capacity and the ability for additional capacity expansion. Intense competition at the systems level can result in a rapid decline in prices and further increase the demand for solar energy solutions.  Most of our existing or future competitors may be part of larger corporations that have greater financial resources and greater brand name recognition than we do and, as a result, may be better positioned to adapt to changes in the industry or the economy as a whole. Certain competitors may have direct or indirect access to significant capital, which could enable such competitors to operate at minimal or negative operating margins for sustained periods of time.
Competitive Strengths
 
We are developing a complete turn-key distributed Concentrated Solar Power (CSP) solution with the ability to operate as a steady-state system by supplemental firing of natural gas when solar thermal energy is not adequate. The electric power output is estimated to be 10 kW operating via solar heat over 90% of the time during acceptable daylight hours, and is dry cooled during all times of operation.  The installed cost of the system is estimated to be $20,000.  This system will have a solar power only Levelized Cost of Energy (LCOE) at 5.7¢ per kWh over a twenty-five year period, when run during normal operating hours, or a solar/natural gas mix LCOE at 5.13¢ per kWh using extended operating hours.
 
The system could become a high impact solution for both CSP and the overall solar market due to the low lifetime cost as well as the ability to operate predictably regardless of cloud cover or other types of weather. The beneficiaries of this technology will be small businesses and light commercial facilities that would otherwise not install photovoltaic (PV) panels due to the unpredictability of using solar power alone.  The primary benefit of the system is its ability to leverage low-quality heat produced within a small solar heating loop. Creating a small, turn-key CSP system which operates on low-quality heat requires many novel solutions.  While some of the unique design solutions may not be viewed as substantial risks by themselves, they are all required to meet the objective of a distributed CSP solution for less than 6¢ per kWh.

Intellectual Property
 
Solar Logic holds several U.S. and foreign patents, as well as pending patent applications, related to our system and turbine technologies.  The Company believes that patent protection is important to its business. There can be no assurance as to the breadth or degree of protection that patents may afford the Company, that any patent applications will result in issued patents or that patents will not be circumvented or invalidated.   Although the Company believes that its existing patents and the Company's equipment do not and will not infringe upon existing patents or violate proprietary rights of others, it is possible that the Company's existing patent rights may not be valid or that infringement of existing or future patents or violations of proprietary rights of others may occur. In the event the Company's equipment or processes infringe, or are alleged to infringe, patents or other proprietary rights of others, the Company may be required to modify the design of its equipment or processes, obtain a license or defend a possible patent infringement action. There can be no assurance that the Company will have the financial or other resources necessary to enforce or defend a patent infringement or proprietary rights violation action or that the Company will not become liable for damages.
 
The Company also relies on trade secrets and proprietary know-how, and employs various methods to protect its technology. However, such methods may not afford complete protection and there can be no assurance that others will not independently develop such know-how or obtain access to the Company's know-how, concepts, ideas and documentation. Failure to protect its trade secrets could have a material adverse effect on the Company.  We will file additional patent applications to protect inventions arising from our research and development. Our patent applications and any future patent applications might not result in a patent being issued with the scope of the claims we seek, or at all, and any patents we may receive may be challenged, invalidated, or declared unenforceable. In addition, we have registered and/or have applied to register trademarks and service marks in the U.S. and a number of foreign countries for “Solar Logic.”
 
Legislated Incentive Programs
 
Tax incentive programs exist in the U.S. at both the federal and state level and can take the form of investment and production tax credits, accelerated depreciation, and sales and property tax exemptions and abatements. At the federal level, investment tax credits for business and residential solar systems have gone through several cycles of enactment and expiration since the 1980’s. In December 2015, the U.S. Congress extended the 30% federal energy investment tax credit (“ITC”) for both residential and commercial solar installations through December 31, 2019. The credit will step down to 26% in 2020, 22% in 2021, and remain at 10% permanently beginning in 2022. The ITC has been an important economic driver of solar installations in the U.S., and its extension is expected to contribute to greater medium-term demand visibility in the U.S. The positive impact of the ITC has depended to a large degree on the availability of tax equity for project financing, and any significant reduction in the availability of tax equity in the future could make it more difficult to develop and construct projects requiring financing. The eventual step-down of the ITC to 10% underscores the need for the LCOE from solar systems to continue to decline and remain competitive with other sources of energy generation.
 
Section 25D of the IRC allows a taxpayer to claim a credit for a residential solar energy system that is owned by the homeowner. This credit is available at 30% for systems that are placed in service by December 31, 2019, at 26% for systems placed in service in 2020, and at 22% for systems placed in service in 2021.  The credit is scheduled to expire effective January 1, 2022. Approximately half of U.S. states offer a personal and/or corporate investment or production tax credit for solar, which are additive to the Federal ITC. Further, more than half of U.S. states, and many local jurisdictions, have established property tax incentives for renewable energy systems, which include exemptions, exclusions, abatements and credits.
 
Forty-one states, Washington, D.C. and Puerto Rico have a form of regulatory policy known as net energy metering, or net metering, available to new solar customers. Net metering typically allows solar customers to interconnect their on-site solar energy systems to the utility grid and offset their utility electricity purchases by receiving a bill credit at the utility’s retail rate for energy generated by their solar energy system that is exported to the grid in excess of electric load used by customers. Each of the states where we currently serve customers have adopted a net metering policy except for Texas, where certain individual utilities have adopted net metering or a policy similar to net metering. Typically, at the end of the billing period, the customer simply pays for the net energy used or receives a credit at the retail rate if more energy is produced than consumed.
 
The majority of states in the U.S. have enacted legislation adopting Renewable Portfolio Standard (“RPS”) mechanisms. Under an RPS, regulated utilities and other load serving entities are required to procure a specified percentage of their total electricity sales to end-user customers from eligible renewable resources, such as solar generating facilities, by a specified date. Some programs may further require that a specified portion of the total percentage of renewable energy must come from solar generating facilities. RPS legislation and implementing regulations vary significantly from state to state, particularly with respect to the percentage of renewable energy required to achieve the state’s RPS, the definition of eligible renewable energy resources, and the extent to which renewable energy credits (certificates representing the generation of renewable energy) qualify for RPS compliance. To prove compliance with such mandates, utilities typically must surrender renewable energy certificates. A solar renewable energy certificate, or SREC, is a tradable credit that represents all of the clean energy benefits of electricity generated from a solar energy system. Every time a solar energy system generates 1,000 kWh of electricity, one SREC is issued or minted by a government agency. The SREC can then be sold or traded separately from the energy produced, generally through brokers and dealers facilitating individually negotiated bilateral arrangements. SRECs are primarily valuable because they help utilities and other energy suppliers comply with RPS standards.
