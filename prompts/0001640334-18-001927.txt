ITEM 1. DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS.
History
 
Apolo Gold & Energy Inc, (the “Company”) was incorporated in March, 1997 under the laws of the State of Nevada as Apolo Gold Inc., for the purpose of financing and operating precious metals concessions. In May, 2005, the Company amended its articles of incorporation to change the name of the Company from Apolo Gold Inc. to Apolo Gold & Energy Inc.
 
After incorporation in 1997 the Company focused on precious metals opportunities in Latin and South America. Shortly thereafter the Company formed a subsidiary, Compania Minera Apologold, C.A. a corporation, and on May 18, 1999 the Venezuela subsidiary entered into an agreement with Empresa Proyectos Mineros Goldma, C.A. in Caracas Venezuela, to acquire the diamond and gold mining concession in Southern Venezuela known as Codsa 13, located in the Gran Sabana Autonomous Municipality, State of Bolivar, Venezuela. This project was subsequently cancelled in August 2001 because of poor testing results. The subsidiary company in Venezuela has been dormant since 2001 and will not be reactivated.
 
On April 16, 2002, the Company executed an agreement with Pt. Metro Astatama, of Jakarta, Indonesia, for the mining rights to a property known as Nepal Umbar Picung (“NUP”), which is located west of Bandar Lampung, on the island of Sumatra, Indonesia. NUP has a KP, Number KW. 098PP325, which is a mineral tenement license for both Exploration and Exploitation. All KP’s must be held by an Indonesian entity.
 
The “NUP” is 733.9 hectares in size and the Company had an 80% interest. These claims are owned privately by citizens of Indonesia and are not crown granted claims. Apolo was entitled to recover all of its development costs on the “NUP” including property payments before the partner with 20% can participate.
 
The total purchase price for “NUP” was $375,000, of which payments amounting to $250,000 had been made. After various exploration programs including different drilling programs failed to yield sufficient positive results, the Company discussed various options with the property owner and decided to terminate its agreement with the NUP property and return all exploration rights to the property owners.
 
On December 11, 2013, the Company acquired 70% interest in three gold exploration claims located in China’s Xinjiang Province from Yinfu Gold Corp. (“Yinfu”). The Company issued six million shares of restricted common stocks for the claims.
 
On December 23, 2013, the Company acquired 24% equity interest in Jiangxi Everenergy New Material Co., Ltd. (“Everenergy”). The consideration was settled by the issuance of eight-million shares of restricted common stock at a deemed price of $0.375 per share, plus $1-million in cash. Additionally, on February 19, 2014, the Company acquired an additional 29% equity interest in Everenergy. The consideration was settled with the issuance of 11-million restricted common stock at a deemed price of $0.45 per share.
 
On September 17, 2014, the Company cancelled both transactions with Everenergy and had requested return of the $1-million payment and all the shares. The 11-million shares issued were effectively cancelled on October 21, 2014. The remaining 8-million shares issued are in the process of cancellation and the $1 million paid for the acquisition was written off as an investment loss.
 
On January 19, 2015, the Company and Yinfu reached a mutual agreement to terminate the acquisition of the 70% interest in the three gold exploration claims in the PRC. On February 3, 2015, all six million shares of restricted common stock had been returned by the wholly owned subsidiary of Yinfu and cancelled by the Company.
