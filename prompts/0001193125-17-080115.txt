 General 
 Pacific Continental Corporation (the Company or the Registrant) is an Oregon corporation and registered bank holding company headquartered in Eugene, Oregon. The Company was organized on June 7, 1999, pursuant to a holding company reorganization of Pacific Continental Bank, its wholly owned subsidiary (the Bank).

THE BANK 
 General 
 The Bank commenced operations on August 15, 1972. The Bank operates in three primary markets: Eugene, Oregon, Portland, Oregon / Southwest Washington and Puget Sound, Washington. At December 31, 2016, the Bank operated fifteen full-service offices in Oregon and Washington and two loan production offices in Washington and Colorado. The primary business strategy of the Bank is to operate in large commercial markets and to provide comprehensive banking and related services tailored to community-based businesses, nonprofit organizations, professional service providers and banking services for business owners. The Bank emphasizes the diversity of its product lines, high levels of personal service and convenient access through technology typically associated with larger financial institutions, while maintaining local decision-making authority and market knowledge, typical of a community bank. The Bank has developed expertise in lending to dental professionals, and during 2016 continued to expand its national dental lending program. More information on the Bank and its banking services can be found on its website (therightbank.com). Information contained on the Banks website is not part of this Form 10-K. The Companys Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K and any amendments to these reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 are available free of charge upon request on the Banks website. The reports are also available on the SECs website at www.sec.gov. The Bank operates under the banking laws of the State of Oregon, and the rules and regulations of the FDIC. In addition, operations at its branches and other offices in the State of Washington and Colorado are subject to various consumer protection and other laws of that state.
THE COMPANY 
 Primary Market Area 
 The Companys primary markets consist of metropolitan Eugene, metropolitan Portland, in the State of Oregon and metropolitan Seattle in the State of Washington. During 2016, the Company expanded its lending to dental professionals, and at year-end had loans to dental professionals in 44 states, up from 39 states in 2015. The Company has five full-service banking offices in the metropolitan Portland and Southwest Washington area, seven full-service banking offices in the metropolitan Eugene area, and three full-service offices in the metropolitan Seattle area. It also operates loan production offices in Tacoma, Washington and Denver, Colorado. The Company has its headquarters and administrative office in Eugene, Oregon. 
 Overall, economic conditions improved in the Companys markets during 2016 as evidenced by the increased loan demand in all three of the Companys primary markets. In particular, larger metropolitan areas, such as Portland and Seattle, experienced higher improvement in general economic conditions and job growth than rural areas of Oregon and Washington. As has been typical in the past, the economic conditions in the Eugene market improved, but not at the levels realized in Portland and Seattle. 
 On a monthly basis, the University of Oregon, located in Eugene, Oregon, produces the Oregon Index of Economic Indicators using the year 1997 as its beginning base of 100. This index attempts to measure various components of the State of Oregon economy, including labor markets, capital goods orders, and consumer confidence, in order to determine if economic conditions in the state are improving or deteriorating, and provides the probability of a recession. This index indicated that economic activity for the State of Oregon fell to its lowest level during the first quarter 2009 when the index reached 85.0 and then generally trended upward. During 2016, the index continued upward on a quarterly basis, and for December 2016 was at 100.5%, an improvement of 0.5% over the prior year-end. 
 The unemployment rate for the State of Oregon at December 31, 2016, was 4.6%, as compared to 4.7% nationally, and has been improving since early 2009. Portland area unemployment stood at 4.3%, for this same time period, below the state average and national average. For Lane County, Oregon, which includes Eugene, Oregon, the unemployment rate was 4.8%, above both the state and national average at December 31, 2016. The unemployment rate for the State of Washington at December 31, 2016, was 5.2%, above the national averages, and has trended downward on a quarterly basis since early 2009. In King County, Washington, which includes the metropolitan Seattle area, the unemployment rate at year-end 2016 was 3.4%, below the state and national averages. The Seattle market in particular has demonstrated more economic diversity than the other primary markets in which the Company operates. All unemployment rates were provided by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.

At December 31, 2016, approximately 65% of the Companys loan portfolio in principal amount was secured by real estate, thus the condition and valuation trends of commercial and residential real estate markets in the Pacific Northwest have had a significant impact on the overall credit quality of the Companys primary assets in that, in the event of default, the value of real estate collateral and its salability is typically the primary source of repayment. At December 31, 2016, approximately $167 million, or 9.00% of the Companys loan portfolio, was categorized as residential and commercial construction loans, which also included land development and acquisition loans. During 2016, the Company experienced an increase in construction lending, centered in commercial real estate construction and acquisition and development construction. 
 Real estate markets in the Pacific Northwest, particularly the Portland and Puget Sound markets, have shown steady improvement in virtually every segment year over year. Industrial commercial real estate in both Portland and Seattle continued elevated pre-leasing activity, strong absorption rates, and increasing rental and lease rates during 2016. Industrial vacancy rates in the Puget Sound region fell to 2.6% by the end of 2016, even with the addition of over 4 million square feet of new space. In the Eugene market, vacancy trends continued to show stability through year end. The office commercial real estate market showed maturing in the Portland metropolitan region in 2016, and pre-leasing was steady, with vacancy rates remaining stable at 8%, despite over 1 million square feet being added during the year. The Puget Sound region was robust, with the regional vacancy rate remaining 8.6% despite the addition of over 4.4 million square feet added. For Eugene, demand for office space was moderate to steady, with building or refurbishing continuing, and vacancy rates remaining generally stable. With regard to multifamily commercial real estate, the diverse Eugene, Portland and Puget Sound demographics and continued inward migration with limited availability of multifamily units, led to private and institutional investment in all three regions. Rents increased, but at a more moderate pace in 2016, and the Eugene and Portland markets began to experience slower lease up, still however reflecting stable markets at year end. These multifamily vacancy rates in the Portland and Eugene markets remain generally in the 2.5% range, while the vacancy rate in the Puget Sound market is near record lows. There was some evidence of overcapacity developing in the Eugene student housing market in 2016. Residential development continued, with single-family and multi-family building permit issuance remaining solid in all of our markets, dominated primarily by the national home builders in the Portland and Puget Sound regions. Normalized to limited supply of single family residences was evident during the year. Similar trends are suggested into 2017, subject to various market and economic forces. 
 Residential housing prices in all three of the Companys primary markets showed marked improvement in 2016, to the point where values have generally recovered to their pre-recession levels in each market, with some values exceeding pre-recession levels in areas of Portland and Seattle. A moderate level of new residential construction continued in each market as well due to the improving market conditions, continued low interest rates, and the slow return of bank financing to a wider range of residential developers. 
 Competition 
 Commercial banking in the States of Oregon and Washington is highly competitive. The Company competes with other banks, as well as with savings and loan associations, savings banks, credit unions, mortgage companies, investment banks, insurance companies, and other financial institutions. Banking in Oregon and Washington is dominated by several large banking institutions including U.S. Bank, Wells Fargo Bank, Bank of America, Key Bank and Chase. Together these banks account for a majority of the total commercial and savings bank deposits in Oregon and Washington. These competitors have significantly greater financial resources and offer a much greater number of branch locations. The Company offsets the advantage of the larger competitors by focusing on certain market segments, providing high levels of customization and personal service, and tailoring its technology, products and services to the specific market segments that the Company serves. 
 In addition to larger institutions, numerous community banks and credit unions operated, expanded or moved into the Companys three primary markets and have developed a similar focus to that of the Company. These institutions have further increased competition in all three of the Companys primary markets. This number of similar financial institutions and an increased focus by larger institutions in the Companys primary markets has led to intensified competition in all aspects of the Companys business. During 2016, the Company saw increased competition, specifically regarding loan pricing. The Company saw competitors willing to accept yields or terms not desirable to the Company and some deals were lost due to the Companys unwillingness to compromise on deal pricing. The Company remained diligent in its underwriting standards during the year and did not loosen credit standards to achieve growth.

The adoption of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 (the GLB Act) led to further intensification of competition in the financial services industry. The GLB Act eliminated many of the barriers to affiliation among providers of various types of financial services and has permitted business combinations among financial service providers such as banks, insurance companies, securities or brokerage firms and other financial service providers. Additionally, the rapid adoption of financial services through the Internet has reduced or even eliminated many barriers to entry by financial service providers physically located outside our market areas. For example, remote deposit services allow depository companies physically located in other geographical markets to service local businesses with minimal cost of entry. Although the Company has been able to compete effectively in the financial services business in its markets to date, it may not be able to continue to do so in the future. 
 The financial services industry has experienced widespread consolidation over the last decade. Following consolidation due to FDIC failures between 2008 and 2011, the banking industry began to see acquisition consolidation in 2012. Beginning in 2012, consolidation continued in the form of bank acquisitions throughout the Northwest. The Company anticipates consolidation among financial institutions in its market areas will continue. In addition, with the passage of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the Dodd-Frank Act), smaller financial institutions may find it difficult to continue to operate due to higher anticipated regulatory costs. The Dodd-Frank Act also authorized nationwide de novo branching by national and state banks and certain foreign banks operating in the U.S., which could also result in new entrants to the markets served by the Bank. 
 As of June 30, 2016, the most recent FDIC Summary of Deposit survey indicated, the Company had 17.08% of the Lane County deposit market share, which currently is serviced by seven branches in the Eugene community. This was the highest deposit market share of any bank in Lane County. In Multnomah County, which is serviced by three of the Companys offices in the Portland Market, the Company had 1.42% of the deposit market share, ranking ninth in the Multnomah County, Oregon Market. In King County, Washington, the Company had 0.27% of the deposit market share, serviced by the Seattle and Bellevue offices, ranking 22rd in the King County Market as of June 30, 2016. 
 In addition, the Company anticipates more competitive pressure for new loans in its markets. While the Banks loan demand improved throughout 2016, healthy banks with ample capital and liquidity are expected to aggressively seek new loan customers. This may cause pressure on loan pricing and make it more difficult to retain existing loan customers or attract new ones and may create compression in the Companys net interest margin. 
 Services Provided 
 The Company offers a wide array of financial service products to meet the banking needs of its targeted segments in the market areas served. The Company regularly reviews the profitability and desirability of various product offerings, particularly new product offerings, in an effort to assure ongoing viability. 
Deposit Services 
 The Company offers a wide range of deposit services that are typically available in most banks and other financial institutions including checking, savings, money market accounts and time deposits. The transaction accounts and time deposits are tailored to the Companys primary markets and market segments at rates competitive with those offered in the area. Additional deposits are generated through national networks for institutional deposits. All deposit accounts are insured by the FDIC to the maximum amount permitted by law, currently $250 per depositor. The Company provides online cash management, remote deposit capture and banking services to businesses and consumers. The Company also allows 24-hour customer access to deposit and loan information via telephone and online cash management products. 
Lending Activities 
 The Company emphasizes specific areas of lending within its primary markets. Commercial loans are made primarily to professionals, community-based businesses and nonprofit organizations. These loans are available for general operating purposes, acquisition of fixed assets, purchases of equipment and machinery, financing of inventory and accounts receivable and other business purposes. The Company also originates U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) loans and is a national SBA preferred lender. 
 Within its primary markets, the Company also originates construction and permanent loans financing commercial facilities, including investor and owner-occupied projects. The Company also originates pre-sold, custom and, on a limited basis, speculative home construction. The major thrust of residential construction lending is smaller in-fill construction projects in 
 
7 
 
 inner-city urban neighborhoods, and consisting of single-family residences. During 2016, as commercial real estate prices continued to stabilize and improve, the Company expanded construction financing activity in commercial real estate and multifamily residential construction financing. During 2016, the housing markets in Portland and Seattle experienced very low inventory and high rates of appreciation, thus the Company was selective in financing single-family housing projects in both of these markets. 
 Due to the Companys concentration in real estate secured loans, the Company strategically focuses on increasing its commercial and industrial (C & I) loan lending. In particular, the Company has developed a specialty in C & I lending to dental professionals. Loans to dental professionals include loans for such purposes as starting up a practice, acquisition of a practice, equipment financing, owner-occupied facilities, and working capital. Loans for dental office startups are typically SBA loans as these loans represent additional risk. During 2016, the Company continued to expand its national dental lending program. At year-end 2016, the Company had active dental loans in 44 states which totaled $377,478, of which $227,210 were located outside of the Companys primary markets in Oregon and Washington. Since inception of the national dental lending program, lending has been limited to loans to dental professionals for acquisition of practices by experienced dental professionals, owner-occupied commercial real estate or seasoned practice refinance loans. 
 The Company makes secured and unsecured loans to individuals for various purposes, including purchases of automobiles, mobile homes, boats, and other recreational vehicles, home improvements, education, and personal investment. 
 Inter-agency guidelines adopted by federal bank regulators mandate that financial institutions establish real estate lending policies with maximum allowable real estate loan-to-value limits, subject to an allowable amount of non-conforming loans as a percentage of capital. The Board of Directors has approved specific lending policies and procedures for the Company, and management is responsible for implementation of these policies. The lending policies and procedures include guidelines for loan term, loan-to-value ratios that are within established federal banking guidelines, collateral appraisals, and cash flow coverage. The loan policies also vest varying levels of loan authority in management, the Companys Loan Committee and the Board of Directors. Company management monitors lending activities through management meetings, loan committee meetings, monthly reporting, and periodic review of loans by third-party contractors. 
 Merchant and Card Services 
 In December 2013, the Company entered into an agreement with Vantiv, a third-party provider of merchant services, to outsource all merchant processing for the Banks clients. The agreement provides for a portion of the revenue generated from existing and new clients to be shared with the Company. Through the agreement, the Companys existing merchant portfolio was converted onto the Vantiv platform.
Wealth Management 
 During 2015, the Company began offering wealth management services through a strategic partnership with Transamerica Financial Advisors (TFA) and World Financial Group (WFG). This partnership provides for employees of the Bank to also be Investment Advisors, Registered Representatives, and/or Agents with TFA and WFG. The products available include: individual investment advisory services, Company retirement plans, employee benefits programs, mutual funds, unit investment trusts, fixed and variable annuities, fixed and variable life insurance, long term care, and disability. The products and services are provided by TFA/WFG and the over 100 other financial institutions with which TFA/WFG has selling agreements. Through referral relationships, WFG is also able to provide estate planning documents, and business & personal property solutions. 
Other Services 
 The Company provides other traditional commercial and consumer banking services, including cash management products for businesses, online banking, safe deposit services, debit and automated teller machine (ATM) cards, automated clearing house (ACH) transactions, cashiers checks, notary services and others. The Company is a member of numerous ATM networks and utilizes an outside processor for the processing of these automated transactions. The Company has an agreement with MoneyPass, an ATM provider, which permits Company customers to use MoneyPass ATMs located throughout the country at no charge to the customer.

Employees 
 At December 31, 2016, the Company employed 374 FTE employees with 61 FTE employees in the Puget Sound market, 75 FTE employees in the Portland market, and 79 FTE employees in the Eugene market as well as 159 FTE employees in administrative functions primarily located in Eugene, Oregon. None of these employees are represented by labor unions, and management believes that the Companys relationship with its employees is good. The Company emphasizes a positive work environment for its employees, which is validated by recognition from independent third-parties. 
 During 2016, the Company was recognized for the seventeenth consecutive year by Oregon Business magazine as one of the 100 Best Companies to Work For in Oregon. Also, the Company was recognized by Seattle Business magazine as one of Washingtons 100 Best Companies to Work For. The Portland Business Journal named the Company as one of Oregons most admired companies. This was the sixth time the Company was recognized as a top-ten company in the Financial Services classification. Additionally, Seattle Business magazine named the Company Business of the Year, in the small business category. The Company was recognized by Raymond James as one of the top performing community banks in the country with its prestigious Community Bankers Cup. The award recognizes the top 10 percent of community banks nationally, based on various profitability, operational efficiency and balance sheet metrics. 
 Management continually strives to retain and attract top talent as well as provide career development opportunities to enhance skill levels. A number of benefit programs are available to eligible employees, including group medical plans, paid sick leave, paid vacation, group life insurance, 401(k) plans, deferred compensation plans, and equity compensation plans. 
 Supervision and Regulation 
 General 
 The following discussion provides an overview of certain elements of the extensive bank regulatory framework applicable to the Company and the Bank. This regulatory framework is primarily designed for the protection of depositors and other customers of banks, the federal deposit insurance fund and the banking system as a whole, rather than specifically for the protection of shareholders or other investors in the securities of banking organizations in the United States. Due to the breadth and growth of this regulatory framework, our costs of compliance continue to increase in order to monitor and satisfy these requirements. 
 To the extent that this section describes statutory and regulatory provisions, it is qualified by reference to those provisions. These statutes and regulations, as well as related policies, are subject to change by Congress, state legislatures and federal and state regulators. Changes in statutes, regulations or regulatory policies applicable to us, including the interpretation or implementation thereof, could have a material adverse effect on our business and operations. In light of the financial crisis, which began in 2008 and 2009, numerous changes to the statutes, regulations or regulatory policies applicable to the Company and other banks generally have been made or proposed. The full extent to which these changes will impact our business is not yet known. However, our continued efforts to monitor and comply with new regulatory requirements add to the complexity and cost of our business. 
 Federal and State Bank Holding Company Regulation 
 General. The Company is a bank holding company under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (BHCA), and is therefore subject to regulation, supervision and examination by the Federal Reserve. In general, the BHCA limits the business of bank holding companies to owning or controlling banks and engaging in other activities closely related to banking. The Company must file reports with and provide to the Federal Reserve such additional information as it may require. Under the GLB Act, a bank holding company may apply to the Federal Reserve to become a financial holding company, and thereby engage (directly or through a subsidiary) in certain expanded activities deemed financial in nature, such as securities and insurance underwriting. The Company has not applied to the Federal Reserve to become a financial holding company and has no plans to do so. 
 Holding Company Bank Ownership. The BHCA requires every bank holding company to obtain the prior approval of the Federal Reserve before (i) acquiring, directly or indirectly, ownership or control of any voting shares of another bank or bank holding company if, after such acquisition, it would own or control more than 5 percent of such shares; (ii) acquiring all or substantially all of the assets of another bank or bank holding company; or (iii) merging or consolidating with another bank holding company. 
 
9 
 
Holding Company Control of Non-Banks. With some exceptions, the BHCA also prohibits a bank holding company from acquiring or retaining direct or indirect ownership or control of more than 5 percent of the voting shares of any company which is not a bank or bank holding company, or from engaging directly or indirectly in activities other than those of banking, managing or controlling banks, or providing services for its subsidiaries. The principal exceptions to these prohibitions involve certain non-bank activities that, by statute or by Federal Reserve regulation or order, have been identified as activities closely related to the business of banking or of managing or controlling banks. 
 Transactions with Affiliates. Subsidiary banks of a bank holding company are subject to restrictions imposed by the Federal Reserve Act on extensions of credit to the holding company or its subsidiaries, on investments in their securities, and on the use of their securities as collateral for loans to any borrower. These restrictions prevent the Company from borrowing from the Bank unless the loans are secured by marketable obligations of designated amounts. Further, such secured loans and investments by the Bank to or in the Company are limited individually to 10 percent of the Banks capital stock and surplus and in the aggregate to 20 percent of the Banks capital stock and surplus. The Federal Reserve Act also provides that extensions of credit and other transactions between the Bank and the Company must be on terms and conditions, including credit standards, that are substantially the same or at least as favorable to the Bank as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions involving other non-affiliated companies, or, in the absence of comparable transactions, on terms and conditions, including credit standards, that in good faith would be offered to, or would apply to, non-affiliated companies. These regulations and restrictions may limit the Companys ability to obtain funds from the Bank for its cash needs, including funds for payment of dividends, interest, and operational expenses. 
 Tying Arrangements. The Company is prohibited from engaging in certain tie-in arrangements in connection with any extension of credit, sale or lease of property or furnishing of services. For example, with certain exceptions, neither the Company nor its subsidiaries may condition an extension of credit to a customer on either (i) a requirement that the customer obtain additional services provided by us; or (ii) an agreement by the customer to refrain from obtaining other services from a competitor. 
 Support of Subsidiary Banks. Under Federal Reserve policy and the Dodd-Frank Act, the Company is required to act as a source of financial and managerial strength to the Bank. This means that the Company is required to commit, as necessary, resources to support the Bank. However, the contribution of additional capital to an under-capitalized subsidiary bank may be required at times when a bank holding company may not have the resources to provide such support. Any capital loans a bank holding company makes to its subsidiary banks are subordinate to deposits and to certain other indebtedness of those subsidiary banks. 
 State Law Restrictions. As an Oregon corporation, the Company is subject to certain limitations and restrictions under applicable Oregon corporate law. For example, state law restrictions and limitations in Oregon include indemnification of directors, distributions to shareholders, transactions involving directors, officers or interested shareholders, maintenance of books, records and minutes, and observance of certain corporate formalities. 
Federal and State Regulation of Pacific Continental Bank 
 General. The Bank is an Oregon commercial bank operating in Oregon and Washington with deposits insured by the FDIC. As an Oregon state bank that is not a member of the Federal Reserve System, the Bank is subject to supervision and regulation by the Oregon Department of Consumer and Business Services (the Oregon Department) and the FDIC. These agencies have the authority to prohibit banks from engaging in what they believe constitute unsafe or unsound banking practices. Additionally, the Banks branches in Washington are subject to supervision and regulation by the Washington Department of Financial Institutions and must comply with applicable Washington laws regarding community reinvestment, consumer protection, fair lending, and intrastate branching. 
 Consumer Protection. The Bank is subject to a variety of federal and state consumer protection laws and regulations that govern its relationship with consumers, including laws and regulations that mandate certain disclosure requirements and regulate the manner in which we take deposits, make and collect loans, and provide other services. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations can subject the Bank to various penalties, including but not limited to, enforcement actions, injunctions, fines, civil liability, criminal penalties, punitive damages, and the loss of certain contractual rights. 
 Community Reinvestment. The Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 (CRA) requires that, in connection with examinations of financial institutions within their jurisdiction, the FDIC evaluate the record of the financial institution in meeting the credit needs of its local communities, including low- and moderate-income neighborhoods, consistent with the 
 
10 
 
 safe and sound operation of the institution. In addition to substantial penalties and corrective measures that may be required for a violation of certain fair lending laws, the federal banking agencies may take compliance with such laws and the CRA into account when regulating and supervising other activities, and in evaluating whether to approve applications for permission to engage in new activities or for acquisitions of other banks or companies or de novo branching. An unsatisfactory CRA rating may be the basis for denying the application. In the most current CRA examination report dated February 24, 2014, the Banks compliance with CRA was rated Satisfactory. 
 Insider Credit Transactions. Banks are also subject to certain restrictions imposed by the Federal Reserve Act and the regulations of the Federal Reserve on extensions of credit to executive officers, directors, principal shareholders or any related interests of such persons. Extensions of credit (i) must be made on substantially the same terms, including interest rates and collateral, and follow credit underwriting procedures that are at least as stringent as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with persons not covered above and who are not employees; and (ii) must not involve more than the normal risk of repayment or present other unfavorable features. Banks are also subject to certain lending limits and restrictions on overdrafts to insiders. A violation of these restrictions may result in the assessment of substantial civil monetary penalties, regulatory enforcement actions, and other regulatory sanctions. 
 Regulation of Management. Federal law (i) sets forth circumstances under which officers or directors of a bank may be removed by the institutions federal supervisory agency; (ii) places restraints on lending by a bank to its executive officers, directors, principal shareholders and their related interests; and (iii) generally prohibits management personnel of a bank from serving as a director or in other management positions of another financial institution which assets exceed a specified amount or which has an office within a specified geographic area. 
 Safety and Soundness Standards. Certain non-capital safety and soundness standards are also imposed upon banks. These standards cover internal controls, information systems and internal audit systems, loan documentation, credit underwriting, interest rate exposure, asset growth, compensation, fees and benefits, such other operational and managerial standards as the agency determines to be appropriate, and standards for asset quality, earnings and stock valuation. An institution that fails to meet these standards may be subject to regulatory sanctions. 
 Customer Information Security. The federal bank regulatory agencies have adopted guidelines for safeguarding confidential, personal customer information. The guidelines require each financial institution to create, implement and maintain a comprehensive written information security program designed to ensure the security and confidentiality of customer information, protect against any anticipated threats or hazards to the security or integrity of such information and protect against unauthorized access to or use of such information that could result in substantial harm or inconvenience to any customer. The Bank has adopted a customer information security program. 
 Privacy. The GLB Act requires financial institutions to implement policies and procedures regarding the disclosure of nonpublic personal information about consumers to non-affiliated third parties. In general, the statute requires explanations to consumers on policies and procedures regarding the disclosure of such nonpublic personal information, and, except as otherwise required by law, prohibits disclosing such information except as provided in the banks policies and procedures. The Bank implemented a privacy policy, which provides that all of its existing and new customers will be notified of the Banks privacy policies. State laws and regulations designed to protect the privacy and security of customer information also apply to us. 
Interstate Banking and Branching 
 The Riegle-Neal Interstate Banking and Branching Efficiency Act of 1994 (Interstate Act), together with the Dodd-Frank Act, relaxed prior interstate branching restrictions under federal law by permitting, subject to regulatory approval, state and federally chartered commercial banks to establish branches in states where the laws permit banks chartered in such states to establish branches. The Interstate Act requires regulators to consult with community organizations before permitting an interstate institution to close a branch in a low-income area. Federal banking agency regulations prohibit banks from using their interstate branches primarily for deposit production, and the federal banking agencies have implemented a loan-to-deposit ratio screen to ensure compliance with this prohibition. The Dodd-Frank Act also authorized nationwide de novo branching by national and state banks and certain foreign banks operating in the U.S., which could also result in new entrants to the markets served by the Bank.

Dividends 
 The principal source of the Companys cash is from dividends received from the Bank, which are subject to government regulation and limitations. In addition, capital raises may provide another source of cash. Regulatory authorities may prohibit banks and bank holding companies from paying dividends in a manner that would constitute an unsafe or unsound banking practice or would reduce the amount of its capital below that necessary to meet minimum applicable regulatory capital requirements. The Oregon Bank Act and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 also limit a banks ability to pay cash dividends to its parent company. A bank may not pay cash dividends if that payment would reduce the amount of its capital below that necessary to meet minimum applicable regulatory capital requirements. In addition, under the Oregon Bank Act, the amount of the dividend paid by the Bank may not be greater than net unreserved retained earnings, after first deducting, to the extent not already charged against earnings or reflected in a reserve, all bad debts, which are debts on which interest is unpaid and past due at least six months unless the debt is fully secured and in the process of collection; all other assets charged-off as required by Oregon bank regulators or a state or federal examiner; and all accrued expenses, interest and taxes of the Bank. The Federal Reserve has issued a policy statement on the payment of cash dividends by bank holding companies, which expresses the Federal Reserves view that a bank holding company should pay cash dividends only to the extent that its net income for the past year is sufficient to cover both the cash dividends and a rate of earnings retention that is consistent with the holding companys capital needs, asset quality and overall financial condition. Payment of cash dividends by the Company and the Bank will depend on sufficient earnings to support them and adherence to bank regulatory requirements. 
Capital Adequacy 
 Regulatory Capital Rules. Federal bank regulatory agencies use capital adequacy guidelines in the examination and regulation of bank holding companies and banks. The guidelines are risk-based, meaning that they are designed to make capital requirements more sensitive to differences in risk profiles among banks and bank holding companies. The Federal Reserve Board and the other U.S. federal banking agencies have adopted final rules making significant changes to the U.S. regulatory capital framework for U.S. banking organizations and to conform this framework to the current international regulatory capital accord (Basel III) of the Basel committee on Banking Supervision (the Basel Committee). The Basel Committee is a committee of banking supervisory authorities from major countries in the global financial system which formulates broad supervisory standards and guidelines relating to financial institutions for implementation on a country-by-country basis. These rules replace the U.S. federal banking agencies general risk-based capital rules, advanced approaches rule, market-risk rule, and leverage rules, in accordance with certain transition provisions. Banks, such as Pacific Continental Bank, became subject to the new rules on January 1, 2015. The new rules generally establish more restrictive capital definitions, create additional categories and higher risk-weightings for certain asset classes and off-balance sheet exposures, higher leverage ratios and capital conservation buffers that will be added to the minimum capital requirements and must be met for banking organizations to avoid being subject to certain limitations on dividends and discretionary bonus payments to executive officers. The new rules also implement higher minimum capital requirements, include a new common equity Tier 1 capital requirement, and establish criteria that instruments must meet in order to be considered common equity Tier 1 capital, additional Tier 1 capital, or Tier 2 capital. When fully phased in, the final rules will provide for increased minimum capital ratios as follows: (a) a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 4.50%; (b) a Tier 1 capital ratio of 6.00% (which is an increase from 4.00%); (c) a total capital ratio of 8.00%; and (d) a Tier 1 leverage ratio to average consolidated assets of 4.00%. While earlier proposals would have required that trust preferred securities be phased out of Tier 1 capital, the new rules exempt depository institution holding companies with less than $15 billion in total consolidated assets as of December 31, 2009, such as the Company, from this requirement. These capital instruments, if issued prior to May 19, 2010, and currently in Tier 1 capital, are grandfathered in Tier 1 capital, subject to certain limits. 
 Under the new rules, in order to avoid limitations on capital distributions, including dividend payments and certain discretionary bonus payments to executive officers, a banking organization must hold a capital conservation buffer composed of common equity Tier 1 capital above its minimum risk-based capital requirements (equal to 2.50% of total risk-weighted assets). The phase-in of the capital conservation buffer began on January 1, 2016, and will be completed by January 1, 2019. The new rules also provide for various adjustments and deductions to the definitions of regulatory capital that phase in from January 1, 2014 to December 31, 2017. 
 In January 2014, the Basel Committee issued an updated version of its leverage ratio and disclosure guidance (the Basel III Leverage Ratio). The Basel Committee guidance continues to set a minimum Basel III Leverage Ratio of 3%. In April 2016, the Basel Committee proposed, among other things, that for purposes of calculating the denominator of the leverage ratio, off-balance sheet exposures of banks to securitization transactions should be treated the same as such exposures are treated under the Basel Committee revisions to its securitization framework for risk-based capital. The Basel III Leverage Ratio will be subject to further calibration until 2017, with final implementation expected by January 2018. The Basel Committee is 
 
12 
 
 expected to collect data during this observation period to assess whether a minimum leverage ratio of 3% is appropriate over a full credit cycle and for various types of business models and to assess the impact of using either common equity Tier 1 capital or total regulatory capital as the numerator. 
 The implementation of these new rules could have an adverse impact on our financial position and future earnings due to the inclusion of Tier 1 capital as a core capital component and because of the heightened minimum capital requirements. These capital rules could restrict our ability to grow during favorable market conditions, or require us to raise additional capital and liquidity, generally increase our cost of doing business, and impose other restrictions on our operations. The application of more stringent capital requirements would, among other things, result in lower returns on invested capital and result in regulatory sanctions if we were unable to comply with these requirements. As a result, our business, results of operations, financial condition or prospects could be adversely affected. We expect that we will be able to satisfy the minimum capital requirements adopted by the Federal Reserve and the other U.S. banking agencies within the prescribed implementation timelines. For additional information, see Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  Capital Resources in this Form 10-K. 
 Prompt Corrective Action. Under the guidelines, a bank is assigned to one of five capital categories ranging from well-capitalized to critically under-capitalized. Institutions that are under-capitalized or lower are subject to certain mandatory supervisory corrective actions. At each successively lower capital category, an insured bank is subject to increased restrictions on its operations. Failure to meet regulatory capital guidelines can result in a bank being required to raise additional capital. An under-capitalized bank must develop a capital restoration plan and its parent holding company must guarantee compliance with the plan subject to certain limits. During challenging economic times, the federal banking regulators have actively enforced these provisions. 
 At December 31, 2016, the Company and the Bank each exceeded the required risk-based capital ratios for classification as well capitalized as well as the required minimum leverage ratios for the Bank, and we believe we will meet the minimum capital ratios plus the fully phased-in conservation buffer as implemented. See Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  Capital Resources in this Form 10-K. 
 Regulatory Oversight and Examination 
 The Federal Reserve conducts periodic inspections of bank holding companies, which are performed both onsite and offsite. The supervisory objectives of the inspection program are to ascertain whether the financial strength of the bank holding company is being maintained on an ongoing basis and to determine the effects or consequences of transactions between a holding company or its non-banking subsidiaries and its subsidiary banks. For holding companies under $10 billion in assets, such as the Company, the inspection type and frequency varies depending on asset size, complexity of the organization and the holding companys rating at its last inspection. 
 The Federal Reserve also has extensive enforcement authority over all bank holding companies, such as the Company. Such enforcement powers include the power to assess civil money penalties against any bank holding company violating any provision of the BHCA or any regulation or order of the Federal Reserve Board under the BHCA and the power to order termination of activities or ownership of nonbank subsidiaries of the holding company if it determines that there is reasonable cause to believe that the activities or ownership of the non-bank subsidiaries constitutes a serious risk to the financial safety, soundness or stability of banks owned by the bank holding company. Knowing violations of the BHCA or regulations or orders of the Federal Reserve Board can also result in criminal penalties for the Company and any individuals participating in such conduct. 
 Banks are subject to periodic examinations by their primary regulators. Bank examinations have evolved from reliance on transaction testing in assessing a banks condition to a risk-focused approach. These examinations are extensive and cover the entire breadth of operations of the Bank. Generally, safety and soundness examinations occur on an 18-month cycle for banks under $500 million in total assets that are well-capitalized and without regulatory issues, and on a 12-month cycle otherwise. Examinations alternate between the federal and state bank regulatory agency and may occur on a combined schedule. The frequency of consumer compliance and CRA examinations is linked to the size of the institution and its compliance and CRA ratings at its most recent examinations. However, the examination authority of the FDIC allows it to examine supervised banks as frequently as deemed necessary based on the condition of the Bank or as a result of certain triggering events. Neither the Company nor the Bank is party to a formal or informal agreement with the FDIC, the Federal Reserve or the Oregon Department.

Corporate Governance and Accounting 
 Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the Act) addresses, among other things, corporate governance, auditing and accounting, enhanced and timely disclosure of corporate information, and penalties for non-compliance. Generally, the Act (i) requires chief executive officers and chief financial officers to certify to the accuracy of periodic reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC), (ii) imposes specific and enhanced corporate disclosure requirements, (iii) accelerates the time frame for reporting of insider transactions and periodic disclosures by public companies, (iv) requires companies to adopt and disclose information about corporate governance practices, including whether or not they have adopted a code of ethics for senior financial officers and whether the audit committee includes at least one audit committee financial expert, and (v) requires the SEC, based on certain enumerated factors, to regularly and systematically review corporate filings. 
 As a publicly reporting company, we are subject to the requirements of the Act and related rules and regulations issued by the SEC and NASDAQ. After enactment, we updated our policies and procedures to comply with the Acts requirements and have found that such compliance, including compliance with Section 404 of the Act relating to internal control over financial reporting, has resulted in significant additional expense for the Company. We anticipate that we will continue to incur such additional expense in our ongoing compliance. 
 Anti-terrorism and Anti-Money Laundering 
 USA Patriot Act of 2001. The Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001 (the Patriot Act), intended to combat terrorism, was renewed with certain amendments in 2006 . Certain provisions of the Patriot Act were made permanent and other sections were made subject to extended sunset provisions. The Patriot Act, in relevant part, (i) prohibits banks from providing correspondent accounts directly to foreign shell banks; (ii) imposes due diligence requirements on banks opening or holding accounts for foreign financial institutions or wealthy foreign individuals; (iii) requires financial institutions to establish an anti-money laundering compliance program; and (iv) eliminates civil liability for persons who file suspicious activity reports. 
 In recent years, the federal bank regulators have announced regulatory enforcement actions against a number of large bank holding companies and banks arising from deficiencies in processes, procedures and controls involving anti-money laundering measures and compliance with the economic sanctions that affect transactions with designated foreign countries, nationals and others as provided for in the regulations of the Office of Foreign Assets Control of the U.S. Treasury Department. These actions evidence an intensification of the U.S. governments expectations for compliance with these regulatory regimes on the part of banks operating in the U.S., including the Bank, and may result in increased compliance costs and increased risks of regulatory sanctions. 
 Financial Services Modernization 
 The GLB Act, which became law in 1999, brought about significant changes to the laws affecting banks and bank holding companies. Generally, the GLB Act (i) repealed historical restrictions on preventing banks from affiliating with securities firms; (ii) provided a uniform framework for the activities of banks, savings institutions and their holding companies; (iii) broadened the activities that may be conducted by national banks and banking subsidiaries of bank holding companies; (iv) provided an enhanced framework for protecting the privacy of consumer information and requires notification to consumers of bank privacy policies; and (v) addressed a variety of other legal and regulatory issues affecting both day-to-day operations and long-term activities of financial institutions. Bank holding companies that qualify and elect to become financial holding companies can engage in a wider variety of financial activities than permitted under previous law, particularly with respect to insurance and securities underwriting activities. 
Deposit Insurance 
 The Banks deposits are insured under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, up to the maximum applicable limits, and are subject to deposit insurance assessments designed to tie what banks pay for deposit insurance more closely to the risks they pose. Deposit insurance assessment rates are subject to change by the FDIC and will be impacted by the overall economy and the stability of the banking industry as a whole. As required by the Dodd-Frank Act, the FDIC adopted a comprehensive, long-range restoration plan for the deposit insurance fund to better ensure the adequacy of the funds reserves relative to total insured deposits in the U.S. The ultimate effect on our business of these legislative and regulatory developments relating to the deposit insurance fund cannot be predicted with any certainty. There can be no assurance that the FDIC will not impose special assessments or increase annual assessments in the future. 
 
14 
 
The FDIC may terminate the deposit insurance of any insured depository institution if it determines that the institution has engaged in or is engaging in unsafe and unsound banking practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition or has violated any applicable law, regulation or order or any condition imposed in writing by, or pursuant to, any written agreement with the FDIC. The termination of deposit insurance for the Bank could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations due to the fact that the Banks liquidity position would likely be adversely affected by deposit withdrawal activity. 
 The Federal Deposit Insurance Act provides that, in the event of the liquidation or other resolution of an insured depository institution, the claims of its depositors (including claims by the FDIC as subrogee of insured depositors) and certain claims for administrative expenses of the FDIC as receiver would be afforded a priority over other general unsecured claims against such an institution. If an insured depository institution fails, insured and uninsured depositors along with the FDIC will be placed ahead of unsecured, non-deposit creditors, in order of priority of payment. 
 If any insured depository institution becomes insolvent and the FDIC is appointed its conservator or receiver, the FDIC may, in most cases, disaffirm or repudiate any contract to which such institution is a party, if the FDIC determines that performance of the contract would be burdensome, and that disaffirmance or repudiation of the contract would promote the orderly administration of the institutions affairs. In addition, the FDIC as conservator or receiver may enforce most contracts entered into by the institution notwithstanding any provision providing for termination, default, acceleration or exercise of rights upon or solely by reason of insolvency of the institution, appointment of a conservator or receiver for the institution, or exercise of rights or powers by a conservator or receiver for the institution. 
 Other Legislation 
 Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. The Dodd-Frank Act , enacted in 2010, has resulted in sweeping changes to the U.S. financial system. Among other provisions, the Dodd-Frank Act (1) created the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau with broad powers to regulate consumer financial products such as credit cards and mortgages, (2) created the Financial Stability Oversight Council (comprised of the Secretary of the Treasury, heads of the federal bank regulatory agencies and the SEC, and certain other officials) to provide oversight of all risks created within the U.S. economy from the activities of financial services companies, (3) has led to new capital requirements from federal banking agencies, (4) placed new limits on electronic debit card interchange fees, and (5) required the SEC and national stock exchanges to adopt significant new corporate governance and executive compensation reforms. As discussed below, many of the laws provisions have been implemented by rules and regulations of the federal banking agencies, but certain provisions of the law are yet to be implemented. As a result, the full scope and impact of the law on banking institutions generally and on our business and operations cannot be fully determined at this time. However, the Dodd-Frank Act is expected to have a significant impact on our business operations, including increasing the cost of doing business, as its provisions continue to take effect. Some of the provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act that may impact our business are summarized below. 
 Corporate Governance. The Dodd-Frank Act requires publicly traded companies to provide their shareholders with (1) a non-binding shareholder vote on executive compensation, (2) a non-binding shareholder vote on the frequency of such vote, (3) disclosure of golden parachute arrangements in connection with specified change in control transactions, and (4) a non-binding shareholder vote on golden parachute arrangements in connection with these change in control transactions. Except with respect to smaller reporting companies and participants in the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP), the new rules applied to proxy statements relating to annual meetings of shareholders held after January 20, 2011. 
 Prohibition Against Charter Conversions of Troubled Institutions. The Dodd-Frank Act generally prohibits a depository institution from converting from a state to federal charter, or vice versa, while subject to an enforcement action, unless the bank seeks prior approval from its regulator and complies with specified procedures to ensure compliance with the enforcement action. 
 Overdraft and Interchange Fees. The Federal Reserve has adopted amendments under its Regulation E that imposed new restrictions on banks abilities to charge overdraft services and fees. The rule prohibits financial institutions from charging fees for paying overdrafts on ATM and one-time debit card transactions, unless a consumer consents, or opts in, to the overdraft service for those types of transactions. The opt-in provision established requirements for clear disclosure of fees and terms of overdraft services for ATM and one-time debit card transactions. Since a percentage of the Banks service charges on deposits are in the form of overdraft fees on point-of-sale transactions, this has had an adverse impact on our noninterest income. 
 
15 
 
The Dodd-Frank Act, through a provision known as the Durbin Amendment, required the Federal Reserve to establish standards for interchange fees that are reasonable and proportional to the cost of processing the debit card transaction and imposes other requirements on card networks. Under the final rule, effective in October 2011, the maximum permissible interchange fee that a bank may receive is the sum of $0.21 per transaction and five basis points multiplied by the value of the transaction, with an additional upward adjustment of no more than $0.01 per transaction if a bank develops and implements policies and procedures reasonably designed to achieve fraud-prevention standards set by regulation. The Federal Reserves regulation on charges for overdraft services and interchange fees on debit card transactions reduces the fee revenues that banks receive from the business of processing debit card transactions. While the restrictions on interchange fees do not apply to banks that, together with their affiliates, have assets of less than $10 billion, the rule could affect the competitiveness of debit cards issued by smaller banks. 
 Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. The Dodd-Frank Act created a new, independent federal agency called the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB). The CFPB has broad rulemaking, supervision and enforcement authority for a wide range of consumer protection laws for banks and thrifts with greater than $10 billion in assets. Among the CFPBs responsibilities are implementing and enforcing federal consumer financial protection laws, reviewing the business practices of financial services providers for legal compliance, monitoring the marketplace for transparency on behalf of consumers and receiving complaints and questions from consumers about consumer financial products and services. The Dodd-Frank Act added prohibitions on unfair, deceptive or abusive acts and practices to the scope of consumer protection regulations overseen and enforced by the CFPB. Institutions with less than $10 billion in assets, such as the Company, are subject to rules promulgated by the CFPB but will continue to be examined and supervised by their federal banking regulators for compliance purposes. 
 Repeal of Demand Deposit Interest Prohibition. The Dodd-Frank Act repealed the federal prohibitions on the payment of interest on demand deposits, thereby permitting depository institutions to pay interest on business transaction and other accounts. 
Proposed Legislation 
 Proposed legislation that may affect the Company and the Bank is introduced in almost every legislative session, both federal and state. Certain of such legislation could dramatically affect the regulation of the banking industry and significantly change the competitive and operating environment in which we operate. We cannot predict if any such legislation will be adopted or, if it is adopted, how it would affect the business of the Bank or the Company. Past history has demonstrated that new legislation or changes to existing laws or regulations usually results in a greater compliance burden and therefore generally increases our cost of doing business. 
Effects of Government Monetary Policy 
 Our earnings and growth are affected not only by general economic conditions, but also by the fiscal and monetary policies of the federal government, particularly the Federal Reserve. The Federal Reserve implements national monetary policy for such purposes as curbing inflation and combating recession. Its open market operations in U.S. government securities, control of the discount rate applicable to borrowings from the Federal Reserve, and establishment of reserve requirements against certain deposits, influence the growth of bank loans, investments and deposits, and also affect interest rates charged on loans or paid on deposits. For the past several years, the banking industry has operated in an extremely low interest rate environment relative to historical averages, and the Federal Reserve has pursued highly accommodative monetary measures, including a very low federal funds rate and substantial purchases of long-term U.S. Treasury and agency securities, in an effort to facilitate growth in the U.S. economy and a reduction in levels of unemployment. In December 2016, the Federal Reserve raised the target range for the federal funds rate to  1⁄2 percent. The Federal Reserve indicated that the increase notwithstanding, the stance of monetary policy remains accommodative, thereby supporting a policy aimed at further strengthening in the labor market and a return to two percent inflation. The Federal Reserve further indicated that it expects economic conditions to evolve in a manner which will warrant only gradual further increases in the federal funds rate. The Federal Reserve also indicated that it intended to continue its policy of holding longer-term agency and Treasury securities at sizeable levels to help maintain accommodative financial conditions.

During 2016 and 2015, the Company recorded loan losses provision of $5,450 and $1,695, respectively. At December 31, 2016, the Companys recorded investment in impaired loans, net of government guarantees, was $10,567, with a specific allowance of $736 provided for in the ending allowance for loan losses. See Note 5 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K for additional information regarding the Companys allowance for loan losses. 
 While the Company saw improvement with regard to the overall credit quality of the loan portfolio in 2016, management cannot predict the level of the provision for loan losses, the level of the allowance for loan losses, or the level of nonperforming assets in future quarters as a result of continuing uncertain economic conditions. At December 31, 2016, and as shown above, the Companys unallocated reserves were $1,146 or 5.10% of the total allowance for loan losses at year-end. Management believes that the allowance for loan losses at December 31, 2016, was adequate and that this level of unallocated reserves was prudent in light of the economic conditions and uncertainty that exists in the Northwest markets that the Company serves and the concentration in loans to dental professionals. See Note 6 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K for additional information regarding the dental loan portfolio.

Borrowings 
 The Company uses short-term borrowings to fund fluctuations in deposits and loan demand. The Bank has access to both secured and unsecured overnight borrowing lines. The secured borrowing lines are collateralized by loans. At December 31, 2016, the Company had secured borrowing lines with the Federal Home Loan Bank of Des Moines (the FHLB) and the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco (the FRB). At December 31, 2016, the FHLB borrowing line was limited by the amount of collateral pledged, which limited total borrowings to $632,202. The borrowing line with the FRB is limited by the value of discounted collateral pledged, which at December 31, 2016, was $80,784. At December 31, 2016, the Company also had unsecured borrowing lines with various correspondent banks totaling $154,000. At December 31, 2016, the Company had no overnight borrowings outstanding on its unsecured borrowing lines. Borrowings include interest at the then stated rate. At December 31, 2016, there was $801,986 available on secured and unsecured borrowing lines with the FHLB, the FRB, and various correspondent banks.

 In addition to the Companys $57,000 in short-term borrowings outstanding at December, 31, 2016, the Company had $8,000 in long term FHLB borrowing, for a total of $65,000. The combined short and long-term borrowings had a weighted average interest rate of 1.01% and a remaining average maturity of approximately 1.87 years. More information on the Companys long-term borrowings can be found in Note 13 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K. 
 The Companys other long-term borrowings consisted of two junior subordinated debentures. The first totals $8,248 was issued on November 28, 2005, and matures on January 7, 2036. The interest rate on the debentures was 6.27% until January 2012 after which it was converted to a floating rate of three-month LIBOR plus 135 basis points. In April 2013, the Company entered into a swap agreement with a third party, which fixed the rate on its $8,000 of trust preferred securities at 2.73% for seven years. The second was acquired September 6, 2016 following the acquisition of Foundation Bank. In third quarter 2016, the Company assumed ownership of Foundation Statutory Trust I, which had previously issued $6,000 in aggregate liquidation amount of trust preferred securities. The interest rate on these trust preferred securities is a floating rate of three-month LIBOR plus 173 basis points. The Company also acquired $6,148 of junior subordinated debentures (the Foundation Debentures) to the trust in exchange for ownership of all of the common security of the trust and the proceeds of the preferred securities sold by the trust. In accordance with current accounting guidance, the trust is not consolidated in the Companys financial statements, but rather the Foundation Debentures are shown as a liability, and acquired at an acquisition date fair value of $3,013. The Company also recognized its $186 investment in the Foundation Statutory Trust I, which is recorded among Other Assets in its consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2016 and 2015. 
 In June 2016, in a regional public offering the Company issued $35,000 in aggregate principal amount of fixed-to-floating rate subordinated debentures (the Notes). The Notes are callable at par after five years, have a stated maturity of June 30, 2026 and bear interest at a fixed annual rate of 5.875% per year, from and including June 27, 2016 but excluding June 30, 2021. From and including June 30, 2021 to the maturity date or early redemption date, the interest rate will reset quarterly to an annual interest rate equal to the then-current three-month LIBOR plus 471.5 basis points. The Notes are included in Tier 2 capital (with certain limitations applicable) under current regulatory guidelines and interpretations.
