ITEM 1. BUSINESS
 
At our core, we are a software company whose technology allows retailers to combat the dual threats of Walmart and Amazon — both online and in physical stores. Our microbrand rollup acquisition strategy allows us to demonstrate the effectiveness of our software, devise and test new products, while providing shareholder value through immediate revenue and earnings growth. The Company operates through our subsidiaries on three continents: 12 Hong Kong, Limited (“12HK”, “12 Hong Kong, Ltd.”), 12 Japan, Limited (“12JP”, “12 Japan, Ltd.”), 12 Europe A.G. (“12EU”, “12 Europe AG”), and 12 Retail Corporation (“12 Retail”) (and its subsidiary, E-Motion Apparel, Incorporated (“EAI”, “E-Motion Apparel, Inc.”) in North America).
 
The Subsidiaries: 
 
-12 Hong Kong, Ltd. a corporation organized in the special economic region of Hong Kong. On June 27, 2017 the Company acquired 12 Hong Kong, Ltd. in a share exchange transaction (See section 7 Management Discussion & Analysis). This is the technology company that manages all the Company’s proprietary and licensed technology that is utilized and sold by the other subsidiaries. In addition, this subsidiary serves as an additional marketing and sales hub for Asia, particularly the Chinese market, excluding Japan.
 
-12 Japan, Ltd. a corporation organized in Japan. The Company acquired 12 Japan, Ltd, located in Tokyo, Japan on July 31, 2017 in a share exchange (see section 7 Management Discussion & Analysis). This subsidiary operates in the country of Japan. It is this subsidiary that services our first customer, Itoya Ltd, where our technology was successfully implemented and proven.
 
-12 Europe A.G. a corporation organized in Switzerland. The Company acquired 12 Europe A.G. on October 26, 2017 in a shares exchange. (see section 7 Management Discussion & Analysis). This subsidiary markets, sells, and services the Company’s proprietary and licensed technology to retailers in the European market from its base in Zurich, Switzerland. Since its acquisition, this subsidiary has already signed agreements with 4 retailers, 1 department store and 3 local businesses, to deploy our technology and 12Sconti app (see Our Technology).


-12 Retail Corporation was formed in the state of Arizona, USA and maintains an office in Scottsdale, Arizona. This subsidiary was formed on Sept. 18, 2017 to execute the Company’s microbrand roll up acquisition strategy as well as to penetrate the North American market with our technology to select retailers. All of the microbrands that are acquired will retain their own brand name and identity although they will share some economies of scale and benefit from the management expertise, resources and capital allocation available as a subsidiary of the Company. The microbrands will become subsidiaries of 12 Retail Corporation.
 
-E-motion Apparel, Inc. (“EAI”) On March 12, 2018, The Company acquired 100% of the equity in E-motion Apparel, Inc, a California corporation, though the 12 Retail subsidiary, pursuant to a Share Exchange Agreement (see Section “Subsequent Events”), which itself owns four other microbrands that target specific niche markets: Lexi-Luu Dancewear, Punkz Gear, Cleo VII and Skipjack Dive & Dance Wear. This company, now located in Salt Lake City, Utah, operates its own production and fulfillment facility that management believes can be utilized by all of the Company’s future microbrand acquisitions as a competitive advantage to quickly produce, market, sell and deliver many smaller quantities of garments, keeping online sales channels fresh.
 
The Opportunity:
 
Brick and mortar retailers continue to struggle against online competition, even though online sites haven’t changed much in 20 years. With consumers looking to purchase products in new ways with a larger focus on individualism and social sharing, retailers and merchants are searching for new ways to entice consumers through software technologies that engage consumers both online and in the physical store. These disruptive changes are affecting not just merchants and retailers, but all stages of their supply channel from design and manufacture to distribution and shipping. Consequently, many of the valuations of retailers, merchants, and their suppliers are in the trough while other retailers have simply gone out of business.

However, brick and mortar retailers are not all going to just disappear, although they will change, because consumers shop when they enjoy the shopping experience. Online merchants will change too as the landscape continues to get more competitive. Both online and physical merchants are learning that as consumers habits change, traditional marketing and advertising like TV is much less effective. We call this combination of forces the “Consumer Shift”. This Consumer Shift is driving a convergence of the online/mobile merchant with the physical retailer, as we have seen with Amazon’s acquisition of Whole Foods, Inc. and their opening of physical book stores, and Walmart’s acquisition of Jet.com. That convergence will continue.
 
World-wide retailing represents approximately $28 trillion in revenue, while in 2016 in the U.S. alone all forms of retailing represented $4.65 trillion in annual revenue (according to Statista Feb 2017). While management believes that the Company’s software and technologies can benefit almost all retailers, the Company will initially focus on the Apparel and Cosmetics sectors where they believe we can have the biggest impact and that market generated over $378 billion in 2016 revenue in just the U.S. (Statista Feb 2017).
 
The Company benefits shareholders by generating its revenue and earnings two ways: 1) Through the revenue and earnings generated from its microbrands, and 2) through the revenue generated through the sale and/or licensing of its proprietary software and technology to third party retailers and merchants.
 
Our Technology:
 
The Company’s patented, proprietary technology products, software and services, as well as management expertise, directly addresses the Consumer Shift with software solutions that seamlessly engage consumers both in the physical store and online, encourage social sharing, and advertising while lowering retailer and merchants’ operating costs. We will employ it ourselves at our microbrands where we demonstrate its effectiveness and develop additional feature sets.


Adoption and Deployment of our Software: 
 
Retailers have already expressed interest in our software solutions, recognizing that we demonstrate the 3P’s of successful technology: “Proven, Proprietary, and Patented”. Itoya has already successfully installed our technology in its 13-story lifestyle store in Tokyo and is in talks to install our solutions in more of its stores. Manor, A.G., the largest department store chain in Switzerland with over 60 stores, has now ordered a pilot for two of its stores including its Flagship Store. The Company’s brand new 12Sconti app has been well received and is being promoted by retailers in Switzerland in advance of its planned May 2018 launch. In the United States, in January 2018 the Company hosted nearly 60 top retail executives in association with the National Retail Foundation where it introduced its technology to favorable reviews, and has received interest from retailer in the U.S., Mexico, and Brazil as well.


Our Microbrand Acquisition Strategy:
 
Management defines a “microbrand” as “any brand that generates under $75 million in annual revenue”, and a “minibrand” as “any brand with $75 million to $ 1 billion in annual revenue”. A true “Brand” has over $1 billion in annual revenue. With brick and mortar retail sales in the trough due to the Consumer Shift, management believes that there is a strong opportunity to acquire microbrands based on trough valuations that, through the deployment of our technologies, can produce outsized returns and be generally accretive to our business. Since these microbrands are small, they can be targeted to smaller individual niche demographics, providing the individuality required by the Consumer Shift. Each of our microbrands will be complementary to each other and generally benefit from our technologies.

With the acquisition of significant profitable microbrands, the Company becomes self-sufficient, able to generate its own cash flow to minimize the need to raise capital to support its software development, sales and deployment.
 
Management formed 12 Retail Corporation in Arizona, U.S.A to acquire microbrands and manage its Microbrand strategy:
 
-E-motion Apparel, Inc. On March 12, 2018, subsequent to year ended December 31, 2017 the Company, through its 12 Retail subsidiary, acquired its first microbrand: E-motion Apparel, Inc, (“EAI”), a California corporation founded in 2011, which itself owns four other microbrands that target specific niche markets: Lexi-Luu Dancewear, Punkz Gear, Cleo VII and Skipjack Dive & Dance Wear. This company is now located in Salt Lake City, Utah to take advantage of a “pro-business” well trained employee market, and operates its own production facility that management believes can be utilized by all of the Company’s future microbrand acquisitions as a competitive advantage to produce many small quantity garments that can keep online sales channels fresh, as well as speeding up design and creation of samples so that large scale off-shore production can be accomplished more rapidly. For more information please visit our website at www.E-motionapparelinc.com or on Facebook at: lexi-luu designs-dancewear
 
Additional Microbrands Targeted for Acquisition:
 
The Company has targeted a number of other potential acquisitions and has announced the execution of two Letters of Intent (“LOI”) to acquire three of them: Colorado Trading and Clothing Company d/b/a Active Fashion Group, The J. Peterman Company, LLC, and Krazy Larry, Inc., and continues to perform due diligence while final negotiations and documentation are on-going. If and when these acquisitions are completed, they would add an additional $45 million in annual revenue, and could expect to similarly benefit from the synergies between the other microbrands and the Company’s proprietary technologies.
Our Technology Strategy:
 
Management believes that adoption of our software technology and strategies by physical and online retailers and merchants is the only way for them to combat the dual threat posed by Amazon and Walmart
 
12 Retech Corporation has created a fully-integrated shopping experience driven by new technology and has integrated all aspects of social networking. We refer to our technology simply as the “12 Technology Suite”, or just “12 Suite”. We anticipate we will be the next disruptive innovator in the retail sector. Simply put, 12 Suite is an interactive shopping cart that seamlessly combines shopping and social networking for a fun and unique shopping experience. 12 Suite integrates in-store, online, and mobile shopping with its smart mirror (“12Mirror”), 12Mobile app, and 12Kiosk, while an interactive advertising screen provides special offers from shops, restaurants, and service providers. Over the past 36 months, the Company has developed a proprietary technology suite (software, hardware (the 12Mirror), applications for the iPhone, iPad, and Android phones and tablets (12Mobile)) that integrates traditional shopping, on-line shopping, entertainment and social networking into a “Totally Integrated Retail Platform”.
 
The first fully-integrated store (13 story shopping center) has been fully implemented in Tokyo, Japan and is running successfully since the beginning of 2016. In the meantime, we have been in active negotiations with a Japanese information technology company for distribution rights in Japan and are now working on an enhancement project focusing our system to Promotion / Advertising activities in approximate vicinities. We believe that all elements are in place to continue development and expansion of the concept in department stores, malls and specialized retailers in fashion and/or jewelry.

The 12 Retech Experience
 
USXS – Unifying Shopping eXperience System® - Management believes that the USXS is the solution for all retail problems related to reaching the consumer; the connector of any available technology system and the generator of a truly shopping and entertainment experience for consumers. Our technology is based on the full integration of the 12Mirror / 12ADScreen connected with 12Kiosk, 12Mobile and e-commerce. The whole technology will enable consumers to be independent and freely share information with friends.



We call this the “12 Experience”. We believe that the 12 Experience offers both retailers and customers an exciting, timesaving and efficient way to enjoy and to fully become immersed within the traditional retail environment.
 
We believe that:
 

● | 12 Retech will set a new trend in retailing; changing the way shopping and advertising is done 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | 12 Retech will connect people to business and people to people 
● | 12 Retech will be the first offering a real-time service to consumers wherever they are located 
● | 12 Retech will build on the complete integration of four fundamental retail and entertainment components: Traditional Shopping; Online/Mobile Shopping; Social Networking; PR - Advertising and Entertainment 

Industry Overview
 

● | E-commerce has increased 20% on average each year but remains at only 8% of total commerce. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Many shoppers visit physical shops but purchase online looking for lower a price. 
● | Unqualified shop staff cannot help effectively and can struggle to make consumers happy. 
● | Waiting in line, waiting for fitting rooms, or waiting to pay, can be frustrating and has the potential to make customers exit the store without purchasing. 
● | Small retailers cannot afford to spend significant money on advertising or technology. 
● | Retailers are reluctant to fully embrace the potential of new technologies if it costs them significant money and is difficult to implement the new system. 
● | There is a need to provide an easier way to get special offers to consumers. 

Disruptive Technology
 
The Company is deploying its technology in traditional retail outlets in order to allow for a seamless and novel approach to traditional retail shopping models. In order to advance our concept, we have identified several key concepts that we believe are the cornerstones of our business in the coming months and years. We believe that consumers want to shop in a seamless way, avoiding long lines and avoiding the frustrations that traditional retail shopping has long since been mired.

We firmly believe that the modern shopper:
 

● | Wants to evaluate products all the time, not only while shopping.

● | Likes to learn about a product and get a friend’s recommendation and suggestion through any methodology available, especially social media. 
● | Wants flexible shopping anywhere; online, mobile or at the store. 
● | Wants flexible order and delivery or pick-up at the store. 
● | Wants to receive customized offers and promotions before entering or when they are at the store.

What does it bring to Customers?
 
12 Retech’s technology helps drive more customers to the store and helps to increase sales due to the fact that customer will spend more time in the store browsing and checking products, sales can also be generated after store closure, sales can be generated after the consumer shows the product to friends and speaks with them. The technology allows retailers to receive customized information about customers, learn and understand their behavior and shopping patterns, while providing improved and customized offers to consumers. Customers create free advertising for the retailers through the sharing of pictures taken in the stores.

When synchronized with the 12Mobile application, it enables shoppers to transfer 12Mirror images to their smart phones, purchase items with ease, and share their experience with friends online. The 12Mirror detects products, gives information and collects data from consumers and products that are important for the shop, designer and manufacturer. It also offers related products in store and from other stores if available. 
12Kiosk | 
 | The 12Kiosk is an in-store application to browse products, get information and place orders. In the stores, the 12Kiosk can detect products, provide information, and allow the consumer to checkout on this device as a self-checkout point. It collects data from consumers and products, which in turn are important for the shop, designer, and manufacturer.

12 Retech Will Make Shopping a “Truly Social Experience”
 

Offers to Consumers
 

● | Consumers can enjoy shopping while they socialize with friends, being entertained at all times. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Consumers can check products online, in the store, on the 12Mirror, 12Kiosks or 12Mobile. 
● | Consumers can get customized offers on specific products/brands. 
● | Consumers do not need to wait in line for fittings and paying. They can have the flexibility of home delivery or pick-up at the store. 
● | Consumers can get immediate offers and discounts on products, restaurants or services from business that is in the vicinity (within 10 min walking distance). 
● | Consumers can always get the best immediate deal available on various offers. 

 
12 Retech brings social media to life in a rich, totally immersive and exciting environment. In the store, consumers can connect instantaneously with any available social networking system like Facebook, Skype, WhatsApp, Line, Wechat, etc. Consumers can share pictures and videos, and can get opinions from their families and friends. 12 Retech actively evolves with the rapidly changing “iGeneration.”
 
Advertising and Entertainment
 
In the retail and advertising business, the ideal customer for adopting this concept are department stores, malls or small retailers who want to improve their sales at the shop and online by empowering consumers and providing them with a total experience and also by reaching them with unique offers. For the first stage of our mobile app, we are targeting small and middle level retailers as well as service providers.

We believe that the concept of allowing the Consumer to have fun, receive special offers and being entertained during their shopping experience is very important. 12 Retech makes the consumer feel special, important and empowered, allowing them to choose the best offer available right now at the store they are in or at stores in the vicinity.
