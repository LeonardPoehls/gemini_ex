ITEM 1.     DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS 
Our Corporate History and Background
 
Petrogress, Inc. was incorporated on February 10, 2010 under the laws of the State of Florida as 800 Commerce, Inc. (“800 Commerce”) and was formed for the purpose of marketing credit card processing services on behalf of merchant payment processing service providers.
 
On February 19, 2016, 800 Commerce entered into an Agreement concerning the Exchange of Securities (“SEA”) with Petrogres Co. Limited, a Marshall Islands corporation, and its sole shareholder, Christos Traios, a Greek citizen. 800 Commerce issued 136,000,000 shares of restricted Common Stock, representing approximately 85% of the post- transaction issued and outstanding shares, to Mr. Traios in exchange for 100% of the shares of Petrogres Co. Limited. In connection with the transaction, Mr. Traios was appointed as a director of 800 Commerce, and it amended its constituent documents to increase its authorized capital to 490,000,000 shares of Common Stock, par value $0.001, and 10,000,000 preferred shares, par value $0.001.
 
800 Commerce’s acquisition of Petrogres Co. Limited effected a change in control and was accounted for as a “reverse acquisition” whereby Petrogres Co. Limited was the acquirer for financial statement purposes. Accordingly, the historical financial statements of 800 Commerce are those of Petrogres Co. Limited and its subsidiaries from their respective inception and those of the consolidated entity subsequent to the February 19, 2016 transaction date.
On March 9, 2016, 800 Commerce’s Board of Directors approved an amendment to 800 Commerce’s Articles of Incorporation to change 800 Commerce’s name to Petrogress, Inc. On March 15, 2016, Mr. Traios was appointed Chief Executive Officer. On November 16, 2016, Petrogress, Inc. filed Articles of Merger and Plan of Merger in Florida and Delaware to change Petrogress, Inc.’s domicile by merging with and into a Delaware corporation formed solely for the purpose of effecting the reincorporation. Petrogress, Inc.’s name and capitalization remained the same, and the Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Delaware corporation are the constituent documents of the surviving corporation.
The Company operates as a fully integrated international merchant of petroleum products, focused on the supply and trade of light petroleum fuel oil (LPFO), refined oil products and other petrochemical products to local refineries in West Africa and Mediterranean countries. The Company operates as a holding company and provides its services primarily through its four wholly-owned subsidiaries: Petrogres Co. Limited, which provides management of crude oil purchases and sales; Petronav Carriers LLC, which manages day-to-day operations of its beneficially-owned affiliated tanker fleet, currently consisting of four vessels; Petrogress Int’l LLC, which is a holding company for subsidiaries currently conducting business in Cyprus and Ghana; and Petrogress Oil & Gas Energy Inc., which is primarily focused on purchasing interests in oil fields in Texas and exporting liquefied natural gas. 
The Company’s management team operates from its principal offices located in Piraeus, Greece.

Overview of Significant Subsidiaries
 
Petrogres Co. Limited, is a Marshall Islands corporation, incorporated in 2009 with the purpose of supplying crude oil and other oil products in West Africa. Since its inception, Petrogres Co. Limited has evolved its business from focusing solely on fleet and tanker ship operations to expand into the oil and gas industry as a trader and merchant of oil. Over the last five years, Petrogres Co. Limited has strengthened its position in the oil and gas industry by combining its regional market knowledge with over 25 years of experience to successfully establish both its midstream and downstream operations to serve markets primarily located in West Africa and the Mediterranean.
 
In 2014, Petrogres Co. Limited entered into a Joint Venture Agreement (the “JV Agreement”) with Platon Gas Oil Ghana Limited, an oil refinery and importer of various petroleum products based in Ghana (“Platon”). Pursuant to the terms of the JV Agreement, Platon would process crude oil and other products while Petrogres Co. Limited would sell those products and other raw materials directly to local refineries in Ghana. Due to management changes in Platon on August 2016, we decided to suspend operations conducted under the terms of the JV Agreement.
 
On March 20, 2018 Petrogres Co. Limited entered into a new Partnership Agreement with Platon that is intended to be renewed on an annual basis, pursuant to which Petrogres Co. Limited will supply crude oil for storage, refinement, marketing and distribution in Ghana by Platon. Under the Partnership Agreement, Petrogres Co. Limited is expected to deliver 3,000-5,000 metric tons of crude oil on a monthly basis for storage and processing by Platon into various petroleum products, including crude oil, blend stocks, cutter stock and other feedstock. Platon will also be expected to market and distribute the refined petroleum products.  Net profits from the sale of the petroleum products will be split evenly between Petrogres Co. Limited and Platon. As of the execution of the Partnership Agreement, Petrogres Co. Limited appointed its local commercial manager and its accountant to perform the daily supervision and monitoring of the storage, processing and of the sales of the refined products to local buyers, including the marketing and distribution.
 
In November 2016, Petrogres Co. Limited entered into an alliance agreement with Prometheus Maritime Ltd., a Nigerian corporation (“PML”), a crude oil and gas trading company (the “Alliance Agreement”). Pursuant to the terms of the Alliance Agreement, Petrogres Co. Limited and PML agreed to cooperate on a petroleum project in Nigeria, with Petrogres Co. Limited acting as the lead party, which would facilitate the supply of oil commodities and the attending-servicing of our tankers fleet while they are trading and navigating in Nigeria territory.
 
In addition to the long term arrangements described above, Petrogres Co Limited also makes sales to individual buyers by supplying them crude oil, gas oil and other feedstock products on spot sales, either on Ship-to-Ship (STS) or Cost & Freight (C&F) terms.
 
Currently Petrogres Co. Limited operates as an international merchant of petroleum products specializing in crude oil and refined products trade within West African and Mediterranean countries, with a focus on the supply and trade of light petroleum fuel oil (“LPFO”), refined oil products and other petrochemical commodities to refineries in West Africa and Mediterranean. Such products are shipped and delivered to these refineries by its four beneficially-owned affiliated vessels. We are focused on increasing our sales and expanding our sales base by attempting to register Petrogres Co. Limited with large crude oil suppliers, as SOMO Iraq, NNPC Nigeria and NOC Libya, while we have obtained letters of interest from oil refineries for their supply with our products.
 
Petronav Carriers LLC, is a Delaware limited liability company, incorporated in March 2016 for the purpose of managing the day-to-day operations of four vessels, which are used to transport the Company’s petroleum products within various countries in West Africa. 
 
In December 2016, Petronav Carriers LLC executed a non-binding memorandum of understanding with West Africa Fenders Ltd., a Nigerian company that provides ship-to-ship services to the oil and shipping industries. The memorandum contemplates that Petronav may purchase a 25% interest in the capital of West Africa Fenders Ltd., subject to execution of definitive agreements and customary closing conditions. Although we consider this transaction a priority for our plans of business expansion, it has yet to be consummated, subject to establishing the necessary financing. 
 
Petronav Carriers LLC is actively exploring opportunities to expand its operations by identifying and acquiring additional vessels to expand its fleet. On these grounds, Petronav Carriers LLC is currently in negotiations with certain owners/ sellers based in Dubai to purchase two Aframax tanker vessels, subject to establishing the necessary financing. 
 
Petrogress Int’l LLC, is a Delaware limited liability company, acquired by the Company in September 2017 with the purpose of acting as a holding company for conducting business across the world, including Cyprus, Middle East, and West Africa as an oil energy corporation.
 
In September 2017, Petrogress Int’l LLC acquired 90% of the shares of Petrogres Africa Company Limited from Christos Traios, our President, Chief Executive Officer and sole Director. Petrogres Africa Company Limited holds a current Ghanaian business permit, and is authorized to conduct local sales of oil products and shipping business from the Port of Tema in Greater Accra. Port facilities in Tema will provide a service and operations hub for the Company tankers currently involved in West Africa and Nigerian oil trading and transport.  The Port of Tema also serves as a secondary hub for repair, supply and transport ship operators servicing Ghana’s Tano Basin offshore oil fields in the Gulf of Guinea. Through Petrogres Africa Company Limited, we strengthen our presence and position in a huge and promising market in West Africa and sub-Saharan countries with a population of more than 1.3 billion people designated as the next developing region.

The foregoing joint operations will be conducted under PG Cypyard& Offshore Service Terminal Ltd.
On February 2018, the Company through Petrogress Int’l LLC entered in a Partnership and Memorandum of Understanding agreements with A&E Petroleum Co. Limited, a Nigerian company who owns its own farm with oil storage tanks and private jetty for loading and unloading petroleum products. A&E Petroleum Co. Limited operates in sales and distribution of gas oil in the local market with available storage capacity for approximately 90,000 cubic meters, and is established for the last 8years as an oil wholesale company. The Partnership agreement anticipates that Petrogress Int’l LLC and A&E Petroleum Co. Limited will contribute to the capital and own 55% and 45% respectively, a new entity to be named P&A Nigeria Oil. Co. Ltd. (“PANOC”). This Partnership agreement anticipates among others that Petrogress Int’l LLC or any of its affiliated companies will supply PANOC with about 5-6,000 tons gas oil on a monthly basis; PANOX will then store and distribute and/ or sell the oil to local end-buyers. 
On February 2018, Petrogress Int’l LLC executed a Representation/Agency agreement with Mr. Louizos George, with the aim of establishing its representation in Erbil, Iraq. Mr. Louizos is handling on behalf of Petrogress Int’l LLC the negotiations with SOMO (the Iraqi National Oil Company) to register the company as a buyer and obtain an allocation of Basrah Light Crude Oil for 1,000,000 barrels per month under a long term contract. The registration process is ongoing and we hope to finalize it within the second quarter 2018.
 
On March 2018, the company appointed Mr. Osy Adah as its representative in Nigeria. Mr. Adah is a Nigerian Citizen who has previously worked as a manager in major Nigerian oil companies. Through our representative, we have commenced the procedures for the registration of Petrogress Int’l LLC with Nigeria National Petroleum Company (NNPC) for an allocation for supplying half million barrels of Bonny light on monthly terms.
 
On March 23, 2018, Petrogress Int’l LLC, executed another Partnership agreement with a Nigeria Oil storing company Gonzena Hydrocarbons and Energy Co.

PEGNOC will be assigned from Gonzena two oil tanks each with a capacity of 15,000 liters.
 
Petrogress Oil & Gas Energy Inc., is a Texas corporation, incorporated in December 2015 and is focused on identifying and acquiring suitable interests in oil fields in Texas to allow for the Company’s expansion of its operations to include oil refinery production based within the United States and to export liquefied natural gas (“LNG”) to Mediterranean markets.
 
On September 2017, Petrogress Oil & Gas Energy Inc. through its affiliated company Petrogres Africa Company Limited, commenced negotiations with Ghana National Petroleum Company (“GNPC”) for the exploration of the oil fields in Saltpond basin and the repairs of the oil rig-platform “APG-1” where a survey on the of the platform is carried-out by a US specialist, for the assessment of the repairs cost of the platform and the improvement of the oil production. 
 
The Saltpond oil fields, including the APG-1 platform, were operated by the Texas corporation Lushann International Energy, Inc. (“Lushann”), under a Petroleum Agreement with GNPC since 2004 (the “Petroleum Agreement”). Due to financial and technical issues the Petroleum Agreement was suspended by GNPC on August 2017 and the operations in Saltpond ceased.
 
Based on our interest on re-commencing the operations and to continue the oil production, we conducted negotiations with Lushann, which were concluded on February 16 2018, with the execution of a Memorandum of Understanding between Petrogress Oil & Gas Energy Inc. and Lushann. Under the terms of this memorandum, Petrogress Oil & Gas Energy Inc. elected to play the role of a farm-in-partner in the crude oil and the associated gas production in the developing area of 12 km² of the Saltpond oil field. The parties have agreed to form a Ghanaian limited liability company to be named PG – Saltpond Offshore Oil Production & Development Co., Limited (“SODCO”). Subject to the removal of the suspension of the Petroleum Agreement, and the assignment of 65% of SODCO to Petrogress Oil & Gas Energy Inc., the latter intends to undertake the necessary repairs and improvements of the APG-1 platform, and arrange a cash investment of $3.5 million plus a credit line of $15.0 million. The agreement is expected to be finalized in May 2018.
 
Our business structure affords us with full control of the logistics involved in oil sourcing and the transportation of our products by our affiliated vessels, which we believe to be a competitive advantage in West African markets. By directly controlling all aspects of our operations, as opposed to engaging the services of third-parties at potentially higher costs, we are able to keep costs low and thus generate revenue from a number of different sources.
 
Competition
 
International seaborne transportation of LPFO and the supply of petroleum products is mainly conducted by two types of operators: independent fleet-owning companies and fleets operated by both private and state owned oil companies. Many oil companies and other oil trading companies also operate their own vessels and transport oil for themselves and third-party charterers in direct competition with independent owners and operators. Competition for charters is intense and is based upon price, vessel location, the size, age, condition and acceptability of the vessel, and the quality and reputation of the vessel’s operator. 
 
The Company will compete in the transportation of petroleum products with much larger companies that have significantly longer operating histories and are much better capitalized. Most of these other operators are larger in size and with more vessels either under management or owned. They may also operate in a larger geographical area than the Company does at present and have significantly more capital and other resources from which to conduct their operations and as a result, face less risk in their operations.
