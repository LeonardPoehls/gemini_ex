 Merger with Wyndham Worldwide and Spin of our owned real estate business
 On January 17, 2018, La Quinta Holdings Inc., Wyndham Worldwide Corporation, a Delaware corporation (“Wyndham Worldwide”), and WHG BB Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Wyndham Worldwide (“Merger Sub”), entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”), pursuant to which, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, Wyndham Worldwide agreed to acquire our franchise and management business for cash (such acquisition, the “Merger”). In connection with the Merger, La Quinta Holdings Inc. and CorePoint Lodging Inc. a Maryland corporation and an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of La Quinta Holdings Inc. (“CorePoint Lodging”), entered into a Separation and Distribution Agreement dated January 17, 2018 (the “Separation Agreement”), pursuant to which, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Separation Agreement, immediately prior to the merger with Wyndham Worldwide, we will, among other things, (i) effect a reclassification and combination of our common stock whereby each share of our common stock will be reclassified and combined into one half of a share of our common stock (par value $0.02) (the “Reverse Stock Split”), (ii) convey our owned real estate assets and certain related assets and liabilities to CorePoint Lodging and, (iii) thereafter, distribute (the “Spin”) to our common stockholders all of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock of CorePoint Lodging, which will become a separate publicly traded company. 
 On the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, at the effective time of the Merger, which will occur after completion of the Reverse Stock Split and immediately after the effective time of the Spin, each share of our common stock will be converted into the right to receive $16.80 in cash per share.
 Immediately following the Spin, in accordance with and subject to the terms of the Merger Agreement, Merger Sub will merge with and into the Registrant, with the Registrant continuing as the surviving company and as a wholly-owned indirect subsidiary of Wyndham Worldwide, and our common stock will be delisted from the New York Stock Exchange (the “NYSE”). 
 The boards of directors of each of Wyndham Worldwide and La Quinta have approved the Merger Agreement. The Merger is subject to the approval of our stockholders, the completion of the Reverse Stock Split and the Spin and certain customary conditions.
 There is no assurance that the Spin and/or the Merger will occur.  See “Risk Factors—Risks related to the pending Spin and merger” in “Part I—Item 1A. Risk Factors.”
 Company overview
 Our system-wide portfolio, as of December 31, 2017, consisted of 902 hotels representing approximately 88,400 rooms located predominantly in 48 states across the U.S., as well as in Canada, Mexico, Honduras and Colombia, of which 317 hotels were owned and operated and 585 were franchised. We also have a pipeline of 261 franchised hotels as of December 31, 2017, to be located in the United States, Mexico, Colombia, Nicaragua, Guatemala, Chile and El Salvador (89% of which represents new construction as opposed to the conversion of an existing hotel).

As illustrated by the following table, from 2007 to December 31, 2017, we have grown our total number of owned and franchised hotels worldwide from 634 properties to 902 properties.


La Quinta was founded in San Antonio, Texas in 1968 and has a nearly 50-year history of owning and operating hotels. From 1973 to January 2006, we operated through our predecessors as a public company. In January 2006, we were acquired by Blackstone (the “Acquisition”). At the time of the Acquisition, we had a total of 425 hotels, of which 267 were owned hotels and 158 were franchised hotels. Since the Acquisition and through December 31, 2017, we expanded our franchise system by over three times, growing from 158 franchised hotels to 585 franchised hotels. We also established a franchise presence in Mexico, Central America and South America, with 38 hotels either open or in the pipeline in those regions.
 Our brand and hotels
 We operate our business across two segments: owned hotels and franchise and management. These segments are components of the business which are managed discretely and for which discrete financial information is reviewed regularly by our CEO, who is our chief operating decision maker, to assess performance and make decisions regarding the allocation of resources. For more information regarding our segments, see “Part II—Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and Note 17: “Segments” in our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

 We own our owned hotels through wholly owned subsidiaries except for one hotel, which is owned by a joint venture in which we own a controlling interest. Generally, our owned hotels include the land, related easements and rights, buildings, improvements, furniture, fixtures and equipment, though certain of our owned hotels are located on land leased by us pursuant to ground leases with third parties.
 We own, operate and franchise all of our hotels under the La Quinta Inn, La Quinta Inn & Suites and LQ Hotel trademarks. As of December 31, 2017, the hotels in our system consisted of 707 La Quinta Inn & Suites hotels, which include guest suites and are generally our newer hotels with interior corridors, 183 La Quinta Inns, 88 of which include interior corridors, and 12 LQ Hotels, which is the primary trademark under which our hotels are identified in Mexico and Central and South America. When STR’s price points by segment are applied to each of our hotels, approximately 34% would be considered upper-midscale, approximately 47% would be considered midscale, approximately 8% would be considered economy (principally our owned hotels) and the balance would be considered in the segments above upper-midscale. We are focused on providing clean and comfortable guest rooms at affordable prices in convenient locations. Our hotels typically include common areas with amenities such as a great room (including breakfast seating area, lobby with seating area and business center), swimming pool and vending areas, and typically offer a complimentary breakfast. Our guest mix includes both business and leisure travelers. As of December 31, 2017, the hotels in our owned portfolio have an average age of 29 years, and the hotels in our franchise portfolio have an average age of 14 years, with over 30% being in our system less than five years.
 Current designs for new La Quinta hotels are typically four story structures and approximately 56,900 square feet with approximately 85 to 120 interior corridor guest rooms. International La Quinta hotels generally also include expanded breakfast offerings, full-service restaurants and between 85 and 165 rooms. Certain of our owned hotels are larger than our typical design. For example, our hotel in downtown Chicago, which was converted from office space to a La Quinta-branded hotel in 2009, is approximately 141,000 square feet with 241 guest rooms. All new franchised hotels are La Quinta Inn & Suites in the U.S., and Canada. Franchised hotels in Mexico, Central and South America, use “LQ Hotel” as the primary mark.  
 At both our La Quinta Inn & Suites and La Quinta Inn hotels in the U.S. and Canada, our guests typically have convenient access to food service at nearby freestanding restaurants, which include many national chains. We own approximately 57 buildings that are adjacent to some of our owned hotels, which we generally lease to third party restaurant operators.
 Our franchise agreements allow us to require franchised hotels to replace furnishings every five to seven years and require upgrades to meet then-current brand standards at any time, but under these agreements, we may not require substantial upgrading or remodeling more often than once every five years.
 In addition, we have an active advisory Brand Council that includes both Company and franchisee representation and meets three to four times a year to discuss ways to strengthen our brand. Franchise representatives are elected from their geographical areas. Through the Brand Council, we often test new concepts at both owned and franchised hotels.

We regularly repair and maintain our owned hotels, and review each hotel to assess the need for renovations based on asset condition.  Maintenance and renovation capital expenditures are comprised of repair and maintenance in ordinary course operations, customary cycle renovations and ongoing maintenance of our technology infrastructure in order to keep it current. Customary cycle renovations can range from design renovations to full renovations and can include, among other things, replacement of mattresses, seating, fixtures or carpet, repainting, window treatments and improvements in the common areas and exteriors. We maintain a variety of designs and décor scheme options for our rooms and select the room scheme for a given hotel’s cycle renovation based on market factors and our review of the optimal return for the capital invested.
 On an ongoing basis, we evaluate additional capital projects such as accelerating renovation cycles for our owned hotels as well as investing in technology innovation that enhances our guest experience, and we will invest in those projects that we believe will provide an appropriate return on capital invested and increase RevPAR Index. In 2016, we undertook a review of our owned hotel portfolio to identify properties that, with the appropriate scope of capital investment and renovation, have the opportunity to re-position upwards within a market, capturing occupancy and additional rate while being measured against new, higher-quality competitive sets. Renovations of approximately 50 properties identified in this review commenced in the fourth quarter of 2016, with the start and completion dates staged through 2017 and 2018. As of December 31, 2017, 27 of these hotel renovations were substantially completed. For additional information, see “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations―Key components and factors affecting our results of operations―Revenues.”
 We continually evaluate our owned hotel portfolio and, from time to time, we may sell certain hotels or groups of hotels that we determine are not consistent with our overall brand experience. In 2016, as part of a strategic review of our owned hotel portfolio, we identified approximately 50 hotels as possible candidates for sale. In 2017, we entered into definitive purchase agreements to sell three of those hotels, one of which sold during 2017 and one of which sold in 2018, and in 2016 we entered into agreements to sell five additional owned hotels, three of which were sold during 2016 and two of which were sold in 2017.
 The following table summarizes our key operating statistics for our owned, franchised and managed hotels for the past five years (1):

Our owned hotel operations
 
Centralized corporate services for our owned hotels include marketing, global and regional sales, revenue management, accounting, finance, treasury, tax, information systems, construction and design, purchasing, legal, risk management, human resources and training.  During 2016, we reorganized our owned hotels leadership to include new levels of field support to provide additional operational leadership to our general managers. These regional and district managers are responsible for the oversight of day-to-day owned hotel operations, on-site guest experience, and certain regional and local financial and other operational metrics for their assigned hotels and areas.
 
Each owned hotel is operated as an individual profit center, generally with an on-site general manager who oversees all day-to-day operations. Our general managers focus their attention on delivering our “Here For You” guest experience, maintaining clean and comfortable guest rooms and achieving profitable operations. Their responsibilities also include recruiting, training and supervising the hotel’s staff. A typical owned hotel has approximately 20 to 25 employees, including the general manager, housekeepers, laundry attendants, maintenance staff, front desk guest service representatives and a night auditor. We also utilize assistant managers to support the general managers at certain hotels, which provides a pool of experienced candidates to fill open general manager positions as needed.
 
Our general managers receive a comprehensive training program through LQUniversity, our nationally recognized training and development program. Our team of trainers has both training and operational experience. LQUniversity offers comprehensive training solutions to enable our owned hotels to operate more successfully and deliver on our “Here For You” guest experience. Many of these same programs are made available to franchisees. 
 
We use target-driven operational budgets, prepared by our general managers, which are deployed after review with our senior management. Under the direction of our revenue management team, the hotel general managers, field leadership team and senior management continually review our room rates and price rooms based on the prevailing market conditions at each owned hotel. Each general manager can earn financial incentives based upon achieving favorable results in comparison to revenue and profit targets and upon achieving targeted goals in their RevPAR Index and Net Promoter scores for their respective hotel. Our Net Promoter Score, which measures a guest’s intent to recommend our brand, is calculated through guest satisfaction surveys that are conducted utilizing an independent market research company. These surveys provide guest feedback on each of our hotels. Financial incentives reward our general managers for improvements in Net Promoter Scores which are indicative of guest satisfaction levels. From time to time, we may adjust the labor model at specific hotels in order to help ensure consistent delivery of our guest experience. We believe this operating model and incentive program increase our general managers’ focus on operating efficient, well-maintained and profitable hotels and on delivering a “Here For You” guest experience.  
 
Our franchising operations
 
Our franchising activities include franchising both newly constructed hotels and existing hotels converted to meet our brand standards. La Quinta Inn & Suites represents the current standard for La Quinta in the United States and Canada and has largely been the exclusive focus of franchise growth since 2007. Franchised hotels in Mexico, Central, and South America utilize the LQ Hotel primary trademark.  As of December 31, 2017, there were 585 open and operating franchised La Quinta lodging facilities in the United States, Canada, Mexico, Honduras and Colombia and a pipeline of 261 locations, each represented by an executed franchise agreement. Twenty-six of these properties are to be located in Mexico, Colombia, Nicaragua, Guatemala, Chile and El Salvador. The remaining properties are to be located throughout the United States, with 67 in Texas, 21 in California, 16 in Florida, 13 in New York, and the remaining 118 properties dispersed among 27 other states.
 
Franchising sales
 
We believe that hotel owners and operators choose to become a franchisee of a lodging brand based primarily on the perceived value and quality of that brand and the franchisor’s services, and the extent to which affiliation with that franchisor may increase the franchisee’s profitability. Because a significant portion of the costs of owning and operating a hotel are generally fixed, increases in revenues generated by affiliation with a franchise lodging chain can improve a hotel’s financial performance. We offer our franchisees our strong brand awareness supported by well-developed infrastructure that includes reservation, national advertising, training and systems-related services.

Franchising agreements and fees
 
A prospective franchisee is typically required to pay us a nonrefundable application fee of $5,000 when an application is made for a La Quinta franchise. We evaluate franchise applicants on the basis of their hotel operating experience and ability, financial resources strength and credit history, among other factors. Our current form of franchise agreement provides that approved franchise applicants will pay us an initial fee of $55,000, against which the application fee is credited, for up to 100 authorized guest rooms, plus $550 per guest room over 100. Historically, we have modified this initial fee to adapt to differing circumstances, such as the size and type of hotel facility, the location of the hotel site, and the experience and creditworthiness of the applicant. During our fiscal year ended December 31, 2017, franchisees were charged initial fees up to $57,200.  In certain instances, we determined to charge an initial fee below our standard initial fee based upon factors we determined sufficient to justify a reduced fee under the circumstances, such as size and type of the hotel facility, the location of the hotel site and the experience and creditworthiness of the applicant. Additionally, a franchisee may expand the number of guest rooms in a hotel with our approval, which generally requires payment of the then-standard per room initial fee per guest room. A franchisee may also transfer ownership of a hotel with our approval, which may require payment of a transfer fee.
 
Approved franchise applicants are granted rights (subject to the terms of their franchise agreement) to operate their hotels under our trademarks and system, to obtain reservations through our central reservation system and to use our hotel designs, operating systems and procedures, among other rights. Our franchise agreements generally restrict our ability to open a new owned or franchised hotel in a limited area near the franchised hotel, which can range from several city blocks in an urban area to several square miles in less populated areas.
 
Our franchise agreements for existing franchised hotels in the United States generally require a franchisee to pay a royalty fee of 4.0% of gross room revenues (as defined in the franchise agreement) during the first two years of operating under our brand and 4.5% of gross room revenues for all periods thereafter. Our current form of franchise agreement for newly franchised hotels in the United States requires a franchisee to pay a royalty fee of 4.5% of gross room revenues during the first two years of operating under our brand and 5.0% of gross room revenues for all periods thereafter. Under current agreements, after the first two years, a U. S. franchisee can receive a rebate of 0.5% of gross room revenues if, in any calendar year, the franchised hotel achieves superior results in guest satisfaction as measured and defined by results of surveys conducted by an independent market research firm. However, our current form of franchise agreement for newly franchised hotels outside of the United States does not include a royalty fee ramp up or rebates for guest satisfaction results. In addition to royalty fees, a franchisee generally pays, as a percentage of gross room revenues, a marketing fee of 2.5% for brand advertising and other promotional efforts and a reservation fee of 2.0% to support the cost of reservation services provided to the hotels. Franchisees also pay us other fees, such as fees to participate in our online LQConnect intranet, computer related fees, attend training programs and participate in our La Quinta Returns program. We also provide franchisees the option to purchase revenue management services for their hotel, at fees ranging from $700 to $1,600 per month depending on the size of the hotel and services provided.
 
Our franchise agreements generally have an initial term of 20 years, and, as of December 31, 2017, the average remaining term of our existing franchise contracts for open locations was approximately 14 years. We, and the franchisee, generally have a right to terminate the agreement on the tenth and fifteenth anniversary of the opening date of the franchised hotel and, if the hotel was converted from a competing brand, additionally on the fifth such anniversary. The franchisee may also terminate the agreement if the hotel is not meeting predetermined occupancy levels, which may, under certain circumstances, require payment of specified termination fees to us. Additionally, we have the right to terminate a franchise agreement if a franchisee fails to meet our quality standards or fulfill other contractual obligations, which may, under certain circumstances, require payment by the franchisee of specified liquidated damages to us. Since the inception of our franchising program, excluding temporary franchised locations, we have retained approximately 82% of our franchise properties and the majority of the terminations were initiated by us. During the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017, 15 franchise agreements for open locations terminated. All of these terminations were initiated by us. In addition, we had two temporary franchise agreements that terminated. The temporary franchise agreements were provided to owners of disposition properties (who were given the option to continue using the La Quinta brand while they transitioned to a new brand) which expired by their terms or were mutually terminated.
 
Franchising operations support
 
As of December 31, 2017, the average size of our franchised hotels is approximately 82 rooms. Before a franchised hotel opens, we inspect the hotel to confirm that it meets our quality specifications. Once a franchised hotel opens, we strive to provide continued sales support and operational assistance. Each franchised hotel must adhere to rigorous brand standards of design, maintenance and guest service and is inspected periodically by a franchise service director to assure that the franchised hotel adheres to our brand standards. Competition for franchise agreements, however, may require us to reduce the level of hotel improvements required for a particular hotel.

Financial assistance and incentives to new franchisees
 
We do not presently have a company-funded financial assistance program for franchisees. However, on occasion we have provided, and at our discretion may occasionally provide in the future, franchisees with various forms of financial incentives or assistance upon varying terms, depending upon a number of factors. These factors include: the number of hotels involved and their locations, the number of rooms involved, relevant market conditions and other factors that may warrant providing financial incentives or assistance.
 
Our pipeline
 
As of December 31, 2017, we had a pipeline of 261 franchise agreements for future franchised hotels, representing approximately 24,500 rooms. Each hotel in our pipeline is represented by an executed franchise agreement for a term of 20 years following opening. Eighty-nine percent of our pipeline represents new construction and the remaining 11% represents the conversion of an existing hotel into a La Quinta-branded hotel. As of December 31, 2017, approximately 28% of the new construction and conversion of hotels in our pipeline had commenced. However, based on historical experience, while converted hotels in our pipeline can generally become operational between 12 to 18 months from the date of execution of the franchise agreement, and newly constructed hotels in our pipeline can generally become operational between 36 to 48 months from the date of execution of the franchise agreement, openings may be delayed, or abandoned, due to economic conditions, weather, construction and permit delays and other factors. Moreover, the commitments of owners and developers with whom we have agreements are subject to numerous conditions, and the eventual development and construction of our pipeline not currently under construction is subject to numerous risks, including, in certain cases, the ability of the franchisee to obtain governmental and regulatory approvals and adequate financing.
 Additionally, because revenues from franchised hotels are principally derived from franchise fees rather than room rentals, as we grow our system by increasing the number of franchised hotels, our revenues and expenses will increase at a significantly slower rate than if we were growing our system through an increase in number of owned hotels.
 As of December 31, 2015, 2016 and 2017 our pipeline numbered 228, 248 and 261 franchise agreements for franchised hotels, respectively. The size of our pipeline is a function of both the number of new agreements signed and the pace of opening hotels in the pipeline and, accordingly, will fluctuate over time. Moreover, we periodically evaluate our pipeline to determine whether to terminate any contracts and/or seek new franchisees in any particular locations. We opened 18% of the hotels in our pipeline as of the end of 2015 in 2016 and 14% of the hotels in our pipeline as of the end of 2016 in 2017.
 Our mission
 We are guided by two primary goals that we believe contribute to a high level of employee and guest engagement:
 1. Live our core values, which are defined by our people:
  
• | People : People are the heart of everything we do. Make coming to work the best part of their day. Treat everyone with respect.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Passion : Approach each work day with a sense of ownership and personal pride. Always do “whatever it takes.”
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Integrity : Always do the right thing, even when no one is watching.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Excellence : Do ordinary things extraordinarily well. Good is not good enough; strive for the best in all you do.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Unique : La Quinta is big but acts small. We are not afraid to be different.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

 2. Delight our guests with an experience that makes them feel:
  
• | Assured : Secure, confident they made the right choice with La Quinta.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Settled in : Comfortable, relaxed in their surroundings.
--+---------------------------------------------------------


• | Optimistic : Ready to take on the new day—whatever it holds.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------

 
Our two goals can be summarized using a single phrase—“Here For You.” It is not a program or a slogan, but a way of life at La Quinta that is built upon the purpose and core values that guide us. Our values are delivered by people who have a unique passion to enhance our guests’ experience and create enduring relationships by striving for excellence and serving with integrity every day. “Here For You” creates meaningful and differentiated experiences that are uniquely La Quinta and provides us with a powerful business advantage. “Here For You” provides valuable insight into not only what motivates our team members and drives them to perform and innovate; it also helps to inform our strategies through a better understanding of guest preferences which drives business results.

--+--------------------------------------------------------

 The La Quinta brand is promoted through national, regional and local marketing. We advertise our brand on television through national cable and spot TV as well as national network radio, on the web through online advertising, social media, search marketing and email campaigns and in print through newspapers and magazines. We also conduct direct marketing to potential and former guests, including La Quinta Returns members. Our marketing is primarily supported through fee contributions, calculated as a percentage of gross room revenues, from our owned and franchised hotels to our marketing programs, including La Quinta Returns and the Brand Marketing Fund (“BMF”).
 Our international marketing efforts are intended to reinforce general brand awareness while targeting local market needs. A portion of the fees paid to the BMF by Mexico franchisees is allocated to a Mexico marketing program. Similarly, a portion of the marketing fees paid into the BMF by franchisees in other countries are utilized for marketing the brand in the geographic area in which the hotel is located.
 
We have also launched a system-wide military initiative that supports hiring of military veterans, community outreach, franchise growth, sourcing and La Quinta Returns loyalty program tiers geared towards the military community.
 La Quinta Returns.  As of December 31, 2017, we had over 15 million members in our La Quinta Returns loyalty program, approximately three million of which we consider active members (which generally refers to our loyalty program members who earn or redeem La Quinta Returns points within the previous 18 months). We believe our loyalty program is favored by our members because of:

• | rapid accumulation of rewards, including free nights at La Quinta locations, free nights at thousands of resort properties worldwide, airline miles and credits, magazine subscriptions, and gift cards from national restaurant chains and retailers;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | rapid achievement of Gold and Elite status, after as few as 10 nights in a calendar year;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | instant Gold status for military personnel and their families; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------


• | ability for Visa Card Holders to redeem their La Quinta Returns points anytime using their mobile phones for everyday purchases at over one million U.S. retail locations, including places like grocery stores, restaurants and coffee shops.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Our Returns program also helps expedite the reservation and check-in process and improves administrative efficiency of our reservation agents and front desk staff by providing a personal profile of each Returns member. This profile includes information such as email and mailing address and preferred method of payment that we use to market directly to Returns members.

 Our sales operation
 Sales. As of December 31, 2017, we employed a direct sales force consisting of approximately 110 professionals. The direct sales force consists of approximately 37 global sales managers, funded by the BMF, who call on Fortune 500 companies and mid-tier businesses to increase our corporate travel base. For the year ended December 31, 2017, corporate accounts, including government and military accounts, generated approximately 24% of system-wide consumed room revenues. These accounts typically have a significant number of travelers in the regions in which we operate and need a high volume of room-nights. Global sales managers also seek to increase room sales through inclusion in approved or preferred lodging lists of corporate travel managers and travel agencies operating on a national basis. We also maintain and continue to seek alliances with national travel and consumer organizations, such as AAA and AARP, and offer special rates or promotions to such organizations’ guests. In addition to the global effort, approximately 73 of our sales managers, funded by our owned hotels, are based in our regional markets. These sales managers’ efforts are tied to specific hotels. They target business in the surrounding markets of the hotels, as well as governmental agencies, hospitals and other organizations.
 The following graph reflects the percentage of comparable system-wide consumed room revenues that is attributable to each of our internal and external distribution channels in 2017.


Property direct and call center.  Property direct reservations are made by guests calling the property directly or “walking in” to the property without a previously made reservation. Our call center consists of our own central reservation system, as well as toll-free numbers to accept reservations. Our reservation system provides reservation agents with information about hotel locations, available rooms and prices in order to assist guests in reserving rooms. Our reservations agents are trained in telephone sales techniques. Through our computer network, we continually update the number of rooms sold at each hotel to maximize the sale of available rooms through either the individual hotel or the reservation center.
 LQ internet & mobile (LQ.com). We provide guests with the ability to shop and reserve rooms on the Internet through our brand website, www.LQ.com, and through mobile via the La Quinta Returns app and the LQ Instant Hold platform. The LQ Instant Hold feature permits our guests to use a mobile application to hold a room for up to four hours from any smart device by just entering a phone number. Our website and app provide guests with real-time information on each hotel through hotel micro-sites that contain Trip Advisor scores, location, descriptions, amenities, special promotions, rates and availability for each La Quinta hotel. Hotel

photographs are prominently displayed on the hotel information pages along with dynamic maps and driving directions, information on nearby attractions and local weather information. Multiple search options are offered, including searches by city, attraction, zip code and trip routing from origin or destination.  Guests who book through LQ.com, our mobile site or our LQ Returns app can also take advantage of our innovative and industry-leading Ready For YouTM option and receive a notice on their smart devices that their room is ready for check in. 
 Online travel agency and global distribution systems. In addition to our proprietary brand website, we distribute our lodging product via third party travel websites. We market our reservation services to both online and offline travel agents and corporate travel planners who may make reservations through global airline reservation distribution systems. We also have specialized reservation agents for large group sales, motor coach sales and special service bookings.
 Our information systems
 We have created an innovative technology deployment methodology that has enabled a collaborative environment where cross departmental business partners work very closely and effectively with technology teams and third parties to innovate, design and deploy technology-enabled improvements. 
 We employ an appropriate blend of in-house development of technology solutions and third-party best of breed software-as-a-service providers. We have also moved away from deployment of technology hosted at hotels and moved key systems such as hotel management systems, phone switches, back office, financials and HR functions to Cloud based environments, resulting in efficient and scalable IT operating and maintenance costs.
 Our trademarks
 All of the intellectual property used for La Quinta hotels is owned by La Quinta Worldwide, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Registrant. “La Quinta,” “LQ,” “Returns,” “LQ Hotel” and the sunburst Q symbol are our primary trademarks. Our primary trademarks and many secondary marks are registered in various combinations of word and logo marks with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (“USPTO”) and the trademark offices of various other countries for hotel and motel services and other trademark classes. In the United States, certain of our marks are subject to an agreement with the owner of a resort known as “La Quinta Resort & Club,” located in La Quinta, California. The agreement, among other things, geographically divides use of the trademark “La Quinta,” granting the resort owner the exclusive right to use the mark “La Quinta” in connection with facilities located within a 37 mile radius of the La Quinta Resort & Club, subject to certain exceptions, and the right to open three more facilities using certain of our marks, subject to certain exceptions, conditions and restrictions. As between the resort owner and us and our affiliates, we and our affiliates have the right to use the trademark in all other areas. The agreement is perpetual in duration.
 
Certain pending applications by us for registrations of variations of our primary marks, including certain logo forms, were suspended by the USPTO pending resolution of litigation and related USPTO proceedings brought by us against the owners of a chain of hotels in Mexico called “Quinta Real.” After a trial on the merits in a federal court in Tucson in 2012, Quinta Real was generally prohibited from using the Quinta name to expand into the United States. The decision was appealed to the 9th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals. In August 2014, the 9th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals affirmed the finding of trademark infringement; however, the Court concluded that the district court did not provide a sufficient analysis balancing the equities in its decision to grant a permanent injunction and, therefore, remanded the case to district court for further analysis on that issue. The district court accepted additional evidence and legal arguments from the parties and in 2015 once again entered a permanent injunction in favor of La Quinta. Quinta Real appealed that decision. All briefs in the second appeal were filed and the 9th Circuit scheduled oral arguments in the case.  Rather than proceed to oral argument, Quinta Real dismissed its appeal and we have mutually dismissed the USPTO proceedings.   The injunction has become permanent, three of the suspended applications have proceeded to registration, three more have been published without opposition, and we expect these and the remaining pending applications will ultimately proceed to registration. 
 
We consider all of our trademarks and the associated name recognition to be important to our business.
 
Our employees
 
As a service-oriented business, our employees are important to our success. Recruiting for general managers and corporate office employees is coordinated through our corporate human resources department. All owned hotel employees, including hourly employees, receive training through LQUniversity when hired as well as ongoing training to improve their skills. Our online training system provides consistent and effective orientation, training and testing across our brand. Prior to assuming responsibility for a hotel, our general managers participate in a comprehensive training program that emphasizes operations, hospitality, rate management, legal and risk management issues, interviewing, employee relations, training and budgeting. Within 120 days of hire, new managers also 
 13

attend a one-week training program which is conducted at the Company’s headquarters which is focused on reinforcing the core competencies of the position as well as delivering excellence in product and service quality.
 We provide all of our full-time employees and their families, including hourly hotel employees, the opportunity to participate in a benefits package, which includes health, dental and vision coverage. We believe these benefits provide a competitive advantage in recruiting hourly hotel employees, as compared to competing select-service hotels. Our full-time employees are also able to earn financial incentives based on achieving targeted goals, such as RevPAR Index, profitability, Net Promoter scores and personal and departmental development goals. In addition, recognition programs have been established to acknowledge our employees’ outstanding service and achievement. We believe our scale and size also provide career opportunities for our employees to advance within the organization.
 As of December 31, 2017, we employed 7,486 employees. Of these employees, 6,944 were full-time and 542 were part-time. Four hundred forty-six were employed as corporate associates and 7,040 were employed at our hotels. Our employees are not currently represented by labor unions, and we have never experienced an organized work stoppage. We believe that ongoing labor relations with our employees are good.
 Competition
 As of December 31, 2017 the U.S. hotel sector comprised approximately 55,255 hotels with approximately 5.2 million rooms. Of these rooms, approximately 70% were affiliated with a brand. The hotel industry is highly fragmented, with no one entity controlling a majority of hotel rooms in the U.S.
 La Quinta is a select-service hotel brand that competes primarily against other select-service hotels in both the upper-midscale and the midscale segments, and we consider our main STR competitive set to be Comfort, Holiday Inn Express and Hampton. However, our owned and franchised hotels generally operate in markets that contain numerous competitors, including a wide range of lodging facilities offering full-service, select-service and all-suite lodging options. Hotels in other market segments, such as full-service hotels, may lower their rates to a level comparable to those of select-service hotels such as ours that, in turn, may further increase competitive pressure in our markets. Our owned and franchised hotels generally compete for guests on the basis of room rates, quality of accommodations, name recognition, service levels, convenience of locations and reward program offerings.  We have also seen the emergence of a sharing economy with the increasing availability of online short term rentals.  Additionally, an increasing supply of hotel rooms in La Quinta’s market segment, and consolidations in the lodging industry generally, have resulted in the creation of several large, multi-branded hotel chains with diversified operations and greater marketing and financial resources than we have, which has increased competition for guests in the markets in which our owned and franchised hotels operate.
 
We compete for franchise agreements based primarily on brand name recognition and reputation, the room rate that can be realized, royalty fees charged and other contract terms. Some of our competitors may have substantially greater marketing and financial resources, greater brand distribution and awareness and/or greater financial incentives than we do. Other competitive factors for franchise agreements include relationships with hotel owners and investors, including institutional owners of multiple hotels, availability and affordability of financing, marketing support, reservation and e-commerce system capacity and efficiency and the ability to make investments that may be necessary to obtain franchise agreements. The terms of our franchise agreements for each of our franchised hotels are also influenced by contract terms offered by our competitors, among other things. As a result, the terms of new franchise agreements in the future may not be as favorable as our existing franchise agreements. For example, competition may require us to reduce or change fee structures, make greater use of key money or provide other financial incentives such as loans and guarantees to franchisees and/or reduce the level of hotel improvements required to conform to brand standards. In addition, if the availability of suitable locations for new hotels decreases, planning or other local regulations change or the availability or affordability of financing is limited, the supply of suitable hotels for franchising could be diminished. Additionally, an excess supply of hotel rooms or unfavorable borrowing conditions may discourage potential franchisees from expanding or constructing new hotels, thereby limiting a source of growth of the franchise fees received by us. Our franchise agreements generally restrict our ability to open a new owned or franchised hotel in a limited area near the franchised hotel, which can range from several city blocks in an urban area to several square miles in less populated areas. If the hotels that we franchise perform less successfully than those of our competitors, if we are unable to offer terms as favorable as those offered by our competitors, or if the availability of suitable hotels is limited, our ability to compete effectively for new franchise agreements could be reduced.
 
We believe we compete effectively, and our competitive position is protected due to our strong brand, owner, operator and franchisor business model and experienced management team.
 
Seasonality and cyclicality
 
The hotel industry is seasonal in nature. Generally, our revenues are greater in the second and third quarters than in the first and fourth quarters. The timing of holidays can also impact our quarterly results. The periods during which our properties experience 
 14

higher revenues vary from property to property and depend principally upon location. This seasonality can be expected to cause quarterly fluctuations in revenue, profit margins and net earnings. Additionally, our quarterly results may be further adversely affected by the timing of certain of our marketing production expenditures. Further, the timing of opening of newly constructed or franchised hotels and the timing of any hotel acquisitions or dispositions may cause a variation of revenue and earnings from quarter to quarter.
 
Environmental matters
 
We are subject to certain requirements and potential liabilities under various foreign, federal, state and local environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, and incur costs in complying with such requirements. These laws and regulations govern actions including air emissions, the use, storage and disposal of hazardous and toxic substances, and wastewater disposal. In addition to investigation and remediation liabilities that could arise under such laws, we may also face personal injury, property damage or other claims by third parties concerning environmental compliance or contamination. We use and store hazardous and toxic substances, such as cleaning materials, pool chemicals, heating oil and fuel for back-up generators at some of our facilities, and we generate certain wastes in connection with our operations. Some of our hotels include older buildings, and some may have, or may historically have had, dry-cleaning facilities and underground storage tanks for heating oil and back-up generators. We have from time to time been responsible for investigating and remediating contamination at some of our facilities, such as contamination that has been discovered when we have removed underground storage tanks, and we could be held responsible for any contamination resulting from the disposal of wastes that we generate, including at locations where such wastes have been sent for disposal. Some laws may regard us as having liability as an operator by virtue of how we may implement our franchise agreements, rendering us potentially responsible for addressing environmental or other conditions existing at our franchised hotels. In some cases, we may be entitled to indemnification from the party that caused the contamination, or pursuant to our franchise agreements, but there can be no assurance that we would be able to recover all or any costs we incur in addressing such problems. From time to time, we may be required to manage, abate, remove or contain mold, lead, asbestos-containing materials, radon gas or other hazardous conditions found in or on our hotels. We are required to have operations and maintenance plans that seek to identify and remediate these conditions as appropriate. Although we have incurred, and expect that we will continue to incur, costs relating to the investigation, identification and remediation of hazardous materials known or discovered to exist at our hotels, those costs have not had, and are not expected to have, a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flow.
 
Regulation
 
The hotel industry is subject to extensive federal, state and local governmental regulations in the United States and the other countries in which our owned and franchised hotels operate, including those relating to building and zoning requirements and those relating to the preparation and sale of food. Hotels and their owners and operators are also subject to licensing and regulation by state and local departments relating to health, sanitation, fire and safety standards, and to laws governing their relationships with employees, including minimum wage requirements, overtime, working conditions and citizenship requirements. In connection with the continued operation or remodeling of certain of our hotels, we or our franchisees may be required to expend funds to meet federal, state and local regulations. Any failure to obtain or maintain any such licenses or any publicity resulting from actual or alleged violations of any such laws and regulations could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. Our franchisees are responsible for compliance with all laws and government regulations applicable to the hotels they own and operate. We believe that our businesses are conducted in substantial compliance with applicable laws and regulations.
 
The Federal Trade Commission (the “FTC”), various states and certain foreign jurisdictions (including Canada and Mexico) regulate the sale of franchises. The FTC and the foreign jurisdictions require franchisors to make extensive disclosure to prospective franchisees but do not require registration of the franchise offer. A number of U.S. states in which we offer franchises require both registration and disclosure in connection with franchise offers and sales. In addition, several states have “franchise relationship laws” that limit the ability of the franchisor to terminate franchise agreements or to withhold consent to the renewal or transfer of these agreements. While our franchising operations have not been materially adversely affected by such regulations, we cannot predict the effect of future regulation or legislation.
 
Insurance
 
We maintain insurance coverage for general liability, property, including business interruption, terrorism, workers’ compensation and other risks with respect to our business for all of our owned hotels. Our insurance provides coverage related to claims arising out of the operations of our hotels. Most of our insurance policies are written with self-insured retentions or deductibles that are common in the insurance market for similar risks. These policies provide coverage for claim amounts that exceed our self-insured retentions or deductibles, subject to the terms and limits of the policies.
 
For our franchised locations, our franchise agreements require the properties to be insured at coverage levels generally consistent with the coverage levels under our insurance programs, including liability, property coverage, business interruption 
 15

coverage and workers’ compensation insurance. In addition, our franchise agreements typically include provisions requiring the owner of the property to indemnify us against losses arising from the design, development and operation of their hotels.
