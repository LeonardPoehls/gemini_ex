ITEM 1.    BUSINESS
Overview 
Aerohive Networks, Inc. (together with its subsidiaries, “Aerohive Networks,” “Aerohive,” “Company,” “we,” “us,” and “our”), has designed and developed a leading cloud-networking platform and portfolio that enables our customers to use the power of the cloud to simply and easily deploy and operate an enterprise-class access network made up of Wi-Fi access points, access switches and Software-Defined WAN ("SD-WAN") capable routers. Our platform and portfolio are centrally managed and instrumented to provide all manner of network intelligence and augmented analytics that enable customers to solve for domain-specific use cases as well as benchmark themselves against customers of similar size and domain. 
Technologies and Solutions
We have built our portfolio of products and solutions around three primary sets of technologies and capabilities:

• | Enterprise Cloud Networking. Using cloud-based technologies, whether as a public or private cloud, to reduce the complexity of deploying and managing Wi-Fi access points, access switches and SD-WAN-capable routers; 


• | Wi-Fi as the Primary Connectivity. Putting more Wi-Fi intelligence and power closer to the user using a unique distributed-control architecture that greatly simplifies network topologies and IT operations; and


• | Augmented Analytics and Insights. Accessing collected data sets and analytics for our customers through widgets in Aerohive's HiveManager or through application programming interfaces ("APIs"), to enable customers to solve for domain-specific use cases as well as benchmark themselves against customers of a similar size and domain. 

We believe that each of these areas adds valuable customer capabilities, differentiates our offering, and showcases our continuing innovation.
Enterprise Cloud Networking. Our customers today are increasingly demanding ease and simplicity in how they deploy, manage and operate their access networks with a particular emphasis on the Wi-Fi element of the access network. Cloud networking enables us to deliver this. Our cloud networking capabilities, including our HiveManager network management applications, combine the benefits of the cloud with the feature depth required for managing enterprise-class networks. We believe we are the only major vendor who can provide these enterprise-class capabilities in public cloud, private cloud and on on-premise deployments.
We have chosen to focus on enterprise cloud networking based on the compelling benefits we believe we can offer our customers. Legacy approaches to network management have relied on complex enterprise applications that customers must install, integrate, maintain, and administer themselves. New releases were infrequent and updates installed by customers even less frequent. In contrast, our cloud-based network management provides a single, integrated management view across the entire network that a user can access from virtually anywhere. We maintain and administer the network management application in the cloud, which users then access as a subscription service that can be regularly updated in response to new features or urgent changes. 
With our cloud networking and our HiveManager application, we deliver a number of important capabilities to our customers. While enterprise customers want simplified network management they still need a full set of features and capabilities. Our “progressive disclosure” user interface means that advanced features are available but are hidden from view when not being used. Similarly, organizations that need to deploy the network often do not have technical staff at every location. Our cloud networking supports automated provisioning, where a device that is connected to the network for the first time can automatically find and download its proper configuration. Our cloud network solution also includes troubleshooting capabilities, such as dashboards, to quickly identify potential issues and monitoring to easily research and resolve them. Finally, cloud networking makes it possible for a customer to very quickly evaluate the capabilities of our solution. A single wireless access point with a corresponding license for HiveManager gives customers complete access to our capabilities. In addition, those customers who want the capabilities of cloud networking but also need to manage their network in their own datacenter, behind their own firewall, can install and run HiveManager "on premises" at a customer location with similar functionality and the same software as we offer in the public cloud. Overall, by taking advantage of our cloud-network capabilities, our customers are able to manage even large networks with a small staff and limited resources.
While we were an early leader in cloud networking we continue to innovate and to invest in HiveManager as our strategic cloud networking application. We are focusing our current efforts on HiveManager NG, an updated version of our legacy HiveManager application, which we now call HiveManager Classic. HiveManager NG features an updated user

interface, improved troubleshooting, expanded access to data and analytics, and an upgraded cloud-deployment platform. While HiveManager NG offers a more compelling customer solution, it also offers a more dynamic platform for innovation. In April 2016, we announced with our partner Dell, Inc. ("Dell"), a Dell-branded version of HiveManager NG capable of managing Dell N-series switches in the same network as Aerohive Wi-Fi access points, delivering multi-vendor integrated wired and wireless network management. Throughout 2016, we delivered new releases of HiveManager NG that continued to expand our enterprise feature set and improve the user experience. In January 2017, we announced HiveManager Connect, a simplified version of HiveManager NG included as a part of our new Aerohive Connect product line designed for customers with less complex, connectivity-oriented requirements. Aerohive's Connect customers can purchase a subscription to upgrade to our current full-featured Aerohive Select offering to access additional capabilities, such as advanced security and troubleshooting tools, support for Bring-Your-Own-Device programs, increased network visibility, enterprise support options, and the ability to deploy HiveManager on-premises or in a private cloud environment. The capabilities of our scalable cloud platform enabled all of these innovations.
Our transition to HiveManager NG took longer to effect than we initially expected. Nonetheless throughout 2017, we began to see a significant increase in the rate of adoption of HiveManager NG by new customers. We expect in the future that HiveManager NG will be the primary choice for the majority of new customers. However, we will continue to offer and support both versions of the application, while working with current HiveManager Classic customers as appropriate to migrate to HiveManager NG. 
Wi-Fi as the Primary Connectivity for the Enterprise. We have built our Wi-Fi around a unique distributed control and data-plane architecture that simplifies deployment, management, and operation while providing resiliency. We believe our distributed-control and data-plane technology remains one of our key innovations and differentiators. Over the last decade, Wi-Fi architectures have gone through a series of evolutions in response to changing technologies and user requirements. When the original autonomous Wi-Fi access points proved difficult to manage vendors introduced wireless LAN controllers to the network. Wireless LAN controllers brought management and control, but they also brought the cost and complexity of dedicated hardware, a new single point of failure, and rigid deployments too inflexible to meet dynamic requirements of wireless networks. To overcome these limitations other vendors have integrated their controller with switches or Wi-Fi access points, or moved their controllers into the cloud, with greater cost and limited capabilities. In contrast, our architecture fully distributes the control plane across the Wi-Fi access points, eliminating the need for any wireless LAN controller and reducing cost of operations. We deliver the algorithms for distributed control through HiveOS, our device operating system that runs on every Aerohive Wi-Fi access point. HiveOS delivers radio management, client roaming, load balancing, policy enforcement, packet inspection and other functions locally on the Wi-Fi access point. 
Our distributed-control and data-plane architecture provides key benefits to our customers. Most important is the scalability of a single architecture effective for deployments from one to many thousands of Wi-Fi access points. Most of our competitors have different technologies and products for different sizes of deployments. Instead, our customers can start small and grow as they need to without any change in architecture or Wi-Fi technology. Our customers can also mix different generations of Wi-Fi access points in the same network, thus preserving existing infrastructure investments. Overall, by intelligently distributing control over the Wi-Fi access points our architecture can support faster deployments and greater resiliency.
Integral to our scalable Wi-Fi is the ability to enforce security at the Wi-Fi access point based on the end-user customer’s access policies, which can be based on the application being used, user identity and role, device type and ownership, location and time of day. Our Private Pre-Shared Key ("PPSK") technology extends these capabilities to assign each device a unique key for accessing the network that can be authorized or revoked without impacting any other network device. PPSK can also be used in Internet-of-Things deployments to authorize devices that do not have a keyboard or some other mechanism for providing credentials.
While we emphasize our Wi-Fi capabilities our portfolio also includes cloud-managed access switches and SD-WAN-capable routers. Our Wi-Fi access points do not require either our access switches or SD-WAN-capable routers; they can be used with products from other major network hardware manufacturers. However, customers who purchase our access switches or SD-WAN-capable routers gain the ability to manage them with their wireless access points through a single HiveManager interface. 
Augmented Analytics and Insights. Increasingly, our customers are looking for value from their networks beyond just connectivity. Aerohive's access networks can collect for our customers enormous amounts of data about end-user devices; where they are, how they are being used, how often the devices are on the network, etc. Our Augmented Analytics and Insights, which we expect to begin to be deliver later in 2018, will provide our customers access to this data from within HiveManager NG or via APIs. We believe such augmented analytics or APIs will be able to deliver data sets to our customers to address a variety of use cases including:    
2


• | Component Benchmarking. Tracking and comparing utilization of a customer's network components to other access networks of a similar size and domain; 


• | Client Benchmarking. Tracking and comparing client experience in a customer's access network to other access networks of a similar size and domain; and 


• | Presence and Location. Tracking and reporting the presence and/or location of user and devices in near real-time or over time. 

Application developers will also be able to take advantage of the Aerohive Cloud Services ("ACS") platform. The ACS platform collects data for our customers from Aerohive network devices and, we expect in the future, from other vendor devices or other third-party sources. Collected data can then be aggregated for our customers into a secure and scalable cloud-based store of big data, which then can be processed and made available to our customers externally via APIs that we provide. Application developers can incorporate these APIs into their applications in order to receive data and analytics from us without needing to collect and process this data themselves. This approach means that the ACS platform has the extensibility to support additional use cases in the future. We expect to continue to expand the APIs and analytics that we make available from the ACS platform in order to encourage and enable an open application-development environment to make possible compelling applications for our partners and customers. 
Products
We offer our solution to end customers as a portfolio of products that includes our hardware products, cloud-based network management and applications, and support services.
Our hardware products include Wi-Fi access points, access switches and SD-WAN-capable routers. Our hardware design team develops our hardware products by working in conjunction with original design manufacturers ("ODMs"). Our Wi-Fi access points run our proprietary HiveOS operating system. We generally sell our access switches and SD-WAN-capable routers in conjunction with a sale of Wi-Fi access points. We also sell our Wi-Fi access points for use with other manufactures' access switches and routers.
Our cloud-based product offering includes our next-generation network management application HiveManager NG and features an updated user interface, improved troubleshooting, expanded access to data and analytics and upgraded cloud-deployment platform. 
We offer tiered maintenance and support services under renewable, fee-based maintenance and support contracts, which include technical support, bug fixes, access to priority hardware replacement service and unspecified upgrades on a when-and-if-available basis. Our Software as a Service ("SaaS") subscriptions include comparable maintenance and support services.
We continue to look for new ways to package and deliver our product to best address customer demand and market opportunity. In January 2017, we introduced our Aerohive Connect product line targeting customers with simpler connectivity-oriented use cases. All Aerohive access points and switches now can be purchased and deployed with Aerohive's subscription-free Connect offering which is a simplified version of HiveManager NG, and community/email-based customer support. We offer Aerohive Connect as a complement to, not a replacement for, our full offering which we refer to as Aerohive Select. Aerohive Select remains our flagship solution capable of addressing the most demanding enterprise network, deployment, and security requirements. Aerohive Connect customers can easily upgrade from Connect to Select at any time with the purchase of an entitlement key that provides access to additional feature sets and support. We expect many customers who might otherwise not initially consider Aerohive to be nonetheless attracted to the simplicity and low cost of Aerohive Connect and the ability to transition later to Aerohive Select as their network requirements evolve. 
Segment and Geographic Information
We operate one reporting segment and operating segment structure. We present financial information about our operating segment and geographic areas in Note 10 to our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
Customers
We sell our products through a network of authorized value-added resellers ("VARs"), value-added distributors ("VADs") and managed service providers ("MSPs"). We have sold our products to tens of thousands of end customers worldwide. We define end customers as organizations holding or having held licenses to our products and software subscription and services. Our end customers represent a broad range of industry verticals, including education, distributed enterprises, retail, hospitality and healthcare. In many cases, our target customers are installing a Wi-Fi network for the first time, or in parts of their organization that do not currently have Wi-Fi installed. In other cases, our customers already have a Wi-Fi network installed and our opportunity is to engage them in an expansion or replacement of their current solution.

Sales
We use channel partners to sell and deliver our solutions to our end customers, which we support through our sales organization. Our field-based regional sales organization supports large-account acquisition and overall market development. Our centrally based inside sales US and EMEA teams focus on the acquisition of mid-market accounts in both the Enterprise and State & Local Government/Education segments. Our field-based and inside sales teams recruit and manage channel partners, in conjunction with our channel sales team. Our sales engineers have responsibility for pre-sales technical support, solutions engineering for our end customers, and technical training for our channel partners. We continue to evaluate and adjust our sales headcount in our principal and emerging markets based on a combination of our current sales results and future sales potential. 
Our sales team works with our channel partners who have networking, Wi-Fi and/or vertical market expertise to win and support end customers through a direct-touch approach. Our VADs sell our products to and support our VARs, who then sell our products directly to end customers, often with the addition of their own installation or professional services. We are increasingly working with MSPs, who bundle our product and service offerings with their own infrastructure and services to provide ongoing network operations and management to end customers. This includes traditional VARs who are now expanding their services offering to include ongoing network management services. 
We extend our sales capabilities through strategic alliances with companies such as Dell. We expect our alliance with Dell, as well as with other strategic alliances that we hope to develop, will over time be meaningful contributions to our business going forward. 
Backlog 
We typically accept and ship orders for product and related services within a short time-frame. However, our partners may reschedule orders without penalty or we may delay shipment due to inventory constraints. As such, we do not believe that our backlog at any particular time is a reliable indicator of future revenue.
Research and Development
Continued investment in research and development is critical to our business. To this end, we have assembled a team of engineers with expertise in various fields, including networking platforms, cloud operations and applications, security systems, RF functions, user-interface design and open-source programming. We currently conduct our research and development efforts in California and China. 
We have invested significant time and financial resources in the development of our products, including our ACS, HiveManager and our HiveOS platforms. We view continued investment in these capabilities as essential to our ability to differentiate ourselves in a competitive industry and to continue to be able to grow our business. For example, in 2015 we released HiveManager NG, our next-generation cloud services platform which provides a basis for data services and data analytic applications, and we released additional software modules to enhance the functionality and performance of our HiveOS operating system. In 2015, we announced our ACS platform, which provides a secure and scalable cloud-based big data store for data collected from Aerohive network devices, other vendor devices, or other third-party sources, which can then be available to application developers to incorporate their API applications without needing to collect and process this data themselves. In April 2016, we announced with our partner Dell, a Dell-branded version of HiveManager NG capable of managing Dell N-series switches in the same network as Aerohive Wi-Fi access points, delivering multi-vendor integrated wired and wireless network management. Throughout 2016, we delivered new releases of HiveManager NG that continued to expand our enterprise feature set and improve the user experience. In January 2017, we announced HiveManager Connect, a simplified version of HiveManager NG included as a part of our new Aerohive Connect product line designed for customers with less complex, connectivity-oriented requirements. Aerohive's Connect customers can purchase a perpetual license or subscription to upgrade to our current full-featured Aerohive Select offering to access additional capabilities, such as advanced security and troubleshooting tools, support for Bring-Your-Own-Device programs, increased network visibility, enterprise support options, and the ability to deploy HiveManager on-premises or in a private cloud environment. The capabilities of our scalable cloud platform enabled all of these innovations.
Later in 2017 we also announced our SD-WAN solution for highly distributed commercial enterprises, retail chains, and long-term healthcare providers which, we combined with our existing SD-LAN offering, enables organizations to simplify branch deployments with a unified cloud-management Wi-Fi, switching, and SD-WAN VPN routing solution. In addition, in early 2018, we announced our A3 secure access management and authentication product and Aerohive Atom AP30 pluggable access point.
We plan to continue to expand our product offerings and solutions capabilities in the future to dedicate significant resources to these research and development efforts.

Manufacturing 
We outsource the manufacturing of our hardware products to ODMs located in China and Taiwan. We believe that using original design manufacturers helps to optimize our operations by lowering costs, reducing time-to-market and enabling us to adjust to changing end customer demand.
Our ODM partners ship finished products to our warehousing and delivery logistics centers in the U.S., the Netherlands, Malaysia and China. We operate these logistic centers for all end customer shipments, whether destined to locations in the Americas, Europe, the Middle East and Africa ("EMEA"), or Asia Pacific and Japan ("APAC"). 
Our manufacturing partners procure components and assemble our products based on our demand forecasts. These forecasts represent our estimates at the time of future demand for our products, based upon historical trends and the assessment of our sales and product management functions of end customer demand and overall market conditions. 
Our ODMs source the component parts within our products. We do not contract directly and do not have any long-term manufacturing contracts that guarantee us any fixed access to such component parts or specific pricing. This absence of direct and long-term component supply contracts may increase our exposure to shortages of component availability and to price increases which the ODM or supplier may charge in response to increased product demand or fluctuations related to the raw material inputs for such components. In addition, during periods of continued fluctuating or flat customer demand for our products our ODMs may be required to slow the production rate for those products, thus increasing costs, extending time-to-market and otherwise creating uncertainty for our ODM relationships. 
Competition 
We operate in a competitive market for enterprise mobility and network-edge infrastructure, which continues to experience constant change and consolidation. Our competitors include general networking and independent Wi-Fi vendors, such as Cisco/Meraki, Hewlett-Packard/Aruba, Arris/Ruckus, Ubiquiti, Extreme Networks, Huawei and Riverbed/Xirrus whose portfolios include enterprise mobility solutions and wireless access products.
Trends in enterprise network infrastructures and mobility are all significantly increasing the importance of Wi-Fi to our target customers. As organizations address the proliferation of mobile devices, increased BYOD utilization, enterprise adoption of cloud and the adoption of mobile-first applications they compare competing wireless infrastructure produces, including:

• | ability to address specific customer use cases;


• | ease-of-use and simplicity of solutions;


• | price and total cost of ownership;


• | flexibility and feature-depth of solutions;


• | ability to meet deployment requirements;


• | ability to support business or customer-facing applications;


• | performance and scalability of products;


• | network survivability and reliability of solutions;


• | security of the network; and


• | for service providers, the ability to support business/operating models.

We believe that we generally compete favorably on the combined basis of all of these factors. However, some of our competitors have better solutions for one or several of these factors. Many of our competitors have substantially greater financial, technical and other resources, greater name recognition, longer operating histories, larger sales and marketing budgets, broader distribution and established relationships with distribution partners and end customers and larger and more mature intellectual property portfolios which provide a greater ability to assemble, market, aggressively price and more quickly bring to market different capabilities across integrated product platforms. Other competitors are also working to grow their cloud-networking capabilities, an area that has been one of our key differentiators. 
Seasonality 
See Item 7, "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for information regarding seasonality of our business.

Intellectual Property
Our success depends in part upon our ability to protect our core technology and intellectual property. We rely on patents, trademarks, copyrights and trade secret laws, confidentiality procedures, and employee disclosure and invention assignment agreements to protect our intellectual property rights. As of December 31, 2017, we had 54 issued patents and 45 patent applications pending in the United States relating to our current and next-generation networking products, operating platform and cloud-based applications, and the ability to claim priority to most of the patent applications worldwide. Our patents issued in the U.S. will expire between 2028 and 2036. However, these patents or any patents that may issue to us in the future may be subject to re-examination, contested, circumvented, found unenforceable or invalidated, and we may or may not be able to prevent third parties from infringing them. We also license software from third parties for integration into our products, including open-source software. We believe our licenses are on commercially reasonable terms.
We utilize internal and external controls to restrict access to and use of our proprietary software and other confidential information, including contractual protections with employees, contractors, end customers and channel partners. Our software is also protected by U.S. and international copyright laws. However, despite our efforts to protect our trade secrets and proprietary rights through intellectual property rights, licenses and confidentiality agreements, third parties may still copy our products or otherwise gain access to or obtain and use our proprietary software and technology without our knowledge or authority or in ways we do not intend. 
Our industry is characterized by the existence of a large number of patents, and competitors increasingly may utilize litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights to protect or expand their market position. In particular, leading and more mature companies in the wireless networking industry have extensive patent portfolios and are regularly involved in both offensive and defensive litigation. As end customers increasingly use our products and services, and to the extent that we gain greater visibility and market exposure as a public company, we face a higher risk of being the subject of intellectual property infringement claims from third parties, not only from our competitors but also increasingly from non-operating entities, who will be more likely to claim that our platform infringes their proprietary rights. From time-to-time, such third parties, including certain of these leading companies and, increasingly, non-operating entities, may assert patent, copyright, trademark, and other intellectual property rights against us, our channel partners or our end customers. In these instances, our standard license and other agreements may obligate us to indemnify our channel partners and end customers against such claims. Successful claims of infringement by a third party could prevent us from distributing certain products or performing certain services, require us to expend significant management attention and money to develop non-infringing solutions or force us to pay substantial damages, royalties or other fees. This could include treble damages, if we are found to have willfully infringed patents or copyrights. We currently do not maintain insurance coverage against any such claims. 
In addition, our products utilize software modules under third-party open-source licenses, including as incorporated into software we receive from third-party commercial software vendors. Some open-source licenses contain requirements that we make available source code for modifications or derivative works we create based upon the type of open-source software that we use. If we combine our proprietary software with open-source software in a certain manner, we could, under certain open-source licenses, be required to release portions of the source code of our proprietary software to the public. This could allow our competitors to create similar products with lower development effort and time, and ultimately could result in a loss of product sales for us.
We cannot assure that we do not currently infringe, or that we will not in the future infringe, or that we can resolve through litigation or on reasonable settlement terms, any such claims against us relating to, any third-party patents or other proprietary rights, including relating to use of third-party open source software. See “Part I, Item 3 - Legal Proceedings” and “Part I, Item 1A - Risk Factors Claims by others that we infringe their proprietary technology or other rights could harm our business” for additional information.
Employees
As of December 31, 2017, we had approximately 490 employees in offices in the Americas, EMEA and APAC. None of our employees is represented by labor unions, whether in the United States or abroad. We consider all current employee relations to be good. However, we continue to see employee turn-over, particularly amongst our employees in Silicon Valley where competition is typically high for sales and engineering personnel, and in Hangzhou China, where we currently maintain a research presence, where competition is high for highly skilled product development and engineering personnel.
