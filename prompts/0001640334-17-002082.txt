Business
 
We have been a Franchise Development Company and operator of Company-owned vending machines and micro markets that makes healthy eating more convenient through access to high quality healthy foods at high foot traffic vending destinations. We and our franchisees have operated over 3,000 vending machines and micro markets primarily offering natural, organic and healthy food and beverage products throughout North America, the Bahamas and Puerto Rico. Our obligations to each franchisee include securing locations for the healthy vending machines and micro markets they purchase. We offer thousands of healthy food and beverage products via an agreement with a national food distributor and we train each franchisee at our San Diego headquarters. We provide dedicated account management and ongoing customer service to our franchisees. As of March 2016, we have discontinued marketing our healthy vending franchises, although we continue to support our ongoing franchisees. Furthermore, we have sold our corporate route and no longer operate our own healthy vending machines. 
 
During fiscal 2017, we obtained the exclusive rights in the USA (excluding Puerto Rico) and Canada for a new frozen yogurt vending machine robot, branded Reis & Irvy’s. As of June 30, 2017, we have received approval to sell franchises in a number of U.S. states and Canada and have booked a net 731 units aggregating $27.1 million, prior to certain offset adjustments, which is included in deferred revenues. As of June 30, 2017, and through the date of this report, the Company has not yet delivered any frozen yogurt vending machines. The Company is in the process of redeveloping the next generation frozen yogurt robot and has spent $2.1 million in research and development expenses through June 30, 2017. The Company will continue to incur additional research and development expenses until at least December 2017.
 
On December 29, 2016, the Company entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement (the “Agreement”) with Robofusion, Inc. (“RFI”), whereby the Company acquired the intellectual property assets of RFI, a developer of robotic-kiosk vending technology, primarily frozen yogurt vending kiosks/cubes, using RFI's trademarked name of Reis & Irvy's (the “Acquisition”). Pursuant to the Agreement, the Company provided RFI, and its designees, a cash payment of $440,000, The Company also issued to RFI a three-year, $2 million note and a five-year common stock purchase warrant for 1,520,000 shares with a strike price of $0.50 per share. Furthermore, certain RFI Officers, Directors and Shareholders will be subject to a five-year, non-compete agreement. Also, the Agreement provides for indemnification and set off of up to $1 million, under certain circumstances.
 
As mentioned above, we will no longer market our vending machines and micro markets to new franchisees. We will however, continue to service and support our current FHV LLC franchisees.

History
 
On July 19, 2013 (the “Closing Date”) our wholly-owned subsidiary, FHV Acquisition Corp., completed a Reorganization and Asset Acquisition Agreement (the “Acquisition Agreement”) with FHV Holdings Corp, a California corporation (“FHV Cal”) (the “FHV Acquisition”). Pursuant to the terms of the Acquisition Agreement, we issued (i) 15,648,298 shares of our Company’s common stock (as adjusted for the Stock Split) to FHV Cal, in exchange for all FHV Cal’s assets as of the Closing Date. FHV Cal’s principal asset consisted of the operations and assets of Fresh Healthy Vending LLC, a California limited liability company. At the closing, FHV Cal distributed the Company’s common stock to the sole shareholder of FHV Cal, a trust affiliated with Nicholas Yates, our Chairman.
 
On July 19, 2013, we also completed the sale of 2,235,951 shares of our common stock to 18 investors (“Stock Sale”) in exchange for gross proceeds totaling $1,000,000 (approximately $996,000 net of estimated related costs in connection with the transaction). In addition, on July 19, 2013, we converted $210,000 of convertible notes payable into 552,418 shares of common stock.
 
In connection with the Acquisition Agreement, we entered into a Business Transfer and Indemnity Agreement dated July 22, 2013 (the “Indemnity Agreement”) with our former Chief Executive Officer Daniel Duval providing for:
 

1. | The sale to Mr. Duval of our business existing on the date of the Indemnity Agreement (the “GEEM Business”); 
---+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. | The assumption by Mr. Duval of all liabilities of our Company and the indemnification by Mr. Duval holding our Company harmless for any and all liabilities arising at or before the date of the Indemnity Agreement;
3. | The payment to Mr. Duval of $191,000 in cash; and 
4. | The surrender by Mr. Duval of 11,671,713 shares of our Company’s common stock (all of which shares were cancelled by our Company). 

 
We are a public company listed under the symbol “VEND.” We were incorporated in the State of Nevada on June 8, 2011 as Green 4 Media, Inc. Prior to July 19, 2013, we were an eco-marketing and advertising company (“GEEM Business”). On July 22, 2013, we entered into the Indemnity Agreement and in connection with that agreement we transferred the GEEM Business to our former Chief Executive Officer. Effective August 8, 2013, we changed the name of our Company from Green 4 Media, Inc. to Fresh Healthy Vending International, Inc., and in March 2016, we changed the name of our Company to Generation NEXT Franchise Brands, Inc. 
 
FHV LLC was formed as a limited liability company in California in 2010, as a franchisor of healthy drinks and snack vending machines. Including the operating history of YoNaturals, whose assets were contributed to FHV LLC in August 2010, we have a combined nine year operating history in vending machines providing food and beverages.

The Industry and the Overall Market
 
In the franchise market, 2012 saw the first positive growth in the number of franchise establishments since 2008 according to the IFA’s annual Franchise Business Economic Outlook report (compiled by HIS Global Insight). Upscale vending is taking over as consumers’ palates become more refined and they gravitate toward a health-conscious lifestyle, according to Food Business News. Additionally, the vending machine market is expected to expand 1.5 percent by 2015 according to Food Business New. The National Automated Merchandising Association (“NAMA”) estimates the vending market is a $30 billion-a-year industry. NAMA also estimates that 100 million Americans will use one of seven million vending machines each day.
 
Frozen Yogurt Robot
 
We are in the process of manufacturing a state-of-the art frozen yogurt vending machine robot that is a completely unique vending machine and entertainment experience. The robot contains both a cash and cashless vending platform that allows us to readily monitor the sales of our franchisees’ and our corporate-owned machines. Our vending standards are UL (“Underwriters Laboratories”) and NSF (“National Sanitation Foundation”) recognized, which we believe are among the highest standards in the industry. This ensures food temperature compliance, which includes auto-contingency processes should electrical or hardware malfunction; it also ensures that ambient air stays within specified parameters at all times. Our third-party cashless payment technology provides the highest level of data and network security compliance while ensuring complete transparency. As a result, our frozen yogurt vending machine robots will contain minimal amounts of cash. All transactions are managed by third parties to facilitate financial compliance with local and national laws and regulations.
Vending Technology
 
We have developed a cash and cashless vending platform to readily monitor the sales of our franchisees. We help our franchisees to grow their business with onsite and virtual management tools, including as an example, wireless remote monitoring telemetry software. As mentioned above, our vending standards are UL recognized. All transactions are managed by third parties to facilitate financial compliance with local and national laws and regulations.
Micro Market Technology
 
We have developed a high-tech cashless self-checkout kiosk that boasts state-of-the-art point-of-sale technology currently utilizing an iOS operating system and iPad hardware. The system also includes a wireless remote monitoring telemetry software with inventory management. The kiosk is completely cashless and all transactions are managed by third parties to facilitate financial compliance with local and national laws and regulations.
Vending and Micro Market Products
 
We primarily provide a portfolio of fresh, organic and all-natural snacks and drinks. Most products are available via our Company’s agreement with a national distributor. We also create custom menus for each franchisee specific to each location type based on their guidelines, requests and demographics. We have developed customized menus that meet and exceed school and state nutrition guidelines nationwide, facilitating the placement of machines in schools. Our suppliers are available to deliver products to our franchisees on a weekly basis and charge a fee of $35 with a minimum order of $500.
 
The micro market is a self-checkout kiosk that contains a similar portfolio of fresh, organic and all-natural snacks and drinks. The micro market also provides fresh full meal options such as salads, sandwiches, and wraps. The micro market is designed for implementation in corporate environments, hotel lobbies, auto dealerships and other retail environments.

Frozen Yogurt Products
 
The Company intends to set up national distribution partners to carry the consumable products required for the frozen yogurt robots. 
 
Competition
 
The vending industry is large, highly fragmented and consolidating as the market leaders acquire regional vending companies to fulfill their real-estate expansion plans or acquire privately-held service verticals. We believe we have laid the foundation for a national health vending operation with built-in, long-term service agreements and residual product and inventory sales. We believe our business model offers competitive advantages including the following.

· | We focus on healthier food included in school and other health-conscious vending locations, and those locations with high transient foot traffic for our frozen yogurt robots, including hospitals, amusement parks, and other entertainment venues. Federal guidelines have been established that aim to counter youth obesity while improving student nutrition, such rules work to discourage our competitors’ fare to be marketed to schools. According to Ned Monroe, senior vice-president for government affairs for the National Automatic Merchandising Association, “There were fewer and fewer operators handling school accounts because it was a tough process to find products that met the patchwork of school guidelines.” In fact, “the trade group estimates that just 10 percent of its vending operator members sell in schools now, down from about 25 percent a decade ago.”
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | We outsource non-core functions to third-party vendors. Outsourced services include: machine manufacturing, transport, location set-up, maintenance, inventory, food management and ordering, payment processing, and cash management. This has historically allowed us to focus more of our financial resources to investing in new services. 

Our Principal Suppliers
 
The Company currently purchases substantially all of its vending machines, and will purchase it frozen yogurt robots, as needed from a sole supplier, Automated Merchandising Systems Inc. (“AMS”), or its designated distributor. We believe that our relationship with our suppliers is excellent, and likely to continue. In our view, the loss of our relationship with our suppliers, should it occur, may result in short term disruptions not likely to be material. The Company has identified several other suppliers with comparable capabilities. The Company also purchases its micro markets from a single manufacturer and believes the loss of its supplier may result in short term disruptions not likely to be material. 
 
Additionally, primarily on behalf of our healthy vending franchisees, the Company has negotiated discounts with a national product distribution chain, United Natural Foods, Inc. (“UNFI”). We believe that our relationship with UNFI is excellent, and likely to continue. In our view, the loss of our relationship with UNFI, should it occur, may result in short-term disruptions not likely to be material. The Company has identified several other suppliers that stock the same or comparable products. Furthermore, our franchisees are able to purchase directly from UNFI.
 
Furthermore, the Company intends to set up similar arrangements with distributors of the frozen yogurt consumables.
 
Governmental Regulation
 
We are required to comply with regulations governing the sale of franchises – the primary component of our business. Fifteen states directly regulate franchising and fourteen require pre-sale registration of a Franchise Disclosure Document (“FDD”), or offering prospectus, by the franchisor, normally with the state agency that oversees the sale of securities in that state, and pre-sale delivery of an FDD to a franchise candidate by a franchisor before the signing of a binding agreement or the payment of any money to the franchisor. Franchise sales in the remaining 35 states are generally subject to the Franchise Rule promulgated by the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”), which requires the pre-sale delivery of an FDD to a franchise candidate before the signing of a binding agreement or the payment of any money to the franchisor. A franchisor that fails to properly register and maintain the registration of its FDD and disclose its franchisee candidates in the 15 registration states, unless exempt from registration under a few narrowly drawn exceptions to the registration requirements, is subject to legal action by its franchisees for damages and, under certain circumstances, for rescission of the franchise agreements, and to administrative, civil and criminal penalties that may be imposed as well. The FTC’s Franchise Rule does not require registration of an FDD with the FTC.

Our Employees
 
We had approximately 43 full-time employees as of June 30, 2017. None of our employees are subject to collective bargaining agreements.
 
Seasonality
 
We do not expect that our business will experience significant seasonality other than that resulting from vending machine sales within schools and at seasonal frozen yogurt venues.
