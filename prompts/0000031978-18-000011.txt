Palo Verde
The Company owns an interest, along with six other utilities, in the three nuclear generating units and common facilities ("Common Facilities") at Palo Verde. Arizona Public Service Company ("APS") serves as operating agent for Palo Verde, and under the Arizona Nuclear Power Project Participation Agreement ("ANPP Participation Agreement"), the Company has limited ability to influence operations and costs at Palo Verde.

• | Palo Verde Operating Licenses. Operation of each of the three Palo Verde Units requires an operating license from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission ("NRC"). The NRC issued full power operating licenses for Unit 1 in June 1985, Unit 2 in April 1986 and Unit 3 in November 1987 and issued renewed operating licenses for each of the three units in April 2011, which extended the licenses for Units 1, 2 and 3 to June 2045, April 2046 and November 2047, respectively.


• | Decommissioning. Pursuant to the ANPP Participation Agreement and federal law, the Company must fund its share of the estimated costs to decommission Palo Verde Units 1, 2 and 3, including the Common Facilities, through the term of their respective operating licenses. In 2017, the Palo Verde Participants approved the 2016 Palo Verde decommissioning study (the "2016 Study"), which estimated that the Company must fund approximately $432.8 million (stated in 2016 dollars) to cover its share of decommissioning costs. At December 31, 2017, the Company's decommissioning trust fund had a balance of $286.9 million. Although the 2016 Study was based on the latest available information, there can be no assurance that decommissioning cost estimates will not increase in the future or that regulatory requirements will not change.

•Spent Fuel and Waste Disposal. Pursuant to the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982, as amended in 1987 (the "NWPA"), the United States Department of Energy ("DOE")  is legally obligated to accept and dispose of all spent nuclear fuel and other high-level radioactive waste generated by all domestic power reactors by 1998. The DOE's obligations are reflected in a contract for Disposal of Spent Nuclear Fuel and/or High-Level Radioactive Waste (the "Standard Contract") with each nuclear power plant. The DOE failed to begin accepting spent nuclear fuel by 1998. On December 19, 2012, APS, acting on behalf of itself and the Palo Verde Participants, filed a second breach of contract lawsuit against the DOE. This lawsuit sought to recover damages incurred due to the DOE’s failure to accept Palo Verde’s spent nuclear fuel for the period beginning January 1, 2007 through June 30, 2011. On August 18, 2014, APS and the DOE entered into a settlement agreement stipulating to a dismissal of the lawsuit. Pursuant to the terms of the August 18, 2014 settlement agreement, APS files annual claims for the period July 1 of the then-previous year to June 30 of the then-current year. The settlement agreement, as amended, provides APS with a method for submitting claims and receiving recovery for costs incurred through December 31, 2016, which has been extended to December 31, 2019. The Company's share of costs recovered are presented below (in thousands):        
 | | Amount Credited | 
 | | to Customers | 
 | | through Fuel | Period Credited
Costs Recovery Period | Amount Refunded | Adjustment Clauses | to Customers 
January 2007 - June 2011 | $ | 9,076 | | $ | 7,944 | September 2014
July 2011 - June 2014 | 6,643 | | 5,759 | | March 2015
July 2014 - June 2015 | 1,884 | | 1,581 | | March 2016
July 2015 - June 2016 | 1,779 | | 1,432 | | March 2017

On October 31, 2017, APS filed an $8.9 million claim for the period July 1, 2016 through June 30, 2017. The Company's share of this claim is approximately $1.4 million. In February 2018, the DOE approved this claim. Any reimbursement is anticipated to be received in the first half of 2018, and the majority of the reimbursement received by the Company is expected to be credited to customers through the applicable fuel adjustment clauses.

• | DOE’s Construction Authorization Application for Yucca Mountain. The DOE had planned to meet its disposal obligations by designing, licensing, constructing and operating a permanent geologic repository in Yucca Mountain, Nevada. In March 2010, the DOE filed a motion to dismiss with prejudice its Yucca Mountain construction authorization application that was pending before the NRC. Several interested parties have intervened in the NRC proceeding. Additionally, a number of interested parties have filed a variety of lawsuits in different jurisdictions around the country challenging the DOE's authority to withdraw the Yucca Mountain

 2

construction authorization application and NRC’s cessation of its review of the Yucca Mountain construction authorization application. The cases have been consolidated into one matter at the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit (the "D.C. Circuit"). In August 2013, the D.C. Circuit ordered the NRC to resume its review of the application with available appropriated funds.
On October 16, 2014, the NRC issued Volume 3 of the safety evaluation report developed as part of the Yucca Mountain construction authorization application. This volume addresses repository safety after permanent closure, and the issuance of Volume 3 is a key milestone in the Yucca Mountain licensing process. Volume 3 contains the NRC staff’s finding that the DOE’s repository design meets the requirements that apply after the repository is permanently closed, including but not limited to the post-closure performance objectives in the NRC’s regulations. 
On December 18, 2014, the NRC issued Volume 4 of the safety evaluation report developed as part of the Yucca Mountain construction authorization application. This volume covers administrative and programmatic requirements for the repository. It documents the NRC staff’s evaluation of whether the DOE’s research and development and performance confirmation programs, as well as other administrative controls and systems, meet applicable NRC requirements. Volume 4 contains the NRC staff’s finding that most administrative and programmatic requirements in NRC regulations are met, except for certain requirements relating to ownership of land and water rights.
Publication of Volumes 3 and 4 does not signal whether or when the NRC might authorize construction of the repository. The Company cannot predict when spent fuel shipments to the DOE will commence. 

• | Waste Confidence and Continued Storage. On June 8, 2012, the D.C. Circuit issued its decision on a challenge by several states and environmental groups of the NRC’s rulemaking regarding temporary storage and permanent disposal of high level nuclear waste and spent nuclear fuel. The petitioners challenged the NRC’s 2010 update to the agency’s Waste Confidence Decision and temporary storage rule ("Waste Confidence Decision"). 

The D.C. Circuit found that the agency’s 2010 Waste Confidence Decision update constituted a major federal action, which, consistent with the National Environmental Policy Act ("NEPA"), requires either an environmental impact statement or a finding of no significant impact from the agency’s actions. The D.C. Circuit found that the NRC’s evaluation of the environmental risks from spent nuclear fuel was deficient, and therefore remanded the 2010 Waste Confidence Decision update for further action consistent with NEPA. 
On September 6, 2012, the NRC Commissioners issued a directive to the NRC staff to proceed directly with development of a generic environmental impact statement to support an updated Waste Confidence Decision. The NRC Commissioners also directed the NRC staff to establish a schedule to publish a final rule and environmental impact study within 24 months of September 6, 2012. 
In September 2013, the NRC issued its draft Generic Environmental Impact Statement ("GEIS") to support an updated Waste Confidence Decision. On August 26, 2014, the NRC approved a final rule on the environmental effects of continued storage of spent nuclear fuel. Renamed the Continued Storage Rule, the NRC's decision adopted the findings of the GEIS regarding the environmental impacts of storing spent fuel at any reactor site after the reactor’s licensed period of operations. As a result, those generic impacts do not need to be re-analyzed in the environmental reviews for individual licenses. Although Palo Verde has not been involved in any licensing actions affected by the D.C. Circuit’s June 8, 2012 decision, the NRC lifted its suspension on final licensing actions on all nuclear power plant licenses and renewals that went into effect when the D.C. Circuit issued its June 2012 decision. The final Continued Storage Rule was subject to continuing legal challenges before the NRC and the Court of Appeals. In June 2016, the D.C. Circuit issued its final decision, rejecting all remaining legal challenges to the Continue Storage Rule. On August 8, 2016, the D.C. Circuit denied a petition for rehearing. 
Palo Verde has sufficient capacity at its on-site independent spent fuel storage installation ("ISFSI") to store all of the nuclear fuel that will be irradiated during the initial operating license period, which ends in December 2027. Additionally, Palo Verde has sufficient capacity at its on-site ISFSI to store a portion of the fuel that will be irradiated during the period of extended operation, which ends in November 2047. If uncertainties regarding the United States government’s obligation to accept and store spent fuel are not favorably resolved, APS will evaluate alternative storage solutions that may obviate the need to expand the ISFSI to accommodate all of the fuel that will be irradiated during the period of extended operation. 
The One-Mill Fee. In 2011, the National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners and the Nuclear Energy Institute challenged the DOE’s 2010 determination of the adequacy of the one tenth of a cent per kWh 
 3

fee (the "one-mill fee") paid by the nation’s commercial nuclear power plant owners pursuant to their individual obligations under the Standard Contract. This fee was recovered by the Company through applicable fuel adjustment clauses. In June 2012, the D.C. Circuit held that the DOE failed to conduct a sufficient fee analysis in making the 2010 determination. The D.C. Circuit remanded the 2010 determination to the Secretary of the DOE (the "Secretary") with instructions to conduct a new fee adequacy determination within six months. In February 2013, upon completion of the DOE’s revised one-mill fee adequacy determination, the court reopened the proceedings. On November 19, 2013, the D.C. Circuit ordered the Secretary to notify Congress of his intent to suspend collecting annual fees for nuclear waste disposal from nuclear power plant operators, as he is required to do pursuant to the NWPA and the court’s order. On January 3, 2014, the Secretary notified Congress of his intention to suspend collection of the one-mill fee, subject to Congress’ disapproval and on May 16, 2014, the DOE notified all commercial nuclear power plant operators, effective May 16, 2014, the one-mill fee was suspended. Electricity generated at Palo Verde and sold on or after May 16, 2014 is no longer subjected to the one-mill fee.

• | NRC Oversight of the Nuclear Energy Industry in the Wake of the Earthquake and Tsunami in Japan. The NRC regulates the operation of all commercial nuclear power reactors in the United States, including Palo Verde. The NRC periodically conducts inspections of nuclear facilities and monitors performance indicators to enable the agency to arrive at objective conclusions about a licensee's safety performance. Following the March 11, 2011 earthquake and tsunami in Japan, the NRC established a task force to conduct a systematic and methodical review of NRC processes and regulations to determine whether the agency should make additional improvements to its regulatory system. On March 12, 2012, the NRC issued the first regulatory requirements based on the recommendations of the NRC's Near Term Task Force. With respect to Palo Verde, the NRC issued two orders requiring safety enhancements regarding: (1) mitigation strategies to respond to extreme natural events resulting in the loss of power at plants and (2) enhancement of spent fuel pool instrumentation. 

The NRC has issued a series of interim staff guidance documents regarding implementation of these requirements. Palo Verde has met the NRC's imposed deadlines for the installation of equipment to address these requirements. Palo Verde has spent approximately $125.4 million (the Company's share is $19.8 million) on capital enhancements related to these requirements as of December 31, 2017. 

• | Liability and Insurance Matters. The Palo Verde Participants have insurance for public liability resulting from nuclear energy hazards, covered by primary liability insurance provided by commercial insurance carriers and an industry-wide retrospective assessment program. If a loss at a nuclear power plant covered by the programs exceeds the accumulated funds in the primary level of protection, the Company could be assessed retrospective premium adjustments on a per incident basis up to $60.4 million, with an annual payment limitation of approximately $9.0 million. The Palo Verde Participants also maintain $2.75 billion of "all risk" nuclear property insurance. The insurance provides coverage for property damage and decontamination at Palo Verde. For covered incidents involving property damage not accompanied by a release of radioactive material, the policy's coverage limit is $2.25 billion. In addition, the Company has secured insurance against portions of any increased cost of generation or purchased power and business interruption resulting from a sudden and unforeseen outage at Palo Verde. 

Fossil-Fueled Plants
The Newman Power Station ("Newman") consists of three conventional steam-electric generating units and two combined cycle generating units. The station operates primarily on natural gas but the conventional steam-electric generating units can also operate on fuel oil.
The Company's Rio Grande Power Station ("Rio Grande") consists of three conventional steam-electric generating units and one aeroderivative unit that operate on natural gas. 
The Company's Montana Power Station ("MPS") consists of four aeroderivative generating units which operate on natural gas. The units can also operate on fuel oil.
The Company's Copper Power Station ("Copper") consists of a natural gas combustion turbine used primarily to meet peak demand.
The Company owned a 7% interest in Units 4 and 5 at Four Corners Generating Station ("Four Corners"). The Company shared power entitlements and certain allocated costs of the two units with APS (the Four Corners operating agent) and the other Four Corners participants. On July 6, 2016, the Company sold its interests in Four Corners for $32.0 million to 4C Acquisition, LLC, an affiliate of APS ("APS's affiliate"), and Pinnacle West Capital Corporation ("Pinnacle West"), the parent company of APS 
 4

and APS's affiliate. No significant gain or loss was recorded for this sale. APS's affiliate assumed responsibility for all Four Corners capital expenditures made after July 6, 2016, which assumption is guaranteed by Pinnacle West. In addition, APS's affiliate will indemnify the Company against certain liabilities and costs related to the future operation of Four Corners, which indemnification is guaranteed by Pinnacle West. See Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note C and Note E of Notes to Financial Statements for further discussions. 
Solar Photovoltaic Facilities
The Company’s Texas Community solar facility, a 3 MW utility-scale solar plant located at MPS, began commercial operations on May 31, 2017. The Company also owns six other solar photovoltaic facilities with a total capacity of 0.2 MW.
Transmission and Distribution Lines and Agreements
The Company owns, or has significant ownership interests in, four 345 kV transmission lines in New Mexico and Arizona and three 500 kV lines in Arizona. These lines enable the Company to deliver its energy entitlements from its remote generation at Palo Verde to its service area (pursuant to various transmission and power exchange agreements to which the Company is a party). The Company also owns the transmission and distribution network within its New Mexico and Texas retail service area and operates these facilities under franchise agreements with various municipalities. Pursuant to standards established by the North American Electric Reliability Corporation and the Western Electricity Coordinating Council, the Company operates its transmission system in a way that allows it to maintain system integrity in the event that any one of these transmission lines is out of service. 
In addition to the transmission and distribution lines within our service territory, the Company's transmission network and associated substations include the following:

Line | Length (miles) | Voltage (kV) | | Company Ownership Interest
Springerville-Macho Springs-Luna-Diablo Line (1) | 310 | | 345 | | 100.0 | %
West Mesa-Arroyo Line (2) | 202 | | 345 | | 100.0 | %

Environmental Matters
General. The Company is subject to extensive laws, regulations and permit requirements with respect to air and GHG emissions, water discharges, soil and water quality, waste management and disposal, natural resources and other environmental matters by federal, state, regional, tribal and local authorities. Failure to comply with such laws, regulations and requirements can result in actions by authorities or other third parties that might seek to impose on the Company administrative, civil and/or criminal penalties or other sanctions. In addition, releases of pollutants or contaminants into the environment can result in costly cleanup liabilities. These laws, regulations and requirements are subject to change through modification or reinterpretation, or the introduction of new laws and regulations, and, as a result, the Company may face additional capital and operating costs to comply. Certain key environmental issues, laws and regulations facing the Company are described further below. 
In March 2017, the Company entered into a Compliance Agreement ("Compliance Agreement") with the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality under the Texas Environmental, Health and Safety Audit Privilege Act to address certain water and waste compliance issues associated with the integrity of the synthetic liner of the evaporation pond at the Company’s Newman Generating Station. The Company has initiated a capital project to extend the life of evaporation pond and in doing so will complete its obligation of the Compliance Agreement.
Air Emissions. The U.S. Clean Air Act ("CAA"), associated regulations and comparable state and local laws and regulations relating to air emissions impose, among other obligations, limitations on pollutants generated during the operations of the Company's facilities and assets, including sulfur dioxide ("SO2"), particulate matter ("PM"), nitrogen oxides ("NOx") and mercury. 
National Ambient Air Quality Standards ("NAAQS").  Under the CAA, the EPA sets NAAQS for six criteria pollutants considered harmful to public health and the environment, including PM, NOx, carbon monoxide ("CO"), ozone and SO2. NAAQS must be reviewed by the EPA at five-year intervals. In 2010, the EPA tightened the NAAQS for both nitrogen dioxide ("NO2") and SO2. The EPA is considering a 1-hour secondary NAAQS for NO2 and SO2. In January 2013, the EPA tightened the primary annual NAAQS for fine PM. On October 1, 2015, the EPA released a final rule tightening the primary and secondary NAAQS for ground-level ozone from its 2008 standard levels of 75 parts per billion ("ppb") to 70 ppb.The EPA may designate the areas in which we operate as nonattainment. For example, in December 2017, EPA proposed to designate southern Dona Ana County, New Mexico, as a nonattainment area. States that contain any areas designated as nonattainment, and any tribes that choose to do so, will be required to complete development of implementation plans in the 2020-2021 timeframe. Most nonattainment areas are expected to have until 2020 or 2023 to meet the primary (health) standard, with the exact attainment date varying based on the ozone level in the area. The Company continues to evaluate what impact these final and proposed NAAQS could have on its operations. If the Company is required to install additional equipment to control emissions at its facilities, the NAAQS, individually or in the aggregate, could have a material impact on its operations and financial results.
Other Laws and Regulations and Risks. The Company sold its interest in Four Corners to APS's affiliate on July 6, 2016 at the expiration of the 50-year participation agreement. As of the closing date of the sale, the Company’s environmental liabilities associated with Four Corners were limited to conditions that existed at the time of the sale and further limited to the portion thereof for which the Company would have been financially responsible if Four Corners had fully ceased operation on July 6, 2016. Pursuant to the terms of the Purchase and Sale Agreement, neither APS's affiliate nor APS assumed the Company's pre-closing obligations under environmental laws with respect to its interest in Four Corners. The Company may be subject to certain future claims under environmental laws and regulations as a former owner of Four Corners. The extent of such claims, if any, cannot be predicted with certainty. 
Climate Change. There has been a wide-ranging policy debate, at the local, state, national, and international levels, regarding the impact of GHG and possible means for their regulation. Efforts continue to be made in the international community toward the adoption of international treaties or protocols that would address global climate change issues. In April 2016, the United States signed the Paris Agreement, which requires countries to review and "represent a progression" in their intended nationally determined contributions, which set GHG emission reduction goals, every five years beginning in 2020. In August 2017, the United States formally documented to the United Nations its intent to withdraw from the Paris Agreement. The earliest possible effective withdrawal date from the Paris Agreement is November 2020. 
The U.S. federal government has either considered, proposed and/or finalized legislation or regulations limiting GHG emissions, including carbon dioxide. In particular, the U.S. Congress has considered legislation to restrict or regulate GHG emissions. In October 2015, the EPA published a rule establishing guidelines for states to regulate CO2 emissions from existing power plants, known as the Clean Power Plan ("CPP"). Legal challenges to the CPP are ongoing. The Company cannot at this time determine the impact of the CPP, related proposals and legal challenges may have on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

While a significant portion of the Company's generation assets are nuclear or gas-fired, and as a result, the Company believes that its GHG emissions are low relative to electric power companies who rely more on coal-fired generation, current and future legislation and regulation of GHG or any future related litigation could impose significant costs and/or operating restrictions on the Company, reduce demand for the power the Company generates, and/or require the Company to purchase rights to emit GHG, any of which could be material to the Company's business, reputation, financial condition or results of operations.
Climate change also has potential physical effects that could be relevant to the Company's business. In particular, climate change could affect the Company's service area by causing higher temperatures, less winter precipitation and less spring runoff, as well as by causing more extreme weather events. Such developments could change the demand for power in the region and could also impact the price or ready availability of water supplies or affect maintenance needs and the reliability of Company equipment. The Company believes that material effects on the Company's business or results of operations may result from the physical consequences of climate change, the regulatory approach to climate change ultimately selected and implemented by governmental authorities, or both. Given the very significant remaining uncertainties regarding whether and how these issues will be regulated, as well as the timing and severity of any physical effects of climate change, the Company believes it is impossible to meaningfully quantify the costs of these potential impacts at present.
Environmental Litigation and Investigations. Since July 2011, the U.S. Department of Justice (the "DOJ"), on behalf of the EPA, and APS have been engaged in substantive settlement negotiations in an effort to resolve certain of the pending matters. The allegations being addressed through settlement negotiations are that APS failed to obtain the necessary permits and install the controls necessary under the CAA to reduce SO2, NOx, and PM, and that defendants failed to obtain an operating permit under Title V of the CAA that reflects applicable requirements imposed by law. On June 24, 2015, the parties filed with the U.S. District Court for New Mexico a settlement agreement ("CAA Settlement Agreement") resolving this matter. On August 17, 2015, the U.S. District Court for New Mexico entered the CAA Settlement Agreement. The agreement imposes a total civil penalty payable by the co-owners of Four Corners collectively in the amount of $1.5 million, and it requires the co-owners to pay $6.7 million for environmental mitigation projects. At December 31, 2017, the Company has accrued its remaining unpaid share of approximately $0.2 million related to this matter.

Construction Program 
Utility construction expenditures reflected in the following table consist primarily of local generation, expanding and updating the transmission and distribution systems, the cost of capital improvements and replacements at Palo Verde and other generating facilities, and other property and equipment. Studies indicate that the Company will need additional power generation resources to meet increasing load requirements on its system and to replace retiring plants and terminated purchased power agreements, the costs of which are included in the table below.
The Company’s estimated cash construction costs for 2018 through 2022 are approximately $1.3 billion. Actual costs may vary from the construction program estimates shown. Such estimates are under continuous review and subject to ongoing adjustment and are updated periodically to reflect changed conditions.

By Year (1)(2)(estimates in millions) | | By Function(estimates in millions)
2018 | $ | 236 | | Production (1)(2) | $ | 551 
2019 | 238 | | Transmission | 183 | 
2020 | 278 | | Distribution | 430 |

Energy Sources
General
The following table summarizes the percentage contribution of nuclear fuel, natural gas, coal and purchased power to the total kWh energy mix of the Company. Energy generated by Company-owned solar photovoltaic panels and wind turbines accounted for less than 1% of the total kWh energy mix of the Company.

 | Years Ended December 31, 
 | 2017 | | 2016 | | 2015
Power Source | (percentage of total kWh energy mix)
Nuclear | 49 | % | | 49 | % | 47 | %
Natural gas | 36 | % | | 34 | % | 34 | %
Coal | — | % | | 2 | % | 6 | %
Purchased power | 15 | % | | 15 | % | 13 | %
Total | 100 | % | | 100 | % | 100 | %

Allocated fuel and purchased power costs are generally recoverable from customers in Texas and New Mexico pursuant to applicable regulations. Historical fuel costs and revenues are reconciled periodically in proceedings before the Public Utility Commission of Texas ("PUCT") and the New Mexico Public Regulation Commission ("NMPRC"). See "Regulation – Texas Regulatory Matters" and "Regulation – New Mexico Regulatory Matters."
Nuclear Fuel
The nuclear fuel cycle for Palo Verde consists of the following stages:  the mining and milling of uranium ore to produce uranium concentrates, the conversion of the uranium concentrates to uranium hexafluoride ("conversion services"), the enrichment of uranium hexafluoride ("enrichment services"), the fabrication of fuel assemblies ("fabrication services"), the utilization of the fuel assemblies in the reactors, and the storage and disposal of the spent fuel.  
Pursuant to the ANPP Participation Agreement, the Company owns an undivided interest in nuclear fuel purchased in connection with Palo Verde. The Palo Verde Participants are continually identifying their future nuclear fuel resource needs and negotiating arrangements to fill those needs. The Palo Verde Participants have contracted for 100% of Palo Verde's requirements for uranium concentrates through 2023 and 50% of its requirements for 2024 through 2025. The participants have contracted for 100% of Palo Verde's requirement for conversion services through 2021 and 46% of its requirements for 2022 through 2025. The participants have also contracted for 100% of Palo Verde's requirement for enrichment services through 2020 and 20% of its requirement for 2021 through 2026 and all of Palo Verde's requirement for fuel assembly fabrication services through 2024.
Nuclear Fuel Financing. The Company’s financing of nuclear fuel is accomplished through Rio Grande Resources Trust ("RGRT"), a Texas grantor trust, which is consolidated in the Company’s financial statements. As of December 31, 2017, RGRT has $45 million aggregate principal amount borrowed in the form of senior notes. In August 2017, RGRT's $50 million Series B 4.47% Senior Notes matured and were paid utilizing funds borrowed under the revolving credit facility (the "RCF"). The Company guarantees the payment of principal and interest on the senior notes. The nuclear fuel financing requirements of RGRT are met with a combination of the senior notes and short-term borrowings under the RCF.
Natural Gas
The Company manages its natural gas requirements through a combination of a long-term (greater than a year) supply contract, several medium-term (greater than a month but less than one year) supply contracts and spot or short-term (daily to a month) market purchases. The long-term supply contract provides for firm deliveries of gas at market-based index prices. Medium-term and spot agreements are either fixed priced and/or index priced depending on the market. In 2017, the Company’s natural gas requirements at Newman, Rio Grande and MPS were met with short-term, medium-term and long-term natural gas purchases from various suppliers, and this practice is expected to continue in 2018. Interstate gas is delivered under a base firm transportation contract. The Company has expanded its firm interstate transportation contract to include MPS. The Company anticipates it will continue to purchase natural gas at spot market prices on a monthly basis for a portion of the fuel needs for Newman, Rio Grande and MPS. The Company will continue to evaluate the availability of short-term natural gas supplies versus medium and long-term supplies to maintain a reliable and economical supply for its local generating stations.
Natural gas for Newman and Copper is also supplied pursuant to a long-term intrastate natural gas contract that became effective October 1, 2009 and continues through March 31, 2018. Beginning April 1, 2018, intrastate natural gas reservation and storage for Newman, Copper and MPS will be provided through a new contract that will continue through March 31, 2028. Under 
 9

this new contract, intrastate gas supply will be sourced in the same manner as interstate gas, through a variety of long, medium and short-term supply contracts.
Purchased Power
To supplement its own generation and operating reserve requirements, and to meet required renewable portfolio standards, the Company engages in power purchase arrangements that may vary in duration and amount based on an evaluation of the Company’s resource needs, the economics of the transactions and specific renewable portfolio requirements.
The Company has a firm 100 MW Power Purchase and Sale Agreement (the "Power Purchase and Sale Agreement") with Freeport-McMoran Copper and Gold Energy Services LLC ("Freeport"), pursuant to which Freeport will deliver energy to the Company from the Luna Energy Facility (a natural gas-fired combined cycle generation facility located in Luna County, New Mexico) and the Company will deliver a like amount of energy at Greenlee, Arizona. The Company may purchase up to the contracted MW amount at a specified price at times when energy is not exchanged under the Power Purchase and Sale Agreement. The Power Purchase and Sale Agreement was approved by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission ("FERC") and will continue through an initial term ending December 31, 2021, with subsequent rollovers until terminated. Upon mutual agreement, the Power Purchase and Sale Agreement allows the parties to increase the amount of energy that is purchased and sold thereunder. The parties have agreed to increase the amount up to 125 MW through December 2018.
The Company has entered into several power purchase agreements to help meet its renewable portfolio requirements. Specifically, the Company has a 25-year purchase power agreement with Hatch Solar Energy Center I, LLC for a 5 MW solar photovoltaic project located in southern New Mexico, which began commercial operation in July 2011. In June 2015, the Company entered into a consent agreement with Hatch Solar Energy Center 1, LLC to provide for additional or replacement photovoltaic modules. The Company also entered into a 20-year contract with NRG Solar Roadrunner, LLC ("NRG") for the purchase of all of the output of a 20 MW solar photovoltaic plant built in southern New Mexico, which began commercial operation in August 2011. In addition, the Company has 25-year purchase power agreements to purchase all of the output of two additional solar photovoltaic projects located in southern New Mexico, SunE EPE1, LLC (10 MW) and SunE EPE2, LLC (12 MW), which began commercial operation in June 2012 and May 2012, respectively. In September 2017, Longroad Solar Portfolio Holdings, LLC purchased SunE EPE1, LLC and in October 2017, Silicon Ranch Corporation purchased SunE EPE2, LLC with the Company's consent per the terms of both purchase power agreements.
Furthermore, the Company has a 20-year purchase power agreement with Macho Springs Solar, LLC to purchase the entire generation output delivered from the 50 MW Macho Springs solar photovoltaic project located in Luna County, New Mexico which began commercial operation in May 2014. Finally, the Company has a 30-year purchase power agreement with Newman Solar LLC to purchase the total output, which is approximately 10 MW, from a solar photovoltaic generation plant on land subleased from the Company in proximity to Newman. This solar project began commercial operation in December 2014. 
Other purchases of shorter duration were made during 2017 to supplement the Company's generation resources during planned and unplanned outages, for economic reasons and to supply off-system sales.

Regulation
General
The rates and services of the Company are regulated by incorporated municipalities in Texas, the PUCT, the NMPRC and the FERC. Municipal orders, ordinances and other agreements regarding rates and services adopted by Texas municipalities are subject to review and approval by the PUCT. The FERC has jurisdiction over the Company's wholesale (sales for resale) transactions, transmission service and compliance with federally-mandated reliability standards. The decisions of the PUCT, the NMPRC and the FERC are subject to judicial review.
Texas Regulatory Matters
2015 Texas Retail Rate Case Filing. On August 10, 2015, the Company filed with the City of El Paso, other municipalities incorporated in its Texas service territory, and the PUCT in Docket No. 44941, a request for an annual increase in non-fuel base revenues ("2015 Texas Retail Rate Case").
On July 21, 2016, the parties to PUCT Docket No. 44941 filed the Joint Motion to Implement Uncontested Amended and Restated Stipulation and Agreement which was unopposed by the parties (the "2016 Unopposed Settlement"). On August 25, 2016, the PUCT approved the 2016 Unopposed Settlement and issued its final order in Docket No. 44941 ("2016 PUCT Final Order"), as proposed. The 2016 PUCT Final Order provided for: (i) an annual non-fuel base rate increase, lower annual depreciation expense, a revised return on equity for allowance for funds used during construction ("AFUDC") purposes, and the inclusion of substantially all new plant in service in rate base; (ii) an additional annual non-fuel base rate increase of $3.7 million related to Four Corners costs, which was collected through a surcharge that terminated on July 11, 2017; (iii) removing the separate rate treatment for residential customers with solar systems that the Company had proposed in its August 10, 2015 filing; (iv) allowing the Company to recover  $3.1 million in rate case expenses through a separate surcharge; and (v) allowing the Company to recover revenues associated with the relate back of rates to consumption on and after January 12, 2016 through March 31, 2016 through a separate surcharge.
Interim rates associated with the annual non-fuel base rate increase became effective on April 1, 2016. The additional surcharges associated with the incremental Four Corners costs, rate case expenses and the relate back of rates to consumption on and after January 12, 2016 through March 31, 2016 were implemented on October 1, 2016.
For financial reporting purposes, the Company deferred any recognition of the Company's request in its 2015 Texas Retail Rate Case until it received the 2016 PUCT Final Order on August 25, 2016. Accordingly, it reported in the third quarter of 2016 the cumulative effect of the 2016 PUCT Final Order, which related back to January 12, 2016.
2017 Texas Retail Rate Case Filing. On February 13, 2017, the Company filed with the City of El Paso, other municipalities incorporated in the Company's Texas service territory and the PUCT in Docket No. 46831, a request for an increase in non-fuel base revenues ("2017 Texas Retail Rate Case"). On November 2, 2017, the Company filed the Joint Motion to Implement Uncontested Stipulation and Agreement with the Administrative Law Judges for the 2017 Texas Retail Rate Case.
On December 18, 2017, the PUCT issued its final order in the Company's rate case pending in Docket No. 46831 ("2017 PUCT Final Order"), which provides, among other things, for the following: (i) an annual non-fuel base rate increase of $14.5 million; (ii) a return on equity of 9.65%; (iii) all new plant in service as filed in the Company's rate filing package was prudent and used and useful and therefore is included in rate base; (iv) recovery of the costs of decommissioning Four Corners in the amount of $5.5 million over a seven year period beginning August 1, 2017; (v) the Company to recover reasonable rate case expenses of approximately $3.4 million through a separate surcharge over a three year period; and (vi) a requirement that the Company file a refund tariff if the federal statutory income tax rate, as it relates to the Company, is decreased before the Company files its next rate case. The 2017 PUCT Final Order also establishes baseline revenue requirements for recovery of future transmission and distribution investment costs, and includes a minimum monthly bill of $30.00 for new residential customers with distributed generation, such as private rooftop solar. Additionally, the 2017 PUCT Final Order allows for the annual recovery of $2.1 million of nuclear decommissioning funding and establishes annual depreciation expense that is approximately $1.9 million lower than the annual amount requested by the Company in its initial filing. Finally, the 2017 PUCT Final Order allows for the Company to recover revenues associated with the relate back of rates to consumption on and after July 18, 2017 through a separate surcharge.
New base rates, including additional surcharges associated with rate case expenses and the relate back of rates to consumption on and after July 18, 2017 through December 31, 2017 were implemented in January 2018. 
For financial reporting purposes, the Company deferred any recognition of the Company's request in its 2017 Texas Retail Rate Case until it received the 2017 PUCT Final Order on December 18, 2017. Accordingly, it reported in the fourth quarter of 2017 the cumulative effect of the 2017 PUCT Final Order, which related back to July 18, 2017. 
 12

The 2017 PUCT Final Order requires the Company to file a refund tariff if the federal statutory income tax rate, as it relates to the Company, is decreased before the Company files its next rate case. Following the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 ("TCJA") on December 22, 2017, and in compliance with the 2017 PUCT Final Order, the Company will reduce the recognition of Texas jurisdictional revenues beginning January 1, 2018, to approximate the tax savings resulting from the TCJA and will file a refund tariff which the Company will ask to be implemented in the first half of 2018. The refund tariff is expected to be reflected in rates over a period of a year and will be updated annually until new base rates are implemented pursuant to the Company's next rate case filing. See Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note J for further details.
Energy Efficiency Cost Recovery Factor. On May 1, 2017, the Company filed its annual application, which was assigned PUCT Docket No. 47125, to establish its energy efficiency cost recovery factor ("EECRF") for 2018. In addition to projected energy efficiency costs for 2018 and a true-up to prior year actual costs, the Company requested approval of an incentive bonus for the 2016 energy efficiency program results in accordance with PUCT rules. Interim rates were approved effective January 1, 2018. The Company, the staff of the PUCT, and the City of El Paso reached an agreement that includes an incentive bonus of $0.8 million. The agreement was filed on January 25, 2018, and was approved by the PUCT on February 15, 2018.
Fuel and Purchased Power Costs. The Company's actual fuel costs, including purchased power energy costs, are recovered from customers through a fixed fuel factor. The PUCT has adopted a fuel cost recovery rule (the "Texas Fuel Rule") that allows the Company to seek periodic adjustments to its fixed fuel factor. The Company can seek to revise its fixed fuel factor based upon the approved formula at least four months after its last revision except in the month of December. The Texas Fuel Rule requires the Company to request to refund fuel costs in any month when the over-recovery balance exceeds a threshold material amount and it expects fuel costs to continue to be materially over-recovered. The Texas Fuel Rule also permits the Company to seek to surcharge fuel under-recoveries in any month the balance exceeds a threshold material amount and it expects fuel cost recovery to continue to be materially under-recovered. Fuel over and under-recoveries are considered material when they exceed 4% of the previous twelve months' fuel costs. All such fuel revenue and expense activities are subject to periodic final review by the PUCT in fuel reconciliation proceedings.
On November 30, 2016, the Company filed a request, which was assigned PUCT Docket No. 46610, to increase its fixed fuel factor by approximately 28.8% to reflect increased fuel expenses primarily related to an increase in the price of natural gas used to generate power. The increase in the fixed fuel factor was effective on an interim basis January 1, 2017 and approved by the PUCT on January 10, 2017. As of September 30, 2017, the Company had over-recovered fuel costs in the amount of $1.1 million for the Texas jurisdiction. On October 13, 2017, the Company filed a request, which was assigned PUCT Docket No. 47692, to decrease the Texas fixed fuel factor by approximately 19% to reflect decreased fuel expenses primarily related to a decrease in the price of natural gas used to generate power. The decrease in the Texas fixed fuel factor became effective beginning with the November 2017 billing month and will continue thereafter until changed by the PUCT. At December 31, 2017, the Company had a net fuel over-recovery balance of approximately $5.8 million in Texas.
Fuel Reconciliation Proceeding. On September 27, 2016, the Company filed an application with the PUCT, designated as PUCT Docket No. 46308, to reconcile $436.6 million of Texas fuel and purchased power expenses incurred during the period of April 1, 2013 through March 31, 2016. On June 29, 2017, the PUCT approved a settlement in this proceeding. The settlement provides for the reconciliation of fuel and purchased power costs incurred from April 1, 2013 through March 31, 2016. Additionally, the settlement modifies and tightens the Palo Verde performance rewards measurement bands beginning with the 2018 performance period. The financial results for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 include a $5.0 million, pre-tax increase to income reflecting the settlement of the Texas fuel reconciliation proceeding. This amount represents Palo Verde performance rewards associated with the 2013 to 2015 performance periods net of disallowed fuel and purchased power costs as approved in the settlement. Texas jurisdictional fuel and purchased power costs subject to prudence review are costs from April 1, 2016 through December 31, 2017 that total approximately $250.9 million.
Community Solar. On June 8, 2015, the Company filed a petition with the PUCT to initiate a community solar program that includes the construction and ownership of a 3 MW solar photovoltaic system located at the Company's MPS. Participation is on a voluntary basis, and customers contract for a set capacity (kW) amount and receive all energy produced. This case was assigned PUCT Docket No. 44800. The Company filed a settlement agreement among all parties on July 1, 2016 approving the program, and the PUCT approved the settlement agreement and program on September 1, 2016. On April 19, 2017, the Company announced that the entire 3 MW program was fully subscribed by approximately 1,500 Texas customers. The Community Solar facility began commercial operation on  May 31, 2017.
Four Corners Generating Station. On February 17, 2015, the Company and APS entered into the Purchase and Sale Agreement providing for the sale of the Company's interest in Four Corners to APS. The sale of the Company's interest in Four Corners closed on July 6, 2016. See Part II, Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note E of Notes to Financial Statements" for further details on the sale of Four Corners.
 13

On June 10, 2015, the Company filed an application in Texas requesting reasonableness and public interest findings and certain rate and accounting findings related to the Purchase and Sale Agreement. This case was assigned PUCT Docket No. 44805. Subsequent to the filing of the application, the case was subject to numerous procedural matters, including a March 23, 2016 order in which the PUCT determined not to dismiss the reasonableness and public interest issues in this docket but to consider the requested rate and accounting findings, including coal mine reclamation costs, in a rate case proceeding. On September 1, 2016, a motion by parties in the proceeding to suspend the procedural schedule in order to pursue settlement was approved. On March 3, 2017, the Company filed a Joint Motion to Implement Stipulation and Agreement (the "Stipulation and Agreement"), and PUCT Staff filed its recommendation that the Company’s disposition of its interest in Four Corners was reasonable and consistent with the public interest. Additionally, the signatories of the Stipulation and Agreement agreed to support the recovery of the Company's Four Corners decommissioning costs in the 2017 Texas Retail Rate Case. A final order approving the Stipulation and Agreement was adopted by the PUCT on March 30, 2017. The approval to recover Four Corners decommissioning costs was included in the 2017 PUCT Final Order.
Other Required Approvals. The Company has obtained other required approvals for tariffs and other approvals required by the Texas Public Utility Regulatory Act ("PURA") and the PUCT.
New Mexico Regulatory Matters
2015 New Mexico Rate Case Filing. On May 11, 2015, the Company filed a request with the NMPRC, in Case No. 15-00127-UT, for an annual increase in non-fuel base rates. On June 8, 2016, the NMPRC issued its final order in Case No. 15-00127-UT (the "NMPRC Final Order") which approved an annual increase in non-fuel base rates of approximately $0.6 million, an increase of approximately $0.5 million in other service fees and a decrease in the Company's allowed return on equity to 9.48%. The NMPRC Final Order concluded that all of the Company's new plant in service was reasonable and necessary and therefore would be recoverable in rates. The Company's rates were approved by the NMPRC effective July 1, 2016 and implemented at such time.
Future New Mexico Rate Case Filing. NMPRC Case No. 15-00109-UT required the Company to make a rate filing in New Mexico in the second quarter of 2017 using a historical test year ended December 31, 2016. On March 24, 2017, the Company, NMPRC Utility Division Staff and the New Mexico Attorney General filed a Joint Motion to Modify Filing Date Stated in Final Order requesting that the rate filing date be changed to no later than July 31, 2019, using the appropriate historical test year period. The joint request was approved by the NMPRC on April 12, 2017. The NMPRC has initiated an investigation into the impact of the TCJA on utility customers that may require earlier action by the Company. The Company is evaluating possible approaches to begin providing a refund credit for the TCJA income tax rate decrease to New Mexico customers.
Fuel and Purchased Power Costs. Historically, fuel and purchased power costs were recovered through base rates and a Fuel and Purchased Power Cost Adjustment Clause (the "FPPCAC") that accounts for changes in the costs of fuel relative to the amount included in base rates. Effective July 1, 2016, with the implementation of the NMPRC Final Order, fuel and purchased power costs are no longer recovered through base rates but are recovered through the FPPCAC. The Company's request to reconcile its fuel and purchased power costs for the period January 1, 2013 through December 31, 2014 was approved in Case No. 15-00127-UT. New Mexico jurisdictional costs subject to prudence review are costs from January 1, 2015 through December 31, 2017 that total approximately $173.1 million. At December 31, 2017, the Company had a net fuel over-recovery balance of approximately $0.4 million in New Mexico. As required, the Company filed a request to continue use of its FPPCAC with the NMPRC on January 5, 2018 which was assigned NMPRC Case No. 18-00006-UT.
5 MW HAFB Facility Certificate of Convenience and Necessity ("CCN"). On October 7, 2015, in NMPRC Case No. 15-00185-UT, the NMPRC issued a final order approving a CCN for a 5 MW solar power generation facility located on HAFB in the Company's service territory in New Mexico. The Company and HAFB negotiated a retail contract, which includes a power sales agreement for the facility, to replace the existing load retention agreement which was approved by final order issued October 5, 2016 in NMPRC Case No. 16-00224-UT. Construction of the solar generation facility is expected to be completed in the third quarter of 2018. 
New Mexico Efficient Use of Energy Recovery Factor. On July 1, 2016, the Company filed its annual application requesting approval of its 2017 Energy Efficiency and Load Management Plan and to establish energy efficiency cost recovery factors for 2017. In addition to projected energy efficiency costs for 2017, the Company requested approval of a $0.4 million incentive for 2017 energy efficiency programs in accordance with NMPRC rules. This case was assigned Case No. 16-00185-UT. On February 22, 2017, the NMPRC issued a Final Order approving the Company’s 2017 Energy Efficiency and Load Management Plan and authorizing recovery in 2017 of a base incentive of $0.4 million. The Company’s energy efficiency cost recovery factors were approved and effective in customer bills beginning on March 1, 2017.
On July 1, 2016, the Company filed its 2015 Annual Report for Energy Efficiency Programs, which included an incentive for verified 2015 program performance of $0.3 million, which was approved in Case No. 13-00176-UT. The Company recorded 
 14

the $0.3 million approved incentive in operating revenues in the first quarter of 2017.
