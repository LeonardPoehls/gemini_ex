Over time, we expect to see other competing technologies emerge.
Semiconductor and IP Licensing Segment
Tessera, Inc.'s research and development led to significant innovations in semiconductor packaging technology. Semiconductor packaging creates the mechanical and electrical connection between semiconductor chips and systems such as computers and communication equipment, often via connection to printed circuit boards. We patented these innovations, often referred to as chip-scale packaging, which were widely adopted in the electronics industry. The wave of adoption was initially led by Intel Corporation, and over time, many semiconductor companies and outsourced assembly and test companies adopted the technology and entered into license agreements with Tessera, Inc.
Invensas Corporation develops next generation semiconductor packaging and interconnect technologies for memory, mobile, computing and automotive applications. For these applications, Invensas innovates in three primary areas: (i) DRAM and Flash memory, (ii) mobile semiconductor devices, and (iii) three dimensional integrated circuit (3D-IC) assemblies. Invensas engineering teams develop and prototype these technologies in advanced assembly and test laboratories, as well as performing full product reliability testing and acceptance testing. By building collaborative partnerships with world-class manufacturing companies and high-volume equipment and materials suppliers, Invensas then licenses these technology solutions to original equipment manufacturers ("OEMs"), original design manufacturers ("ODMs"), integrated device manufacturers ("IDMs"), fabless device suppliers, foundries and outsourced assembly and test (OSATs) providers, and supports the technology transfer at customer-designated sites.
Within each of these three areas of innovation (memory, mobile, and 3D-IC), Invensas has created specific product solutions that address critical needs in the market. For example, Invensas innovates in the 3D-IC space. 3D-IC, which includes Through-Silicon Vias, is widely expected to be the next major inflection in semiconductor packaging and is applicable to multiple markets, including networking, data storage, computing and mobility. In August of 2015, we augmented our 3D-IC portfolio with the acquisition of Ziptronix, Inc., a leading developer of emerging low temperature wafer bonding technologies, which are targeted at the image sensor, DRAM, MEMS, RF and 2.5D logic markets. BVA (Bond Via Array), one of the Invensas mobile packaging solutions, addresses the need for small form factor, high bandwidth, low power and low cost in mobile devices, and Invensas with its partners is working to demonstrate the benefits of this technology for system-in-package applications.
Customers
Our semiconductor packaging and other technologies have been licensed to more than 100 companies. These customers include SK hynix, Samsung and Micron, among others. 
Research & Development
As demonstrated by our industry‑recognized, advanced and widely-deployed technologies, we have a long history of developing, licensing and delivering innovative semiconductor packaging and interconnect solutions. Many of our longstanding innovations have enabled core function and performance gains in semiconductor solutions over the years. 
As we have grown, we continue to develop new technologies internally as well as seeking to acquire best-in-class technologies from outside sources. Taken together with a strong team of talented and deeply experienced research and development engineers, this base of technology and our constant efforts to innovate new, industry leading solutions, provides a strong foundation for the development of new and unique semiconductor packaging and interconnect solutions going forward. 
As of December 31, 2016, the Intellectual Property segment employed 42 engineers and technologists devoted to semiconductor packaging and other semiconductor technologies. Research and development and other related costs for the Semiconductor and Intellectual Property segment were approximately $28.6 million, $22.7 million and $19.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
Intellectual Property Portfolio
As of December 31, 2016, our subsidiaries comprising the Semiconductor and IP Licensing segment owned approximately 1,902 United States patents and patent applications, as well as approximately 1,490 foreign patents and patent applications. The last to expire of those issued patents expires in 2035.
We evaluate the purchase of patents in the field of semiconductor technologies and related areas. Our evaluation criteria for patent acquisitions include: the fit with our existing portfolios, the number and jurisdiction of patent assets, the profitability of the potential infringing products, our view of the prospects of the market for infringing products, legal criteria and our assessment of the likelihood of obtaining negotiated licenses. See Part I, Item 1A- Risk Factors.
Strategy
For our semiconductor business, we invest in the development of new advanced packaging and interconnect technologies to enable the next generation of mobile, consumer, and computing products. Leveraging our extensive design, simulation and prototyping capability, we partner with leaders throughout the semiconductor ecosystem to develop, demonstrate, optimize and commercialize our technologies. As a component of our commercialization effort, we transfer our technologies to customer-selected manufacturing sites, foundries and OSATs.
In addition, we have developed significant capabilities in the technical analysis of intellectual property and its embodiment in commercial products. We generally encourage customers to broaden their adoption of (and license to) our array of innovative technologies in conjunction with licensing patented technologies from us.
To increase the likelihood that our technologies are adopted, we lead with technology and then seek to negotiate reasonable royalties for our patented inventions. Successful negotiation of these royalties is generally dependent on:

• | Explaining the benefits of new technologies, including any size, power and performance benefits;


• | Explaining the value proposition over existing or alternative technologies;


• | Explaining the manufacturability of the technologies;


• | Countering bias against externally developed solutions; and

7


• | Providing technical and market data supporting the royalties we are seeking.

We expect our Intellectual Property revenue to primarily come from:

• | Continuing business with our existing licensees;


• | New licensees of our semiconductor technology; and


• | Partnering with patent holders or purchasing patent assets in fields beyond semiconductor packaging and then leveraging our core competencies in licensing to realize value from those assets.

Although we are engaged with and have licensed our technologies to many semiconductor companies, some of the companies that use our patented technologies have nonetheless chosen not to enter a license agreement with us. Consequently, we have necessarily developed significant abilities to plan, to execute, and sustain litigation activities. We view litigation as a tool to be used only when necessary and only when other business approaches have failed. Although we have reduced our litigation activities over the past several years, if we are unable to secure license agreements on favorable terms through negotiations, or if licensees do not comply with the terms of their licenses, we might have to file new litigation to enforce our rights. See Part 1, Item 3-Legal Proceedings. We believe that holding a significant cash and cash equivalents position is essential to maintaining the credibility of our litigation capabilities.
Competition
We compete with internal technology development groups at semiconductor manufacturers, assemblers, and electronic component and system manufacturers, who may create their own solutions that compete with technologies that we license. We also face a form of competition known as royalty stacking. Royalty stacking refers to situations in which a single product potentially infringes on many patents, and thus may bear multiple royalty burdens. Our customers’ willingness and ability to pay reasonable royalties is, in part, affected by the number of patents infringed by a particular customer product, the concentration of the holders of those patents, the customer’s cost of licensing those patents, and the profitability of the infringing product. We also compete with other firms in acquiring patent assets or partnering with owners of patent assets. The key competitive factors related to acquiring patent assets include financial resources and willingness to pay, experience in patent licensing, reputation as a licensor, litigation history, and licensing strategy for the subject portfolio.
Customer Concentration
Nearly all of our revenue is denominated in U.S. dollars. The following table sets forth revenue generated from customers comprising 10% or more of total revenue for the periods indicated:
