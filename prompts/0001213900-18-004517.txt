ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Our History 
 
Horrison Resources Inc. Horrison Resources Inc. (“we,” “us,” “our” or the “Company”), formally known as Sichuan Leaders Petrochemical Company., was incorporated under the laws of the State of Florida on June 29, 2000. From our inception through May 2013, we provided quality space saving custom home furniture and closet organizing systems to the general public.
 
In May 2013, our Board of Directors (the “Board”) determined that to continue to protect and increase shareholder value, it would be to the advantage, welfare and best interests of our shareholders to pursuit other business opportunities within lubricating oil research and development, production and sales in Asia in order to generate new business revenue. The Board agreed to the change in the business strategy and to change the name of the Company to reflect said new direction and mission. To facilitate this action, the Board voted to dispose of all of our assets related to the retail operation of the wall bed products. This action was approved on May 21, 2013 by shareholders representing 87% of our issued and outstanding shares of common stock.
 
On September 28, 2017, Andy Fan (the “Seller”) and Yap Nee Seng (the “Purchaser”) entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement (the “Agreement”). The closing of the transactions (the “Closing”) contemplated by the Agreement occurred and consummated on November 3, 2017. Pursuant to the Agreement, the Sellers sold to the Buyers, and the Buyers agreed to purchase from the Sellers, 40,000,020 shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share (the “Common Stock”) of the Company, constituting approximately 92.1% of the issued and outstanding Common Stock. In connection with the Closing, Mr. Andy Fan resigned from the executive officer positions he held with the Company and Tina Donnelly resigned from the corporate secretary position she held with the Company. Effective on October 31, 2017, the Company appointed Yap Nee Seng as Chief Executive Officer, President and Chairman of the Company and the Company appointed Cheah Pei Yin as Chief Financial Officer, Secretary and director of the Company. 
 
As a result of the change of control of our Company, on March 8, 2018, our board has adopted and approved by the unanimous written consent in lieu of a meeting to amend Article 1 of our Articles of Incorporation changing our name to “Horrison Resources Inc.” (the “Name Change Amendment”) and an amendment to Article 3 of our Articles of Incorporation changing our address to Unit L, 16/F, MG Tower, 133 Hoi Bun Road, Kwun Tong, Kowloon, Hong Kong. The Name Change Amendment was also adopted and approved by the written consent of Mr. Nee Seng Yap, the owner of approximately 92.1% of our outstanding shares of common stock, executed on March 8, 2018. We filed a preliminary information statement with the SEC on or about the date first set forth above to holders of record as of the close of business on March 8, 2018 (the "Record Date") of the common stock, par value $.01 per share ("Common Stock") of the Company in connection with the Name Change Amendment. No proxy of our shareholders will be solicited for a vote on the Name Change Amendment and this Information Statement is being furnished to shareholders solely to provide them with certain information concerning the Name Change Amendment in accordance with the requirements of the Exchange Act and the regulations promulgated thereunder, including particularly Regulation 14C. In accordance with Regulation 14C, the Name Change Amendment will not be effected prior to the 21st day after this Information Statement is mailed to shareholders of record as of the Record Date.
 
We are a shell company within the meaning of Section 12(b)(2) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”) seeking to acquire an operating business.

Our Business
 
Management has determined that the opportunities in the petrochemical field in Asia have declined in recent years. Management believes the change in our strategic business direction will be more difficult and will take longer to complete any acquisitions and generate future cash flows. Accordingly, we have expanded our business plan to include mergers and acquisitions of non-petrochemical companies in Asia and the United States. Since March 2018, we have been exploring various opportunities within the Agar wood field for the acquisition of companies in Hong Kong and Southeast Asia that are wholesalers of Agar Wood. Management has sought to acquire companies through mergers and acquisitions or in the alternative to acquire the rights to distribute products throughout the Hong Kong and Southeast Asia. 
 
The realization value from any additional services to be offered is largely dependent on factors beyond our control such as the market for our services. We currently have no operations with which to raise cash. Our only source for cash at this time is investments by our current sole officer and director.
 
We originally engaged AF Ocean Investment Management Company (the “Service Provider”), effective June 1, 2014, for access to and use of office space at a location leased by the Service Provider from a third party, for legal services, management and accounting related services including, without limitation, preparing periodic and other reports required to be filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, preparing financial reports, bookkeeping, managing their websites, handling previous employee matters as they should arise, and related governmental filings, handling advertising matters, and processing payables. (collectively, the "Services"). The agreement with the Service Provider was continued for another one year term. We paid the Service Provider a management fee of $1,996 per month, totaling $23,957 for the twelve month ended December 31, 2016.On March 1, 2017, the Board agreed to cancel the management agreement with AF Ocean Investment Management Company (“AF Ocean”) effective April 1, 2017.
 
During the next 12 months, our only foreseeable cash requirements will relate to the payment of our Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) and Exchange Act reporting filing expenses, including associated accounting fees; costs incident to reviewing or investigating any potential business venture; maintaining our good standing as a corporation in our state of organization.
 
Principal Products and Their Markets
 
We currently have no business operations and produce no products or provide any services.
 
Products Distribution Methods
 
We currently have no business operations and produce no products or provide any services.
 
Status of any Publicly Announced New Product or Service
 
We currently have no business operations and produce no products or provide any services.
 
Competitive Business Conditions
 
Management believes that there are literally thousands of shell companies engaged in endeavors similar to those engaged in by the Company; many of these companies have substantial current assets and cash reserves. Competitors also include thousands of other publicly-held companies whose business operations have proven unsuccessful, and whose only viable business opportunity is that of providing a publicly-held vehicle through which a private entity may have access to the public capital markets via a reverse reorganization or merger. There is no reasonable way to predict our competitive position or that of any other entity in these endeavors; however, we, having limited assets and no cash reserves, will no doubt be at a competitive disadvantage in competing with entities that have significant cash resources and have recent operating histories when compared with the lack of any substantive operations by the Company.

Sources and Availability of Raw Materials and Names of Principal Suppliers
 
Because we currently have no business operations and produce no products or provide any services, we do not use any raw materials nor have any suppliers at this time.
 
Dependence on One or a Few Customers
 
Because we currently have no business operations and produce no products or provide any services, we do not have any customers at this time.
 
Patents, Trademarks, Licenses, Franchises, Concessions, Royalty Agreements or Labor Contracts
 
We have not registered the “Horrison Resources Inc.” mark used by our business as a trade name in Florida or any state or the United States Patent and Trademark Office.
Need for Government Approval of Principal Products or Services
 
Because we currently have no business operations and produce no products or provide any services, we are not presently subject to any governmental regulation in this regard.
 
Effect of Existing or Probable Governmental Regulations on the Business
 
Exchange Act Reporting Requirements
 
We are subject to the reporting requirements of Section 13 of the Exchange Act, and the disclosure requirements of Regulation S-K. However, as a “smaller reporting company,” we are permitted to omit certain disclosures or provide less disclosure regarding certain information required to be disclosed under Regulation S-K as compared to companies that are not a “smaller reporting company.”
 
We are required to file Annual Reports on Form 10-K and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q with the SEC on a regular basis, and are required to timely disclose certain material events (e.g., changes in corporate control; acquisitions or dispositions of a significant amount of assets other than in the ordinary course of business; and bankruptcy) in a Current Report on Form 8-K.
 
Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act requires all companies with securities registered pursuant to Section 12(g) of the Exchange Act to comply with the rules and regulations of the SEC regarding proxy solicitations, as outlined in Regulation 14A. Matters submitted to shareholders of the Company at a special or annual meeting thereof or pursuant to a written consent will require the Company to provide the Company’s shareholders with the information outlined in Schedules 14A or 14C of Regulation 14; preliminary copies of this information must be submitted to the SEC at least ten days prior to the date that definitive copies of this information are forwarded to the Company’s shareholders.
 
The costs of preparing and filing annual and quarterly reports, proxy statements and other information with the SEC and furnishing audited reports to shareholders will cause our expenses to be significantly higher than they would be if we were a privately-held company.
 
Sarbanes-Oxley Act
 
We are also subject to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act created a strong and independent accounting oversight board to oversee the conduct of auditors of public companies and strengthen auditor independence. It also requires steps to enhance the direct responsibility of senior members of management for financial reporting and for the quality of financial disclosures made by public companies; establishes clear statutory rules to limit, and to expose to public view, possible conflicts of interest affecting securities analysts; creates guidelines for audit committee members’ appointment, compensation and oversight of the work of public companies’ auditors; management assessment of our internal controls; auditor attestation to management’s conclusions about internal controls (this is not applicable to “non-accelerated filers” and “smaller reporting companies”); prohibits certain insider trading during pension fund blackout periods; requires companies and auditors to evaluate internal controls and procedures; and establishes a federal crime of securities fraud, among other provisions. Compliance with the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act will substantially increase our legal and accounting costs.

Foreign Corrupt Practices Act
 
We are required to comply with the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which prohibits U.S. companies from engaging in bribery or other prohibited payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Foreign companies, including some of our competitors, are not subject to these prohibitions. Corruption, extortion, bribery, pay-offs, theft and other fraudulent practices occur from time-to-time in mainland China. If our competitors engage in these practices, they may receive preferential treatment from personnel of some companies, giving our competitors an advantage in securing business or from government officials who might give them priority in obtaining new licenses, which would put us at a disadvantage. If our employees or other agents are found to have engaged in such practices, we could suffer severe penalties.
State and Local Regulations
 
There’s no state or local regulations that require us to obtain a special business license for our business, however the State of Florida requires us to file an Annual Report. We are not required as a company to maintain Worker’s Compensation Insurance and pay into the Florida Unemployment Compensation Fund since we have no employees. When we retain new officers and begin to pay salaries we will then have to apply for Workers Compensation Insurance and pay into the Florida Unemployment Compensation Fund.
Research and Development During Our Last Two Fiscal Years
 
We did not spend any money on research and development during each of the last two fiscal years.
 
Cost and Effects of Compliance with Environmental Laws
 
Because we currently have no business operations and produce no products or provide any services, we are not subject to environmental laws in any material manner.
Number of Total Employees and Number of Full Time Employees
 
We have no employees.
