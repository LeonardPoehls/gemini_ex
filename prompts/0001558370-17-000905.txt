     Overview
     Cotiviti is a leading provider of analytics-driven payment accuracy solutions, focused primarily on the healthcare sector (88% of 2016 revenue). Our integrated solutions help clients enhance payment accuracy in an increasingly complex healthcare environment. We leverage our robust technology platform, configurable analytics, proprietary information assets and expertise in healthcare reimbursement to help our clients enhance their claims payment accuracy. We help our healthcare clients identify and correct payment inaccuracies, which resulted in approximately $3.3 billion in savings in 2016. We work with over 40 healthcare organizations, including 20 of the 25 largest U.S. commercial, Medicare and Medicaid managed health plans, as well as CMS. We are also a leading provider of payment accuracy solutions to over 35 retail clients (12% of 2016 revenue), including eight of the ten largest retailers in the United States. 
     Timely and accurate healthcare claims processing is critical to the U.S. healthcare system. The administration of healthcare claims is complex and payment inaccuracies can occur for many reasons. Changes in the healthcare industry, such as increasingly complex reimbursement models, increased coding complexity, changing demographics and potential changes to the Affordable Care Act are expected to further increase the need for our solutions. We support healthcare payers in managing the complexities in the claims payment process. Our analytics-driven solutions review claims for accuracy with respect to billing, contract compliance, payment responsibility and clinical appropriateness before and after claims are paid. 
     Cotiviti was formed in May 2014 through the merger of Connolly, a leader in retrospective payment accuracy solutions for the healthcare and retail sectors and iHealth Technologies, a leader in prospective payment accuracy solutions for the healthcare sector. Through the Connolly iHealth Merger, we significantly broadened our suite of payment accuracy solutions, expanded our client base, enhanced our subject matter expertise and positioned ourselves for significant growth opportunities. 
     Our growth strategy for healthcare includes:

· | expand within our existing client base by increasing the volume of claims we review with our solutions; expanding utilization across the depth and breadth of our solutions; and cross-selling our prospective and retrospective solutions;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

· | innovate to improve and develop new solutions to expand the scope of our services; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | pursue opportunistic acquisitions and strategic partnerships in payment accuracy and adjacent markets.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  As a result of the meaningful savings we deliver to our clients, we have increased our client base and strengthened our long-standing relationships with many of the leading healthcare payers in the United States. In 2016, we generated revenue from six new clients and four cross-sell clients which we believe will drive revenue growth in 2017 and beyond. The average length of our relationships with our ten largest healthcare clients is over ten years. We have also substantially increased the annual savings captured by our healthcare clients over time. As a result, we believe our revenue is highly recurring and we have strong visibility into future revenue. 
     We are also a leading provider of payment accuracy solutions to the retail market. Retailers process and validate extremely high volumes of transactions with disparate suppliers on varying terms. We work with retail clients in the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom to realize their negotiated allowances, concessions, rebates and other incentives associated with merchandise procurement, logistics and other service transactions. In 2016, we generated over $500 million in savings for our retail clients.

     Our track record of consistently delivering value for our clients has enabled strong growth in our revenue and profitability, especially within our core healthcare payer client base. For the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, our total revenue was $625.2 million, $541.3 million and $441.4 million, respectively. In these same periods, we generated net income (loss) of $48.9 million, $13.9 million and $(25.8) million, respectively, representing 7.8%, 2.6% and (5.9)% of revenue, respectively, and Adjusted EBITDA of $239.7 million, $203.4 million and $172.2 million, respectively, representing 38.3%, 37.6% and 39.0% of revenue, respectively. For a reconciliation of net income (loss) to Adjusted EBITDA, a measure not calculated in accordance with GAAP, see “Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—How we Assess Our Performance—Adjusted EBITDA.”  
     The Payment Process 
     Timely and accurate healthcare claims processing is critical to the U.S. healthcare system. This process is complicated and involves applying specific codes, policies and contracts, cross-referencing disparate data sources and, in many cases, adhering to regulatory requirements. To ensure prompt and accurate claims reimbursement, payers utilize internal processes and systems and third party solutions to review claims and apply analytics throughout the claims payment process. The following graphic represents the healthcare claims payment process.
    
     After delivering care, a provider initiates the claims payment process by submitting a claim for reimbursement to the patient's health insurance carrier (Step 1). After the insurance carrier (payer) uses internal and external tools to conform the claim to its claims processing system: it validates that the patient is a member; that the services provided were eligible under the member's benefits; and that appropriate prior authorizations were in place. The payer then adjudicates the claim by applying the provider's contract and fee schedule to the claim along with any claim system edits (Step 2). During this adjudication process, the payer uses payment accuracy solutions to perform claim reviews for information discrepancies between the provider's submission and the payer's payment policies. These reviews range in complexity and can be executed by the payer or by third party solutions. After the claim has been adjudicated but before the claim is paid, the payer may utilize the advanced, automated analytical solutions that we provide to review the claim to identify additional discrepancies (Step 3). If the prepayment review identifies a claim inaccuracy, the payer makes the correction and pays the corrected claim (Step 4).
     After payment is made and additional information becomes available, the payer and third party solutions such as Cotiviti's continue to identify, select and evaluate claims for payment accuracy (Step 5). If this retrospective payment

review identifies a payment inaccuracy, the payer makes the correction and recovers overpayments through offsets against future claims or by seeking reimbursement from the provider. 
     Our Solutions 
     We apply our analytics-driven payment accuracy solutions at multiple points across the client's claims processing cycle. Our extensive library of complex payment analytics is designed to identify, select and make recommendations for correct application of contracts and coding to meet client payment policies. Following is a description of our payment accuracy solutions:
     Prospective Claims Accuracy Solutions. Our prospective claims accuracy solutions help our healthcare clients identify and address claim discrepancies immediately following claim adjudication and before a claim is paid to a healthcare provider. We help our clients ensure that claims payments meet regulatory, compliance, industry and health plan requirements based on correct coding and clinical guidelines. We customize, configure and integrate our payment policy algorithms to enhance our clients' claims payment systems and automatically and efficiently review our clients' adjudicated claims. By directly interfacing with our clients' systems, our solutions analyze claims either in real-time or in batch processes. Our algorithms apply our proprietary library of current payment policies including industry, regulatory and medical specialty coding requirements as well as customized health plan rules. We review claims on a transactional as well as longitudinal basis, evaluating against our accumulated claims data, to make accurate payment policy recommendations. We believe that our differentiated content library, configurable algorithms and other post-adjudication software tools provide our clients with a more thorough and client-specific analysis of claims than other claims adjudication systems, creating more value for our clients. In 2016, our prospective claims accuracy solutions analyzed over $75 billion in claims. 
     Retrospective Claims Accuracy Solutions. Our retrospective claims accuracy solutions help health insurers identify and resolve payment inaccuracies after a claim has been paid to a healthcare provider. These solutions utilize sophisticated analytics and data mining tools to identify potential inaccuracies. Our claim analytics include longitudinal reviews of data to identify discrepancies that may span multiple claims and time periods. Our analytics are configurable to our clients' claims payment processes and enable us to prioritize areas of review based on our clients' operational and financial objectives. If expert validation is required, our claims analysts conduct a deeper review of more complex reimbursement issues. In analyzing claims retrospectively, we leverage additional information sources and broader data sets beyond the claims files, many of which only become accessible post-payment. These data and retrospective analytics enable reviews of a variety of payment accuracy categories, including issues relating to coordination of benefits, member eligibility and provider adherence to complex contract conditions. We also can provide clinical chart validation for our clients, in which our certified clinical and coding specialists review the clinical documentation associated with a claim. Clinical chart validation provides our clients with broader payment accuracy reviews beyond claims files analysis, including more complex clinical appropriateness and payment policies. We believe that our combination of retrospective analytics and clinical and coding expertise provides our clients with more thorough and configurable solutions than they are able to develop on their own, leading to increased savings for our clients. In 2016, our retrospective claims accuracy solutions analyzed over $485 billion in claims. 
     Other Services. Beyond our prospective and retrospective claims accuracy solutions, we provide analytics and support to our clients in optimizing their operations and enterprise-wide claims payments and trends. These offerings include selective anti-fraud, waste and abuse analytics to identify abnormal patterns in coding and billing practices. We also provide our clients with ongoing surveillance and longitudinal analytics, by reviewing claims submissions and payments across multiple dimensions, including provider, plan-type, procedure and others. In addition, clients engage us for comprehensive claims history analytics to identify necessary areas for direct interaction, as well as to identify policy and program changes that can improve future payment accuracy.

Billing Accuracy Was the claim coded correctly? Are the code reimbursements consistent with the payer's payment policy? |  Under ICD‑10 coding guidelines, asthma and bronchitis have different codes. However, there is a single code for patients diagnosed with both asthma and bronchitis  Our solutions identify situations where a provider submitted separate claims for simultaneous asthma and bronchitis diagnoses and recommends claim modification and reimbursement to reflect use of a single code |  Reimbursement for many episodes of care is evolving from separate payments for each service to a bundled payment for the full episode and relevant services  For example, bundled payments for surgical procedures should include the surgical procedure and post-operative follow-up visits  Our solutions perform longitudinal claim reviews to determine if an office visit is related to a previous surgical procedure and should be bundled according to our client's policy 
Contract Compliance Is the claim submitted and calculated in accordance with payer / provider contract terms? Is this payment calculated appropriately based on bundles, quality or value-based care? |  Tests and procedures may be conducted under the supervision both of a general practitioner and a specialist (e.g. a radiologist)  Depending on the provider's contract, reimbursement may be covered either under a global payment or separate payments to each provider  Our solutions cross-reference claims from multiple providers to identify circumstances where a combined reimbursement should be applied |  Increasingly, payers participate in value-based reimbursement arrangements with strategic provider networks  These contractual arrangements are complex and it can be difficult to determine coverage and capitated or fee-for-service reimbursement terms  Our solutions assess claims submissions and support our clients in administering the appropriate contracted liability, coverage and payments terms with the provider network 
Payment Responsibility Does the client have responsibility for this claim? Does any other party share in the liability? |  Many employer-sponsored benefit plans stipulate that Medicare is the primary payer for beneficiaries who are at least 65 years of age  In such instances, our solutions identify the appropriate payer and we support our clients in working with the provider to bill Medicare |  If both of the dependent's parents are insured by separate health plans, the health plan of the parent whose birthday comes first in the calendar year is designated as the primary insurer  Our solutions determine the health plan liable for dependent claims and support our clients in remedying the inaccurate billing

Clinical Appropriateness Was care delivered in accordance with industry association and payer guidelines? Does chart documentation support treatment and claim submission? |  The initial symptoms for Acute Renal Failure and Dehydration are very similar and may result in incorrect coding  The level of care, tests and procedures required to treat Acute Renal Failure are significantly higher than for Dehydration  Our solutions and clinical experts identify claims in which treatment details in the medical chart do not support a diagnosis of Acute Renal Failure and, where appropriate, recommend chart edits and revised payment levels to reflect a Dehydration diagnosis |  Many of our health plan clients elect to administer the ABIM Foundation's Choosing Wisely® guidelines to reduce unnecessary tests and procedures  For example, electrocardiograms are measurements of heart activity that are recommended for patients with heart disease but have minimal usefulness for healthy patients  When our clients elect to follow the Choosing Wisely® guidelines in setting policy, we support them in identifying claims that are not deemed clinically appropriate 

      Healthcare Industry Overview
     The market for payment accuracy solutions is large and growing, driven by increasing healthcare costs and payment complexities. From 2004 to 2014, healthcare costs in the United States grew at a 4.8% compounded annual growth rate to $3.0 trillion and increased 5.8% in 2015 to $3.2 trillion. According to CMS, healthcare costs are expected to continue to grow at an average annual rate of 5.6% through 2025. The introduction of new reimbursement models, the increase in coding complexity and the shift to managed care plans within government healthcare are expected to further increase the complexity of healthcare payments.

 We believe that there is substantial opportunity for continued growth in the payment accuracy solutions market. We estimate that there was over $900 billion in unnecessary or wasteful spending in the U.S. healthcare system in 2016. The U.S. federal government estimates that inaccurate provider claim submissions totaled between 3% and 10% of annual healthcare spend and we estimate that there were approximately $170 billion of inaccurate provider claim submissions in 2016. Healthcare payers will continue to invest in payment accuracy solutions in an effort to identify and resolve these inaccurate billings. We estimate that the relevant savings opportunity addressable by our current payment accuracy solutions is approximately $35 billion, for a total addressable market of approximately $5.0 billion. Of this addressable market, approximately 75% of the opportunity is within our existing client base and the balance is new client prospects across the 100 largest health plans.

     The principal drivers of growth in the payment accuracy solutions market are as follows:
    
· | Increasingly complex reimbursement models. We believe that reimbursement models will continue to become more complex as healthcare payers accommodate new markets and new lines of business. A broader focus on value-based reimbursement and consumer engagement programs, which are designed to reduce costs and improve patient outcomes, adds an additional layer of complexity as payments are migrated from a fee-for-service basis to value-based and risk sharing models. As a result, healthcare payers must reconcile additional data sources, contracts with multiple provider networks and longitudinal episodes of care over time, driving demand for payment accuracy solutions.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Increased coding complexity. Advancements in medical technology, procedures and medications have resulted in an increasing number of testing and treatment options for providers to utilize. Scientific advancements also have led to an increase in the discovery of treatable or curable diseases. As the acceleration of medical science continues, the way in which health claims are processed is evolving to keep pace. For example, ICD‑10, the 10th revision of the International Classification of Disease and Related Health Problems, contains diagnosis codes which are used for reimbursement. With the adoption of ICD‑10 in October 2015, the total number of diagnosis codes has increased nearly five times to approximately 68,000, resulting in significantly greater coding complexity and an increasing need for payment accuracy review.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Changing demographics. An aging and sicker population is driving rising healthcare costs, increased utilization of prescription drugs and increased co-morbidities within patient populations. As the population
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ages, the number of higher-cost Medicare beneficiaries has increased from 41.5 million in 2005 to 54.3 million in 2015 and is estimated to grow to 72.0 million in 2025. As a result of both high and growing costs, healthcare insurers, the federal government and each of the state governments are under pressure to reduce costs while improving access to care and the quality of patient outcomes, creating a greater demand for highly efficient payment review solutions.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Shift to managed care plans within government healthcare. Individuals who receive government sponsored healthcare are transitioning from direct fee-for-service coverage to managed care network models through Medicare Advantage and managed Medicaid plans. The percentage of Medicare eligible patients enrolled in a Medicare Advantage plan has steadily increased from 22% in 2008 to 34% as of December 2016. Additionally, many state-administered Medicaid programs are alleviating budget constraints by contracting with private health insurers to manage a growing number of Medicaid eligible enrollees. The shift to managed care networks and increase in individuals covered by private health insurers increases the opportunity for commercially focused payment accuracy solutions such as ours.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Consolidation of managed care companies. Managed care providers are going through a period of consolidation driven by regulatory and competitive dynamics. Larger plans have historically been strong adopters of payment accuracy solutions. With a client base including over 40 healthcare organizations, including 20 of the 25 largest U.S. commercial, Medicare and Medicaid managed health plans, we believe we are well positioned to benefit from managed care consolidation.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

      We believe we are well positioned to benefit from these trends.

      Our Growth Strategies
     We believe we are well positioned to benefit from the expected growth in claims processing complexity and healthcare spend, which we expect will drive continued demand for payment accuracy solutions among healthcare payers. Our strategies for achieving growth include:
     Expand within our existing client base. We have significant opportunities to expand our business within our existing client base through the following strategies:
    
· | Increase the volume of claims reviewed by our solutions. When our clients initially implement our solutions, they typically start by having us review a subset of their claims. As we demonstrate success and deliver value, our clients often increase the volume of claims we review. We have significant opportunities to evaluate additional claim types, plan types, geographic regions and/or provider settings.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Expand the utilization of our solutions. When our clients initially implement our solutions, they typically start with a subset of our algorithms and analytical tools. As we demonstrate success and deliver value, our clients often expand the utilization of our algorithms and analytical tools. The opportunity to expand the utilization of our solutions is significant.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Cross-sell between prospective and retrospective solutions. We believe we have a significant opportunity to further cross-sell our solutions to existing clients as we have cross-sell opportunities across more than half of our healthcare client base. We continue to actively engage with existing clients to cross-sell our solutions. In 2016, we generated revenue from four successful cross-sells with existing clients.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     Expand our client base. There is a significant opportunity to increase our client base of healthcare payers by targeting new relationships. The top 100 healthcare payers that are not our existing clients made approximately $240 billion in payments in 2016. We are pursuing these healthcare payers as potential new clients by leveraging our proven value proposition, leadership position, track record of performance and the strong references provided by our diversified client base of leading health plans. The addition of new clients creates revenue growth opportunities for future periods. In 2016, we generated revenue from six new healthcare clients.
     Continue to innovate. We plan to enhance our existing solutions by developing new concepts and analytical algorithms and improving our information assets to allow us to expand our value creation for our clients. We also plan to continue to improve our processes and upgrade our technology infrastructure to improve the efficiency with which we deliver our solutions. Additionally, we will continue to monitor the evolution of the healthcare environment and develop new solutions in anticipation of increasing complexity in reimbursement models to supplement our core payment accuracy solutions.
     Selectively pursue acquisitions and strategic partnerships. We plan to selectively pursue acquisitions and strategic partnerships to (i) accelerate the pace of innovation and expansion of our core solutions, (ii) provide cross-sell opportunities, (iii) offer complementary data, technologies or industry expertise to our existing analytics-driven payment accuracy solutions or (iv) expand our addressable market beyond payment accuracy to address other dimensions of healthcare waste, potentially including missed prevention opportunities, inefficiently delivered services, excessive administrative costs and unnecessary services. We have a successful track record of identifying, acquiring and integrating high-quality solutions providers that complement and enhance the value of our existing solutions.
     Retail Payment Accuracy Solutions
     We are a leading provider of payment accuracy solutions to retailers in the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom, with over 35 years of experience. We serve over 35 retail clients, including eight of the ten largest retailers in the United States. Our relationships with these clients tend to be long-term, with an average tenure of more than ten years.
     The retail industry faces significant cost containment challenges as retailers process and validate extremely high volumes of transactions with disparate suppliers on varying terms. The retail payment accuracy market continues to grow in complexity due to shifts in consumer spending habits, such as the increasing adoption of internet-based shopping, as well as newer pricing strategies, such as dynamic pricing and promotional activities.
     We provide value to retailers by helping them identify and recover payments to suppliers of goods and services that are inconsistent with contractual or agreed upon terms. We use automated analytics capabilities and experienced teams to review supplier agreements, invoices, purchase orders, promotions and other transactions and identify discrepancies in merchandise procurement, logistics and other services transactions. In 2016, we generated over $500 million in savings for our retail clients.
     Seasonality
     Historically, there has been a seasonal pattern to our healthcare revenue with the revenues in the first quarter generally lower than the other quarters and revenues in the fourth quarter generally being higher than the other quarters. Accordingly, the comparison of revenue from quarter to quarter may fluctuate and is dependent on various factors, including, but not limited to, reset of member liability, timing of special projects and timing of inaccurate payments being prevented or recovered as well as the aforementioned seasonal considerations. Consequently, you should not rely on our revenue for any one quarter as an indication of our future performance.     Sales and Marketing
     Our sales and marketing activities are focused on increasing the scope of claims reviewed by our solutions, cross-selling our solutions to our existing clients and generating new clients. Our sales and client services professionals sell our solutions directly to clients and manage our ongoing client relationships. Marketing activities for our healthcare and retail solutions include targeted direct marketing, advertising, tradeshow participation, workshops, web-based marketing activities, e-newsletters and customer and industry conferences.

     A majority of our business is directly or indirectly related to the healthcare industry and is affected by changes in the healthcare industry, including political, legislative and regulatory changes and fluctuations in healthcare spending. Participants in the healthcare industry, including our clients, are required to comply with extensive and complex federal and state laws and regulations including fraud and abuse, false claims, anti-kickback and privacy and security laws and regulations. Although many of the regulatory and governmental requirements do not directly apply to our operations, many of our clients are required to comply with these requirements, which may impact our business and the demand for our services and solutions. Many of the laws and regulations, including federal and state false claims laws that affect us as a result of some of our services and solutions, are complex and may be subject to varying interpretations by courts and other governmental authorities. Our failure to comply with any applicable laws and regulations could result in restrictions on our ability to provide certain services and solutions, as well as the possible imposition of civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines and exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs.     The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act 
     In the United States, federal and state legislatures and agencies periodically consider healthcare reform measures that may contain proposals to increase governmental involvement in healthcare, lower reimbursement rates or otherwise change the environment in which healthcare industry participants operate. Our business could be affected by changes in healthcare laws including the Affordable Care Act, which was signed into law in March 2010 and is currently under consideration for repeal or restructuring by the current administration. The Affordable Care Act has changed how healthcare services are covered, delivered and reimbursed through expanded coverage of uninsured individuals, reduced Medicare program spending and insurance market reforms. The Affordable Care Act has created major changes in how healthcare is delivered and reimbursed and generally increased access to health insurance benefits to the uninsured and

underinsured population of the United States. Among other things, the Affordable Care Act has increased the number of individuals with Medicaid and private insurance coverage, implemented reimbursement policies that tie payment to quality, facilitated the creation of accountable care organizations that may use capitation and other alternative payment methodologies, strengthened enforcement of fraud and abuse laws and encouraged the use of information technology.
     While many of the provisions of Affordable Care Act will not be directly applicable to us, the Affordable Care Act, as enacted, will affect the business of our healthcare clients and also will affect the Medicaid programs of the states with which we have contracts, which may in turn affect our business. Many of the changes promulgated by the Affordable Care Act require implementing regulations which have not yet been drafted or have been released only as proposed rules. Until the Affordable Care Act is fully implemented, or there is more certainty concerning the future of the Affordable Care Act, it will be difficult to predict its full impact and influence on the healthcare industry.
     Additionally, the Affordable Care Act has been subject to a number of challenges to its constitutionality. On June 28, 2012, the United States Supreme Court upheld challenges to the constitutionality of the “individual mandate” provision of the Affordable Care Act, which generally requires all individuals to purchase healthcare insurance or pay a penalty, but struck down as unconstitutional the provision that would have allowed the federal government to revoke all federal Medicaid funding to any state that did not expand its Medicaid program. As a result, many states have refused to extend Medicaid eligibility. On June 25, 2015, the United States Supreme Court upheld the legality of premium subsidies made available by the federal government to individuals residing in the 36 states that have federally-run health insurance exchanges. The subsidies are provided to low-income individuals to assist with the cost of purchasing health insurance through federally-run health insurance exchanges. Other legal challenges to the Affordable Care Act are pending. On January 12, 2017, Congress voted in favor of a budget resolution to produce legislation that, if passed, would repeal certain aspects of the Affordable Care Act. Congress is also considering subsequent legislation to replace or repeal elements of or all of the Affordable Care Act. In addition, there have been recent public announcements by members of Congress and the new presidential administration regarding potential plans to repeal and replace all or a portion of the Affordable Care Act. As a result, it is difficult to predict the impact the Affordable Care Act will have on our business given the threats to and uncertainty surrounding the Affordable Care Act.
     HIPAA and other Health Information Laws
     A significant portion of our business is regulated by HIPAA. Among other things, HIPAA requires business associates and covered entities to comply with certain privacy and security requirements relating to PHI and PII and mandates the way certain types of healthcare services are coded and processed. We frequently act as a business associate to our covered entity clients and, as a result, collect, use, disclose and maintain PHI and PII of individuals, as well as other financial, confidential and proprietary information belonging to our clients and certain third parties from whom we obtain information (e.g., private insurance companies, financial institutions). HIPAA and other state, industry and international laws and regulations require us to establish and maintain reasonable and appropriate administrative, technical and physical safeguards to ensure the integrity, confidentiality and availability of electronic protected health information, which also includes information about the payment for healthcare services. The laws and rules promulgated by these acts are changed frequently by legislation, regulatory issuances and/or administrative interpretation. For instance, in January 2013, HHS issued the Omnibus Final Rule modifying and supplementing many of the standards and regulations under HIPAA. The Omnibus Final Rule significantly lowered the disclosure standards required for notifications of breaches in patient privacy and expanded the universe of available liability under certain of HIPAA's requirements, including expanding direct liability for HIPAA's requirements to companies such as ours, which act as business associates to covered entities.
     HIPAA establishes privacy and security standards that limit the use and disclosure of PHI and require the implementation of administrative, physical and technical safeguards to ensure the confidentiality, integrity and availability of individually identifiable health information in electronic form, as well as breach notification procedures for breaches of PHI and penalties for violation of HIPAA's requirements for entities subject to its regulation. Violations of HIPAA's requirements may result in civil and criminal penalties. Civil penalties may be up to $50,000 per violation with a maximum civil penalty of $1.5 million in a calendar year for violations of the same requirement. However, a single breach incident can result in violations of multiple requirements, resulting in possible penalties well in excess of $1.5 million. In addition, the Federal Civil Penalties Inflation Adjustment Improvements Act of 2015 required all federal agencies to adjust their civil monetary penalties to inflation, no later than August 1, 2016. As a result, the maximum annual penalties for each HIPAA violation which occurs later than February 17, 2009, are now $1.7 million. Recent enforcement actions by HHS for HIPAA violations have imposed penalties of up to $5.6 million. State attorneys general

also have the right to prosecute HIPAA violations committed against residents of their states. While HIPAA does not create a private right of action that would allow individuals to sue in civil court for HIPAA violations, its standards have been used as the basis for the duty of care in state civil suits, such as those for negligence or recklessness in misusing individuals' health information. HHS is currently conducting audits to assess HIPAA compliance efforts by covered entities and business associates and is authorized to establish a permanent program for the future.
     In addition to HIPAA, numerous other federal and state laws govern the collection, maintenance, protection, use, transmission, disclosure and disposal of PHI and PII and these laws can be more restrictive than HIPAA, which means that entities subject to them must comply with the more restrictive state law in addition to complying with HIPAA. Not only may some of these state laws impose fines and penalties upon violators, but some, unlike HIPAA, may also afford private rights of action to individuals who believe their personal information has been misused. State laws are changing rapidly, and there is discussion of a new federal privacy law or federal breach notification law. Further, the United States Congress and a number of states have considered or are considering additional prohibitions or limitations on the disclosure of medical or other information to individuals or entities located outside of the United States.
     Healthcare Administrative Simplification
     HIPAA mandates a package of interlocking administrative simplification rules to establish standards and requirements for the electronic transmission of certain healthcare claims and payment transactions, to encourage electronic commerce in the healthcare industry. The standard transaction regulations established under HIPAA mandate certain format and data content standards for the most common electronic healthcare transactions, using technical standards promulgated by recognized standards publishing organizations.
     In January 2009, CMS published a final rule adopting updated standard code sets for diagnoses and procedures known as the ICD-10 code sets, which contain significantly more diagnostic and procedural codes than the existing ICD-9 coding system. All Medicare claims with a date of service after October 1, 2015, must contain the new ICD-10 codes. As a result, we have adapted our solutions to the new coding system.
     Reductions in Government Healthcare Spending
     In recent years, legislative and regulatory changes have limited, and in some cases reduced, the levels of payment that healthcare payers receive for various services under the Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs. In some cases, healthcare payers base their payment rates on Medicare policy, and therefore, adjustments that negatively impact Medicare payments also may negatively impact payments received by healthcare providers from other payers. The Affordable Care Act provides for significant federal healthcare program spending reductions, including reductions in Medicare payments to most healthcare providers and Medicare Advantage plans. In addition to reductions required by the Affordable Care Act, the Budget Control Act of 2011 requires automatic spending reductions of $1.2 trillion for federal fiscal years 2013 through 2021, minus any deficit reductions enacted by Congress and debt service costs. Under the Budget Control Act, the percentage reduction for most Medicare programs may not be more than 2% for a fiscal year, with a uniform percentage reduction across those Medicare programs. Due to subsequent legislation, the reductions have been extended through 2025. The Medicaid program, however, is not included in the reductions. Federal healthcare program spending continues to be a “hot-button” issue in the United States and the federal government continues to consider deficit reduction measures and other changes to government healthcare programs, including a possible repeal or restructuring of the Affordable Care Act.     Employees
     As of the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016, we had approximately 3,000 employees. None of our employees are represented by labor unions. We have not experienced any work stoppages and we consider our relationship with our employees to be good.
