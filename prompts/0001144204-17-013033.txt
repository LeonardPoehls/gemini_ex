Item 1. Business
THE COMPANY
 
Overview
 
Loral Space & Communications Inc., together with its subsidiaries (“Loral,” the “Company,” “we,” “our” and “us”), is a leading satellite communications company engaged, through our ownership interests in affiliates, in satellite-based communications services.
Satellite Services
 
Loral has one operating segment consisting of satellite-based communications services.
 
Loral participates in satellite services operations through its 62.7% economic interest in Telesat Canada (“Telesat”), a leading global fixed satellite services operator, with offices and facilities around the world. Effective January 1, 2017, Telesat Holdings Inc. completed a corporate reorganization pursuant to which Telesat Holdings Inc. amalgamated with Telesat Interco Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary, and immediately thereafter the newly amalgamated company amalgamated with Telesat Canada. The continuing entity, existing under the laws of Canada, is named Telesat Canada.
 
Telesat owns and leases a satellite fleet that operates in geosynchronous earth orbit approximately 22,000 miles above the equator. In this orbit, satellites remain in a fixed position relative to points on the earth’s surface and provide reliable, high-bandwidth services anywhere in their coverage areas, serving as the backbone for many forms of telecommunications. Telesat is also developing a global constellation of low earth orbit (“LEO”) satellites. LEO satellites operate in a circular orbit around the earth with an altitude typically between 500 and 870 miles. Unlike geosynchronous satellites that operate in a fixed orbital location above the equator, LEO satellites travel around the earth at high velocities requiring antennas on the ground to track their movement. LEO satellite systems have the potential to offer a number of advantages over geosynchronous orbit satellites to meet growing requirements for broadband services, both consumer and commercial, by providing increased data speeds and capacity, global coverage, and latency on par with or potentially better than terrestrial services.
 
At December 31, 2016, Telesat provided satellite services to customers from its fleet of 15 in-orbit geostationary satellites. In addition, Telesat owns the Canadian Ka-band payload on the ViaSat-1 satellite, has two other geostationary satellites under construction and has an additional two prototype Ka-band satellites under construction, which will be deployed in low earth orbit. Telesat also manages the operations of additional satellites for third parties.
 
Telesat provides video distribution and direct-to-home (“DTH”) video, as well as end-to-end communications services using both satellite and hybrid satellite-ground networks.
 
Our economic interest decreased from 62.8% to 62.7% in March 2016 when certain Telesat employees exercised share appreciation rights related to a total of 178,642 stock options granted under Telesat’s share-based compensation plan and received 129,400 non-voting participating preferred shares.
 
Telesat Services
 
Telesat earns the majority of its revenues by providing satellite-based services to customers, who use these services for their own communications requirements or to provide services to customers further down the distribution chain for video and data services. Telesat also earns revenue by providing ground-based transmit and receive services, selling equipment, installing, managing and maintaining satellite networks, and providing consulting services in the field of satellite communications. Telesat categorizes its revenues into: Broadcast, Enterprise, and Consulting and Other.
Broadcast
 
Telesat’s broadcast services business provided approximately 52% of its revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016. These services include:

-

DTH: Both Canadian DTH service providers (Bell TV and Shaw Direct) use Telesat’s satellites as a distribution platform for their services, delivering television programming, audio and information channels directly to customers’ homes. In addition, Telesat’s satellites are used by EchoStar/DISH Network for DTH services in the United States.
 
Video distribution and contribution: Major broadcasters, cable networks and DTH service providers use Telesat satellites for the full-time transmission of television programming. Additionally, Telesat provides certain broadcasters and DTH service providers bundled value-added services that include satellite capacity, digital encoding of video channels, authorization services and uplinking and downlinking services to and from Telesat satellites and earth station facilities.
 
Occasional use services: Occasional use services consist of satellite transmission services for the timely broadcast of video news, sports and live event coverage on a short-term basis enabling broadcasters to conduct on-the-scene transmissions using small, portable antennas.
 
Enterprise
 
Telesat’s enterprise services provided approximately 45% of its revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016. These services include:
 
Telecommunication carrier and integrator services: Telesat provides satellite capacity and end-to-end services for data and voice transmission to telecommunications carriers and integrators located throughout the world. These services include space segment services and terrestrial facilities for broadband, internet backhaul, cellular backhaul and services such as rural telephony to telecommunications carriers and network services integrators around the world.
 
Government services: The United States government is the largest single consumer of fixed satellite services in the world and a user of Telesat’s international satellites. Telesat provides services to the United States government through government service integrators, rather than directly to United States government agencies. Telesat is also a significant provider of satellite services to the Canadian government.
 
Consumer broadband services: Telesat provides Ka-band satellite capacity to customers in Canada, particularly to Xplornet Communications Inc., which uses it to provide two-way broadband internet services. Telesat also provides Ka-band satellite capacity to ViaSat which uses it to provide similar services in the United States.
 
Resource services: Telesat provides communications services to geographically diverse locations, both on and off shore, for the oil and gas and mining industries.
 
Maritime and aeronautical services: Telesat is increasingly providing satellite capacity to customers serving the growing maritime and aeronautical markets bringing broadband communications services to commercial airplanes and vessels.
 
Retail services: Telesat operates VSAT and hybrid VSAT/terrestrial networks in Canada providing end-to-end services including installation and maintenance of the end user terminal, maintenance of the VSAT hub and provision of satellite capacity. These networks include the support of point-of-sale and other applications at thousands of retail petroleum sites.
 
Satellite operator services: Telesat provides services to other satellite operators in the form of partial channel satellite capacity, full transponder satellite capacity and, on occasion, the relocation and use of an entire satellite at a designated orbital location.
 
Consulting and Other
 
Telesat’s consulting and other category provided approximately 3% of its revenues for the year ended December 31, 2016. Telesat’s consulting operations allow it to realize operating efficiencies by leveraging Telesat’s existing employees and the facility base dedicated to its core satellite communication business. With over 45 years of engineering and technical experience, Telesat is a leading consultant in establishing, operating and upgrading satellite systems worldwide.

Competitive Strengths
 
Telesat’s business is characterized by the following key competitive strengths:
 
Leading Global FSS Operator
 
Telesat is one of the world’s leading FSS operators and the largest in Canada. It has a leading position as a provider of satellite services in the North American video distribution market. Telesat provides services to both of the major DTH providers in Canada, Bell TV and Shaw Direct, which together have approximately 2.2 million subscribers, as well as to EchoStar (DISH Network) in the United States, which has approximately 13.6 million subscribers. Its international satellites are well positioned to serve a number of growing markets and serve a range of important customers in those markets.
Blue Chip Customer Base
 
Telesat offers its broad suite of satellite services to more than 400 customers worldwide, which include some of the world’s leading television broadcasters, cable programmers, DTH service providers, ISPs, network services integrators, telecommunications carriers, corporations and government agencies. Over 45 years of operation, Telesat has established long-term, collaborative relationships with its customers and has developed a reputation for creating innovative solutions and providing services essential for its customers to reach their end users. Telesat’s customers represent some of the strongest and most financially stable companies in their respective industries. These customers have historically committed to long-term contracts for Telesat’s services, which enhances the predictability of its future revenues and cash flows and supports its future growth.
Large Contracted Backlog and Young Satellite Fleet Underpin Anticipated Growth and High Revenue Visibility
 
Historically, Telesat has been able to generate strong cash flows from its operating activities due to the high operating margins in the satellite industry and its disciplined control of expenses. The stability of Telesat’s cash flows is underpinned by its large revenue backlog. Telesat has been able to generate significant backlog by entering into long-term contracts with its customers, in some cases for all or substantially all of a satellite’s orbital maneuver life. In addition to this backlog, Telesat has historically experienced a high proportion of contract renewals. Together, these two factors have produced ongoing, stable cash flows.
 
Many of Telesat’s satellites are relatively new and will not need to be replaced for a significant period of time which defers replacement capital expenditures.
 
Portfolio of Orbital Real Estate
 
Telesat’s satellites occupy highly attractive orbital locations that provide it with an advantageous position in the markets in which it operates due to the scarcity of available satellite spectrum and the strong neighborhoods Telesat has developed at these locations. Access to these orbital locations, coupled with the high capital intensity of the satellite industry, creates barriers to entry in those markets. Telesat is licensed by the Department of Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada (“ISED”) (formerly Industry Canada) to occupy a number of key orbital positions that are well-suited to serve the Americas and support its leading position in North America. Telesat’s international satellites also occupy highly desirable orbital locations that enable broad pan-regional service with interconnectivity between regions, making them attractive for both intra- and inter-regional services. Telesat has rights to additional spectrum, including Ka-band and reverse DBS band at certain existing orbital locations, as well as rights to use Ka-band to operate a global LEO satellite constellation.
Global Operations Provide Revenue Diversification and Economies of Scale
 
The combination of Telesat’s North American broadcast and enterprise services businesses and Telesat’s international business offers diversity in terms of both the customers and regions served as well as the services provided.
 
Moreover, as the operator of a fleet of 15 satellites plus multiple other satellites for third parties, Telesat has attained meaningful scale to allow it to leverage its relatively fixed cost base to achieve substantial operating margins.

Business Strategy
 
Telesat’s commitment to providing strong customer service and its focus on innovation and technical expertise has allowed it to successfully build its business to date. Building on its existing contractual revenue backlog, Telesat will continue to focus on increasing the utilization of its existing satellite capacity, maintaining its operating efficiency and, in a disciplined manner, using its strong cash flow to grow in-orbit satellite capacity and strengthen its business.
 
Telesat believes its satellite fleet offers a strong combination of existing backlog and additional capacity on its existing satellites and planned satellites that provide a solid foundation upon which it will seek to continue to grow its revenue and cash flows. To achieve this growth, Telesat will seek to capture the anticipated increased demand for satellite services and capacity, (i) in the broadcast services market, from broadcast video applications, including DTH services, HDTV, Ultra HD and expansion in the number of channels and (ii) in the enterprise services market, from requirements such as maritime and aeronautical broadband, government services and supporting carrier and enterprise networks.
 
Telesat will continue to focus on capturing the anticipated increase in worldwide demand for satellite services through a disciplined satellite expansion program that should drive incremental contracted backlog and cash flows, and further leverage its fixed cost structure.
 
Telstar 18 VANTAGE, a powerful, state-of-the-art, multi-mission satellite currently under construction, will replace Telstar 18 at 138° EL. This new satellite will bring replacement and expansion capacity to this orbital location utilizing high throughput and broad beam capacity. The satellite will offer a high degree of flexibility with coverage of China, Mongolia, Indochina, Indonesia, Australia, New Zealand and the Pacific Ocean. Telesat’s long-standing partner at the 138° EL location, APT, will use 57.5% of the satellite’s capacity in exchange for providing 57.5% of the capital for the satellite program.
 
Telstar 19 VANTAGE, a powerful, multi-mission, high throughput Ku-band and Ka-band satellite currently under construction, will bring additional capacity to the 63° WL orbital location where Telesat operates its Telstar 14R/Estrela do Sul 2 satellite. The satellite will offer a high degree of flexibility with coverage of Brazil, the Andean region, the Caribbean, the North Atlantic Ocean and Northern Canada. Hughes Network Systems LLC has entered into a long-term contract for all of the high throughput Ka-band capacity on Telstar 19 VANTAGE serving South America.
 
The satellite industry is characterized by a relatively fixed cost base that allows significant revenue growth with relatively minimal increases in operating costs, particularly for the provision of services using only satellite capacity. Thus, Telesat anticipates that the relatively fixed cost nature of its business, combined with increasing demand for satellite services, will over time produce growth in its operating cash flows. To further enhance liquidity, Telesat has a $200 million revolving credit facility in place that can be used for general corporate purposes including working capital and capital expenditures of which, other than $0.1 million of outstanding letters of credit, no amount was drawn as of December 31, 2016.
 
Competition
 
Telesat is a leading global FSS operator in a highly competitive industry, and Telesat competes against other global, regional and national satellite operators and with providers of terrestrial-based communications services.
Fixed Satellite Operators
 
Other global satellite operators are Intelsat S.A. (‘‘Intelsat’’), SES S.A. (‘‘SES’’), Eutelsat S.A. (“Eutelsat”) and Inmarsat. Telesat also competes with a number of nationally or regionally focused FSS operators around the world.
 
Intelsat, SES and Eutelsat are each substantially larger than Telesat in terms of both the number of satellites they have in-orbit as well as their revenues. Telesat believes that Intelsat and its subsidiaries and SES and its subsidiaries each have global fleets of over 50 satellites, and that Eutelsat and its subsidiaries have a fleet of almost 40 satellites. Due to their larger sizes, these operators may be able to take advantage of greater economies of scale, may be more attractive to customers, and may (depending on the specific satellite and orbital location in question) have greater flexibility to restore service to their customers in the event of a partial or total satellite failure. In addition, their larger sizes may enable them to devote more resources, both human and financial, to sales, operations, product development and strategic alliances and acquisitions.

Regional and domestic providers: Telesat also competes against regional FSS operators, including:
 

• | in North America: Ciel, ViaSat, HNS/EchoStar, Hispasat and Arsat;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------


• | in Europe, Middle East, Africa: Avanti, Arabsat, Es’hailsat, Nilesat, Gazprom, Hellas Sat, RSCC, Yahsat, Turksat and Spacecom;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | in Asia: AsiaSat, Measat, Thaicom, APT, PT Telkom, Optus, SKY Perfect JSAT and Asia Broadcast Satellite; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | in Latin America: Star One, Arsat and Hispamar.
--+------------------------------------------------

 
A number of other countries have domestic satellite systems against which Telesat competes in those markets.
 
The Canadian government opened Canadian satellite markets to foreign satellite operators as part of its 1998 World Trade Organization commitments to liberalize trade in basic telecommunications services. As of January 2017, approximately 80 non-Canadian FSS satellites are listed as having been approved for use in Canada. Three of these are Telesat satellites licensed by other administrations and one is a satellite on which Telesat owns the Canadian-coverage capacity.
 
In addition, the FSS and the Mobile Satellite Services (‘‘MSS’’) sectors, which have historically served distinct customer requirements, are converging. As a result, Telesat faces competition from MSS operators that include Inmarsat, which recently began offering a high throughput Ka-band service using a global constellation of three geostationary satellites. The growth in satellite service providers using or planning to use Ka-band, including Avanti Communications, SES/O3b, ViaSat/WildBlue, Eutelsat, HNS/Echostar, Inmarsat, SES, Yahsat and others, will result in increased competition.
 
Over the past two years, a number of global LEO satellite systems have been announced and are now in various stages of development.
 
Many of the new and replacement satellites expected to be deployed in the near term will be high throughput satellites (“HTS”) or will include high throughput payloads. This includes Intelsat’s ‘‘Epic’’ satellites, the first two of which were launched in 2016. In addition, second generation HTS systems now in development purport to be capable of throughput that substantially exceeds the throughput of first generation HTS. This may result in a significant increase in satellite capacity which may further increase competition.
 
Terrestrial Service Providers
 
Providers of terrestrial-based communications services compete with satellite operators. Increasingly, in developed and developing countries alike, governments are providing funding and other incentives to encourage the expansion of terrestrial networks resulting in increased competition for satellite operators.
Consulting Services
 
The market for satellite consulting services is generally comprised of a few companies qualified to provide advice to governments, satellite operators, spacecraft manufacturers and other industry participants on a range of technical and commercial matters related to satellite communications and earth observation. Telesat’s competitors are primarily United States and European-based companies.
Satellite Fleet & Ground Resources
 
As of December 31, 2016, Telesat had 15 in-orbit satellites. In addition, Telesat owns the Canadian Ka-band payload on the ViaSat-1 satellite.
 
Telesat operates an extensive ground infrastructure including a satellite control center (“SCC”) in Ottawa, Ontario, its main earth station and backup SCC at Allan Park, Ontario, nine earth stations throughout Canada, one teleport located in the United States and one in Brazil and its telemetry tracking and control facility in Perth, Australia. These ground facilities are used for controlling Telesat’s satellites and for the provision of end-to-end services to Telesat’s customers.

Telesat’s North American focused fleet is comprised of eight satellites (Anik F1R, Anik F2, Anik F3, Nimiq 1, Nimiq 2, Nimiq 4, Nimiq 5 and Nimiq 6), plus the Canadian beams on ViaSat-1. Telesat’s international fleet is comprised of six satellites (Anik F1, Telstar 11N, Telstar 12, Telstar 12 VANTAGE, Telstar 14R/Estrela do Sul 2 and Telstar 18). Telesat’s Anik G1 satellite provides service for both North and South America.

(1) | Telesat’s current estimate of when each satellite will be decommissioned, taking account of anomalies and malfunctions the satellites have experienced to date and other factors such as remaining fuel levels, consumption rates and other available engineering data. These estimates are subject to change and it is possible that the actual orbital maneuver life of any of these satellites will be shorter than Telesat currently anticipates. Further, it is anticipated that the payload capacity of each satellite may be reduced prior to the estimated end of orbital maneuver life. For example, Telesat currently anticipates that it will need to commence the turndown of transponders on Anik F1 prior to the end of orbital maneuver life, as a result of further degradation in available power.

(3) | 54% of the transponders on the satellite are leased to APT (the “APT transponders”), through the end of life of the satellite in consideration for APT’s funding a portion of the satellite’s cost. This transaction was accounted for as a sales-type lease, because substantially all of the benefits and risks incident to the ownership of the leased transponders were transferred to APT. Telesat has agreed with APT among other things that if Telesat is able to obtain the necessary approvals and licenses from the U.S. government under U.S. export laws, it would transfer title to the APT transponders on Telstar 18 to APT, as well as a corresponding interest in the elements on the satellite that are common to or shared by the APT transponders and the Telesat transponders. Telesat acquired two transponders from APT for an additional payment in August 2009.

----+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(5) | End of Orbital Maneuver Life for these satellites has been extended through inclined orbit operations which reduces fuel consumption through the elimination of north-south stationkeeping.
----+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(6) | The End of Orbital Maneuver Life for Telstar 18 is expected to be extended through inclined orbit operations to 2028.
----+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
In addition, Telesat has rights to satellite capacity on other satellites including the Ka-band Canadian payload consisting of nine user beams on ViaSat-1.
 
In November 2015, Telesat entered into contractual arrangements with Space Systems Loral, LLC (formerly known as Space Systems/Loral, Inc.) (“SSL”) for the construction of Telstar 19 VANTAGE, which it anticipates will be launched in the first half of 2018. This new state-of-the-art satellite will utilize high throughput capabilities to offer superior performance in Ku-band and in Ka-band and will be co-located with Telesat’s Telstar 14R/Estrela do Sul 2 satellite at 63˚ WL, a prime orbital slot for coverage of the Americas. The satellite will have high throughput Ka-band capacity in South America, over Northern Canada, the Caribbean and the North Atlantic Ocean. It will also provide high throughput Ku-band capacity over Brazil, the Andean region and the North Atlantic. Also in 2015, Telesat entered into a long-term satellite service arrangement with Hughes Network Systems LLC for services using the high throughput Ka-band capacity of Telstar 19 VANTAGE in South America.
 
In December 2015, Telesat entered into contractual arrangements with SSL for the construction of Telstar 18 VANTAGE, which it anticipates will be launched in the first half of 2018. The new satellite will operate from 138˚ EL. Telstar 18 VANTAGE will expand Telesat’s coverage of growing satellite service markets in China, Mongolia, Southeast Asia, and the Pacific Ocean region. This satellite will utilize a combination of broad regional beams and high throughput spot beams in Ku-band to maximize throughput and spectral efficiency. It will also provide extensive C-band coverage of Asia that reaches from India and Pakistan in the West all the way to Hawaii in the East, enabling direct connectivity from any point in Asia to the Americas. Telesat also entered into agreements with APT under which its partner, APT, will use certain capacity on the Telstar 18 VANTAGE satellite and fund a portion of the satellite’s cost.
 
In April 2016, Telesat announced the procurement of two prototype Ka-band satellites for operation in low earth orbit that it expects to launch in 2017.

Total Telesat assets were $4.2 billion, $4.0 billion and $4.6 billion as of December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The change in total assets from December 31, 2015 to December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2014 to December 31, 2015 is primarily the result of the change in foreign exchange rates. Backlog was approximately $3.2 billion and $3.5 billion as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The decrease in backlog is due to revenues recognized partially offset by new orders and exchange rate changes. It is expected that approximately 17% of the backlog at December 31, 2016 will be recognized as revenue by Telesat in 2017.
 
Sale of SSL
 
On November 2, 2012, Loral completed the sale (the “Sale”) of its wholly-owned subsidiary, Space Systems/Loral, LLC (formerly known as Space Systems/Loral, Inc.) (“SSL”), to MDA Communications Holdings, Inc. (“MDA Holdings”), a subsidiary of MacDonald, Dettwiler and Associates Ltd. (“MDA”). Pursuant to the purchase agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”), dated as of June 26, 2012, as amended on October 30, 2012 and March 28, 2013, by and among Loral, SSL, MDA and MDA Holdings, Loral agreed to indemnify MDA and its affiliates from certain damages in a lawsuit (the “ViaSat Suit”) brought in 2012 by ViaSat, Inc. (“ViaSat”) against Loral and SSL. In September 2014, Loral, SSL and ViaSat entered into a settlement agreement (the “Settlement Agreement”) pursuant to which the ViaSat Suit and an additional patent infringement and breach of contract lawsuit brought by ViaSat against SSL in September 2013 were settled. Loral was also released by MDA, MDA Holdings and SSL from indemnification claims relating to the ViaSat lawsuits under the Purchase Agreement. The terms of the Settlement Agreement provided, among other things, for payment by Loral and SSL to ViaSat on a joint and several basis of $100 million, $40 million of which was paid in September 2014 in connection with entering into the Settlement Agreement, with the remaining $60 million payable with interest in ten equal quarterly installments of $6.9 million from October 15, 2014 through January 15, 2017.
 
Following a mediation session held on December 1, 2014, Loral and MDA entered into an agreement titled “MDA/Loral Dispute Resolution” dated December 1, 2014 (the “Allocation Agreement”), pursuant to which Loral and MDA agreed that Loral was responsible for $45 million, and MDA and SSL were responsible for $55 million, of the $100 million litigation settlement with ViaSat.

As of December 31, 2016, Loral had paid $43.3 million, including interest, toward the ViaSat settlement. Pursuant to the Allocation Agreement, Loral paid ViaSat the final installment of $2.8 million in January 2017 (see Note 14 to the financial statements).
 
Other
 
We also own 56% of XTAR, LLC (“XTAR”), a joint venture between Loral and Hisdesat Servicios Estrategicos S.A. (“Hisdesat”). We account for our ownership interest in XTAR under the equity method of accounting because we do not control certain of its significant operating decisions. XTAR owns and operates an X-band satellite, XTAR-EUR located at 29o EL, which entered service in March 2005. The satellite is designed to provide X-band communications services exclusively to United States, Spanish and allied government users throughout the satellite’s coverage area, including Europe, the Middle East and Asia. The government of Spain granted XTAR rights to an X-band license, normally reserved for government and military use, to develop a commercial business model for supplying X-band capacity in support of military, diplomatic and security communications requirements. XTAR also leases 7.2 72 MHz X-band transponders (subject to certain temporary reductions for 2017) on the Spainsat satellite located at 30o WL owned by Hisdesat, which entered commercial service in April 2006. These transponders, designated as XTAR-LANT, allow XTAR to provide its customers in the U.S. and abroad with additional X-band services and greater flexibility. XTAR currently has contracts to provide X-band services to the U.S. Department of Defense, U.S. Department of State and various agencies of the Spanish government. For more information on XTAR see Note 6 to the Loral consolidated financial statements.
REGULATION
 
Telesat is subject to regulation by government authorities in Canada, the United States and other countries in which it operates and is subject to the frequency coordination process of the International Telecommunication Union (“ITU”). Telesat’s ability to provide satellite services in a particular country or region is subject also to the technical constraints of its satellites, international coordination, local regulation including as it applies to securing landing rights and licensing requirements.
Canadian Regulatory Environment
 
Telesat was originally established by the government of Canada in 1969 under the Telesat Canada Act. As part of the Canadian government’s divestiture of its shares in Telesat, pursuant to the Telesat Canada Reorganization and Divestiture Act (1991), or the Telesat Divestiture Act, Telesat was continued on March 27, 1992 as a business corporation under the Canada Business Corporations Act, the Telesat Canada Act was repealed and the Canadian government sold its shares in Telesat. The Telesat Divestiture Act provides that no legislation relating to the solvency or winding-up of a corporation applies to Telesat and that its affairs cannot be wound up unless authorized by an Act of Parliament. In addition, Telesat and its shareholders and directors cannot apply for Telesat’s continuation in another jurisdiction or dissolution unless authorized by an Act of Parliament.
 
Telesat is a Canadian carrier under the Telecommunications Act (Canada), or the Telecom Act. The Telecom Act authorizes the Canadian Radio-Television and Telecommunications Commission (“CRTC”) to regulate various aspects of the provision of telecommunications services by Telesat and other telecommunications service providers. Telesat is currently not subject to detailed rate regulation; the CRTC has, however, retained its powers under the Telecom Act to impose price regulation or other regulatory measures on Telesat in the future, as necessary. In addition, Section 28(2) of the Telecom Act provides that the CRTC may allocate satellite capacity to particular broadcasting undertakings if it is satisfied that the allocation will further the implementation of the broadcasting policy for Canada. The exercise by the CRTC of its rights under section 28(2) of the Telecommunications Act could affect Telesat’s relationship with existing customers, which could have a material adverse effect on Telesat’s results of operations, business prospects and financial condition.
 
Telesat’s operations are also subject to regulation and licensing by ISED (formerly Industry Canada) pursuant to the Radiocommunication Act (Canada). ISED has the authority to issue spectrum and earth station licenses and establish policies and standards related to the radio frequencies upon which Telesat’s satellites and earth stations depend. The Minister responsible for ISED has broad discretion in exercising this authority to issue licenses, fix and amend conditions of licenses and to suspend or even revoke them. Some of the spectrum licenses under which Telesat operates the Anik and Nimiq satellites require Telesat to comply with research and development and other industrial and public benefit commitments, to pay annual spectrum license fees and to provide all-Canada satellite coverage.

ISED traditionally licensed satellite radio spectrum using a competitive licensing process. In 2012, ISED conducted a public consultation on the licensing framework for FSS and broadcast satellite services (“BSS”) in Canada. As a result of the consultation, changes in policy were announced in November 2013. Effective January 6, 2014, all FSS and BSS licenses are awarded to qualified applicants on a first-come, first-served basis and spectrum licenses have replaced radio licenses. The term of spectrum licenses is 20 years, with a high expectation of renewal. ISED may, however, issue licenses with a shorter term. ISED also implemented a new spectrum licensing fee regime, which came into effect in the 2016 fiscal year.
 
The Canadian government opened Canadian satellite markets to foreign satellite operators as part of its 1998 World Trade Organization (“WTO”) commitments to liberalize trade in basic telecommunications services, with the exception of DTH television services provided through FSS or DBS facilities. Satellite digital audio radio service markets were also closed to foreign entry until 2005. In September 2005, the Canadian government revised its satellite-use policy to permit the use of foreign-licensed satellites for digital audio radio services in Canada. Further liberalization of the policy may occur and could result in increased competition in Canadian satellite markets.
 
Since November 2000, pursuant to the CRTC’s Decision CRTC 2000-745, virtually all telecommunications service providers are required to pay contribution charges based on their Canadian telecommunications service revenues, minus certain deductions (e.g., terminal equipment sales and inter-carrier payments). The contribution rate varies from year to year. It was initially set at 4.5% of eligible revenues but was significantly reduced in subsequent years. The rate for 2016 was 0.53%, and an interim rate of 0.63% has been established by the CRTC for 2017.
 
United States Regulatory Environment
 
The Federal Communications Commission (“FCC”) regulates the provision of satellite services to, from, or within the United States.
 
Telesat has chosen to operate its U.S. licensed satellites, Telstar 11N, Telstar 12 and Telstar 12 VANTAGE, on a non-common carrier basis. Consequently, it is not subject to rate regulation or other common carrier regulations enacted under the Communications Act of 1934. Telesat pays FCC filing fees in connection with its space station and earth station applications and annual fees to defray the FCC’s regulatory expenses. Annual and quarterly status reports must be filed with the Universal Service Administrative Company (“USAC”) covering interstate/international telecommunications revenues. Based on these reports, USAC assesses Telesat for contribution to the FCC’s Universal Service Fund (“USF”). The USF contribution rate is adjusted quarterly and is proposed to be set at 16.7% for the first quarter of 2017. At the present time, the FCC does not assess USF contributions with respect to bare transponder capacity (i.e. agreements for space segment only). Telesat’s United States telecom revenues that are subject to USF contribution requirements are currently small and its USF payments are not material.
 
Telesat also owns and operates the portion of the ViaSat-1 satellite (115o WL) payload that is capable of providing service within Canada. The ViaSat-1 satellite is licensed by the United States.
 
The FCC currently grants geostationary-like satellite authorizations on a first-come, first-served basis to applicants which demonstrate that they are legally and technically qualified and that the public interest will be served by the grant. Under licensing rules, a bond must be posted starting at $1 million when a geostationary satellite authorization is granted and escalating to up to $3 million. The entire amount of the bond may be forfeited if there is a failure to meet the FCC’s milestones for the launch and commencement of operations of the satellite. According to current licensing rules, the FCC will issue new satellite licenses for an initial 15-year term and will provide a licensee with an “expectancy” that a subsequent license will be granted for the replacement of an authorized satellite using the same frequencies. At the end of the 15-year term, a satellite that has not been replaced, or that has been relocated to another orbital location following its replacement, may be allowed to continue operations for a limited period of time subject to certain restrictions.
 
To facilitate the provision of FSS in C-, Ku- and Ka-band frequencies in the United States market, foreign licensed operators may apply to have their satellites placed on the FCC’s Permitted Space Station List (for certain frequencies) or be granted a declaratory ruling (for other frequencies). Telesat’s Anik Fl, Anik FlR, Anik F2, Anik F3, Telstar 14R/Estrela do Sul 2 and upcoming Telstar 19 VANTAGE satellites are currently authorized to serve the U.S. market in accordance with these procedures.

The United States made no WTO commitment to open its DTH, DBS or digital audio radio services to foreign competition, and instead indicated that provision of these services by foreign operators would be considered on a case-by-case basis, based on an evaluation of the effective competitive opportunities open to United States operators in the country in which the foreign satellite was licensed (i.e., an ECO-sat test) as well as other public interest criteria. While Canada currently does not satisfy the ECO-sat test in the case of DTH and DBS service, the FCC has found, in a number of cases, that provision of these services into the United States using Canadian-licensed satellites would provide significant public interest benefits and would therefore be allowed. In cases involving Telesat, United States service providers, Digital Broadband Applications Corp., DIRECTV and EchoStar, have all received FCC approval to access Canadian-authorized satellites under Telesat’s direction and control in Canadian-licensed orbital locations to provide DTH-FSS or DBS service into the United States.
 
The approval of the FCC for the acquisition of our ownership interest in Telesat was conditioned upon compliance by Telesat with commitments made to the Department of Justice, the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Department of Homeland Security relating to the availability of certain records and communications in the United States in response to lawful United States law enforcement requests for such access.
 
The export of United States-manufactured satellites and technical information related to satellites, earth station equipment and provision of services to certain countries are subject to State Department, Commerce Department and Treasury Department regulations.
 
In 1999, the United States State Department published amendments to the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (“ITAR”) which included satellites on the list of items requiring export licenses. Effective November 2014, further amendments to the ITAR transferred jurisdiction of certain satellites and related technology to the Export Administration Regulations administered by the Commerce Department, which also impose license requirements in specified circumstances. These ITAR provisions may limit Telesat’s access to certain technical information and may have a negative impact on Telesat’s international consulting revenues.
 
If Telesat does not maintain its existing authorizations or obtain necessary future authorizations under the export control laws and regulations of the United States, Telesat may be unable to export technical information or equipment to non-U.S. persons and companies, including to its own non-U.S. employees, as required to fulfill existing contracts. If Telesat does not maintain its existing authorizations or obtain necessary future authorizations under the trade sanctions laws and regulations of the United States, Telesat may not be able to provide satellite capacity and related administrative services to certain countries subject to U.S. sanctions. Telesat’s ability to acquire new United States-manufactured satellites, procure launch services and launch new satellites, operate existing satellites, obtain insurance and pursue its rights under insurance policies or conduct its satellite-related operations and consulting activities could also be negatively affected if Telesat and its suppliers are not able to obtain and maintain required U.S. export authorizations.
 
Regulation Outside Canada and the United States
 
The Brazilian national telecommunications agency, ANATEL, grants exploitation rights for Brazilian satellites to companies incorporated and existing in Brazil which participate in specific auctions conducted by ANATEL and which demonstrate that they are legally, technically and financially qualified and that the public interest will be served by the grant. ANATEL may also grant exploitation and landing rights for foreign satellites when the public interest is evidenced, provided that the applicant company provides certain specific technical information on the relevant satellite and appoints a legal representative in Brazil (i.e., a company incorporated and existing in Brazil). The landing rights of foreign satellites are granted to the owner of the space segment or the company which holds the right to operate it, in whole or in part, but the satellite capacity may only be sold or negotiated in Brazil through the local legal representative. In exploitation and landing rights of Brazilian and foreign satellites, the rights are granted on an onerous basis and are valid for 15 years for Brazilian satellites (renewable once for an additional 15 years) and up to 15 years for foreign satellites (renewable once for an additional equal period).
 
ANATEL has authorized Telesat, through its subsidiary, Telesat Brasil Capacidade de Satélites Ltda. (“TBCS”), to operate a Ku-band FSS satellite at the 63° WL orbital location. In December 2008, TBCS entered into a new 15-year Concession Agreement with ANATEL which obligates TBCS to operate the satellite in accordance with Brazilian telecommunications law and contains provisions to enable ANATEL to levy fines for failure to perform according to the Concession Agreement terms.

In May 2015, TBCS was the successful bidder in an ANATEL auction for Ka-Band and Planned Ku-band frequency rights at the 63° WL orbital location, and the associated 15-year Concession Agreements were signed in March 2016 for Telstar 19 VANTAGE.
 
In addition, ANATEL has accredited TBCS as legal representative in Brazil of three non-Brazilian satellites; Telstar 12 VANTAGE, Anik F1 and Anik G1.
 
Telesat owns Telstar 18, which currently operates at the 138° EL orbital location under an agreement with APT. Telstar 18 VANTAGE will replace Telstar 18 at the same orbital location, also under an agreement with APT. APT has been granted the right to use the 138° EL orbital location by The Kingdom of Tonga. APT is the direct interface with the Tonga regulatory bodies. Because Telesat gained access to this orbital location through APT, there is uncertainty with respect to its ability to maintain access to this orbital location and the frequencies.
 
Telesat owns and operates the portion of the ViaSat-1 satellite (115˚ WL) payload that is capable of providing service within Canada. ViaSat-1 operates in accordance with a license granted by the FCC in the United States. However, by virtue of an intergovernmental arrangement between the United States and the United Kingdom, ViaSat-1 operates in accordance with ITU networks filed by the United Kingdom regulatory agency, OFCOM, on behalf of the Isle of Man. The Isle of Man is a British Crown Dependency and Isle of Man satellite frequency filings are filed with the ITU by OFCOM. ManSat Ltd. has been granted rights by the Isle of Man government to manage all aspects of Isle of Man satellite frequency filings. Both Telesat and ViaSat have a commercial relationship with ManSat. ViaSat and Telesat have agreed to cooperate in their dealings with ManSat with respect to the ViaSat-1 satellite for OFCOM and ITU purposes. The Ka-band and portions of the Ku-band frequencies on Telstar 12 VANTAGE, and portions of the Ka-band frequencies on Telstar 18 VANTAGE and the Ka-band frequencies on Telstar 10 VANTAGE, are also filed with the ITU by ManSat on behalf of Telesat.
 
Landing Rights and Other Regulatory Requirements
 
Many countries regulate satellite transmission signals to, and for uplink signals from, their territory. Telesat has landing rights in major market countries worldwide. In many jurisdictions, landing rights are granted on a per satellite basis and applications must be made to secure landing rights on replacement satellites.
International Regulatory Environment — International Telecommunication Union
 
The ITU, a specialized agency of the United Nations, is responsible for administering access by member states to frequencies in the radio portion of the electromagnetic spectrum. The ITU Radio Regulations set forth the process that member states must follow to secure rights for satellites to use frequencies and the obligations and restrictions that govern such use. The process includes, for example, a “first-come, first-served” system for gaining access to certain frequencies and time limits for bringing the frequencies into use. Other frequencies at specified orbital locations have been reserved in perpetuity for individual administrations’ use.
 
Canada, the United States and other member states have rights to use certain frequencies. Telesat has been authorized by its ITU filing administrators (Canada, USA, Brazil and United Kingdom) to use certain frequencies. In addition, through commercial arrangements, Telesat has the right to use certain frequencies for which the Kingdom of Tonga has the rights. Authorized frequencies include those already used by its current satellites, and additional frequencies at various geostationary orbital locations or in non-geostationary constellations that must be brought into use within specified time limits.
 
The ITU Radio Regulations govern the process used by satellite operators to coordinate their operations with other satellite operators to avoid harmful interference. Each member state is required to give notice of, coordinate, and register its proposed use of radio frequency assignments with the ITU. The filing and registration process is administered by the ITU Radiocommunications Bureau (the “ITU-BR”).
 

14
--

 

Once a member state has filed with the ITU its proposed use of frequencies, other member states inform that member state and the ITU-BR of any intended use that has the potential to cause interference to either existing operations, or operations that may occur in accordance with priority rights. The member states are then obligated to negotiate with each other in an effort to coordinate the proposed uses and resolve interference concerns. If all outstanding issues are resolved in accordance with the various procedures of the ITU Radio Regulations, the frequencies are entered into the ITU’s Master Register (“MIFR”). Registered frequencies are entitled under international law to interference protection from subsequent or nonconforming uses.
 
Under the ITU Radio Regulations, a member state that places a satellite or any ground station into operation without completing coordination could be vulnerable to interference from other systems and may have to alter the operating parameters of its satellite or ground station if harmful interference occurs to other users already entered in the MIFR or that have priority rights.
 
The process of ITU filing and notification in the MIFR of frequencies spans a period of seven to eight years, or longer, depending upon the frequency band and the various provisions of the ITU Radio Regulations that may be invoked. Telesat’s authorized frequencies are in various stages of the coordination and notification process. Many frequencies have completed the process and have been registered in the MIFR. In other cases, coordination is on-going so that entry into the MIFR is pending. This is typical for satellite operators. Depending upon the outcome of coordination discussions with other satellite operators Telesat may need to make concessions in terms of how a frequency may be used. This, in turn, could have a material adverse impact on Telesat’s financial condition, as well as on the value of its business. The failure to reach an appropriate arrangement with such satellite operators may render it impossible to secure entry into the MIFR and result in substantial restrictions on the use and operations of Telesat’s existing satellites. In the event disputes arise during the coordination process or thereafter, the ITU Radio Regulations set forth procedures for resolving disputes but do not contain a mandatory dispute resolution mechanism or an enforcement mechanism. Rather, the rules invite a consensual dispute resolution process for parties to reach a mutually acceptable agreement. Neither the rules nor international law provide a clear remedy for a party where this voluntary process fails.
 
Although non-governmental entities, including Telesat, participate at the ITU, only national administrations have full standing as ITU members. Consequently, Telesat must ultimately rely on the administrations of Canada, the United States, Brazil, the United Kingdom and the Kingdom of Tonga to represent its interests, including submitting and coordinating the ITU satellite networks that provide frequency information within the ITU process described above.
 
PATENTS AND PROPRIETARY RIGHTS
 
As of December 31, 2016, Telesat owned nine issued patents, seven of which are in the United States. These patents expire between 2018 and 2030. Telesat also has several pending domestic and international patent applications.
 
There can be no assurance that any of the foregoing pending patent applications will be issued. Moreover, there can be no assurance that infringement of existing third party patents has not occurred or will not occur. Additionally, because the patent application process is confidential, there can be no assurance that third parties, including competitors, do not have patents pending that could result in issued patents which Telesat may infringe. In such event, Telesat may be restricted from continuing the infringing activities, which could adversely affect its business, or Telesat may be required to obtain a license from a patent holder and pay royalties, which would increase the cost of doing business.
 
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
 
Telesat’s research and development expenditures are incurred for the studies associated with advanced satellite system designs and experimentation and development of space, satellite and ground communications products. This also includes the development of Telesat’s planned LEO constellation.
FOREIGN OPERATIONS
 
Telesat’s revenues from non-U.S. customers, primarily in Canada, Asia, Europe and Latin America represented 66%, 66% and 68% of its consolidated revenues for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. At December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, substantially all of its long-lived assets were located outside of the United States, primarily in Canada, with the exception of in-orbit satellites. (see Item 1A – “Risk Factors – Telesat is subject to risks associated with doing business internationally.”)
