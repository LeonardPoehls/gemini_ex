ITEM 1.                BUSINESS
General 

RSP Permian, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("RSP Inc." or the "Company"), is an independent oil and natural gas company engaged in the acquisition, exploration, development and production of unconventional oil and associated liquids-rich natural gas reserves in the Permian Basin of West Texas.  The vast majority of the Company’s acreage is located on large, contiguous acreage blocks in the core of the Midland Basin and the Delaware Basin, both sub-basins of the Permian Basin. The Midland Basin properties are primarily in the adjacent counties of Midland, Martin, Andrews, Ector, Glasscock, and Dawson. The Delaware Basin properties are in Loving and Winkler counties. The Company’s common stock is listed and traded on the NYSE under the ticker symbol “RSPP.”
The Company’s executive offices are located at 3141 Hood St., Suite 500, Dallas, TX 75219, and the Company also maintains an office in Midland, Texas. The Company’s telephone number is 214-252-2700.
History and Formation

RSP Permian, L.L.C., a Delaware limited liability company (“RSP LLC”), was formed in October 2010 by its management team and an affiliate of Natural Gas Partners, a family of energy-focused private equity investment funds.  In September 2013, the Company was incorporated in Delaware.  In January 2014, pursuant to a corporate reorganization completed in connection with the Company’s initial public offering (“IPO”), RSP LLC became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. Also, in January 2014, in connection with our IPO, the Company acquired (i) working interests in certain acreage and wells in the Permian Basin from Rising Star Energy Development Co., L.L.C. (“Rising Star”), Ted Collins, Jr. (“Collins”), and Wallace Family Partnership, LP (“Wallace LP”) in exchange for shares of the Company’s common stock and cash, (ii) working interests in certain acreage and wells in the Permian Basin from Collins & Wallace Holdings, LLC and Pecos Energy Partners, L.P. (“Pecos”) in exchange for shares of the Company’s common stock, and (iii) net profits interests in oil and natural gas properties in the Permian Basin that were owned and controlled by RSP LLC from ACTOIL, LLC (“ACTOIL”) in exchange for shares of the Company’s common stock (such acquisitions, together with the corporate reorganization, the “IPO Transactions”). 
Information presented in this Report on a pro forma basis gives effect to the completion of the IPO Transactions, and information presented in this Report with respect to our predecessor reflects the combined results of RSP LLC and Rising Star. Additional proved reserves and leasehold acreage information in this report is presented on a pro forma basis that gives effect to the completion of the Silver Hill E&P II, LLC ("SHEP II") transaction. Pro forma information reported on a combined basis is not necessarily indicative of the results that would have been obtained if the IPO Transactions had been completed from the Company’s inception. 
Business Activities

Shortly after RSP LLC was formed, we began a vertical drilling program on our properties using hydraulic fracture stimulation techniques across multiple productive horizons. These vertical wells were completed in several productive formations and received significant production and reserve contributions from the Wolfcamp and Spraberry formations. These wells are commonly called "Wolfberry" wells in the oil and gas industry. In late 2012, we drilled our first horizontal well and in early 2013 our primary focus shifted to drilling horizontal wells, which we believe provides more attractive returns on a majority of our acreage. We were one of the first operators to implement the use of multi-zone horizontal development in the North Midland Basin. We believe that we were the first operator to drill both a Lower Spraberry horizontal well and a Middle Spraberry horizontal well in the Permian Basin. In addition, RSP was one of the first to drill a Wolfcamp B horizontal well in the North Midland Basin. As a result, RSP has been an early leader in executing a multi-zone horizontal development program in the North Midland Basin and gained substantial industry knowledge relating to several productive zones on its properties. Since initiating our horizontal drilling program in the Midland Basin, we have participated in the completion of 274 horizontal wells with wells completed in five different horizontal zones in the Midland Basin including the Middle Spraberry, Lower Spraberry, Wolfcamp A, Wolfcamp B, and Wolfcamp D. With the acquisition of Silver Hill (defined below), we have acquired properties in which Silver Hill has horizontal wells completed in seven different zones including the Brushy Canyon, 1st Bone Spring, 2nd Bone Spring, 3rd Bone Spring, Wolfcamp X/Y, Lower Wolfcamp A, and Wolfcamp B. We target the multiple oil and natural gas producing stratigraphic horizons, or stacked pay zones, on our properties. 
On October 13, 2016, the Company entered into definitive agreements to acquire 100% of Silver Hill Energy Partners, LLC ("SHEP I") and Silver Hill E&P II, LLC ("SHEP II", and together with SHEP I, "Silver Hill") for $1.25 billion of cash and 
6

31.0 million shares of RSP Inc. common stock in aggregate, implying a total purchase price of $2.4 billion at the time of the acquisition announcement (based on the 20-day volume weighted average price of RSP Inc. common stock). Silver Hill is comprised of two privately held entities that collectively own oil and gas producing properties and undeveloped acreage in Loving and Winkler counties in Texas. Silver Hill owns approximately 40,100 net acres with net production of approximately 15,000 Boe per day as of the acquisition announcement date. Silver Hill's highly contiguous acreage position in the core of the Delaware Basin is complementary to the Company's existing asset base in the Midland Basin and the acquisition creates substantial scale from a production and acreage standpoint. The majority of the purchase price will be recorded to proved and unproved oil and natural gas properties on the Company's balance sheet. The SHEP I acquisition closed on November 28, 2016 with a cash cost of $604 million, before purchase price adjustments, and 15.0 million shares of RSP Inc. common stock. The SHEP II acquisition is expected to close in March 2017. These acquisitions are further described in "Part II. Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations." 
During 2016, our developmental capital expenditures, which includes drilling, completion, infrastructure and other and excludes acquisitions, totaled $294 million, which included approximately $275 million spent on drilling and completion activities and $19 million spent on infrastructure and other. In addition, we spent $69 million on bolt-on acquisitions and additions to leasehold in the Midland Basin and approximately $1.2 billion, of which $604 million required the use of cash, on closing the first part of our Silver Hill acquisition, using the stock price of $39.78 at the closing date. 
In 2015, our developmental capital expenditures totaled $391 million which included approximately $354 million on drilling and completion activities, $37 million on infrastructure and other, and in addition we spent approximately $456 million on acquisitions and additions to leasehold. As of December 31, 2016, RSP had 11 operated horizontal and 11 non-operated horizontal drilled but uncompleted wells in inventory.
Our board of directors has approved an initial capital budget for drilling, completion, and infrastructure for 2017 of approximately $625 to $700 million, which anticipates increasing our operated horizontal rig count from five currently to eight by the end of the year. We will continue to monitor commodity prices, our cash flow and returns to determine adjustments to our capital budget. We intend to allocate our 2017 capital budget approximately as follows:
•$575 to $625 million for drilling and completion activities; approximately 10% of which is non-operated drilling and completion activities; and
•$50 to $75 million for infrastructure and other.
For the year ended December 31, 2016, our average net daily production was 29,161 Boe/d (approximately 73% oil, 11% natural gas and 16% NGLs), of which 77% was from horizontal well production and 23% was from vertical well production. As of December 31, 2016, we operated and produced from 233 horizontal and 402 vertical wells and were the operator of approximately 81% of our net acreage.
As of December 31, 2016, our estimated pro forma proved oil and natural gas reserves, taking into account both the SHEP I acquisition which closed on November 28, 2016 and the SHEP II acquisition expected to close in March 2017, were 283.3 MMBoe as summarized in the reserve reports by Netherland, Sewell & Associates, Inc. ("Netherland Sewell") our independent reserve engineer. Of these reserves, approximately 39% were classified as PDP. PUDs included in this estimate are from 367 horizontal well locations. As of December 31, 2016, total proved reserves were approximately 70% oil, 12% natural gas and 18% NGLs.
The following table provides summary information regarding our proved reserves as of December 31, 2016..

Competition and Markets

General

We are the operator of approximately 81% of our net acreage. As operator, we design and manage the well development and supervise operation and maintenance activities on a day-to-day basis. Independent contractors engaged by us provide all the equipment and personnel associated with these activities. We employ petroleum engineers, geologists and land professionals who work to improve production rates, increase reserves and lower the cost of operating our oil and natural gas properties.
Marketing and Customers

We market the majority of the oil and natural gas production from properties we operate for both our account and the account of the other working interest owners in these properties. We sell our natural gas production to purchasers at market prices. We sell all of our natural gas under contracts with terms greater than twelve months and all of our oil under contracts with terms of twelve months or less, excluding five year oil purchase agreements with Shell Trading (US) Company (“Shell Trading”), Enterprise Crude Oil, LLC, and Plains Marketing, LP. These contracts typically allow for the sale of production quantities at prices that approximate the current market price for the underlying commodity.

We normally sell production to a relatively small number of customers, as is customary in the exploration, development and production business. For the year ended December 31, 2016, two purchasers individually accounted for more than 10% of our revenue: Shell Trading Company (US) (23%) and Enterprise Crude Oil LLC (27%). For the year ended December 31, 2015, four purchasers individually accounted for more than 10% of our revenue: Shell Trading Company (US) (37%), Enterprise Crude Oil LLC (12%), Phillips 66 Company (22%) and Diamondback E&P LLC (13%). For the year ended December 31, 2014, four purchasers individually accounted for more than 10% of our revenue: Shell Trading Company (US) (31%), Enterprise Crude Oil LLC (24%), Diamondback E&P LLC (14%) and Permian Transport & Trading (21%). However, based on the current demand for oil, NGLs, and natural gas, and the availability of other purchasers, we believe that the loss of any one or all of our major purchasers would not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations, as crude oil, NGLs, and natural gas are fungible products with well-established markets and numerous purchasers.

Transportation

During the initial development of our fields, we assess the gathering and delivery infrastructure in the areas of our production and then plan accordingly to arrange transportation to gathering systems or pipelines. Our oil is transported from the wellhead to our tank batteries by our gathering systems. The oil is then transported by the purchaser by truck to a tank farm or by pipeline. Our NGLs and natural gas are generally transported from the wellhead to the purchaser’s pipeline interconnection point through our gathering system.
Competition

The oil and natural gas industry is intensely competitive, and we compete with other companies that have greater resources. Many of these companies not only explore for and produce oil and natural gas, but also carry on midstream and refining operations and market petroleum and other products on a regional, national or worldwide basis. These companies may be able to pay more for productive oil and natural gas properties and exploratory prospects or to define, evaluate, bid for and purchase a greater number of properties and prospects than our financial or human resources permit. In addition, these companies may have a greater ability to continue exploration activities during periods of low oil and natural gas market prices. Larger or more integrated competitors also may be able to absorb the burden of existing, and any changes to, federal, state and local laws and regulations more easily than we can, which would adversely affect our competitive position. Our ability to acquire additional properties and to discover reserves in the future will be dependent upon our ability to evaluate and select suitable properties and to consummate transactions in a highly competitive environment. In addition, because we have fewer financial and human resources than many companies in our industry, we may be at a disadvantage in bidding for exploratory prospects and producing oil and natural gas properties.
There is also competition between oil and natural gas producers and other industries producing energy and fuel. Furthermore, competitive conditions may be substantially affected by various forms of energy legislation and/or regulation considered from time to time by the governments of the United States and the jurisdictions in which we operate. It is not possible to predict the nature of any such legislation or regulation which may ultimately be adopted or its effects upon our 
8

future operations. Such laws and regulations may substantially increase the costs of exploring for, developing or producing oil and natural gas and may prevent or delay the commencement or continuation of a given operation.
Seasonality of Business

Weather conditions affect the demand for, and prices of, both oil and natural gas and refinery turnaround and summer driving season affects demand for, and prices of crude oil. The prices of both oil and natural gas are heavily dependent on prevailing and expectations of future supply and demand factors, including current domestic and worldwide storage of each commodity and may not follow a seasonal pattern. Due to seasonal fluctuations or the other above factors impacting pricing, results of operations for individual quarterly periods may not be indicative of the results that may be realized on an annual basis.
Title to Properties

As is customary in the oil and natural gas industry, we initially conduct only a cursory review of the title to our properties in connection with acquisition of leasehold acreage. At such time as we determine to conduct drilling operations on those properties, we conduct a thorough title examination and perform curative work with respect to significant defects prior to commencement of drilling operations. To the extent title opinions or other investigations reflect title defects on those properties, we are typically responsible for curing any title defects at our expense. We generally will not commence drilling operations on a property until we have cured any material title defects on such property. We have obtained title opinions on substantially all of our producing properties and believe that we have satisfactory title to our producing properties in accordance with standards generally accepted in the oil and natural gas industry.
Prior to completing an acquisition of producing oil and natural gas leases, we perform title reviews on the most significant leases and, depending on the materiality of properties, we may obtain a title opinion, obtain an updated title review or opinion or review previously obtained title opinions. Our oil and natural gas properties are subject to customary royalty and other interests, liens for current taxes and other burdens which we believe do not materially interfere with the use of or affect our carrying value of the properties.
We believe that we have satisfactory title to all of our material assets. Although title to these properties is subject to encumbrances in some cases, such as customary interests generally retained in connection with the acquisition of real property, customary royalty interests and contract terms and restrictions, liens under operating agreements, liens related to environmental liabilities associated with historical operations, liens for current taxes and other burdens, easements, restrictions and minor encumbrances customary in the oil and natural gas industry, we believe that none of these liens, restrictions, easements, burdens or encumbrances will materially detract from the value of these properties or from our interest in these properties or materially interfere with our use of these properties in the operation of our business. In addition, we believe that we have obtained sufficient right‑of‑way grants and permits from public authorities and private parties for us to operate our business.
Oil and Natural Gas Leases

The typical oil and natural gas lease agreement covering our properties provides for the payment of royalties to the mineral owner for all oil and natural gas produced from all wells drilled on the leased premises. The lessor royalties and other leasehold burdens on our properties generally range from 20% to 25%, resulting in a net revenue interest to us generally ranging from 75% to 80% of our working interest.
Regulation of the Oil and Natural Gas Industry

Our operations are substantially affected by federal, state and local laws and regulations. All of the jurisdictions in which we own or operate producing oil and natural gas properties have statutory provisions regulating the exploration for and production of oil and natural gas, including provisions related to permits for the drilling of wells, bonding requirements to drill or operate wells, the location of wells, the method of drilling and casing wells, the surface use and restoration of properties upon which wells are drilled, sourcing and disposal of water used in the drilling and completion process, and the abandonment of wells. Our operations are also subject to various conservation laws and regulations. These include the regulation of the size of drilling and spacing units or proration units, the number of wells which may be drilled in an area, and the unitization or pooling of crude oil or natural gas wells, as well as regulations that generally prohibit the venting or flaring of natural gas, and impose certain requirements regarding the ratability or fair apportionment of production from fields and individual wells.
Failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations can result in substantial penalties. The regulatory burden on the industry increases the cost of doing business and affects profitability. Although we believe we are in substantial compliance 
9

with all applicable laws and regulations, such laws and regulations are frequently amended or reinterpreted. Therefore, we are unable to predict the future costs or impact of compliance. Additional proposals and proceedings that affect the oil and natural gas industry are regularly considered by Congress, the states, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission ("FERC") and the courts. We cannot predict when or whether any such proposals may become effective.
We believe we are in substantial compliance with currently applicable laws and regulations and that continued substantial compliance with existing requirements will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position, cash flows or results of operations. However, current regulatory requirements may change, currently unforeseen environmental incidents may occur or past non‑compliance with environmental laws or regulations may be discovered. 
Regulation of Production of Oil and Natural Gas

The production of oil and natural gas is subject to regulation under a wide range of local, state and federal statutes, rules, orders and regulations. Federal, state and local statutes and regulations require permits for drilling operations, drilling bonds and reports concerning operations. We own interests in properties located in Texas, which regulates drilling and operating activities by requiring, among other things, permits for the drilling of wells, maintaining bonding requirements in order to drill or operate wells, and regulating the location of wells, the method of drilling and casing wells, the surface use and restoration of properties upon which wells are drilled and the plugging and abandonment of wells. The laws of Texas also govern a number of conservation matters, including provisions for the unitization or pooling of oil and natural gas properties, the establishment of maximum allowable rates of production from oil and natural gas wells, the regulation of well spacing or density, and plugging and abandonment of wells. The effect of these regulations is to limit the amount of oil and natural gas that we can produce from our wells and to limit the number of wells or the locations at which we can drill, although we can apply for exceptions to such regulations or to have reductions in well spacing or density. Moreover, Texas imposes a production or severance tax with respect to the production and sale of oil, NGLs and natural gas within its jurisdiction.
The failure to comply with these rules and regulations can result in substantial penalties. Our competitors in the oil and natural gas industry are subject to the same regulatory requirements and restrictions that affect our operations.
Regulation of Transportation of Oil

Sales of oil, condensate and NGLs are not currently regulated and are made at negotiated prices. Nevertheless, Congress could reenact price controls in the future.
Our sales of oil are affected by the availability, terms and cost of transportation. The transportation of oil in common carrier pipelines is also subject to rate and access regulation. FERC regulates interstate oil pipeline transportation rates under the Interstate Commerce Act. In general, interstate oil pipeline rates must be cost‑based, although settlement rates agreed to by all shippers are permitted and market based rates may be permitted in certain circumstances.
Intrastate oil pipeline transportation rates are subject to regulation by state regulatory commissions. The basis for intrastate oil pipeline regulation, and the degree of regulatory oversight and scrutiny given to intrastate oil pipeline rates, varies from state to state. Insofar as effective interstate and intrastate rates and regulations regarding access are equally applicable to all comparable shippers, we believe that the regulation of oil transportation will not affect our operations in any way that is of material difference from those of our competitors who are similarly situated. 
In December 2015, H.R. 2029 was signed into law which lifted a ban on the export of crude oil from the United States. This will enable U.S. oil producers the flexibility to seek new markets and export oil into the global marketplace.
Regulation of Transportation and Sales of Natural Gas

Historically, the transportation and sale for resale of natural gas in interstate commerce have been regulated by agencies of the U.S. federal government, primarily FERC. In the past, the federal government has regulated the prices at which natural gas could be sold. While sales by producers of natural gas can currently be made at uncontrolled market prices, Congress could reenact price controls in the future. Deregulation of wellhead natural gas sales began with the enactment of the Natural Gas Pipeline Act (the "NGPA"), and culminated in adoption of the Natural Gas Wellhead Decontrol Act which removed controls affecting wellhead sales of natural gas effective January 1, 1993. The transportation and sale for resale of natural gas in interstate commerce is regulated primarily under the Natural Gas Act of 1938 (the "NGA") and by regulations and orders promulgated under the NGA by FERC. In certain limited circumstances, intrastate transportation and wholesale sales of natural gas may also be affected directly or indirectly by laws enacted by Congress and by FERC regulations.
10

The Domenici-Barton Energy Policy Act of 2005 (the "EP Act of 2005") is a comprehensive compilation of tax incentives, authorized appropriations for grants and guaranteed loans, and significant changes to the statutory policy that affects all segments of the energy industry. Among other matters, the EP Act of 2005 amends the NGA to add an anti‑market manipulation provision which makes it unlawful for any entity to engage in prohibited behavior to be prescribed by FERC, and furthermore provides FERC with additional civil penalty authority. The EP Act of 2005 provides FERC with the power to assess civil penalties of up to $1,000,000 per day for violations of the NGA and increases FERC’s civil penalty authority under the NGPA from $5,000 per violation per day to $1,000,000 per violation per day. The civil penalty provisions are applicable to entities that engage in the sale of natural gas for resale in interstate commerce. On January 19, 2006, FERC issued Order No. 670, a rule implementing the anti‑market manipulation provision of the EP Act of 2005, and subsequently denied rehearing. The rules make it unlawful: (i) in connection with the purchase or sale of natural gas subject to the jurisdiction of FERC, or the purchase or sale of transportation services subject to the jurisdiction of FERC, for any entity, directly or indirectly, to use or employ any device, scheme or artifice to defraud; (ii) to make any untrue statement of material fact or omit to make any such statement necessary to make the statements made not misleading; or (iii) to engage in any act or practice that operates as a fraud or deceit upon any person. The new anti‑market manipulation rule does not apply to activities that relate only to intrastate or other non‑jurisdictional sales or gathering, but does apply to activities of gas pipelines and storage companies that provide interstate services, as well as otherwise non‑jurisdictional entities to the extent the activities are conducted “in connection with” gas sales, purchases or transportation subject to FERC jurisdiction, which now includes the annual reporting requirements under Order 704, described below. The anti‑market manipulation rule and enhanced civil penalty authority reflect an expansion of FERC’s NGA enforcement authority.
On December 26, 2007, FERC issued Order 704, a final rule on the annual natural gas transaction reporting requirements, as amended by subsequent orders on rehearing. Under Order 704, wholesale buyers and sellers of more than 2.2 MMBtus of physical natural gas in the previous calendar year, including natural gas producers, gatherers and marketers, are now required to report, on May 1 of each year, aggregate volumes of natural gas purchased or sold at wholesale in the prior calendar year to the extent such transactions utilize, contribute to, or may contribute to the formation of price indices. It is the responsibility of the reporting entity to determine which individual transactions should be reported based on the guidance of Order 704. Order 704 also requires market participants to indicate whether they report prices to any index publishers, and if so, whether their reporting complies with FERC’s policy statement on price reporting.
Gathering service, which occurs upstream of jurisdictional transmission services, is regulated by the states onshore and in state waters. Section 1(b) of the NGA exempts natural gas gathering facilities from regulation by FERC as a natural gas company under the NGA. Although FERC has set forth a general test for determining whether facilities perform a non‑jurisdictional gathering function or a jurisdictional transmission function, FERC’s determinations as to the classification of facilities is done on a case by case basis. To the extent that FERC issues an order that reclassifies certain jurisdictional transmission facilities as non‑jurisdictional gathering facilities, and depending on the scope of that decision, our costs of getting gas to point of sale locations may increase. We believe that the natural gas pipelines in our gathering systems meet the traditional tests FERC has used to establish a pipeline’s status as a gatherer not subject to regulation as a natural gas company. However, the distinction between FERC‑regulated transmission services and federally unregulated gathering services is the subject of ongoing litigation, so the classification and regulation of our gathering facilities are subject to change based on future determinations by FERC, the courts or Congress. State regulation of natural gas gathering facilities generally include various safety, environmental and, in some circumstances, nondiscriminatory‑take requirements. Although such regulation has not generally been affirmatively applied by state agencies, natural gas gathering may receive greater regulatory scrutiny in the future.
The price at which we sell natural gas is not currently subject to federal rate regulation and, for the most part, is not subject to state regulation. However, with regard to our physical sales of these energy commodities, we are required to observe anti‑market manipulation laws and related regulations enforced by FERC under the EP Act of 2005 and under the Commodity Exchange Act (“CEA”), and regulations promulgated thereunder by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (the "CFTC"). The CEA prohibits any person from manipulating or attempting to manipulate the price of any commodity in interstate commerce or futures on such commodity. The CEA also prohibits knowingly delivering or causing to be delivered false or misleading or knowingly inaccurate reports concerning market information or conditions that affect or tend to affect the price of a commodity. Should we violate the anti‑market manipulation laws and regulations, we could also be subject to related third‑party damage claims by, among others, sellers, royalty owners and taxing authorities.
Intrastate natural gas transportation is also subject to regulation by state regulatory agencies. The basis for intrastate regulation of natural gas transportation and the degree of regulatory oversight and scrutiny given to intrastate natural gas pipeline rates and services varies from state to state. Insofar as such regulation within a particular state will generally affect all intrastate natural gas shippers within the state on a comparable basis, we believe that the regulation of similarly situated intrastate natural gas transportation in any states in which we operate and ship natural gas on an intrastate basis will not affect 
11

our operations in any way that is of material difference from those of our competitors. Like the regulation of interstate transportation rates, the regulation of intrastate transportation rates affects the marketing of natural gas that we produce, as well as the revenues we receive for sales of our natural gas.
Changes in law and to FERC policies and regulations may adversely affect the availability and reliability of firm and/or interruptible transportation service on interstate pipelines, and we cannot predict what future action FERC will take. We do not believe, however, that any regulatory changes will affect us in a way that materially differs from the way they will affect other natural gas producers, gatherers and marketers with which we compete.
Regulation of Environmental and Occupational Safety and Health Matters

Our oil and natural gas exploration and production operations are subject to numerous stringent federal, regional, state and local statutes and regulations governing occupational safety and health, the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to environmental protection, some of which carry substantial administrative, civil and criminal penalties for failure to comply. These laws and regulations may require the acquisition of a permit before drilling or other regulated activity commences; restrict the types, quantities and concentrations of various substances that can be released into the environment in connection with drilling, production and transporting through pipelines; govern the sourcing and disposal of water used in the drilling and completion process; limit or prohibit drilling activities in certain areas and on certain lands lying within wilderness, wetlands, frontier and other protected areas; require some form of remedial action to prevent or mitigate pollution from former operations such as plugging abandoned wells or closing earthen pits; establish specific safety and health criteria addressing worker protection; and impose substantial liabilities for pollution resulting from operations or failure to comply with regulatory filings. In addition, these laws and regulations may restrict the rate of production.
The following is a summary of the more significant existing environmental and occupational health and safety laws and regulations, as amended from time to time, to which our business operations are subject and for which compliance may have a material adverse impact on our capital expenditures, results of operations or financial position.
Hazardous Substances and Waste Handling

The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (“CERCLA”), also known as the “Superfund” law, and comparable state laws impose liability, without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct, on certain classes of persons that are considered to have contributed to the release of a “hazardous substance” into the environment. These persons include the current and past owner or operator of the disposal site or the site where the release occurred and companies that disposed or arranged for the disposal of the hazardous substances at the site where the release occurred. Under CERCLA, such persons may be subject to joint and several strict liability for the costs of cleaning up the hazardous substances that have been released into the environment and for damages to natural resources, and it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the hazardous substances released into the environment. We are able to control directly the operation of only those wells with respect to which we act as operator. Notwithstanding our lack of direct control over wells operated by others, the failure of an operator other than us to comply with applicable environmental regulations may, in certain circumstances, be attributed to us. We also generate materials in the course of our operations that may be regulated as hazardous substances. We are unaware of any liabilities for which we may be held responsible that would materially and adversely affect us.
The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (“RCRA”) and analogous state laws, impose detailed requirements for the generation, handling, storage, treatment and disposal of nonhazardous and hazardous solid wastes. RCRA specifically excludes drilling fluids, produced waters and other wastes associated with the exploration, development or production of crude oil, natural gas or geothermal energy from regulation as hazardous wastes. However, these wastes may be regulated by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (the "EPA") or state agencies under RCRA’s less stringent nonhazardous solid waste provisions, state laws or other federal laws. Moreover, it is possible that these particular oil and natural gas exploration, development and production wastes now classified as nonhazardous solid wastes could be classified as hazardous wastes in the future. A loss of the RCRA exclusion for drilling fluids, produced waters and related wastes could result in an increase in our costs to manage and dispose of generated wastes, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position. In addition, in the course of our operations, we generate some amounts of ordinary industrial wastes, such as paint wastes, waste solvents, laboratory wastes and waste compressor oils that may be regulated as hazardous wastes if such wastes have hazardous characteristics. Although the costs of managing hazardous waste may be significant, we do not believe that our costs in this regard are materially more burdensome than those for similarly situated companies.
We currently own, lease or operate numerous properties that have been used for oil and natural gas exploration and production activities for many years. Although we believe we have utilized operating and waste disposal practices that were 
12

standard in the industry at the time, hazardous substances, wastes or petroleum hydrocarbons may have been released on, under or from the properties owned or leased by us, or on, under or from other locations, including off‑site locations, where such substances have been taken for recycling or disposal. In addition, some of our properties have been operated by third parties or by previous owners or operators whose treatment and disposal of hazardous substances, wastes or petroleum hydrocarbons was not under our control. These properties and the substances disposed or released on, under or from them may be subject to CERCLA, RCRA and analogous state laws. Under such laws, we could be required to undertake response or corrective measures, which could include removal of previously disposed substances and wastes, cleanup of contaminated property or performance of remedial plugging or pit closure operations to prevent future contamination.

The federal Water Pollution Control Act (the “Clean Water Act”) and comparable state laws impose restrictions and strict controls regarding the discharge of pollutants, including produced waters and other oil and natural gas wastes, into or near regulated waters. The discharge of pollutants into regulated waters is prohibited, except in accordance with the terms of a permit issued by the EPA or the state. The discharge of dredge and fill material in regulated waters, including wetlands, is also prohibited, unless authorized by a permit issued by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. Obtaining permits has the potential to delay the development of oil and natural gas projects. These laws and any implementing regulations provide for administrative, civil and criminal penalties for any unauthorized discharges of oil and other substances in reportable quantities and may impose substantial potential liability for the costs of removal, remediation and damages.
Pursuant to these laws and regulations, we may be required to obtain and maintain approvals or permits for the discharge of wastewater or storm water and are required to develop and implement spill prevention, control and countermeasure plans, also referred to as “SPCC plans,” in connection with on‑site storage of significant quantities of oil. We believe that we maintain all required discharge permits necessary to conduct our operations, and further believe we are in substantial compliance with the terms thereof.
The primary federal law related specifically to oil spill liability is the Oil Pollution Act (“OPA”), which amends and augments the oil spill provisions of the Clean Water Act and imposes certain duties and liabilities on certain “responsible parties” related to the prevention of oil spills and damages resulting from such spills in or threatening waters of the United States or adjoining shorelines. For example, operators of certain oil and natural gas facilities must develop, implement and maintain facility response plans, conduct annual spill training for certain employees and provide varying degrees of financial assurance. Owners or operators of a facility, vessel or pipeline that is a source of an oil discharge or that poses the substantial threat of discharge is one type of “responsible party” who is liable. The OPA applies joint and several liability, without regard to fault, to each liable party for oil removal costs and a variety of public and private damages. Although defenses exist, they are limited. As such, a violation of the OPA has the potential to adversely affect our operations.
Air Emissions

The federal Clean Air Act and comparable state laws restrict the emission of air pollutants from many sources, such as, for example, tank batteries and compressor stations, through air emissions standards, construction and operating permitting programs and the imposition of other compliance requirements. These laws and regulations may require us to obtain pre‑approval for the construction or modification of certain projects or facilities expected to produce or significantly increase air emissions, obtain and strictly comply with stringent air permit requirements or utilize specific equipment or technologies to control emissions of certain pollutants. The need to obtain permits has the potential to delay the development of oil and natural gas projects. Over the next several years, we may be required to incur certain capital expenditures for air pollution control equipment or other air emissions related issues. For example, the EPA has promulgated final rules under the Clean Air Act that subject oil and natural gas production, processing, transmission and storage operations to regulation under the New Source Performance Standards (the "NSPS") and the Natural Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (the "NESHAPS") programs. With regards to production activities, these final rules have required, among other things, the reduction of volatile organic compound ("VOC") emissions from three subcategories of fractured and refractured gas wells for which well completion operations are conducted: wildcat (exploratory) and delineation gas wells; low reservoir pressure non‑wildcat and non‑delineation gas wells; and all “other” fractured and refractured gas wells. All three subcategories of wells must route flow back emissions to a gathering line or be captured and combusted using a combustion device such as a flare. However, the “other” wells must use reduced emission completions, also known as “green completions." These regulations also establish specific new requirements regarding emissions from production‑related wet seal and reciprocating compressors, and from pneumatic controllers and storage vessels. The rule is designed to limit emissions of VOC, sulfur dioxide, and hazardous air pollutants from a variety of sources within natural gas processing plants, oil and natural gas production facilities, and natural gas transmission compressor stations. In May 2016, the EPA issued new final rules that, among other things, imposed green completion requirements on all newly-fractured and refractured oil wells. This rule could require a number of modifications to 
13

our operations, including the installation of new equipment. Compliance with these and other air pollution control and permitting requirements has the potential to delay the development of oil and natural gas projects and increase our costs of development and production, which costs could be significant. However, we do not believe that compliance with such requirements will have a material adverse effect on our operations.
Regulation of GHG Emissions

In response to findings that emissions of carbon dioxide, methane and other greenhouse gases ("GHGs") present an endangerment to the public health and the environment, the EPA has adopted regulations under existing provisions of the federal Clean Air Act that, among other things, require preconstruction and operating permits for certain large stationary sources. Facilities required to obtain preconstruction permits for their GHG emissions also will be required to meet “best available control technology” standards that will be established by the states or, in some cases, by the EPA on a case‑by‑case basis.
These EPA rulemakings could adversely affect our operations and restrict or delay our ability to obtain air permits for new or modified sources. In addition, the EPA has adopted rules requiring the monitoring and reporting of GHG emissions from specified onshore and offshore oil and natural gas production sources in the United States on an annual basis, which include certain of our operations. We are monitoring GHG emissions from our operations in accordance with the GHG emissions reporting rule and believe that our monitoring activities are in substantial compliance with applicable reporting obligations. More recently, in May 2016, the EPA finalized a suite of regulations that established methane emission standards for new and modified oil and gas production and natural gas processing and transmission facilities.
While Congress has from time to time considered legislation to reduce emissions of GHGs, there has not been significant activity in the form of adopted legislation to reduce GHG emissions at the federal level in recent years. In the absence of such federal climate legislation, a number of state and regional efforts have emerged that are aimed at tracking and/or reducing GHG emissions by means of cap and trade programs. These programs typically require major sources of GHG emissions to acquire and surrender emission allowances in return for emitting those GHGs. Finally, it should be noted that some scientists have concluded that increasing concentrations of GHGs in the Earth’s atmosphere may produce climate changes that have significant physical effects, such as increased frequency and severity of storms, floods and other climatic events; if any such effects were to occur, they could have a material adverse effect on our exploration and production operations.
Hydraulic Fracturing Activities

Hydraulic fracturing is an important and common practice that is used to stimulate production of oil and/or natural gas from dense subsurface rock formations. The hydraulic fracturing process involves the injection of water, sand and chemicals under pressure into targeted subsurface formations to fracture the surrounding rock and stimulate production. We regularly use hydraulic fracturing as part of our operations. Hydraulic fracturing is typically regulated by state oil and natural gas commissions, but the EPA has asserted federal regulatory authority pursuant to the Federal Safe Drinking Water Act (the "SDWA") over certain hydraulic fracturing activities involving the use of diesel fuels and published permitting guidance in February 2014 addressing the performance of such activities using diesel fuels. Also, in May 2014, the EPA issued an Advanced Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, seeking comment on the development of regulations under the Toxic Substances Control Act to require companies to disclose information regarding the chemicals used in hydraulic fracturing. In addition, in March 2015, the Bureau of Land Management (the "BLM") of the U.S. Department of the Interior published a revised final rule that imposes requirements for hydraulic fracturing activities on federal lands, including new requirements relating to public disclosure, as well as well bore integrity and handling of flowback water. Furthermore, Congress has from time to time considered legislation to provide for federal regulation of hydraulic fracturing under the SDWA and to require disclosure of the chemicals used in the hydraulic fracturing process. It is unclear how any federal disclosure requirements that add to any applicable state disclosure requirements already in effect may affect our operations.
We may be subject to regulations that restrict our ability to discharge water produced as part of our production operations, and the ability to use injection wells as a disposal option not only will depend on federal or state regulations but also on whether available injection wells have sufficient storage capacities. For example, the EPA has issued a "no discharge" effluent limitation prohibiting oil and natural gas operators from transporting wastewater associated with hydraulic fracturing activities to publicly owned treatment works for disposal. 
Certain governmental reviews have been conducted or are underway that focus on the potential environmental impacts of hydraulic fracturing. For example, the EPA has completed a study of the potential environmental effects of hydraulic fracturing on water resources and published a final report in December 2016. Other governmental agencies, including the U.S. Department of Energy, have evaluated or are evaluating various other aspects of hydraulic fracturing. These ongoing or 
14

proposed studies could spur initiatives to further regulate hydraulic fracturing and could ultimately make it more difficult or costly for us to perform fracturing and increase our costs of compliance and doing business.
At the state level, several states have adopted or are considering legal requirements that could impose more stringent permitting, disclosure and well construction requirements on hydraulic fracturing activities. For example in, May 2013, the Texas Railroad Commission issued a “well integrity rule,” which updates the requirements for drilling, putting pipe down and cementing wells. The rule also includes new testing and reporting requirements, such as (i) the requirement to submit cementing reports after well completion or after cessation of drilling, whichever is later, and (ii) the imposition of additional testing on wells less than 1,000 feet below usable groundwater. In 2013, the Texas Railroad Commission implemented its hydraulic fracturing disclosure rule, which requires oil and gas operators to disclose on the FracFocus website the chemical ingredients and water volumes used in hydraulic fracturing treatments. Local government also may seek to adopt ordinances within their jurisdictions regulating the time, place and manner of drilling activities in general or hydraulic fracturing activities in particular or prohibit the performance of well drilling in general or hydraulic fracturing in particular. We believe that we follow applicable standard industry practices and legal requirements for groundwater protection in our hydraulic fracturing activities. Nonetheless, if new or more stringent federal, state or local legal restrictions relating to the hydraulic fracturing process are adopted in areas where we operate, we could incur potentially significant added costs to comply with such requirements, experience delays or curtailment in the pursuit of exploration, development or production activities, and perhaps even be precluded from drilling wells.
Endangered Species Act and Migratory Birds

The Endangered Species Act (the “ESA”) and (in some cases) comparable state laws were established to protect endangered and threatened species. Pursuant to the ESA, if a species is listed as threatened or endangered, restrictions may be imposed on activities adversely affecting that species’ habitat. Similar protections are offered to migratory birds under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act. We may conduct operations on oil and natural gas leases in areas where certain species that are listed as threatened or endangered are known to exist and where other species, such as the sage grouse, that potentially could be listed as threatened or endangered under the ESA may exist. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (the "FWS") may designate critical habitat and suitable habitat areas that it believes are necessary for survival of a threatened or endangered species. A critical habitat or suitable habitat designation could result in material restrictions on land use and may materially delay or prohibit land access for oil and natural gas development.
Moreover, as a result of a settlement approved by the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia in September 2011, the FWS is required to make a determination on listing of more than 250 species as endangered or threatened under the ESA by no later than completion of the agency’s 2017 fiscal year. In addition, the federal government recently issued indictments under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act to several oil and natural gas companies after dead migratory birds were found near reserve pits associated with drilling activities. The identification or designation of previously unprotected species as threatened or endangered in areas where underlying property operations are conducted could cause us to incur increased costs arising from species protection measures or could result in limitations on our exploration and production activities that could have an adverse impact on our ability to develop and produce reserves. If we were to have a portion of our leases designated as critical or suitable habitat, it could adversely impact the value of our leases.
In summary, we believe we are in substantial compliance with currently applicable environmental laws and regulations. Although we have not experienced any material adverse effect from compliance with environmental requirements, there is no assurance that this will continue. We did not have any material capital or other non‑recurring expenditures in connection with complying with environmental laws or environmental remediation matters in 2016, nor do we anticipate that such expenditures will be material in 2017.
OSHA

We are subject to the requirements of the Occupation Health and Safety Act (“OSHA”) and comparable state statutes whose purpose is to protect the health and safety of workers. In addition, the OSHA hazard communication standard, the Emergency Planning and Community Right‑to‑Know Act and comparable state statutes and any implementing regulations require that we organize and/or disclose information about hazardous materials used or produced in our operations and that this information be provided to employees, state and local governmental authorities and citizens. We believe that we are in substantial compliance with all applicable laws and regulations relating to worker health and safety.
Related Permits and Authorizations

15

Many environmental laws require us to obtain permits or other authorizations from state and/or federal agencies before initiating certain drilling, construction, production, operation or other oil and natural gas activities, and to maintain these permits and compliance with their requirements for on‑going operations. These permits are generally subject to protest, appeal or litigation, which can in certain cases delay or halt projects and cease production or operation of wells, pipelines and other operations.
Related Insurance

We maintain insurance against some risks associated with above or underground contamination that may occur as a result of our exploration and production activities. However, this insurance is limited to activities at the well site and there can be no assurance that this insurance will continue to be commercially available or that this insurance will be available at premium levels that justify its purchase by us. The occurrence of a significant event that is not fully insured or indemnified against could have a materially adverse effect on our financial condition and operations. Further, we have no coverage for gradual, long‑term pollution events.
Employees

As of December 31, 2016, we had 115 full-time employees. We hire independent contractors on an as needed basis. We have no collective bargaining agreements with our employees. We believe our employee relationships are satisfactory.
