Item 1. Business
 
As used in this annual report, the terms “we”, “us” and “our” mean Valmie Resources, Inc. and all dollar amounts refer to U.S. dollars, unless otherwise indicated.
 
Overview
 
We were incorporated pursuant to the laws of the State of Nevada on August 26, 2011. We have one wholly owned subsidiary, Vertitek Inc., a Wyoming corporation (“Vertitek”), and a 50% interest in a joint venture entity, AeroLift eXpress, LLC, a Wyoming limited liability corporation (“AeroLift”). From our inception until the quarter ended August 31, 2014, we were a mineral exploration company exploring for precious metals, or gold and silver targets.  Our property, known as the Carico Lake Valley Property (the “Property”), was located in Lander County, Nevada.
 
On April 16, 2014, FEN Holdings & Investments Ltd., a company incorporated in the British Virgin Islands (“FEN”), became our majority stockholder by acquiring an aggregate of 237,360,000 shares, or approximately 80.1% of our then issued and outstanding common stock, from Khurram Shroff, our former sole officer and director.
 
In July 2014, the landowner notified us that our option to acquire an interest in the Property had been terminated and that the Property had been sold to a third party.  Our efforts from that date until the end of our fiscal year ended November 30, 2014, were primarily directed to identifying new development properties.
 
In early December 2014, FEN determined it was in the best interests of our shareholders to change our business focus from mining to pursuing opportunities for the commercialization of leading edge products and services in the rapidly expanding technology industry.  We therefore sought to develop or acquire concepts with valid business models positioned to make a significant impact within the four key technology “megasectors”: software, hardware, networking and semiconductors.
 
Business Strategy
 
The first major step in our shift to the technology sector was the appointment of Gerald B. Hammack as our sole officer and director on December 8, 2014.  Mr. Hammack has more than 30 years of experience in a variety of technology-related fields, including programming, digital telephony and database management, as well as substantial expertise in the setup and management of complex data processing systems.
 
Over the past several years, Mr. Hammack has been developing a series of software platforms and technologies designed to provide the near real-time data processing required by the ever-expanding use of commercial Unmanned Aerial Vehicles or UAVs (more commonly referred to as drones).  Towards the end of 2014 we rebranded Mr. Hammack’s development efforts to date as the AIMD (Automated Intelligence for Mobile Devices) data processing platform and adopted them as our own.  On July 15, 2015, we entered into an asset purchase agreement with Mr. Hammack pursuant to which we acquired all of the right, title and interest in and to the intellectual property relating to the AIMD platform in consideration for the issuance of $100,000 worth of our common stock to Mr. Hammack on that date at a deemed price of $0.47 per share. Since we did not acquire any patents from Mr. Hammack, we recognized an intangible asset value of $100,000 related to the acquisition, which was impaired and written-off as of November 30, 2015.
 
While in the process of launching the AIMD platform, we determined that it would be necessary to find a partner that had the technology and experience in the design and manufacture of UAVs in order to design and build a prototype unit to test and refine our product and service offerings. After extensive investigation we located a UAV manufacturer, Vertitek. Vertitek’s technologies are being designed to enable a sophisticated level of autonomy for UAVs and other autonomous mobilized devices, including precision guidance controls and advanced safety features. The company was established to provide unmanned vehicle software, hardware and cloud services for a wide range of commercial applications around the globe, and its under development commercial UAV’s include multi-rotor and fixed wing models.

On January 27, 2015 we entered into a share exchange agreement (the “Share Exchange Agreement”) with Vertitek and the sole shareholder of Vertitek, Masamos Services Ltd., a Cypriot corporation (“Masamos”), to acquire 100% of the capital stock of Vertitek in exchange for the issuance of shares of our common stock to Masamos. On March 31, 2015, the closing of the Share Exchange Agreement occurred and we issued 1,000,000 shares of our common stock to Masamos in exchange for 100% of the issued and outstanding shares of Vertitek. As a result, Vertitek became our wholly owned subsidiary and we acquired all the assets of Vertitek including, but not limited to, all intellectual property, trade names, trade secrets, trademarks, personnel contracts, website domain and content, strategic partnerships, manuals, licenses and all other confidential information related to the V-1 drone system and other technologies under development by Vertitek.
 
In 2016, Vertitek formed the Vertitek Racing team in order to participate in the burgeoning drone racing industry. Vertitek maintains a team of sponsored pilots who fly in these events on behalf of Vertitek Racing, and has also designed a series of racing specific drone frames that it manufactures and sells to other drone operators both through traditional retail methods as well as from its own interactive e-commerce platform.
 
Although we acquired intellectual property both as a result of the Vertitek acquisition and from Mr. Hammack, we have not yet filed for any patent protection in relation to such intellectual property. We intend to protect our intellectual property rights, including trademark and servicemark opportunities, to the maximum extent possible in all jurisdictions in which we may operate. In the future, we anticipate protecting the trademark and service mark opportunities related to Vertitek, the V-Series drones and the AIMD platform.
 
On April 15, 2016, we entered into a joint venture agreement with James Stafford to form AeroLift (the “Joint Venture Agreement”). Pursuant to the Joint Venture Agreement, we currently own 50% of AeroLift and have committed funding up to $500,000 to launch the AeroLift business model, of which $237,000 had been advanced as of November 30, 2016.  AeroLift is led by a team of military trained pilots, mission commanders and specialists with more than 60 years of combined aviation experience, and it expects to utilize military grade UAV’s which have been specifically adapted for its applications in conjunction with the Vertitek design and manufacturing team. Together with state of the art ground control stations and flight control software, AeroLift intends to deliver cutting edge unmanned services to clients in a variety of challenging environments.
 
As of November 30, 2016, we had not generated any revenue through the sales of UAVs or the provision of software, hardware or cloud based services, either through Vertitek, AeorLift or otherwise.  Our operating divisions, Vertitek and AeroLift, are continuing to develop their product and service offerings while beginning to market those offerings to potential customers. The service offerings of AeroLift have a long sales cycle due in large part to the necessity of introducing new technologies and systems into industries that have shown historical resistance to change.
 
We have never declared bankruptcy, receivership or any similar proceedings nor have we had any material reclassifications, mergers, consolidations, or purchases or sales of a significant amount of assets not in the ordinary course of business.
 
Our principal executive office is located at 2603 Augusta Drive, Suite 840, Houston, TX 77057 and our telephone number is (713) 595-6675. Our website address is www.valmie.com.
 
Our Corporate History and Background
 
On December 3, 2013, the holders of a majority of our issued and outstanding common stock approved an amendment to our bylaws (the “Bylaw Amendment”) and an increase in our authorized capital from 100,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.001, to 750,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.001 (the “Authorized Capital Increase”). The purpose of the Bylaw Amendment was to update our bylaws and make them more comprehensive, while the purpose of the Authorized Capital Increase was to reorganize our capital structure in connection with the stock dividend described below. We formally effected the Authorized Capital Increase on December 4, 2013 by filing a Certificate of Amendment with the Nevada Secretary of State.
 
Also on December 3, 2013, our former sole director approved a stock dividend of 59 authorized but unissued shares of our common stock on each one (1) issued and outstanding share of our common stock. On December 13, 2013, we received approval from the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) to effect the stock dividend by way of a forward split, and on December 17, 2013, our shareholders of record on December 16, 2013 received the dividend. As a result of the stock dividend, our issued and outstanding common stock increased from 4,940,000 shares to 296,400,000 shares.

On September 1, 2014, we entered into a consulting agreement with Constant Consulting Corp., a Wyoming corporation (“Constant”), pursuant to which Constant agreed to provide certain consulting services to us, including operational plan and business model structuring, identifying potential development partners, interfacing with third parties to ensure compliance with regulatory requirements, and interfacing with other vendors as requested, for a period of one year in exchange for the payment of $25,000 per month. On February 28, 2015, the parties agreed to terminate the monthly obligation to Constant and that any future work would be compensated on an hourly basis. Our agreement with Constant expired on August 31, 2015 and was not renewed. Other than with regard to the agreement, we are unaware of any relationship between Constant and any of our officers, directors or shareholders.
 
On December 10, 2014, the holders of a majority of our issued and outstanding common stock approved a set of amended and restated articles of incorporation that, among other things, increased our authorized capital to 760,000,000 shares, consisting of 750,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.001, and 10,000,000 shares of “blank check” preferred stock, par value $0.001 (the “Blank Check Preferred Stock”). We formally effected the authorized capital increase and the creation of the Blank Check Preferred Stock by filing the amended and restated articles of incorporation accompanied by the required certificate with the Nevada Secretary of State on December 11, 2014.
 
On December 11, 2014, our sole director approved the designation of 2,000,000 shares of the Blank Check Preferred Stock as Series “A” preferred stock (the “Designation”). We formally effected the Designation by filing a Certificate of Designation with the Nevada Secretary of State on January 15, 2015.
 
The shares of Series “A” preferred stock carry certain rights and preferences. The Designation provides that the Series “A” Preferred Stock may be converted into shares of our common stock on a 10 for one (1) basis at any time after 18 months from the date of issuance, and that each share of Series “A” preferred stock has voting rights and carries a voting weight equal to 50 shares of common stock.
 
On January 16, 2015, FEN agreed to cancel an aggregate of 237,360,000 shares, or approximately 80.1% of our issued and outstanding common stock, in exchange for the issuance of the 2,000,000 shares of Series “A” preferred stock described above. As a result, the number of issued and outstanding shares of our common stock decreased from 296,400,000 to 59,040,000.
 
Between August 18, 2014 and March 20, 2015, we issued eight promissory notes to three investors (Shield Investments, Inc. a British Virgin Islands corporation (“Shield”), Tuverga Finance Ltd., a Cypriot corporation (“Tuverga”) and Fairwinds Consulting LLC, a Texas limited liability corporation) in the aggregate principal amount of $365,000 in exchange for advances to us in an identical amount. Each of the promissory notes bears simple interest at an annual rate of 15% and matures two years from the date of issuance. Seven of the eight promissory notes, in the aggregate principal amount of $350,000, were secured by all of the assets, properties, goods, inventory, equipment, furniture, fixtures, leases, supplies, records, money, documents, instruments, chattel paper, accounts, intellectual property rights (including but not limited to, copyrights, moral rights, patents, patent applications, trademarks, service marks, trade names, trade secrets) and other general intangibles, whether owned by us on the date of the applicable note or thereafter acquired, and all proceeds thereof.


On March 31, 2015, we completed the Vertitek acquisition and Vertitek became our wholly owned subsidiary.


On April 6, 2015, we entered into debt conversion agreements with Shield and Tuverga pursuant to which those investors converted an aggregate of $350,000 in debt into 3,500,000 shares of our common stock at a price of $0.10 per share. As part of those debt conversion agreements, Shield and Tuverga agreed to forgive any and all accrued interest and release their respective security interests in our assets, rights or other property.
 
Also on April 6, 2015, we entered into a debt conversion agreement with Dome Capital LLC, a Wyoming limited liability corporation, pursuant to which it converted an aggregate of $33,927 in debt into 339,270 shares of our common stock at a deemed price of $0.10 per share.

On July 15, 2015, we entered into an asset purchase agreement with Gerald B. Hammack, our sole officer and director, pursuant to which we acquired all of the right, title and interest in and to the intellectual property relating to the AIMD platform from Mr. Hammack in consideration for the issuance of $100,000 worth of our common stock to Mr. Hammack on that date at a deemed price of $0.47 per share. The assets include, but are not limited to, all intellectual property, trade names, trade secrets, trademarks, personnel contracts, web site domains and content, strategic partnerships, publications, operating models, manuals, licenses, and all other confidential information relating to the AIMD platform concept. As a result, Mr. Hammack received an aggregate of 212,765 shares of our common stock.
 
Mr. Hammack determined the value of his intellectual property based on a good faith estimate of the cost to recreate such intellectual property. While the intellectual property acquired from Mr. Hammack does not include any patents or immediately patentable innovations, we did acquire the software foundation for our under construction AIMD platform. We believe the acquisition reduced our software development schedule by six to nine months.
 
During the year ended November 30, 2015, we issued six promissory notes to Crystal Resource Corp. in the aggregate principal amount of $102,500 in exchange for advances to us in an identical amount. During the year ended November 30, 2016, we issued multiple promissory notes to the same investor in the aggregate amount of $172,500, also in exchange for advances to us in an identical amount. Each of the promissory notes bears simple interest at an annual rate of 15%, matures two years from the date of issuance, and is secured by all of the assets, properties, goods, inventory, equipment, furniture, fixtures, leases, supplies, records, money, documents, instruments, chattel paper, accounts, intellectual property rights (including but not limited to, copyrights, moral rights, patents, patent applications, trademarks, service marks, trade names, trade secrets) and other general intangibles, whether owned by us on the date of the applicable note or thereafter acquired, and all proceeds thereof. 


On February 10, 2016, we were granted an exemption (No. 14749, Regulatory Docket No. FAA–2015–4694) from Section 333 of Public Law 112-95 by the Federal Aviation Administration (the “FAA”) to operate two models of the V-Series drones to perform aerial data collection, and in particular, to conduct aerial based agricultural applications, search and rescue operations, power-line inspections, pipe-line inspections, infrastructure surveying and aerial imaging. The exemption is subject to industry standard weight, speed and altitude limitations, as well as certain visual line of sight, visual observer, operating document, safety and pre-flight inspection measures, among others.
 
The exemption will terminate on February 28, 2018, and we do not anticipate being unable to comply with any conditions of the exemption during the term. As Vertitek completes new UAV hardware offerings, we will petition the FAA to add these new platforms to our existing exemption under Section 333.
 
On April 15, 2016, we entered into the Joint Venture Agreement with James Stafford to form AeroLift.


On April 27, 2016, $200,000 of the promissory notes described above was settled through the issuance of 2,000,000 shares of our common stock, and the associated accrued interest of $13,854 was waived.  During the year ended November 30, 2016, we repaid the remaining promissory notes in full in the aggregate amount of $75,000 and the associated accrued interest of $997 was waived. 
 
In late 2016, we entered into a purchase order with Alti UAS of South Africa regarding the manufacture and delivery of five customized VTOL (vertical takeoff and landing) UAV systems to be used by AeroLift in the provisioning of its services. These new systems will be customized and flight-tested by a team consisting of resources from us, Vertitek and AeroLift. Once certified for flight operations these Alti systems will allow AeroLift to provide a new level of services to interested parties.
 
In early 2017, Vertitek opened a new technology development and manufacturing facility in Lake Charles, Louisiana, at which Vertitek’s in-house staff has the capabilities to manufacture components for and assemble its UAV offerings.
 
The Tuverga Agreements
 
On August 20, 2015, we entered into an equity investment agreement (the “Equity Investment Agreement”) with Tuverga pursuant to which Tuverga is irrevocably committed to purchase up to $2.5 million of our common stock over the course of 24 months and may not assign or in any way transfer its rights to purchase such common stock or any interest therein. The aggregate number of shares issuable by us and purchasable by Tuverga under the Equity Investment Agreement is limited by the dollar amount sold, in this instance no more than $2.5 million, and will depend upon the trading price of our shares. When we sell shares to Tuverga, the per share purchase price that Tuverga will pay to us will be determined in accordance with a formula set forth in the Equity Investment Agreement. Generally, with respect to each sale, Tuverga will pay us a per share purchase price equal to fifty percent (50%) of the volume weighted average price of our common stock during the three (3) consecutive trading day period immediately preceding the date of delivery of our request for funds.

In connection with the Equity Investment Agreement, we also entered into a registration rights agreement (the “Registration Rights Agreement”) with Tuverga. Pursuant to the Registration Rights Agreement, we were obligated to file a registration statement with the SEC covering the shares of common stock underlying the Equity Investment Agreement within 15 days after the execution of the agreement. In addition, we were obligated to use all commercially reasonable efforts to have the registration statement declared effective by the SEC within 90 days after the date the registration statement is filed and maintain the effectiveness of such registration statement until the earlier to occur of the date on which (a) Tuverga has sold all of the 10,000,000 shares of our common stock being registered thereunder or (b) we have no right to sell any additional shares to Tuverga under the Equity Investment Agreement.
 
Our Solutions
 
Our UAV solutions and those of Vertitek and AeroLift will consist of aerial data collection hardware, software and data storage solutions for commercial applications. We are currently developing our software and data storage solutions while we continue to test and refine our prototype hardware units.
AIMD Platform: Autonomous Intelligence for Mobilized Devices
 
We are creating a powerful and feature-rich system for connecting mobilized machines, drones and robots to enable communication, automation and visibility. We expect to be able to offer choices from dozens of industry applications that are experiencing a growing need for visibility to help maximize operational efficiencies, and have taken into consideration the need for a seamless point of integration, empowering the best-of-both-worlds – including hardware components and process information – to work better together. We developed the AIMD platform as the intersection point for real-time operational intelligence and effective work-flow that is accessible anywhere, anytime.
 
V-Series UAVs
 
Vertitek is designing and developing the extremely versatile V-Series UAVs. The V-Series includes both traditional multi-rotor and VTOL (vertical takeoff and landing) UAV systems. The previously developed V-1 and V-2 drone systems served as a test platform for new technologies and methodologies to be incorporated into the latest development prototypes. Vertitek’s design team is working closely with AeroLift and its flight operations specialists to ensure the large scale UAVs under development will meet the needs of potential end-users, including clients of AeroLift’s unique service offerings.
 
To date we have built and tested approximately 15 prototypes of the various V-Series UAVs.
 
Suppliers
 
Both our hardware and software solutions rely on certain outside suppliers for either operational components or software packages upon which our systems are constructed. At this time there are multiple suppliers for almost all of the components that are required in our business and we do not foresee a situation under which we would be unable to receive the items required from these suppliers. Vertitek Racing’s drone frames are manufactured in its facility using readily available carbon fiber material from a multitude of suppliers. Our V-Series UAV prototypes are constructed mostly from readily available components. When it becomes viable to manufacture one or more of the V-Series UAVs for commercial sale, we will require certain proprietary components such as flight controllers and network interfacers to be manufactured to our specifications. This will limit our supply network and could leave us vulnerable in the event of an issue with such supplier. Where appropriate we will try to diversify our supply network as much as possible to mitigate future supply risks.

Business Plan Implementation Schedule
 
We have not established a schedule for the completion of specific tasks or milestones contained in our business plan. Virtually all aspects of our business plan are scalable in terms of size, quality, and effectiveness, and the timing of their execution must be concurrent or near concurrent and progressive over an eighteen-month period. We anticipate that we will require an additional $1,500,000 in order to deliver upon our business goals within a 24-month period. We believe that our existing Equity Investment Agreement with Tuverga will be sufficient to provide our capital needs over the next 12-18 months.
Sales and Marketing Strategy
 
We plan to begin generating revenue from sales related to drone services, either through one-time contracts or through longer-term monitoring and data processing agreements. We, along with our AeroLift joint venture, have begun discussions with industry sectors to determine the areas in which our services could have an immediate impact, thus generating the most interest from early adopters. While we plan to attend industry conferences and association meetings in order to introduce our services, we believe that personal relationships and introductions continue to be our best avenue to capture revenue in the near-term.
 
We anticipate that within 24 months, we will be actively marketing our V-Series UAVs for sale to commercial customers. In order to effectively sell the V-Series UAVs, we will need to engage a professional sales and marketing team with experience in business-to-business sales. We expect that as the UAV market matures over the coming years there will be opportunities for collaborations with other interested parties which could provide additional markets for our product and services.
 
Characteristics and Make-Up of Target Market
 
The UAV market is constantly changing, due in large part to the current regulatory challenges faced by the industry. It is impossible to predict exactly how new regulations will impact the market at this time.
 
We will be constantly reviewing our target markets to ensure the success of our business model.
 
As the UAV industry matures in the coming years, the demand for our solutions will only increase. Our early entry into the commercial UAV marketplace will provide an opportunity to become one of the major solution providers in our target markets.
 
Competition
 
The commercial UAV market is characterized by many participants that offer very similar products. Therefore, our strategy is to begin offering advanced solutions that combine our software and hardware offerings in such a way to bring clear value to our customers.

Although this industry operates in a highly specialized niche, competition for business will be intense. We will face significant competition in the provision of both software solutions and hardware systems, from the following companies, among others:
 
Hardware Vendors
 

● | Parrot Industries 
--+----------------------
● | PrecisionHawk 
● | DJI Innovations 

Software Solutions Providers
 

● | PrecisionHawk
--+--------------
● | AirWare 
● | DroneCode 
● | NV Drones 

Intellectual Property
 
Our policy is to capitalize intellectual property related to the filing and acquisition of internally developed patents where appropriate.
 
Patent related expenses that are eligible for capitalization include:
 

● | legal fees related to the preparation and filing of a patent application; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | legal fees related to the defense of a patent or patent application; and 
● | filing fees related to the filing of a patent application. 

 
Intellectual property for internally developed patents will be capitalized only in the above circumstances and will be amortized over the life of the patent, beginning on the grant date.
 
We have not filed any patents related to our UAV technologies as of the date of this annual report; however, we anticipate that we will begin to complete such filings in the near future.
 
Research and Development
 
Our current research and development activities are solely focused on the continued development of the AIMD platform as well as our collaboration on the V-Series UAVs. We anticipate these efforts will lead to additional products being developed from the foundation of these two systems. If and when we are able to do this, engineering design development will be employed to aid in the development of these systems. At this time, however, we have no plans to pursue pure research and development activities at any point in the future.
Government Regulations
 
As a provider of technologies and services in the UAV industry we are likely to be subject to extensive regulation at both the federal and municipal levels. This will be especially true if we begin to offer operational services to our customers. We believe that increasing regulation in the drone space will be beneficial not only to our business, but to all commercial drone operators and solution providers. The barriers to entry created by such regulation will only help to differentiate the product and solutions being offered by professional companies versus those that are intended for the consumer marketplace.
 
The regulatory environment for commercial UAV use has not yet been codified in the United States. In addition to a few recent FAA exemptions, the key case, Huerta v. Pirker, has not brought definitive clarity, just more clearly defined positions on both sides of the dispute over the regulated or unregulated use of UAV’s for commercial purposes.
 

10
--


UAV regulations for the United States airspace are still a patchwork of confusing, often contradictory rulings, generally based on regulations, which, in some cases, were codified decades ago. Based on the existing exemptions, those entities and organizations that are anticipating to use UAV’s commercially will be required to receive pilot certifications, including medical certifications, which the FAA has attached to the few exemptions. Operators and pilots are likely to be distinguished. The FAA has recently determined that a drone registry will be implemented in order to more effectively track drones that stray into restricted airspace or are flown in violation of the law. We feel this registry is long overdue and will help to reduce the negative attention paid to the industry when hobbyist operators do not follow common sense guidelines for drone operations.
 
On the non-FAA side, there will be expanding barriers to entry into the UAV industry, especially if FAA regulations should surprise us with low thresholds for an entry into the commercial field. From homeland security to privacy, there are real and imaginary dangers associated with the expanding use of UAV’s in the United States. As U.S. domestic regulation continues to fall behind that of more forward thinking countries, it may become necessary for UAV companies to focus their efforts and resources outside the United States until such time as UAV regulations become more conducive to the game-changing solutions that can only be delivered by tomorrow’s advanced UAV systems and technologies.
 
Employees
 
As of the date of this annual report, we have eight full-time or part-time employees, including our sole executive officer and director and the employees of our subsidiaries. We currently rely on the efforts of Gerald B. Hammack, our sole executive officer and director, Sean Foster, the sole officer and director of Vertitek, and James Stafford, our partner in the AeroLift joint venture and AeroLift’s Managing Member and Chief Executive Officer, to manage our operations. Mr. Hammack dedicates approximately 40 hours per week to the management of our operations along with the oversight of our autonomous vehicle software and hardware development projects. Mr. Foster dedicates approximately 40 hours per week to the continued development of Vertitek’s autonomous vehicle prototypes, and Mr. Stafford dedicates approximately 40 hours per week to the management and marketing of AeroLift. From time to time, we also engage consultants to provide specialized technical and support services, both in the implementation of our corporate structure as well as the advancement of our products and services.
