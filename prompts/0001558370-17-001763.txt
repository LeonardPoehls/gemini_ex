     Item 1:Business
     Overview
     We are a leading specialty provider of property and casualty insurance operating in two niche markets across the United States.  In our Program Services segment, we leverage our “A” (Excellent) A.M. Best rating, expansive licenses and reputation to provide access to the U.S. property and casualty insurance market in exchange for ceding fees.  In our Lender Services segment, we specialize in providing collateral protection insurance (“CPI”), which insures personal automobiles and other vehicles held as collateral for loans made by credit unions, banks and specialty finance companies. Both of these businesses have a long track record of profitable operations.
     Our Program Services segment generates significant fee income, in the form of ceding fees, by offering issuing carrier capacity to both specialty general agents and other producers (“GAs”), who sell, control, and administer books of insurance business that are supported by third parties that assume reinsurance risk.  These reinsurers are domestic and foreign insurers and institutional risk investors (“capacity providers”) that want to access specific lines of U.S. property and casualty insurance business.  Issuing carrier (“fronting”) arrangements refer to our business in which we write insurance on behalf of a capacity provider and then reinsure the risk under these policies with the capacity provider in exchange for ceding fees. Our broad licensing authority, strong A.M. Best “A” (Excellent) rating, which is the third 

 
  2

 
highest out of fifteen rating categories used by A.M. Best, and track record of over 28 consecutive years of profitable operations allow us to act as the policy-issuing carrier for business produced by GAs.
     We reinsure substantially all of the underwriting and operating risks in connection with our fronting arrangements to our capacity providers.  In many cases, we hold significant collateral to secure the associated reinsurance recoverables. We have ceded over $13 billion in premiums over the past 28 years with no unpaid reinsurance recoverables.  Because we generally only write in these lines on a fronting basis, GAs and reinsurers can be confident that we will not compete with them with respect to the business they write through us. In exchange for providing our insurance capacity, licensing and rating to our GA and capacity provider clients, we receive ceding fees averaging in excess of 5% of gross written premiums.  In addition, we require minimum annual fees, which we refer to as “capacity fees” for smaller programs, programs with uncertain premium volume or a program that involves exclusivity.  
     Our Lender Services segment generates premium primarily from providing CPI to our credit union, bank and specialty finance clients.  Lenders purchase CPI to provide coverage for automobiles or other vehicles of borrowers who do not uphold their obligation to insure the collateral underlying the loan. Our lender clients pay us directly for CPI and then add the cost of CPI to the borrower’s loan. Our CPI business is fully vertically integrated: we manage all aspects of the CPI business cycle, including sales and marketing, policy issuance, policy administration, underwriting and claims handling.  We believe that we are the only vertically integrated CPI provider focused primarily on this product offering, and that the breadth and flexibility of our services enable us to provide our lender clients with responsive and customized policy terms, services and reporting to better serve their needs.  We service our CPI clients through InsurTrak, our proprietary technology platform that allows both us and our clients to track and manage a CPI program. We believe our InsurTrak system is highly scalable with the capacity to service a much larger volume of business without significant changes to the system. As of December 31, 2016, we had over 600 CPI clients with portfolios totaling 5.1 million CPI loans. In addition, our integrated CPI platform and InsurTrak have contributed to our ability to write business for credit unions, banks and specialty finance companies.
     We have an exclusive relationship with CUNA Mutual Insurance Society (“CUNA Mutual”) to provide CPI to credit unions.  CUNA Mutual is a leading insurance company focused on providing a range of insurance products to credit unions in the U.S. This alliance has enabled us to achieve a leading market share in the credit union CPI market. In 2014, we amended our relationship with CUNA Mutual to increase our retention of the business subject to the alliance to 70% from 50% for policies written on or after July 1, 2014. 
     We write our insurance business through our insurance company subsidiaries, which have expansive licenses to write insurance in the U.S.  State National Insurance Company, Inc. (“SNIC”) and National Specialty Insurance Company (“NSIC”) are admitted carriers licensed to write property and casualty business in all 50 states and the District of Columbia.  City National Insurance Company (“CNIC”) is an admitted carrier licensed to write property and casualty business in 49 states and the District of Columbia.  United Specialty Insurance Company (“USIC”) is an admitted carrier in Delaware and is eligible to write surplus lines in all 50 states and the District of Columbia.  Effective January 1, 2017, the Company acquired Fireman’s Fund Insurance Company of Ohio, an excess and surplus lines, or non-admitted, shell company.  The company was subsequently renamed Independent Specialty Insurance Company (“ISIC”).  SNIC, NSIC and USIC operate under an intercompany pooling arrangement in order to take advantage of our strong “A” (Excellent) group rating from A.M. Best.  We have received regulatory approval to add CNIC and ISIC to the intercompany pooling arrangement in 2017.
     Our long history of profitable operations has enabled us to maintain our “A” (Excellent) A.M. Best rating while writing gross premiums in excess of $1.4 billion in 2016 on approximately $296 million of shareholders’ equity, or over four times operating leverage at December 31, 2016. As of December 31, 2016, we had total assets of approximately $2.9 billion. The following table sets forth selected financial data for the periods presented:

(1) | Adjusted pre-tax income is considered a non-GAAP financial measure because it reflects the following adjustments to pre-tax income, which is the most directly comparable measure calculated in accordance with GAAP: the amount of founder special compensation, non-recurring offering-related expenses and contract modification expense related to the amendment to our alliance agreement with CUNA Mutual. Management believes this measure is helpful to investors because it provides comparability in evaluating core financial performance between periods before and after the completion of our private placement in June 2014. Management uses adjusted pre-tax income to evaluate core financial performance against historical results without the effect of these items. For a reconciliation of this non-GAAP financial measure, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation—Results of Operations—Consolidated Results of Operations.”

  Our Business Segments and Services
     We have two primary business segments, Program Services and Lender Services.
    
· | Program Services — Our Program Services segment is a fronting business. We leverage our “A” (Excellent) A.M. Best rating, expansive licenses and reputation to provide access to the U.S. property and

casualty insurance market to capacity providers in exchange for ceding fees. Through our fronting business, we write a wide variety of insurance products, principally including general liability insurance, commercial liability insurance, commercial multi-peril insurance, property insurance and workers compensation insurance. We are able to reinsure substantially all of the underwriting and operating risks associated with our fronting arrangements to our capacity providers. We mitigate the credit risk of our capacity providers generally by either selecting well capitalized, highly rated authorized reinsurers or requiring that the reinsurer post substantial collateral to secure the reinsured risks. 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Lender Services — Our Lender Services segment specializes in providing CPI, which insures personal automobiles and other vehicles held as collateral for loans made by credit unions, banks and specialty finance companies. Our lender clients pay us directly for CPI and then add the cost of CPI to the loans of borrowers who do not uphold their obligation to the lender to insure the collateral underlying the loan. We also provide ancillary insurance products that currently are not actively marketed. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

      Our History
     The Ledbetter family founded a small general agency in 1973 selling CPI exclusively in Texas. By the late 1970s, the Company began to expand the CPI business beyond Texas.  Also at that time, we began to receive inquiries from other carriers and GAs seeking to access the Texas non-standard automobile market, and recognized the opportunity to act as an issuing carrier.  The volume of this fronting business grew significantly.  Most of this business was non-standard automobile insurance in the state of Texas written by a county mutual insurance company that we managed, and all of this business was 100% reinsured. No A.M. Best rating was required and the business could be written at very high leverage ratios.  This high degree of leverage, the related reinsurer credit underwriting undertaken to support that leverage, and the significant collateral held against potential losses, were the foundation of our Program Services business model.
     In 1984, we formed SNIC to write our CPI business directly. SNIC received an “A” (Excellent) rating from A.M. Best in 1993, and has maintained the rating for over 20 years.  Over the years, we expanded our fronting and CPI operations outside of Texas and acquired additional insurance subsidiaries.
     In 2009, we formed an exclusive relationship with CUNA Mutual, a leading provider of insurance products to credit unions. This alliance has enabled us to achieve a leading market share in the credit union CPI market.
     On June 25, 2014, we completed the sale of an aggregate of 31,050,000 shares of our common stock in a private placement exempt from registration under the Securities Act of 1933, which we refer to in this report as the private placement. Subsequently, we registered the resale of these shares with the Securities and Exchange Commission and our common stock began trading on the Nasdaq Global Select Market on November 3, 2014.
     Program Services Segment
     Business Overview
     In our Program Services segment, we leverage our “A” (Excellent) A.M. Best rating, expansive licenses, and reputation to provide access to the U.S. property and casualty insurance market in exchange for ceding fees. This access is sought by GAs and capacity providers in the U.S. property and casualty insurance market. The most common underlying business reasons are set out below:
· | GAs writing specialized books of business supported by capacity providers; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Capacity providers seeking a fronting arrangement, including:
--+--------------------------------------------------------------


o | insurers that have access to origination but require broader licensing or given their lower rating, the use of an “A” A.M. Best rating to access business;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

o | foreign insurers writing in the United States, either directly or through GAs;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | domestic insurers seeking additional business free of channel conflicts;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | insurers looking to reduce financial leverage; and
--+---------------------------------------------------


o | institutional risk investors that need to write through licensed, highly rated entities.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

      Many of our fronting programs are arranged with the assistance of brokers that are seeking to provide customized insurance solutions for specialty insurance business that requires an A.M. Best “A” rated carrier. In exchange for access to our rating, licensing and reputation, we generally charge ceding fees ranging between 5% and 6% of gross written premium.  We are able to do this profitably because our specialized fronting business model relies on our GAs or capacity providers to provide the infrastructure associated with providing policy administration, claims handling, cash handling, underwriting, or other traditional insurance company services. Our low expense structure enables the Program Services segment to produce significant additional premium volume with only minimal incremental expense increase. Using our model, we are able to generate significant gross written premiums on a relatively small capital base compared to other insurance carriers.
     We reinsure substantially all of the underwriting risk and business risk to the capacity providers and collect ceding fees on the transactions we facilitate. We remain exposed to the credit risk of capacity providers, or the risk that one of our capacity providers becomes insolvent or otherwise unable or unwilling to pay policyholder claims. To mitigate this credit risk of capacity providers, we have established financial criteria for selecting capacity providers as well as comprehensive methodologies and systems to monitor and mitigate this risk. See “—Relationships with Capacity Providers and Producers” below.  
     Relationships with Capacity Providers and Producers
     The primary capacity providers that partner with us either make the strategic decision not to write certain business directly or cannot write directly.  We offer a fully licensed platform with a strong capital position and strong relationships with regulators and rating agencies that have been cultivated for over three decades.  Our low cost business model allows us to charge ceding fees that we believe are on the lower end of the market range, which is an additional attraction for capacity providers to work with us. We typically enter into these arrangements with respect to specified portions of a capacity provider’s business, rather than all of their portfolio.
     In connection with writing Program Services business, we enter into agency and reinsurance agreements with both the producer (typically GAs) and the capacity provider (reinsurer) whereby the producer and capacity provider are generally required to deal directly with each other to develop business structures and terms and to implement and maintain the ongoing contractual relationship.  In a number of cases, the producer and capacity provider for a program are part of the same organization or are otherwise affiliated. The producer generally is the party that will handle the marketing and underwriting of the policies (subject to certain limitations), the overall administration of the business, including preparing reports and making payments (i.e. premiums, commissions, losses, loss adjustment expenses, assessments, etc.) required pursuant to the applicable agreements, and handling of claims (up to certain limits and in some cases in conjunction with the reinsurer). The reinsurer typically undertakes to monitor the producer and to be responsible for the performance of the producer.  As a result of our contract design, substantially all of the underwriting risk and business risk inherent in the arrangement is borne by the reinsurer.  We take the risk of insolvency or other failure to pay by a capacity provider and also have potential liability for a breach of our obligations on limited matters, such as a fraudulent or criminal act on our part, fines or penalties assessed for our willful misconduct, a failure to defend an action or prosecute an appeal or our bad faith or negligent rejection of a settlement within policy limits.
     To the extent the funds for premiums, commissions, losses, assessments and other payments are not the obligation of the Company and are settled directly between the producer and reinsurer, we do not record any receivables or payables.  This direct settlement of balances due between the parties has several benefits to us, including reduced leverage ratios, increased Best’s Capital Adequacy Ratio (“BCAR”) score (used by A.M. Best to monitor capital adequacy), and reduced staffing requirements.

     As compensation for writing this business, we receive ceding fees generally from the GAs or other producers.  If a producer defaults on its obligation to pay these fees (or any other amount due), the capacity provider is generally obligated to make the payment under the guarantee contained in the contracts.  We charge ceding fees averaging in excess of 5% of gross written premium.  The fee may be adjusted upward if, for example, the business uses more surplus (i.e., has a longer tail) or requires more administration or oversight due to collateral requirements. In addition, we require minimum annual fees, which we refer to as “capacity fees” for smaller programs, programs with uncertain premium volume or a program that involves exclusivity.
     We select GAs based on their experience, capacity to provide the necessary services, reputation and financial stability. We regularly monitor the performance of our GAs to ensure that there is no material deterioration with respect to such factors over time.
     We generally require new capacity providers to either have an A.M. Best rating of “A-” (Excellent) or better, have equity and/or capital and surplus of at least $300 million and not have other issues that impact credit quality negatively or post substantial collateral.  If a capacity provider does not meet our selection criteria, we utilize a number of risk mitigating levers, including requiring the posting of collateral and excess collateral, equity and/or capital and surplus and financial covenants, guarantees by affiliates and premium and/or policy limit caps.  We review historical financial results of proposed capacity providers to assess financial stability.
     Our contracts relating to collateral typically provide for changes in the level of collateral required based on estimates of reinsurance recoverables. Our contracts may also provide for changes in level of collateral required based on certain events, such as changes in a capacity provider’s ratings and level of equity and/or capital and surplus. See “—Reinsurance.”
     Products
     In our Program Services segment we act as an issuing carrier for foreign and domestic insurance and reinsurance companies in exchange for ceding fees, writing a wide variety of insurance products, principally including general liability insurance, commercial liability insurance, commercial multi-peril insurance, property insurance and workers compensation insurance.     Sales and Marketing
     We source our fronting arrangements from reinsurance brokers and directly with GAs and capacity providers. Historically, we have been able to fully leverage our capital base through our traditional distribution channels with only a modest sales and marketing effort and using our existing infrastructure. We historically have been opportunistic and relationship-driven, rather than systematic, with respect to new business generation but recently began actively marketing our services. We continue to build direct relationships with GAs and capacity providers and have hired additional fully-dedicated sales staff.  Also, we are now attending international conferences in addition to meetings by our senior executives with capacity providers in London and Bermuda. These meetings and conferences along with the direct marketing campaign with GAs have produced new business and viable leads.
     We do not expect that developing direct relationships will have a negative effect on existing large brokerage relationships. In our experience, brokers typically view fronting deals as opportunistic rather than core to their business and generally accept that companies that primarily act as issuing carriers will and must develop direct relationships. We have a number of long-term relationships with GAs, brokers and reinsurers. Turnover generally occurs when capacity providers choose not to use a fronting arrangement, loss performance deteriorates, a GA forms its own insurance company, or a capacity provider exits a particular line of business.  We have historically been able to more than offset cancelled programs with a combination of new fronting arrangements and organic growth in existing fronting arrangements.

 Competition
     We believe there are relatively few active competitors in the fronting business.  We compete primarily on the basis of price, customer service, geographic coverage, financial strength ratings, licenses, reputation, business model, experience and generally not offering State National’s products for our own account.  Our principal competitors are companies such as James River Group Holdings, Ltd., Clear Blue Financial Holdings, LLC., Spinnaker Insurance Company, AmTrust Financial Services, Inc. and Argo Group, which we believe only act as an issuing carrier on a limited basis or if a GA chooses to use an alternative structure in which the insurer retains the risk as opposed to that involves an issuing carrier.  Unlike us, some of our competitors offer policy administration and are willing to assume a significant portion of the underwriting risk.  We believe our long track record of success in this market and long-standing relationship and credibility with A.M. Best enable us to maintain our “A” (Excellent) A.M. Best rating with a relatively high operating leverage that we expect would be difficult for a competitor to obtain.     Geographic Distribution
     We write our insurance business through our insurance company subsidiaries.  The following table sets forth the distribution of our Program Services gross premium written by state as a percent of total gross premium written for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014:

      Lender Services Segment
     Business Overview
     In our Lender Services segment, we primarily offer CPI, which insures automobiles or other vehicles held as collateral for loans made by credit unions, banks and specialty finance companies. CPI is added by lenders to the loans of borrowers who do not uphold their obligation to the lender to insure the collateral underlying the loan. The product is underwritten directly by us. We also provide ancillary insurance products that we do not actively market. For the year ended December 31, 2016, approximately 95% of our CPI business was written with credit unions.  In our CPI business, for 2016, the average lender loan balance was approximately $15,100 and our average claim was approximately $2,900. As of December 31, 2016, we had over 600 CPI clients and with portfolios totaling 5.1 million CPI loans.
     Relationship with CUNA Mutual. We entered into a Collateral Protection Alliance Agreement with CUNA Mutual in 2009, which we refer to as the alliance agreement, which provided us access to a wider array of credit union clients and added significant additional scale to our CPI business.  This alliance has enabled us to achieve a leading market share in the credit union CPI market.  Pursuant to the alliance with CUNA Mutual, CUNA Mutual outsourced CPI administration and claims handling to us.
     In connection with the alliance agreement, the parties also entered into a reinsurance agreement pursuant to which we initially agreed to cede 50% of the alliance business to CUNA Mutual. However, in 2014 we amended the alliance agreement to increase our retention of the business subject to the alliance to 70% from 50% for business written on or 

 
  8

 
after July 1, 2014, and in exchange we made payments to CUNA Mutual totaling $17.8 million.  In addition, CUNA Mutual pays a ceding commission of 21% and reimburses a proportional share of direct commissions and other reimbursable expenses paid to accounts. The policies subject to the reinsurance agreement with CUNA Mutual insure automobiles or other vehicles held as collateral for loans made by credit unions across the U.S.  For a description of the coverages under these policies, see “—CPI Product” below.
     Vertical Integration.  Our CPI business is fully integrated in that our operations in this segment cover sales, policy issuance, policy administration, underwriting, claims handling and all other aspects of the CPI business cycle. We believe we are the only vertically integrated CPI provider focused primarily on this product offering. Because we control all aspects of the CPI business operations, we can readily customize our product coverage and reporting to each client. We underwrite each of our lender client accounts and have the ability to move quickly to re-price the business in response to market or financial changes.
     CPI Product
     Coverages. A basic CPI policy provides coverage for physical damage to an insured’s automobile or other vehicles. The key difference between CPI and traditional automobile physical damage coverage is that CPI is purchased by lenders to protect their interest in collateral when it has been established that a borrower has not fulfilled his or her obligation to the lending institution to purchase adequate insurance coverage. By contrast, traditional automobile coverage is secured by individuals to protect their interests in the automobile in addition to their lienholder’s interest, if applicable.
     CPI coverage can be written to protect the interest of the lending institution in the automobile, which is known as single interest coverage, or it can be written to protect the interest of both the lender and the borrower, which is known as dual interest coverage. At the lender’s request, a CPI program may also include a variety of additional coverage options supplementing the basic physical damage protection. Although the lender is generally responsible for paying our premiums, some of the coverage we offer provides for reimbursement of premiums the lender paid to us in the event of a borrower default. The most significant coverage options include:
    
· | Collision: Covers accidental loss or damage to the collateral caused by collision with another object or rollover.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Premium Deficiency: Provides for reimbursement of earned premiums subject to a wide range of options such as physical damage status and loss ratio.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Conversion/Skip Loss: Provides coverage for the loss due to concealment, disposal, or misappropriation of the collateral by the borrower.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

      Allowance for Policy Cancellations.  We experience a high level of policy cancellations with our CPI product because borrowers often purchase insurance at the traditional rates that provides protection for them in addition to their lender.  As such, our recorded CPI premiums written are those that we expect to earn, and we record an allowance for policy cancellations for the estimated amount of return premiums and policy fees, net of commission expense and premium taxes, associated with expected future policy cancellations.  See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation—Critical Accounting Estimates—Allowance for Policy Cancellations” in Item 7 of this report.
     Ancillary Products
     As part of our agreement with CUNA Mutual, we no longer market any non-CPI products to credit unions, which include, for example, Guaranteed Auto Protection (“GAP”) insurance (covers the difference between the value of the collateral and the outstanding loan balance) and, mortgage protection insurance.  For all non-CPI products, except for GAP, we act as an agent rather than an underwriter.

 Sales and Marketing
     Because of our exclusive relationship with CUNA Mutual, we have focused our CPI sales efforts primarily on credit unions. We have also sold CPI programs opportunistically to banks and specialty lending institutions. As of December 31, 2016, we had over 600 CPI clients nationwide and focus on developing new relationships on an ongoing basis. Measured by premium volume, as of December 31, 2016, approximately 89% of our CPI clients have been with us for two or more years and approximately 73% have been with us for five or more years.
     CPI is sold by full-time sales professionals whose territories are organized geographically in order to facilitate extensive face-to-face interactions and to develop and leverage regional expertise. Sales managers are paid bonuses monthly based on sales volume. These bonuses are uncapped and may exceed annual salary. Most sales managers we hire have prior experience selling to financial institutions. In addition, our alliance with CUNA Mutual provides us with access to their sales force. That sales force is valuable, in part, because CUNA Mutual has business relationships with most credit unions nationwide.  The alliance agreement with CUNA Mutual requires CUNA Mutual to assist in the sale of new CPI loans, and CUNA Mutual provides incentives to their sales force to achieve sales goals.
     Client Servicing
     We believe that our vertical integration is a key differentiator for us relative to competitors. We act as the agency, program administrator, and underwriter for our clients. Some of the key functions offered include new client assistance, tracking, borrower notification, contact center performance and claims.  We believe that other CPI market participants that contract out certain functions of the business are not as well positioned to adapt to market and product changes or offer customized solutions.
     Proprietary Technology — InsurTrak. A key component of our product and service offering is InsurTrak, our proprietary insurance tracking system. InsurTrak delivers real-time visibility into the current borrower insurance information. A key feature of InsurTrak is that it is highly customizable for the client at virtually no incremental cost to us. Clients have their own ways of managing their businesses, and, therefore, require different analyses, data, and reporting outputs. The platform allows clients and us to view transaction histories, monitor calls, submit insurance updates and claims, and view reports.
     Service Operations Center. Another key component of our service offering is our service operations center. The service operations center handles calls from borrowers and is available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. During regular business hours, borrowers can speak with a representative, while after hours callers receive answers to routine insurance questions using an interactive voice response system.  Borrowers can also submit insurance information online, through the mail to a dedicated P.O. Box, or via a dedicated fax line.
     Additionally, we take measures to assist borrowers in becoming compliant with insurance requirements of their loans. We send at least two customized borrower notices, and each month make thousands of outbound insurance verifications in order to avoid unnecessary CPI placements. 
     Once a policy has been issued, if a loss event occurs, we offer an easy electronic claim submission process to clients. Clients can file electronic claims for single or multiple losses through InsurTrak and can track the status, appraisers’ reports, and final settlement sheets of all claims remotely using this system. 
     Competition
     The CPI market is very competitive.  However, we believe the CPI market is mature and has significant barriers to entry, such as the required investment in technology and industry-specific knowledge. We compete primarily on the basis of price, coverages offered, claims handling, customer service, geographic coverage, financial strength ratings, licenses, reputation, technology, relationships with business partners and experience. We compete in the credit union market chiefly with two other CPI providers, Allied Solutions (“Allied”) and Southwest Business Corporation (“SWBC”). Allied is a Carmel, Indiana-based independent agency selling over 100 commercial and consumer insurance products with a similar market share to us. Allied has grown principally through acquisitions since its founding in 1977 

 
  10

 
and was sold to Securian, the parent corporation of Minnesota Life Insurance Company, in 2004. SWBC is a San Antonio, Texas-based GA selling a wide range of insurance, mortgage and investment products to commercial and consumer clients. Together with these two companies, we served approximately 72% of the total credit union CPI market in 2016, with the remainder being assorted smaller players and businesses which have opted to self-insure.
     While we sell CPI almost exclusively, our two main competitors in the credit union market, Allied and SWBC, sell a much wider range of products, many of which are offered by CUNA Mutual. We believe that our monoline focus, vertical integration and proprietary technology platform provide for faster underwriting and better servicing of CPI clients and continue to serve as a key differentiator in the eyes of our clients.
     We believe that a strengthening economy, an aging automobile fleet, and easier access to credit have contributed to recent increases in vehicle sales.  In addition, the size of lenders’ automobile loan portfolios has been growing, reflecting the lenders’ willingness to lend and their willingness to lend at a higher loan-to-value ratio. We believe that there is opportunity for us to benefit from future growth in the CPI market, both organically and through new account sales.

      Reinsurance
     We use quota share reinsurance in both Program Services and Lender Services segments. “Quota share reinsurance” refers to reinsurance under which the insurer transfers, or cedes, a fixed percentage of liabilities, premium and related losses for each policy covered on a pro rata basis in accordance with the terms and conditions of the relevant agreement.  In our Lender Services business, we use quota share reinsurance only in connection with our alliance with CUNA Mutual.
     In our Program Services business, we have developed standardized forms of agreements, including our quota share reinsurance agreement, which we use in substantially all of our fronting arrangements.  Under our fronting arrangements, we generally enter into a 100% quota share reinsurance agreement whereby we cede to the reinsurer substantially all of our gross liability under all policies issued by and on behalf of us by the general agent.  The reinsurer is generally entitled to 100% of the net premiums received on policies reinsured, less the ceding fee to us, the commission paid to the general agent and premium taxes on the policies.  The reinsurer assumes and is liable for substantially all losses incurred in connection with the risks under the reinsurance agreement, including judgments and settlements.  See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our Program Services Segment— Some of our fronting arrangements contain limits on the reinsurer’s obligations to us.” in Item 1A of this report.

 Our capacity providers generally pay incurred losses directly, and we do not need to access the collateral.  The collateral is usually held by a bank trustee and is available to be accessed by us to pay the losses incurred in the unusual case in which a capacity provider does not pay such losses.
     As of December 31, 2016, we held $2.2 billion in collateral securing $1.7 billion in reinsurance recoverables. Collateral held to support reinsurance recoverables generally consists of securities with a NAIC Securities Valuation Office rating of one or evergreen letters of credit.  The remaining unsecured reinsurance recoverables of $664.6 million are ceded to highly-rated, well capitalized reinsurers.  The following table sets forth our ten largest gross reinsurance recoverables by reinsurer as of December 31, 2016:

      Ratings
     Financial strength ratings are an important factor in establishing the competitive position of insurance companies and are important to our ability to market and sell our products. Rating organizations continually review the financial positions of insurers, including us. We have been assigned a group financial strength rating of “A” (Excellent) by A.M. Best, an independent rating agency that specializes in ratings for the insurance industry. A.M. Best’s financial strength rating is an independent opinion of a company’s financial strength and ability to meet its ongoing insurance policy obligations. According to A.M. Best, an “A” rating, which is the third highest out of fifteen rating categories used by A.M. Best, is assigned to insurers that have an excellent ability to meet their ongoing financial obligations to policyholders.  This rating reflects A.M. Best’s opinion of our ability to pay claims and is not an evaluation directed to investors regarding an investment in our common stock.  This rating is subject to periodic review by, and may be revised downward or revoked at the sole discretion of, A.M. Best. There can be no assurance that we will maintain our current ratings. Future changes to our rating may adversely affect our competitive position.     Loss Reserves
     We record loss reserves for estimated losses under the insurance policies that we write and for loss adjustment expenses (“LAE”) related to the investigation and settlement of those losses. Our reserves for losses and LAE represent the estimated cost of all reported and unreported losses and LAE incurred and unpaid at any given point in time based on known facts and circumstances.
     For the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, our loss reserves, net of reinsurance recoverables, were $12.8 million and $12.8 million, respectively.  Since almost all of Program Services losses are ceded, our net loss reserves are primarily related to Lender Services business.  There were no significant changes in the key assumptions utilized in the analysis and calculations of our loss reserves during the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015.
     The process of establishing the liability for unpaid losses and LAE is complex and imprecise as it must take into consideration many variables that are subject to the outcome of future events. As a result, informed subjective estimates and judgments as to our ultimate exposure to losses are an important component of our loss reserving process.
     Loss reserves include statistical reserves and case estimates for individual claims that have been reported and estimates for claims that have been incurred but not reported at the balance sheet date as well as estimates of the expenses associated with processing and settling all reported and unreported claims, less estimates of anticipated salvage and subrogation recoveries. Estimates are based upon past loss experience modified for current trends as well as economic, legal and social conditions. Loss reserves are not discounted to present value, which would involve recognizing the time value of money and offsetting estimates of future payments by future expected investment income.
    
 
  13

 

 Incurred but not reported (“IBNR”) reserve estimates are generally calculated by first projecting the ultimate cost of all claims that have occurred and then subtracting reported losses and loss expenses. Reported losses include cumulative paid losses and loss expenses plus case reserve estimates. The IBNR reserve includes a provision for claims that have occurred but have not yet been reported, some of which are not yet known to the insurer, as well as a provision for future development on reported claims.
     We regularly review our loss reserves using a variety of actuarial methods and available information. We update the reserve estimates as historical loss experience develops, additional claims are reported and settled or as new information becomes available. Any changes in estimates are reflected in financial results in the period in which the estimates are changed.
     Our loss reserves are reviewed quarterly by internal actuaries and at least annually by our external actuaries. The actuarial review may include an actual to expected loss analysis or more detailed reserve indications for segments with changes, as well as the internal actuarial department’s reasonable reserve range compared to carried reserves. We review available actuarial indications and review carried reserves compared to the reasonable reserve range to determine whether any reserve adjustments are warranted.
     With respect to reserve calculation for our Program Services business, we maintain reserve calculation control for all of our programs.  Where a GA or reinsurer has loss development data available, an internal actuary will review such data for sufficiency (i.e., how much history is provided), consistency, and whether the product for which history is provided is consistent with our product.  If the data is not credible or where no data is available, the loss reserves are calculated using our experience or industry experience for similar products or lines of business.
     The majority of our net loss reserves carried relates to our CPI business.  This business is short-tailed due to the nature of the coverages provided, which means that length of time between the assumption of a risk and the payment of claims in respect of that risk is a relatively short period.
     There is no one specific industry standard for determining reasonable reserve ranges.  The internal actuarial reserve ranges are established by considering projections using variations in the underlying actuarial assumptions, projections based on different weightings of the individual actuarial methods, projections by statistical variability analysis or by other appropriate reserve considerations.
     Our internal actuarial analysis of the historical data provides the factors we use in our actuarial analysis in estimating our loss and LAE reserves. These factors are implicit measures over time of claims reported, average case incurred amounts, case development, severity and payment patterns. However, these factors cannot be directly used as they do not take into consideration changes in business mix, claims management, regulatory issues, medical trends, and other subjective factors.  We generally use a combination of actuarial factors and subjective assumptions in the development of up to five of the following actuarial methodologies:
    
· | Paid Development Method — uses historical, cumulative paid losses by accident year and develops those actual losses to estimated ultimate losses based upon the assumption that each accident year will develop to estimated ultimate cost in a manner that is analogous to prior years.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Paid Bornhuetter-Ferguson (“BF”) Method — a combination of the Paid Development Method and the Expected Loss Method, the Paid BF Method estimates ultimate losses by adding actual paid losses and projected future unpaid losses. The amounts produced are then added to cumulative paid losses to produce the final estimates of ultimate incurred losses.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Incurred Development Method — uses historical, cumulative incurred losses by accident year and develops those actual losses to estimated ultimate losses based upon the assumption that each accident year will develop to estimated ultimate cost in a manner that is analogous to prior years.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Incurred Bornhuetter-Ferguson (“BF”) Method — a combination of the Incurred Development Method and the Expected Loss Method, the Incurred BF Method estimates ultimate losses by adding actual incurred losses and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
  14

 

projected future unreported losses. The amounts produced are then added to cumulative incurred losses to produce an estimate of ultimate incurred losses.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Expected Loss Method — utilizes an expected ultimate loss ratio based on historical experience adjusted for trends multiplied by earned premium to project ultimate losses.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

      For each method, losses are projected to the ultimate amount to be paid.  The Company then analyzes the results and may emphasize or deemphasize some or all of the outcomes to reflect actuarial judgment regarding their reasonableness in relation to supplementary information and operational and industry changes. For example, the Incurred Development Method is emphasized in the estimation of our short-tail lines of business while the Incurred BF Method is emphasized in the estimation of our long-tail lines of business. These outcomes are then aggregated to produce a single selected point estimate that is the basis for the internal actuarial department’s point estimate for loss reserves.
     In determining the level of emphasis that may be placed on some or all of the methods, internal actuaries periodically review statistical information as to which methods are most appropriate, whether adjustments are appropriate within the particular methods, and if results produced by each method include inherent bias reflecting operational and industry changes. This supplementary information may include:
    
· | open and closed claim counts;
--+------------------------------


· | statistics related to open and closed claim count percentages;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------


· | claim closure rates;
--+---------------------


· | changes in average case reserves and average loss and LAE incurred on open claims;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | reported and ultimate average case incurred changes;
--+-----------------------------------------------------


· | reported and projected ultimate loss ratios; and
--+-------------------------------------------------


· | loss payment patterns.
--+-----------------------

      When reviewing reserves described in this section, we analyze historical data and estimate the impact of numerous factors such as (1) individual claim information; (2) industry and the historical loss experience; (3) legislative enactments, judicial decisions, legal developments in the imposition of damages, and changes in political attitudes; and (4) trends in general economic conditions, including the effects of inflation. This process assumes that past experience, adjusted for the effects of current developments and anticipated trends, is an appropriate basis for predicting future events. There is no precise method for subsequently evaluating the impact of any specific factor on the adequacy of reserves, because the eventual deficiency or redundancy is affected by multiple factors. The key assumptions we use in our determination of appropriate reserve levels include the underlying actuarial methodologies, consideration of pricing and underwriting initiatives, an evaluation of retention levels, and consideration of any claims handling impact on paid and incurred loss data trends embedded in the traditional actuarial methods.
     With respect to the ultimate estimates for losses and LAE, the key assumptions remained consistent for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015.  If circumstances bear out our assumptions, losses incurred in 2016 should develop similarly to losses incurred in 2015 and prior years. Thus, if the net loss ratio for premiums written in a given accident year is 40%, we expect that the net loss ratio for premiums written in that same accident year evolving in Year 2 would also be 40%.  However, due to the inherent uncertainty in the loss development factors, our actual liabilities may differ significantly from our original estimates.
     The reserve range below provides a sensitivity analysis regarding a range of reserve estimates considered to be reasonable based on current information and normal variations in actuals losses and assumptions.  This range was developed based on actuarial judgment of the potential variance in key loss reserve factors which influence ultimate frequency and severity that can cause favorable or unfavorable development in loss reserves.  However, due to the 

 
  15

 
inherent uncertainty involved with projecting future loss events, the reserve range does not include all possible outcomes, and our actual liabilities may differ significantly from our original reserve estimates.  Our analysis does not anticipate any extraordinary changes in the legal, social or economic environments that could affect the ultimate outcome of claims, or the emergence of claims from causes not currently recognized in the historical data. Such extraordinary changes or claim emergence may impact the level of required reserves in ways that are not presently quantifiable. Thus, while we believe our reserve estimates are reasonable given the information currently available, it must be recognized that actual emergence of losses could deviate, perhaps significantly, from our estimates and the amounts recorded by the Company.
     Loss Reserves evaluated as of December 31, 2016
 ($ in millions)
        
Sensitivity Range | Net Loss & LAE Reserves | 
Low end of the range | $ | 12.1
Carried reserves | $ | 12.8
High end of the range | $ | 14.0

      The resulting range derived from this sensitivity analysis would have increased net reserves by approximately $1.2 million, or decreased net reserves by approximately $0.7 million, at December 31, 2016.  The increase would have reduced pre-tax net income and stockholders’ equity by approximately $1.2 million.  The decrease would have increased pre-tax net income and stockholders’ equity by approximately $0.7 million.  A change in our reserves for net losses and LAE would not have an immediate impact on our liquidity, but would affect cash flow in future periods as the losses are paid.
     Given the numerous factors and assumptions used in our estimates of net reserves for losses and LAE, and consequently this sensitivity analysis, we do not believe that it would be meaningful to provide more detailed disclosure regarding specific factors and assumptions and the individual effects of these factors and assumptions on our net reserves. Furthermore, there is no precise method for subsequently reevaluating the impact of any specific factor or assumption on the adequacy of reserves because the eventual deficiency or redundancy is affected by multiple interdependent factors.

      Loss Development
     Changes in loss reserve estimates are unavoidable because such estimates are subject to the outcome of future events. Loss trends vary and time is required for changes in trends to be recognized and confirmed. Reserve changes that increase previous estimates of ultimate cost are referred to as unfavorable or adverse development or reserve strengthening. Reserve changes that decrease previous estimates of ultimate cost are referred to as favorable development or reserve releases.
             The estimate for ultimate losses incurred on a net basis related to prior years increased by $0.6 million in 2016, increased by $1.8 million in 2015 and decreased by $0.5 million in 2014. The unfavorable development in 2016 is primarily related to reserve strengthening on run-off programs in our Program Services segment ($1.1 million).  The 

 
  17

 
unfavorable development in 2015 is primarily related to reserve strengthening on run-off programs in our Program Services segment ($2.0 million).  The favorable development in 2014 is primarily due to $0.7 million of favorable development in our Lender Services segment.  All of these changes were the result of the re-estimation of unpaid losses and LAE due to ongoing analyses of recent loss development trends as new data becomes available. We had no significant changes in reserving assumptions or methodologies.  See “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—Note 11. Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses” in Part IV of this report.
     Technology
     Our Lender Services segment uses proprietary systems which are designed to deliver and manage the CPI business. Our proprietary insurance tracking system, InsurTrak, delivers real-time visibility to us and our clients into the most current borrower insurance information. In addition to InsurTrak, the other key aspects of the IT platform include the system of record for policy administration and the claims system.  Our Program Services segment also uses proprietary systems. Key systems include the system of record for accounting transactions, the collateral management system and a projection system.     Employees
     We had over 400 employees at December 31, 2016, none of whom is covered by a collective bargaining agreement.  We believe that our employee relationships are good.
     Regulation
     General
     We are subject to extensive regulation in the United States.  SNIC, and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, NSIC and USIC, together operate in all fifty states and the District of Columbia.  CNIC is a wholly-owned subsidiary of USIC and operates in fourty-nine states and the District of Columbia.  SNIC, NSIC and CNIC are Texas domiciled insurers while USIC is domiciled in Delaware.     State Insurance Regulation
     Insurance companies are subject to regulation and supervision by the department of insurance in the jurisdiction in which they are domiciled and, to a lesser extent, other jurisdictions in which they are authorized to conduct business. The primary purpose of such regulatory powers is to protect individual policyholders. State insurance authorities have broad regulatory, supervisory and administrative powers, including, among other things, the power to (a) grant and revoke licenses to transact business, including individual lines of authority, (b) set the standards of solvency to be met and maintained, (c) determine the nature of, and limitations on, investments and dividends, (d) approve policy rules, rates and forms prior to issuance, (e) regulate and conduct specific examinations regarding marketing, unfair trade, claims and fraud prevention and investigation practices, and (f) conduct periodic comprehensive examinations of the financial condition of insurance companies domiciled in their state. In particular, commercial policy rates and forms are closely regulated in all states.     Financial Oversight
     Reporting Requirements
     Our insurance subsidiaries are required to file detailed financial statements prepared in accordance with statutory accounting principles and other reports with the departments of insurance in all states in which they are licensed to transact business, either directly or through the NAIC. These reports include details concerning claims reserves held by the insurer, specific investments held by the insurer, and numerous other disclosures about the insurer’s financial condition and operations. These financial statements are subject to periodic examination by the department of insurance in each state in which they are filed.

 Investments
     State insurance laws and insurance departments also regulate investments that insurers are permitted to make. Limitations are placed on the amounts an insurer may invest in a particular issuer, as well as the aggregate amount an insurer may invest in certain types of investments. Certain investments are prohibited.     State Insurance Department Examinations
     As part of their regulatory oversight process, state insurance departments conduct periodic detailed financial examinations of insurance companies domiciled in their states, generally once every three to five years. Examinations are generally carried out in cooperation with the insurance departments of other states under guidelines promulgated by the NAIC.
     A second type of regulatory oversight examination of insurance companies involves a review by an insurance department of an authorized company’s market conduct, which entails a review and examination of a company’s compliance with laws governing marketing, underwriting, rating, policy-issuance, claims-handling and other aspects of its insurance business during a specified period of time.
     The results of these examinations can give rise to regulatory orders requiring remedial, injunctive or other corrective action on the part of the Company that is the subject of the examination or assessing fines or other penalties against that company.
     Risk-Based Capital Regulations
     Our insurance subsidiaries are required to report their risk-based capital based on a formula developed and adopted by the NAIC that attempts to measure statutory capital and surplus needs based on the risks in the insurer’s mix of products and investment portfolio. The formula is designed to allow insurance regulators to identify weakly-capitalized companies. Under the formula, a company determines its “risk-based capital” by taking into account certain risks related to the insurer’s assets (including risks related to its investment portfolio and ceded reinsurance) and the insurer’s liabilities (including underwriting risks related to the nature and experience of its insurance business). The departments of insurance in our domiciliary states of Texas and Delaware generally require a minimum total adjusted risk-based capital equal to 200% of an insurance company’s authorized control level risk-based capital. Each of our insurance subsidiaries had total adjusted risk-based capital in excess of 200% of the authorized control level as of December 31, 2016.
     In our calculation of risk-based capital for SNIC and NSIC, we have deducted amounts for which SNIC and NSIC hold collateral for amounts recoverable from reinsurers.  We believe this practice to be appropriate because we bear little credit risk for the related reinsurance balances due to the protection provided by the collateral.  This practice differs from NAIC statutory annual statement instructions.  There is no monetary effect on net income or statutory surplus from the use of this practice.  If we would have used the practice outlined in NAIC annual statement instructions, the risk-based capital calculation for SNIC and NSIC would not have triggered a regulatory event.  
     Insurance Regulatory Information System Ratios
     The NAIC Insurance Regulatory Information System (“IRIS”) is part of a collection of analytical tools designed to provide state insurance regulators with an integrated approach to screening and analyzing the financial condition of insurance companies operating in their respective states.  IRIS is intended to assist state insurance regulators in targeting resources to those insurers in greatest need of regulatory attention.  IRIS consists of two phases: statistical and analytical. In the statistical phase, the NAIC database generates key financial ratio results based on financial information obtained from insurers’ annual statutory statements.  The analytical phase is a review of the annual statements, financial ratios and other automated solvency tools.  The primary goal of the analytical phase is to identify companies that appear to require immediate regulatory attention.  A ratio result falling outside the usual range of IRIS ratios is not considered a failing result; rather, unusual values are viewed as part of the regulatory early monitoring system.  Furthermore, in some years, it may not be unusual for financially sound companies to have several ratios with results outside the usual ranges.  An 

 
  19

 
insurance company may fall out of the usual range for one or more ratios because of specific transactions that are in themselves immaterial or because of certain reinsurance or pooling structures or changes in such structures.
     In 2016 and 2015, our insurance subsidiaries (other than CNIC) had two ratios departing from the usual range of values.  It is not uncommon for our insurance subsidiaries to have unusual values for a few IRIS ratios because of our specialized business model.  These deviations are primarily caused by the high volume of ceded premium in our Program Services segment and the low interest rate environment over the last few years, along with a lower investment yield in SNIC because a large portion of its investment portfolio is investment in subsidiaries.  In 2016, CNIC, our recently acquired licensed shell company through which we have not yet written business, had four ratios depart from the usual range of values related to the Company’s purchase of CNIC.
     Statutory Accounting Principles
     Statutory accounting principles (“SAP”) are a basis of accounting developed to assist insurance regulators in monitoring and regulating the solvency of insurance companies. SAP is primarily concerned with measuring an insurer’s solvency. Statutory accounting focuses on valuing assets and liabilities of insurers at financial reporting dates in accordance with appropriate insurance law and regulatory provisions applicable in each insurer’s domiciliary state.
     GAAP is concerned with a company’s solvency, but is also concerned with other financial measurements, principally income and cash flows. Accordingly, GAAP gives more consideration to appropriately matching revenue and expenses and accounting for management’s stewardship of assets than does SAP. As a direct result, different assets and liabilities and different amounts of assets and liabilities will be reflected in financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP as compared to SAP.
     Potential Restrictions on Fronting 
     In certain states, including Florida and Kentucky, the Insurance Commissioner has the authority to prohibit an authorized insurer from acting as an issuing carrier for an unauthorized insurer.  In addition, insurance departments in states in which there is no statutory or regulatory prohibition against an authorized insurer acting as an issuing carrier for an unauthorized insurer could deem the assuming insurer to be transacting insurance business without a license and the issuing carrier to be aiding and abetting the unauthorized sale of insurance. Notwithstanding these state law restrictions on ceding insurers, the Nonadmitted and Reinsurance Reform Act (“NRRA”) contained in the Dodd-Frank Act provides that all laws of a ceding insurer’s nondomestic state (except those with respect to taxes and assessments on insurers or insurance income) are preempted to the extent that they otherwise apply the laws of the state to reinsurance agreements of nondomestic ceding insurers. The NRRA places the power to regulate reinsurer financial solvency primarily with the reinsurer’s domiciliary state and requires credit for reinsurance to be recognized for a nondomestic ceding company if it is allowed by the ceding company’s domiciliary state.     Credit for Reinsurance
     State insurance laws permit U.S. insurance companies, as ceding insurers, to take financial statement credit for reinsurance that is ceded, so long as the assuming reinsurer satisfies the state’s credit for reinsurance laws.  The NRRA provides that if the state of domicile of a ceding insurer is an NAIC accredited state, or has financial solvency requirements substantially similar to the requirements necessary for NAIC accreditation, and recognizes credit for reinsurance for the insurer’s ceded risk, then no other state may deny such credit for reinsurance.  Because all states are currently accredited by the NAIC, the Dodd-Frank Act prohibits a state in which a U.S. ceding insurer is licensed but not domiciled from denying credit for reinsurance for the insurer’s ceded risk if the cedant’s domestic state regulator recognizes credit for reinsurance.  The ceding company in this instance is permitted to reflect in its statutory financial statements a credit in an aggregate amount equal to the ceding company’s liability for unearned premium (which are that portion of premiums written which applies to the unexpired portion of the policy period), loss reserves and loss expense reserves to the extent ceded to the reinsurer.

 Holding Company Regulation
     We qualify as a holding company system under state-enacted legislation that regulates insurance holding company systems. Each insurance company in a holding company system is required to register with the insurance regulatory agency of its state of domicile and periodically furnish information concerning its operations and transactions, particularly with other companies within the holding company system that may materially affect its operations, management or financial condition.     Transactions with Affiliates
     The insurance laws in most of those states provide that all transactions among members of an insurance holding company system must be fair and reasonable. These laws require disclosure of material transactions within the holding company system and, in some cases, prior notice of or approval for certain transactions, including, among other things, (a) the payment of certain dividends, (b) cost sharing agreements, (c) intercompany agency, service or management agreements, (d) acquisition or divestment of control of or merger with domestic insurers, (e) sales, purchases, exchanges, loans or extensions of credit, guarantees or investments if such transactions are equal to or exceed certain thresholds, and (f) reinsurance agreements. All transactions within a holding company system affecting an insurer must have fair and reasonable terms and are subject to other standards and requirements established by law and regulation.     Dividends
     Our insurance subsidiaries are subject to statutory requirements as to maintenance of policyholders’ surplus and payment of dividends. In general, including in our domiciliary states, the maximum amount of dividends that the insurance subsidiaries may pay in any 12-month period without regulatory approval is the greater of adjusted statutory net income or 10% of statutory policyholders’ surplus as of the preceding calendar year end. Adjusted statutory net income is generally defined for this purpose to be statutory net income, net of realized capital gains, for the calendar year preceding the date of the dividend. The maximum amount of dividends that our insurance subsidiaries could pay without regulatory approval was $26.9 million and $23.0 million as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Also, most states, including Texas and Delaware, restrict an insurance company’s ability to pay dividends in excess of its statutory unassigned surplus or earned surplus. In addition, state insurance regulators may limit or restrict an insurance company’s ability to pay shareholder dividends or as a condition to issuance of a certificate of authority, as a condition to a change of control approval or for other regulatory reasons.     Enterprise Risk and Other New Developments
     In December 2010, the NAIC adopted amendments to the Model Insurance Holding Company System Regulation Act and Regulation (the “Amended Model Act and Regulation”) to introduce the concept of “enterprise risk” within an insurance company holding system. “Enterprise risk” is defined as any activity, circumstance, event or series of events involving one or more affiliates of an insurer that, if not remedied promptly, is likely to have a material adverse effect upon the financial condition or the liquidity of the insurer or its insurance holding company system as a whole. The Amended Model Act and Regulation imposes more extensive informational requirements on an insurance holding company system in order to protect the licensed insurance companies from enterprise risk, including requiring it to prepare an annual enterprise risk report that identifies the material risks within the insurance company holding system that could pose enterprise risk to the licensed insurer. In addition, the Amended Model Act and Regulation requires any controlling person of a domestic insurer seeking to divest its controlling interest in the domestic insurer to file a notice of its proposed divestiture, which may be subject to approval by the insurance commissioner.  Many states have adopted some or all of the changes in the Amended Model Act and Regulation, including Texas and Delaware, where our insurance subsidiaries are domiciled. The NAIC has made certain sections of the amendments part of its accreditation standards for state solvency regulation, which may motivate more states to adopt the amendments.     Change of Control
     State insurance holding company laws require prior approval by the respective state insurance departments of any change of control of an insurer. “Control” is generally defined as the possession, direct or indirect, of the power to direct 

 
  21

 
or cause the direction of the management and policies of the Company, whether through the ownership of voting securities, by contract or otherwise. Control is generally presumed to exist through the direct or indirect ownership of 10% or more of the voting securities of a domestic insurance company or any entity that controls a domestic insurance company. Any person wishing to acquire control of us or of any substantial portion of our outstanding shares would first be required to obtain the approval of the domestic regulators of our insurance subsidiaries (and in any other state in which the Company may be deemed to be commercially domiciled by reason of concentration of its insurance business within such state) and may also require pre-notification in certain other states. Obtaining these approvals may result in the material delay of, or deter, any such transaction.
     In addition, insurance laws in many states, including Texas and Delaware (the domiciliary states of our insurance company subsidiaries), contain provisions that require pre- and post-notification to the insurance departments of a change of control of certain non-domestic insurance companies licensed in those states, as well as post-notification of a change of control of certain agencies and third-party administrators. Texas has a prior notification for a change of control of an insurance agency and third party administrator.
     These laws may discourage potential acquisition proposals and may delay, deter or prevent a change of control of us, including through transactions, and in particular unsolicited transactions, that some or all of our shareholders might consider to be desirable.
     Market Conduct
     Regulation of Insurance Rates and Approval of Policy Forms
     The insurance laws of most states in which we conduct business require insurance companies to file insurance rate schedules and insurance policy forms for review and approval. If, as permitted in some states, we begin using new rates before they are approved, we may be required to issue refunds or credits to the policyholders if the new rates are ultimately deemed excessive or unfair and disapproved by the applicable state regulator. In other states, prior approval of rate changes is required and there may be long delays in the approval process or the rates may not be approved. Accordingly, our ability to respond to market developments or increased costs in that state can be adversely affected.     Underwriting
     The use of credit in underwriting and rating is the subject of significant regulatory and legislative activity. Regulators and legislators have expressed a number of concerns related to the use of credit, including: questions regarding the accuracy of credit reports, perceptions that credit may have a disparate effect on the poor and certain minority groups, the perceived lack of a demonstrated causal relationship between credit and insurance risk, the treatment of persons with limited or no credit, the impact on credit of extraordinary life events (e.g., catastrophic injury or death of a spouse), and the credit attributes applied in the credit scoring models used by insurers. A number of state insurance departments have issued bulletins, directives, or regulations that regulate or prohibit the use of credit by insurers. In addition, a number of states are considering or have passed legislation to regulate insurers’ use of credit information. The use of credit information continues to be a regulatory and legislative issue, and it is possible that the U.S. Congress or one or more states may enact further legislation affecting its use in underwriting and rating limitations on the ability to charge policy fees.     Unfair Claims Practices
     Generally, insurance companies, adjusting companies and individual claims adjusters are prohibited by state statutes from engaging in unfair claims practices on a flagrant basis or with such frequency to indicate a general business practice. Unfair claims practices include:
· | misrepresenting pertinent facts or insurance policy provisions relating to coverages at issue;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | failing to acknowledge and act reasonably promptly upon communications with respect to claims arising under insurance policies;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
 
  22

 

    
· | failing to adopt and implement reasonable standards for the prompt investigation and settlement of claims arising under its policies;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | failing to affirm or deny coverage of claims within a reasonable time after proof of loss statements have been completed;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | attempting to settle a claim for less than the amount to which a reasonable person would have believed such person was entitled;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | attempting to settle claims on the basis of an application that was altered without notice to or knowledge or consent of the insured;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | compelling insureds to institute suits to recover amounts due under policies by offering substantially less than the amounts ultimately recovered in suits brought by them;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | refusing to pay claims without conducting a reasonable investigation;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------


· | making claim payments to an insured without indicating the coverage under which each payment is being made;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | delaying the investigation or payment of claims by requiring an insured, claimant or the physician of either to submit a preliminary claim report and then requiring the subsequent submission of formal proof of loss forms, both of which submissions contains substantially the same information;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | failing, in the case of claim denials or offers of compromise or settlement, to promptly provide a reasonable and accurate explanation of the basis for such actions; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | not attempting in good faith to effectuate prompt, fair and equitable settlements of claims in which liability has become reasonably clear.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

      Guaranty Fund Assessments
     Most, if not all, of the states where we are licensed to transact business require that property and casualty insurers doing business within the state participate in a guaranty association, which is organized to pay contractual benefits owed pursuant to insurance policies issued by impaired, insolvent or failed insurers. These associations levy assessments, up to prescribed limits, on all member insurers in a particular state on the basis of the proportionate share of the premiums written by the member insurers in the lines of business in which the impaired, insolvent or failed insurer is engaged. Some states permit member insurers to recover assessments paid through full or partial premium tax offsets.
     Property and casualty insurance company insolvencies or failures may result in additional guaranty association assessments to our insurance subsidiaries at some future date. At this time, we are unable to determine the impact, if any, such assessments may have on their financial positions or results of their operations. As of December 31, 2016, each of our insurance subsidiaries has established accruals for guaranty fund assessments with respect to insurers that are currently subject to insolvency proceedings.
     Creditor-Placed Insurance
     The NAIC Creditor-Placed Insurance Model Act (“Creditor-Placed Model Act”) applies to insurance placed in connection with automobile loans and creates a legal framework within which creditor-placed insurance may be written and helps to maintain the separation between creditors and insurers.  It also serves to minimize the possibilities of unfair competitive practices in the sale of creditor-placed insurance. The Creditor-Placed Model Act has only been adopted by a few states, including Arkansas, Michigan, Mississippi, and Tennessee, but other states have also adopted laws and regulations that cover creditor-placed insurance.  There could be an effort, especially from consumer groups, to expand 

 
  23

 
the protections and breadth of the Creditor-Placed Model Act.  The NAIC Property and Casualty Insurance Committee is currently reviewing the Model Act and is tentatively scheduled to provide its proposed revisions (if any) in 2017.
     Restrictions on Withdrawal, Cancellation, and Nonrenewal
     In addition, many states have laws and regulations that limit an insurer’s ability to withdraw from a particular market. For example, states may limit an insurer’s ability to cancel or not renew policies. Furthermore, certain states prohibit an insurer from withdrawing from one or more lines of business written in the state, except pursuant to a plan that is approved by the state insurance department. The state insurance department may disapprove any proposed plan that may lead to market disruption. Laws and regulations that limit cancellation and non-renewal and that subject program withdrawals to prior approval requirements may restrict the ability of our insurance subsidiaries to exit unprofitable markets.     Required Licensing
     Our Texas domiciled insurance subsidiaries operate under licenses issued by the department of insurance in the states in which they sell insurance. Our Delaware insurance subsidiary operates under a license issued by the Delaware Department of Insurance, but in all other state and the District of Columbia writes on a nonadmitted and surplus lines basis. If a regulatory authority denies or delays granting a new license, our ability to offer new insurance products in that market may be substantially impaired. In addition, if the department of insurance in any state in which one of our insurance subsidiaries currently operates suspends, non-renews, or revokes an existing license, we would not be able to offer affected products in the state.     Licensing of Producers and Other Entities
     Insurance agencies, producers, third-party administrators, claims adjusters and service contract providers and administrators are subject to licensing requirements and regulation by insurance regulators in various states in which they conduct business. Our agency and services company, T.B.A. Insurance Group, Ltd., engages in certain of these functions and is subject to licensing requirements and regulation by insurance regulators in various states.     Federal and State Legislative and Regulatory Changes
     From time to time, various regulatory and legislative changes have been proposed in the insurance industry. Among the proposals that have in the past been or are at present being considered are the possible introduction of federal regulation in addition to, or in lieu of, the current system of state regulation of insurers and proposals in various state legislatures (some of which have been enacted) to conform portions of their insurance laws and regulations to various model acts adopted by the NAIC. The NAIC has undertaken a Solvency Modernization Initiative focused on updating the U.S. insurance solvency regulation framework, including capital requirements, governance and risk management, group supervision, accounting and financial reporting and reinsurance. The Amended Model Act and Regulation (discussed above) is a result of these efforts. Additional requirements are also expected. For example, the NAIC has adopted the Risk Management and Own Risk and Solvency Assessment (“ORSA”) Model Act, which when adopted by the states, will require insurers to perform an ORSA and, upon request of a state, file an ORSA Summary Report with the state. The Company met the required threshold for filing the ORSA Summary Report in 2015 and filed its first report in 2016.
     On July 21, 2010, the President signed into law the Dodd-Frank Act that established a Federal Insurance Office within the U.S. Department of the Treasury. The Federal Insurance Office (“FIO”) initially is charged with monitoring all aspects of the insurance industry (other than health insurance, certain long-term care insurance and crop insurance), gathering data, and conducting a study on methods to modernize and improve the insurance regulatory system in the United States.  On December 12, 2013, the FIO issued a report (as required under the Dodd-Frank Act) entitled “How to Modernize and Improve the System of Insurance Regulation in the United States” (the “Report”), which stated that, given the “uneven” progress the states have made with several near-term state reforms, should the states fail to accomplish the necessary modernization reforms in the near term, “Congress should strongly consider direct federal involvement.” The FIO continues to support the current state-based regulatory regime, but will consider federal 

 
  24

 
regulation should the states fail to take steps to greater uniformity (e.g., federal licensing of insurers). The Report also appears to signal greater activity by the federal government in dealing with non-U.S. regulators and regulatory regimes, using the authority expressly given by the Dodd-Frank Act to the U.S. Department of the Treasury and the United States Trade Representative to negotiate “covered agreements” with foreign authorities. The Report also makes recommendations in the areas of insurance sector solvency and marketplace regulation. Each year the FIO also releases an annual report on the insurance industry (“Annual Report”), with its latest Annual Report released in September of 2016. The Annual Report provided a set of recommendations along with providing an overview of the financial performance and condition of the U.S. insurance industry and outlining a number of insurance industry and regulatory developments from the past year.
     In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act gives the Federal Reserve supervisory authority over a number of financial services companies, including insurance companies, if they are designated by a two-thirds vote of a Financial Stability Oversight Council as “systemically important.” If an insurance company is designated as systemically important, the Federal Reserve’s supervisory authority could include the ability to impose heightened financial regulation upon that insurance company and could impact requirements regarding its capital, liquidity and leverage as well as its business and investment conduct.
     The Dodd-Frank Act also incorporates the NRRA, which became effective on July 21, 2011. Among other things, the NRRA establishes national uniform standards on how states may regulate and tax surplus lines insurance and sets national standards concerning the regulation of reinsurance. In particular, the NRRA gives regulators in the home state of an insured exclusive authority to regulate and tax surplus lines insurance transactions, and regulators in a ceding insurer’s state of domicile the sole responsibility for regulating the balance sheet credit that the ceding insurer may take for reinsurance recoverables.
     Other possible federal regulatory developments include the introduction of legislation in Congress that would repeal the McCarran-Ferguson Act antitrust exemption for the insurance industry. The antitrust exemption allows insurers to compile and share loss data, develop standard policy forms and manuals and predict future loss costs with greater reliability, among other things. The ability of the industry, under the exemption permitted in the McCarran-Ferguson Act, to collect loss cost data and build a credible database as a means of predicting future loss costs is an important part of cost-based pricing. If the ability to collect this data were removed, the predictability of future loss costs and the reliability of pricing could be undermined.
     Privacy Regulations
     In 1999, Congress enacted the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, which, among other things, protects consumers from the unauthorized dissemination of certain personal information. Subsequently, states have implemented additional regulations to address privacy issues. Certain aspects of these laws and regulations apply to all financial institutions, including insurance and finance companies, and require us to maintain appropriate policies and procedures for managing and protecting certain personal information of our policyholders. We may also be subject to future privacy laws and regulations, which could impose additional costs and impact our results of operations or financial condition. In 2000, the NAIC adopted the Privacy of Consumer Financial and Health Information Model Regulation, which assisted states in promulgating regulations to comply with the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act. In 2002, to further facilitate the implementation of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, the NAIC adopted the Standards for Safeguarding Customer Information Model Regulation. Many states have now adopted similar provisions regarding the safeguarding of policyholder information.     Telephone Sales Regulations
     The United States Congress, the Federal Communications Commission and various states have promulgated and enacted rules and laws that govern telephone solicitations. There are numerous state statutes and regulations governing telephone sales activities that do or may apply to our operations, including the operations of our call center insurance agencies. For example, some states place restrictions on the methods and timing of calls and require that certain 

 
  25

 
mandatory disclosures be made during the course of a telephone sales call. Federal and state “Do Not Call” regulations must be followed for us to engage in telephone sales activities.        Available Information
