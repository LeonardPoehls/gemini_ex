(1) | Ark-La-Tex Basin assets also include 14,500 Bbl/d of fractionation capacity and 6,300 Bbl/d of ethane pipeline capacity, which are not listed in the table.

Our natural gas gathering assets include approximately 13,000 miles of natural gas gathering pipelines as of December 31, 2017. Our natural gas gathering systems consist of networks of pipelines that collect natural gas from points at or near our customers’ wells for delivery to plants for processing or pipelines for transportation. Natural gas is moved from the receipt points to the delivery points on our gathering systems by the use of compression. 
Our natural gas processing assets included 15 natural gas processing plants with 2,550 MMcf/d of inlet capacity as of December 31, 2017. Natural gas is comprised primarily of methane, but at the wellhead natural gas may contain varying amounts of NGLs. Our processing plants recover NGLs from natural gas and primarily deliver NGLs and natural gas to pipelines for transportation. The following table sets forth information with respect to our natural gas processing plants as of or for the year ended December 31, 2017:

(3) | A processing plant has been in operation on the Waskom plant site since 1940. The Waskom plant was upgraded to cryogenic in 1995.

The natural gas gathering and processing assets in the Anadarko Basin include 11 processing plants, 10 of which are interconnected through our super-header system. The super-header system is configured to facilitate the flow of natural gas across 
8

our operating areas in western Oklahoma and the Texas Panhandle to the Bradley II, Bradley, McClure, Wheeler, South Canadian, Clinton, Canute, Cox City, Thomas and Calumet processing plants. The super-header system allows us to optimize the utilization of the connected processing plants.
Crude Oil Gathering. As of December 31, 2017, we had approximately 175 miles of crude oil gathering pipelines and approximately 160 miles of produced water gathering pipelines in the Bakken Shale of the Williston Basin. Our crude oil gathering systems have a combined design capacity of 57.9 MBbl/d, and as of December 31, 2017, we had 0.2 million gross acres dedicated under a crude oil gathering agreement. For the year ended December 31, 2017, we had an average daily throughput of 25.56 MBbl/d of crude oil and an average daily throughput of 9.7 MBbl/d of produced water on our Williston Basin gathering system.
Our Williston Basin crude oil gathering assets are located in Dunn, McKenzie, Williams and Mountrail Counties in North Dakota. These systems were designed and built to serve the crude oil production of XTO in these areas. On our systems, crude oil is received on crude oil gathering pipelines near our customer’s wells for delivery to third party transportation pipelines, and produced water is received by produced water gathering pipelines for delivery to third party disposal wells. We do not take title to crude oil or produced water gathered and we do not own or operate produced water disposal wells. 
Delivery Points. Natural gas that is gathered, and when applicable, processed, is typically redelivered to our customers at interconnections with transportation pipelines. Our gathering lines interconnect with both our interstate and intrastate pipelines, as well as other interstate and intrastate pipelines, including the Acadian, ANR, ETC Tiger, Gulf Crossing, Gulf South, NGPL, Northern Natural, Panhandle Eastern, Regency, Southern Natural Gas, Tennessee Gas and Texas Eastern Transmission pipelines. These connections provide producers with access to a variety of natural gas market hubs.
Crude oil gathered on our Williston Basin gathering systems in Dunn and McKenzie Counties can be redelivered to our customers through interconnections to the BakkenLink Pipeline and the Dakota Access Pipeline. Crude oil gathered on our Williston Basin gathering systems in Williams and Mountrail Counties can be redelivered to our customers through interconnections to the Enbridge North Dakota Pipeline and the Dakota Access Pipeline. 

We typically purchase the NGLs produced at our processing plants, and most of the NGLs are delivered into third-party pipelines and transported to Conway, Kansas, or Mont Belvieu, Texas, where the NGLs are exchanged for fractionated NGLs that are sold under contract or on the spot market. At our Cox City, Calumet and Wetumka plants, we operate depropanizers that allow us to extract propane from the NGL stream and sell propane to local markets. Additionally, we operate a fractionator at our Waskom plant and sell ethane, propane, butane and natural gasoline to local markets. 

Customers. We generate revenues from producers in the basins in which we operate. For the year ended December 31, 2017, our top natural gas gathering and processing customers by gathered volumes were Continental Resources, Inc. (Continental), Vine Oil and Gas (Vine), GeoSouthern Energy Corporation (GeoSouthern), XTO, Tapstone Energy LLC (Tapstone), Apache Corporation (Apache), BP America Production Company (BP), affiliates of Chesapeake Energy Corporation (Chesapeake), Covey Park Energy LLC (Covey Park) and FourPoint Energy, LLC (FourPoint). For the year ended December 31, 2017, our top ten natural gas producer customers accounted for approximately 70% of our gathered natural gas volumes. 

Our Williston Basin gathering systems serve XTO. The rates and terms of service on our Williston Basin crude oil gathering systems are regulated by FERC under the Interstate Commerce Act, but our Williston Basin produced water gathering systems are not FERC regulated. As of December 31, 2017, XTO was our only customer on these systems.
Contracts. Our contracts typically provide for natural gas and crude oil gathering services that are fee-based and for natural gas processing arrangements that are fee-based, or percent-of-liquids, percent-of-proceeds or keep-whole based. 

• | Under a typical fee-based processing arrangement, we process the raw natural gas to extract the NGLs, purchase the NGLs from the producer less a fee, return the processed natural gas to the producer and sell the NGLs for our own account.


• | Under a typical percent-of-liquids processing arrangement, we process the raw natural gas to extract the NGLs, purchase the NGLs from the producer at a discount, return the processed natural gas to the producer and sell the NGLs for our own account.


• | Under a typical percent-of-proceeds processing arrangement, we process the raw natural gas to extract the NGLs, purchase the NGLs and an agreed upon percentage of the processed natural gas from the producer at a discount, return the remaining processed natural gas to the producer and sell the purchased natural gas and NGLs for our own account.

• | Under a typical keep-whole arrangement, we process raw natural gas to extract the NGLs, return a quantity of the processed natural gas to the producer that is equivalent to the raw natural gas on a Btu basis and retain and sell the NGLs for our own account.

 For the year ended December 31, 2017, 58%, 35% and 7% of our inlet volumes were under processing arrangements that were fee-based, percent-of-proceeds or percent-of-liquids, and keep-whole, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2017, 74% of our gathering and processing gross margin was fee-based, and the remaining 26% of our gathering and processing gross margin was primarily from sales of commodities, including natural gas, natural gas liquids and condensate received under percent-of-proceeds, percent-of-liquids and keep-whole arrangements. 
In lean gas areas, such as the eastern Arkoma Basin and the Haynesville Shale of the Ark-La-Tex Basin, some of our natural gas gathering contracts contain minimum volume commitments from our customers. In addition, a portion of the crude oil gathered by our crude oil gathering system is under a contract with a minimum volume commitment. Under a minimum volume commitment, a customer agrees to either deliver a minimum volume of natural gas or crude oil to our system for service or pay the service fees for the minimum volume of natural gas or crude oil regardless of whether or not the minimum volume of natural gas or crude oil is delivered. We call any payment for the difference between the volume gathered and the minimum volume committed a shortfall payment. Some of our contracts provide our customers the option to elect to pay a higher gathering fee over the remaining term of the contract in lieu of making a shortfall payment. As of December 31, 2017, the percentage of our gathering and processing gross margin attributable to natural gas gathering contracts with minimum volume commitments, and the volume commitment-weighted average remaining terms of those contracts, were as follows: 

 | Anadarko Basin | Arkoma Basin | | Ark-La-Tex Basin | Williston Basin (2) | | Total
Percentage of gathering and processing gross margin attributable to gathering contracts with minimum volume commitments | — | | 7 | % | 18 | % | | 2 | % | 27 | %
Percentage attributable to shortfall payments (1) | — | | 80 | % | 39 | % | | — | | 47 | %
Volume commitment-weighted average remaining contract term (in years) | — | | 5.9 | | 2.1 | | | 11.2 | | 3.7 | 

____________________

(1) | Represents the percentage of gathering and processing gross margin from gathering contracts with minimum volume commitments that were attributable to shortfall payments.


(2) | Under the Williston Basin contracts, if the customer ships in excess of the minimum volume, this volume commitment could end before the expiration of the contract term.


For our gathering and processing contracts that do not have minimum volume commitments, we strive to obtain acreage dedications. Under an acreage dedication, a customer agrees to deliver all of the natural gas or crude oil produced from a given area to our system for gathering, and, if applicable, processing. As of December 31, 2017, the gross acres dedicated under gathering agreements and the volume-weighted average remaining term for all gathering and processing contracts were as follows: 

 | Anadarko Basin | Arkoma Basin | | Ark-La-Tex Basin | Williston Basin | Total
Gross acreage dedication (in millions) | 5.0 | | 1.7 | | 0.8 | | 0.2 | 7.7
Volume-weighted average remaining contract term (in years) | 6.1 | | 2.3 | | 5.4 | | 11.9 | 5.5

Construction. Our gathering and processing business involves the construction of natural gas and crude oil gathering assets and natural gas processing assets as needed to serve our existing and new customers. For example, during the year ended December 31, 2017, we constructed 210 miles of gathering pipelines, added 59,600 horsepower of compression and invested $264 million in the construction of gathering and processing assets. In addition, the Partnership entered into an agreement to deliver approximately 400 MMcf/d of rich natural gas from the Anadarko Basin to north Texas, providing a new market outlet for growing Anadarko Basin production. The project is expected to be in service by the end of the second quarter of 2018. Even with the 400 MMcf/d of processing capacity provided by this project, the Partnership anticipates that there will be a need to resume construction of the previously announced Wildhorse Plant, a cryogenic processing facility we plan to connect to our super-header system in Garvin County Oklahoma, though likely not before 2019.
Acquisitions. In the fourth quarter of 2017, we acquired Align Midstream, LLC, a midstream company with natural gas gathering and processing facilities in the Cotton Valley and Haynesville plays of the Ark-La-Tex Basin. The acquisition included approximately 190 miles of natural gas gathering pipelines across Rusk, Panola and Shelby counties in Texas and DeSoto Parish in Louisiana and a cryogenic natural gas processing plant in Panola County, Texas, with a capacity of 100 MMcf/d.

Competition. Competition to gather and process natural gas is primarily a function of gathering rate, processing value, system reliability, fuel rate, system run time, construction cycle time and prices at the wellhead. Our gathering and processing systems compete with gatherers and processors of all types and sizes, including those affiliated with various producers, other major pipeline companies and various independent midstream entities. In the process of selling NGLs, we compete against other natural gas processors extracting and selling NGLs. Our primary competitors are other midstream companies who are active in the regions where we operate.
Competition to gather crude oil and produced water is primarily a function of rates, terms of service, system reliability and construction cycle time. The rates and terms of service of our crude oil gathering, but not our produced water gathering, are FERC regulated. Our Williston Basin gathering systems compete with other gatherers, including those affiliated with producers and other midstream companies. 
Seasonality. While the results of our gathering and processing segment are not materially affected by seasonality, from time to time our operations and construction of assets can be impacted by inclement weather. 
Transportation and Storage

We own and operate interstate and intrastate transportation and storage systems across nine states. Our transportation and storage systems consist primarily of our interstate systems, EGT and MRT, our intrastate system, EOIT, and our investment in SESH. Our transportation and storage assets transport natural gas from areas of production and interconnected pipelines to power plants, LDCs and industrial end users as well as interconnected pipelines for delivery to additional markets. Our transportation and storage assets also provide facilities where natural gas can be stored by customers. 
The following table sets forth certain information regarding our transportation and storage assets as of or for the year ended December 31, 2017:

Through EGT’s interconnection with SESH, our customers have access to the Southeast power generation market. Through our interconnections with other pipelines, our customers have access to the Midwest and Northeast markets. Many of EGT’s interconnections are at our Perryville Hub, which provides the ability to move natural gas between 11 major interstate pipelines. As a result, EGT provides our customers with access to not only natural gas consuming markets in Oklahoma, Louisiana, Texas and Arkansas, but also most of the major natural gas consuming markets east of the Mississippi River. In addition, EGT provides our customers supplying those markets with access to natural gas from producing basins and shale plays across the Mid-continent, including the Anadarko, Arkoma and Ark-La-Tex basins and the Barnett, Fayetteville, Granite Wash, Haynesville, SCOOP and STACK plays.

Customers. EGT primarily serves LDCs owned by CenterPoint Energy, producers in key plays in the Mid-continent, power plants, other LDCs and industrial end-users. EGT’s customers are primarily located in Arkansas, Louisiana, Oklahoma and Texas. For the year ended December 31, 2017, approximately 28% of EGT’s service revenue was attributable to contracts with LDCs owned by CenterPoint Energy with a volume-weighted average contract life of 3.0 years for transportation contracts and 3.2 years for storage contracts. In addition to CenterPoint Energy’s LDCs, EGT’s other major customers include Continental, AEP, Chesapeake and XTO.
Contracts. Although EGT has established maximum rates for interstate transportation and storage services as required by FERC, EGT is authorized to enter into negotiated rate and discounted rate agreements with its customers. EGT’s services are 
13

typically provided under firm, fee-based transportation and storage agreements. For the year ended December 31, 2017, approximately 53% of our transportation and storage gross margin was derived from EGT’s firm contracts, 70% of EGT’s transportation capacity was under firm contracts with a volume-weighted average remaining contract life of 3.2 years, and 75% of EGT’s storage capacity was under firm contracts with a volume-weighted average remaining contract life of 3.2 years. EGT’s firm transportation contracts representing 10% of CenterPoint Energy’s LDCs firm transportation capacity are scheduled to expire in March 2018 and 90% are scheduled to expire in March 2021. All of CenterPoint Energy’s LDCs firm storage contracts with EGT are scheduled to expire in March 2021.
Seasonality. EGT provides gas transmission delivery services to LDCs owned by CenterPoint in Arkansas, Louisiana, Oklahoma and Texas. Customer demand for natural gas on EGT is usually greater during the winter, primarily due to LDC demand to serve residential and commercial natural gas requirements. In addition, EGT experiences seasonal impacts associated with storage spreads and basis spreads on interconnected pipelines, as well as power plant demand.
Competition. EGT competes with a variety of other interstate and intrastate pipelines across Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas and Louisiana. Our management views the principal elements of competition among pipelines as rates and terms, flexibility and reliability of service. EGT provides both flexibility and reliability of service with access to multiple sources of supply in the Anadarko, Arkoma and Ark-La-Tex Basins and access to multiple markets in the Midwest, Northeast and Southeast through interconnections with other pipelines. EGT’s interconnections with other pipelines are primarily at our Perryville Hub.
MRT
MRT provides natural gas transportation and storage services principally in Texas, Arkansas, Louisiana, Missouri and Illinois. In addition to 1,600 miles of interstate pipelines with capacity of 1.7 Bcf/d, MRT has one underground natural gas storage facility in Louisiana and one underground natural gas storage facility in Illinois, which, as of December 31, 2017, operate at a combined capacity of 31.5 Bcf with 717 MMcf/d of aggregate maximum withdrawal capacity.
Interconnections and Delivery Points. MRT receives natural gas from a variety of interstate and intrastate pipelines through its interconnections and delivers natural gas primarily to the St. Louis market. Those interconnections include EGT, Gulf South, 
14

NGPL, Ozark Gas Transmission, Texas Eastern, Texas Gas and Trunkline. From MRT’s West Line, we provide our customers with access to supply from East Texas and North Louisiana, including the Haynesville Shale. From MRT’s mainline, we provide our customers with access to supply from the Anadarko, Arkoma and Ark-La-Tex basins and from and the Fayetteville Shale though our interconnection with EGT, Texas Gas and Ozark Gas Transmission. From MRT’s East Line, we provide our customers with access to supply from the Mid-continent and the Marcellus Shale through our interconnections with NGPL and Trunkline. As a result, MRT provides the St. Louis market with access to natural gas from a variety of major producing basins across the U.S. 
Customers. MRT primarily serves the St. Louis LDC owned by Spire. For the year ended December 31, 2017, 61% of MRT’s service revenue was attributable to Spire under contracts with a volume-weighted average contract life of 1.3 years for transportation contracts and 1.4 years for storage contracts. MRT’s other customers include utilities and industrial end users. MRT’s customers are primarily located in Arkansas, Missouri and Illinois.

Contracts. MRT’s services are typically provided under firm, fee-based transportation and storage agreements, with rates and terms of service regulated by FERC. For the year ended December 31, 2017, approximately 14% of our transportation and storage gross margin was derived from MRT’s firm contracts, 96% of MRT’s transportation capacity was under firm contracts with a volume-weighted average remaining contract life of 1.9 years and 91% of MRT’s storage capacity was under firm contracts with a volume-weighted average remaining contract life of 1.6 years. MRT’s firm transportation contracts representing 63% of Spire’s firm transportation capacity are scheduled to expire in July 2018 and 37% of Spire’s firm transportation capacity are scheduled to expire in July 2020. All of Spire’s firm storage contracts are scheduled to expire in May 2019.

In January 2017, Spire filed an application with FERC to construct the Spire STL Pipeline, which would be an additional interstate pipeline serving the St. Louis market. Subject to receiving approval of the proposed project from FERC, Spire has indicated that it is targeting an early to mid-2019 in-service date for this pipeline. If Spire constructs this pipeline, we anticipate that its need for firm transportation and storage capacity on MRT will decrease. 
Seasonality. Customer demand for natural gas on MRT is usually greater during the winter, primarily due to LDC demand to serve residential and commercial natural gas requirements. In addition, MRT experiences seasonal impacts associated with storage spreads and basis spreads on market-based pipelines.
Competition. MRT competes with various intrastate pipelines providing natural gas to the St. Louis market. In addition, MRT, from time-to-time, competes with potential projects to connect one or more third party interstate pipelines to the St. Louis market, such as the proposed Spire STL Pipeline. Our management views the principal elements of competition among pipelines as rates, terms of service, flexibility and reliability of service. MRT, through its interconnections with a variety of interstate and intrastate pipelines and its access to supply from a variety of producing basins, provides our customers with access to a variety of natural gas supply sources.
Intrastate Transportation and Storage
Our intrastate transportation and storage assets consist primarily of EOIT. EOIT provides transportation and storage services in Oklahoma. Our EOIT system delivers natural gas from the Arkoma and Anadarko Basins, including growth areas in the Cana Woodford, Granite Wash, Cleveland, Tonkawa, SCOOP, STACK and Mississippi Lime Shale plays in western Oklahoma and the Texas Panhandle, to utilities and industrial end users connected to EOIT and to interstate and intrastate pipelines interconnected with EOIT. EOIT had 1.88 TBtu/d of average daily throughput for the year ended December 31, 2017. In addition to 2,200 miles of intrastate pipelines, EOIT has two underground natural gas storage facilities in Oklahoma, which, as of December 31, 2017 operate at a combined capacity of 24 Bcf with 605 MMcf/d of aggregate maximum withdrawal capacity. As of December 31, 2017, our intrastate transportation also included a 20-mile intrastate pipeline in Illinois. This 20-mile intrastate pipeline became part of the MRT system on January 1, 2018. 
15


Interconnections and Delivery Points. EOIT has 75 interconnections and EOIT interconnects with EGT and 12 third-party interstate and intrastate natural gas pipelines, including ANR Pipeline, El Paso Natural Gas Pipeline, Gulf Crossing Pipeline Company LLC, MEP, Natural Gas Pipeline Company of America, Northern Natural Gas Company, ONEOK Gas Transmission, Ozark Gas Transmission, L.L.C., Panhandle Eastern Pipe Line, Postrock KPC Pipeline, LLC, Southern Star Central Gas Pipeline and ONEOK Western Trails Pipeline, L.L.C. In addition, EOIT connects to 43 end-user customers, including 16 natural gas-fired electric generation facilities in Oklahoma.

Customers. EOIT’s customers include Oklahoma’s two largest electric utilities, OG&E and Public Service Company of Oklahoma, an affiliate of AEP (PSO). For the year ended December 31, 2017, approximately 6% of our total transportation and storage gross margin was attributable to a firm contract with our affiliate OG&E, and approximately 3% of our transportation and storage gross margin was attributable to a firm contract with PSO. Our transportation agreement with OG&E extends through April 30, 2019, and will remain in effect year to year thereafter unless either party provides notice of termination to the other party at least 180 days prior to the commencement of the succeeding annual period. Our transportation agreement with PSO extends through December 31, 2020 and includes the option for a one-year extension. EOIT’s customers also include other electric generators, LDCs, Arkoma and Anadarko Basin producers and industrial end users. 
Contracts. EOIT provides fee-based firm and interruptible transportation and storage services on both an intrastate basis and, pursuant to Section 311 of the NGPA, on an interstate basis. For the year ended December 31, 2017, approximately 21% of our transportation and storage gross margin was derived from EOIT’s firm contracts. EOIT’s transportation capacity was under firm contracts with a volume-weighted average remaining contract life of 5.5 years and EOIT’s storage capacity was under firm contracts with a volume-weighted average remaining contract life of 0.9 years. 

Seasonality. EOIT provides gas transmission delivery services to the majority of OG&E’s and all of PSO’s natural gas-fired electric generation facilities in Oklahoma. Customer demand for natural gas transportation and storage services on EOIT is usually greater during the summer, primarily due to demand by natural gas-fired power plants to serve residential and commercial electricity requirements.

16

Competition. EOIT competes with a variety of interstate and intrastate pipelines in providing transportation and storage services in Oklahoma, including competing against several pipelines with which EOIT interconnects. We view competition in the transportation and storage market as primarily a function of rates, terms of services, flexibility and reliability of service. EOIT’s integrated transportation and storage system allows us to provide load following service to natural gas-fired power plants to allow the power plants the ability to regulate generation and meet the instantaneous changes in customer demand for electricity. 
Our Investment in SESH
SESH is an approximately 290-mile interstate pipeline that provides transportation services in Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama. We own a 50% interest in SESH and provide field operations for the pipeline. Spectra Energy Partners, LP owns the remaining 50% interest in SESH and provides gas control and commercial operations for the pipeline. As of December 31, 2017, SESH had 1.09 Bcf/d of transportation capacity from Perryville, Louisiana to its endpoint in Mobile County, Alabama.
 
Interconnections and Delivery Points. SESH runs from the Perryville Hub in northeastern Louisiana to southwestern Alabama near the Gulf Coast. SESH has 20 interconnects with third-party natural gas pipelines and provides access to major Southeast and Northeast markets. Natural gas transported by SESH is primarily transported by the interconnecting pipelines to companies generating electricity for the Florida power market. SESH also interconnects with three high-deliverability storage facilities, Mississippi Hub Storage, Petal Gas Storage and Southern Pines Energy Center.
Customers and Contracts. SESH’s customers are primarily companies that generate electricity for the Florida power market. The rates charged by SESH for interstate transportation services are regulated by FERC. SESH’s transportation services are typically provided under firm, fee-based negotiated rate agreements. SESH’s transportation contracts have a volume-weighted average remaining contract life of 4.4 years.
Seasonality. SESH is generally not impacted by seasonality. SESH’s load factor generally remains constant throughout the year.
17

Competition. SESH competes with other interstate and intrastate pipelines providing access to the Southeast power generation market. Our management views the principal elements of competition among pipelines as rates and terms, flexibility and reliability of service.
Rate and Other Regulation

Federal, state and local regulation of pipeline gathering and transportation services may affect certain aspects of our business and the market for our products and services.
Interstate Natural Gas Pipeline Regulation

EGT, MRT and SESH are subject to regulation by FERC and are considered “natural gas companies” under the Natural Gas Act (“NGA”). Natural gas companies may not charge rates that have been determined to be unjust or unreasonable by FERC. In addition, the NGA prohibits natural gas companies from granting any undue preference or advantage, or unduly discriminating against any person with respect to pipeline rates or terms and conditions of service, including unduly discriminatory or preferential access to information. FERC authority over natural gas companies that provide natural gas pipeline transportation services in interstate commerce includes:

• | rates, terms and conditions of service and service contracts;


• | certification and construction of new facilities or expansion of existing facilities;


• | abandonment of facilities;


• | maintenance of accounts and records;


• | acquisition and disposition of facilities;


• | initiation, extension or abandonment of services;


• | accounting, depreciation and amortization policies;


• | conduct and relationship with certain affiliates;


• | market manipulation in connection with the purchase or sale of natural gas or transportation in interstate commerce; and


• | various other matters.

Under the NGA, the rates for service on interstate facilities must be just and reasonable and not unduly discriminatory. Generally, the maximum recourse rates for interstate pipelines are based on the pipeline’s cost of service including recovery of and a return on the pipeline’s actual prudent investment cost. Key determinants in the ratemaking process are the total costs of providing service, allowed rate of return and throughput projections. Our interstate pipeline operations may be affected by changes in the demand for natural gas, the available supply and relative price of natural gas in the Mid-continent and Gulf Coast natural gas supply regions and general economic conditions.

Rate and tariff changes can only be implemented upon approval by FERC. Two primary methods are available for changing the rates, terms and conditions of service of an interstate natural gas pipeline. Under the first method, the pipeline voluntarily seeks a rate or tariff change by making a filing with FERC justifying the proposed change. FERC provides notice of the proposed change to the public through publication on its website and in the Federal Register. If FERC determines that a proposed change is just and reasonable, FERC grants approval of and allows the pipeline to implement the change. If FERC determines that a proposed change may not be just and reasonable, FERC may suspend the proposed change for up to five months. Subsequent to any suspension period ordered by FERC, the proposed change may be placed into effect by the company, pending final FERC approval. In most cases, a proposed rate change is placed into effect before a final FERC determination on such rate change, and the pipeline is permitted to collect the proposed rate subject to refund (plus interest). Under the second method, FERC may, on its own motion or based on a complaint filed by a third party, initiate a proceeding seeking to compel the company to change its rates, terms and/or conditions of service. If FERC determines that the existing rates, terms and/or conditions of service are unjust, unreasonable, unduly discriminatory or preferential, then any rate reduction or change that it orders generally will be effective prospectively from the date of the FERC order requiring this change.

Market Behavior Rules; Posting and Reporting Requirements

On August 8, 2005, Congress enacted the EPAct of 2005. Among other matters, the EPAct of 2005 amended the NGA to add an anti-manipulation provision that makes it unlawful for any entity to engage in prohibited behavior in contravention of rules and regulation to be prescribed by FERC and, furthermore, provides FERC with additional civil penalty authority. On January 19, 
18

2006, FERC issued Order No. 670, a rule implementing the anti-manipulation provisions of the EPAct of 2005. The rules make it unlawful for any entity, directly or indirectly in connection with the purchase or sale of natural gas subject to the jurisdiction of FERC or the purchase or sale of transportation services subject to the jurisdiction of FERC, to (1) use or employ any device, scheme or artifice to defraud; (2) to make any untrue statement of material fact or omit to make any such statement necessary to make the statements not misleading; or (3) to engage in any act or practice that operates as a fraud or deceit upon any person. The anti-manipulation rules apply to interstate gas pipelines and storage companies and intrastate gas pipelines and storage companies that provide interstate services, such as Section 311 service, as well as otherwise non-jurisdictional entities to the extent the activities are conducted “in connection with” gas sales, purchases or transportation subject to FERC jurisdiction. The anti-manipulation rules do not apply to activities that relate only to intrastate or other non-jurisdictional sales or gathering to the extent such transactions do not have a “nexus” to jurisdictional transactions. The EPAct of 2005 also amends the NGA and the NGPA to give FERC authority to impose civil penalties for violations of these statutes and FERC’s regulations, rules and orders, up to approximately $1.2 million per day per violation for violations occurring after August 8, 2005. This maximum penalty authority established by statute will continue to be adjusted periodically for inflation. In connection with this enhanced civil penalty authority, FERC issued a revised policy statement on enforcement to provide guidance regarding the enforcement of the statutes, orders, rules and regulations it administers, including factors to be considered in determining the appropriate enforcement action to be taken. If we fail to comply with all applicable FERC-administered statutes, rules, regulations and orders, we could be subject to substantial penalties and fines. In addition, the CFTC is directed under the Commodities Exchange Act, or CEA, to prevent price manipulations for the commodity and futures markets, including the energy futures markets. Pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act and other authority, the CFTC has adopted anti-market manipulation regulations that prohibit fraud and price manipulation in the commodity and futures markets. The CFTC also has statutory authority to seek civil penalties of up to the greater of $1.1 million or triple the monetary gain to the violator for violations of the anti-market manipulation sections of the CEA.

The EPAct of 2005 also added Section 23 to the NGA, authorizing FERC to facilitate price transparency in markets for the sale or transportation of physical natural gas in interstate commerce. In 2007, FERC took steps to enhance its market oversight and monitoring of the natural gas industry by issuing several rulemaking orders designed to promote gas price transparency and to prevent market manipulation. In December 2007, FERC issued a final rule on the annual natural gas transaction reporting requirements, as amended by subsequent order on rehearing, or Order No. 704. Order No. 704 requires buyers and sellers of annual quantities of natural gas of 2,200,000 MMBtu or more, including entities not otherwise subject to FERC’s jurisdiction, to provide by May 1 of each year an annual report to FERC describing their aggregate volumes of natural gas purchased or sold at wholesale in the prior calendar year to the extent such transactions utilize, contribute to or may contribute to the formation of price indices. Order No. 704 also requires market participants to indicate whether they report prices to any index publishers and, if so, whether their reporting complies with FERC’s policy statement on price reporting. In June 2010, FERC issued the last of its three orders on rehearing and clarification further clarifying its requirements.

Intrastate Natural Gas Pipeline and Storage Regulation

Our intrastate natural gas pipeline and Hinshaw pipelines are subject to state regulation of rates and terms of service, but the scope of such regulation varies state to state. In Oklahoma, our intrastate pipeline system (EOIT) is subject to limited regulation by the Oklahoma Corporation Commission, or the OCC. Oklahoma has a non-discriminatory access requirement, which is subject to a complaint-based review. EOIT’s rates and terms of service are not subject to regulation by the OCC. In 2017, our Hinshaw pipeline system in Illinois was subject to regulation by the Illinois Commerce Commission. The Illinois Commerce Commission’s regulation of this asset ended on January 1, 2018, when it became part of MRT. 

Intrastate natural gas transportation is largely regulated by the state in which the transportation takes place. An intrastate natural gas pipeline system may transport natural gas in interstate commerce provided that the rates, terms and conditions of such transportation service comply with FERC’s regulations under Section 311 of the NGPA and Part 284 of the FERC’s regulations. The NGPA regulates, among other things, the provision of transportation and storage services by an intrastate natural gas pipeline on behalf of an interstate natural gas pipeline or a LDC served by an interstate natural gas pipeline. Under Section 311, rates charged for transportation must be fair and equitable, and amounts collected in excess of fair and equitable rates are subject to refund with interest. The rates under Section 311 are maximum rates and an intrastate pipeline may agree to discount contractual rates at or below such maximum rates. Rates for service pursuant to Section 311 of the NGPA are generally subject to review and approval by FERC at least once every five years. Should the FERC determine not to authorize rates equal to or greater than our currently approved Section 311 rates, our business may be adversely affected.
Failure to observe the service limitations applicable to transportation services provided under Section 311, failure to comply with the rates approved by FERC for Section 311 service, or failure to comply with the terms and conditions of service established in the pipeline’s FERC-approved Statement of Operating Conditions could result in the assertion of federal NGA jurisdiction by FERC and/or the imposition of administrative, civil and criminal penalties, as described in the “—Interstate Natural Gas Pipeline Regulation” section above.
19


The transportation rates charged by EOIT for natural gas transportation in interstate commerce on intrastate pipelines are subject to the jurisdiction of FERC under Section 311 of the NGPA. EOIT currently has two zones under its Section 311 transportation rate structure—an East Zone and a West Zone. For Section 311 service, EOIT may charge up to its maximum established zonal East and West interruptible transportation rates for interruptible transportation in one zone or cumulative maximum rates for transportation in both zones. EOIT may charge up to its maximum established firm rate for firm Section 311 transportation in its East and West Zones. Finally, EOIT may charge the applicable fixed zonal fuel percentage(s) for the fuel used in transporting natural gas under Section 311 on our system. The fixed zonal fuel percentages are the same for firm and interruptible Section 311 services.

We also had a pipeline in Illinois that was subject to regulation in 2017 by the Illinois Commerce Commission as a “Hinshaw pipeline.” Under Section 1(c) of the NGA, a Hinshaw pipeline is exempt from FERC’s NGA regulation if its operations are within a single state, if any gas received from interstate sources is received within the state and if its service is regulated by the state commission. A Hinshaw pipeline may, and our Illinois pipeline did, provide services in interstate commerce pursuant to limited jurisdiction certificate authority under Section 284.224(c) of FERC’s regulations, thereby subjecting itself to the same type of limited FERC jurisdiction imposed on intrastate pipelines engaged in Section 311 service. This Illinois pipeline became part of the MRT system on January 1, 2018. 
Under FERC Order No. 735, intrastate pipelines providing transportation services under Section 311 of the NGPA and Hinshaw pipelines operating under Section 1(c) of the NGA are required to report on a quarterly basis via FERC Form 549D more detailed information and storage transaction information, including: rates charged by the pipeline under each contract; receipt and delivery points and zones or segments covered by each contract; the quantity of natural gas the shipper is entitled to transport, store, or deliver; the duration of the contract; and whether there is an affiliate relationship between the pipeline and the shipper. Order No. 735 further requires that such information must be supplied through an electronic reporting system and will be posted on FERC’s website, and that such quarterly reports may not contain information redacted as privileged. FERC promulgated this rule after determining that such transactional information would help shippers make more informed purchasing decisions and would improve the ability of both shippers and FERC to monitor actual transactions for evidence of market power or undue discrimination. Order No. 735 also extends FERC’s periodic review of the rates charged by the subject pipelines from three to five years. In Order No. 735-A, FERC generally reaffirmed Order No. 735 requiring Section 311 and “Hinshaw” pipelines to report on a quarterly basis storage and transportation transactions containing specific information for each transaction, aggregated by contract. Our intrastate storage assets at the Wetumka Storage Field offer both fee-based firm and interruptible storage services under Section 311 of the NGPA pursuant to terms and conditions specified in our statement of operating conditions for gas storage at market-based rates. Our intrastate Stuart Storage Field currently is used exclusively to provide intrastate storage service, even though FERC previously authorized the use of that storage facility for Section 311 interstate service.

Natural Gas Gathering and Processing Regulation

Section 1(b) of the NGA exempts natural gas gathering and processing facilities from the jurisdiction of the FERC. Although the FERC has not made formal determinations with respect to all of our facilities we consider to be gathering facilities, management believes that our natural gas gathering pipelines meet the traditional tests that the FERC has used to determine that a pipeline is a gathering pipeline and is therefore not subject to FERC’s NGA jurisdiction. The distinction between FERC-regulated transmission services and federally unregulated gathering services, however, has been the subject of substantial litigation, and the FERC determines whether facilities are gathering facilities on a case-by-case basis, so the classification and regulation of our gathering facilities is subject to change based on future determinations by the FERC, the courts or Congress. If the FERC were to consider the status of an individual facility and determine that the facility and/or services provided by it are not exempt from FERC regulation under the NGA and that the facility provides interstate service, the rates for, and terms and conditions of, services provided by such facility would be subject to regulation by the FERC under the NGA or the NGPA. Such regulation could decrease revenue, increase operating costs, and, depending upon the facility in question, could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows. In addition, if any of our facilities were found to have provided services or otherwise operated in violation of the NGA or NGPA, this could result in the imposition of civil penalties as well as a requirement to disgorge charges collected for such service in excess of the rate established by the FERC.
States may regulate gathering pipelines. State regulation of gathering facilities generally includes various safety, environmental and, in some circumstances, requirements prohibiting undue discrimination, and in some instances complaint-based rate regulation. Our gathering operations may be subject to ratable take and common purchaser statutes in the states in which they operate. The ratable take statutes generally require gatherers to take, without undue discrimination, natural gas production that may be tendered to the gatherer for handling. Similarly, common purchaser statutes generally require gatherers to purchase without undue discrimination as to source of supply or producer. These statutes are designed to prohibit discrimination in favor of one 
20

producer over another producer or one source of supply over another source of supply. These statutes have the effect of restricting our right as an owner of gathering facilities to decide with whom we contract to purchase or transport natural gas.

Our gathering operations could be adversely affected should they be subject in the future to the application of state or federal regulation of rates and services. Our gathering operations could also be subject to additional safety and operational regulations relating to the design, construction, testing, operation, replacement and maintenance of gathering facilities. Additional rules and legislation pertaining to these matters are considered or adopted from time to time. We cannot predict what effect, if any, such changes might have on its operations, but the industry could be required to incur additional capital expenditures and increased costs depending on future legislative and regulatory changes.

Sales of Natural Gas

The price at which we buy and sell natural gas currently is not subject to federal regulation and, for the most part, is not subject to state regulation. However, as noted above, with regard to our physical purchases and sales of these energy commodities, and any related hedging activities that we undertake, we are required to observe anti-market manipulation laws and related regulations enforced by FERC and/or the CFTC. Should we violate the anti-market manipulation laws and regulations, we could also be subject to related third-party damage claims by, among others, market participants, sellers, royalty owners and taxing authorities.

Our sales of natural gas are affected by the availability, terms and cost of pipeline transportation. As noted above, the price and terms of access to pipeline transportation are subject to extensive federal and state regulation. FERC is continually proposing and implementing new rules and regulations affecting those segments of the natural gas industry, most notably interstate natural gas transmission companies that remain subject to FERC jurisdiction. These initiatives also may affect the intrastate transportation of natural gas under certain circumstances. The stated purpose of many of these regulatory changes is to promote competition among the various sectors of the natural gas industry. We cannot predict the ultimate impact of these regulatory changes on our natural gas marketing operations.

Crude Oil Gathering Regulation

Crude oil gathering pipelines that provide interstate transportation service may be regulated as common carriers by FERC under the ICA, the Energy Policy Act of 1992 and the rules and regulations promulgated under those laws. We have two transportation systems that transport crude oil in interstate commerce and are located in the Bakken producing region of North Dakota. The ICA and FERC regulations require that rates for interstate service pipelines that transport crude oil and refined petroleum products (collectively referred to as “petroleum pipelines”) and certain other liquids, be just and reasonable and are to be non-discriminatory or not confer any undue preference upon any shipper. FERC regulations also require interstate common carrier petroleum pipelines to file with FERC and publicly post tariffs stating their interstate transportation rates and terms and conditions of service. Under the ICA, FERC or interested persons may challenge existing or changed rates or services. The FERC is authorized to investigate such charges and may suspend the effectiveness of a new rate for up to seven months. A successful rate challenge could result in a common carrier paying refunds together with interest for the period that the rate was in effect. FERC may also order a pipeline to change its rates, and may require a common carrier to pay shippers reparations for damages sustained for a period up to two years prior to the filing of a complaint.

If our rate levels were investigated by FERC, the inquiry could result in a comparison of our rates to those charged by others or to an investigation of our costs, including:

• | the overall cost of service, including operating costs and overhead;


• | the allocation of overhead and other administrative and general expenses to the regulated entity;


• | the appropriate capital structure to be utilized in calculating rates;


• | the appropriate rate of return on equity and interest rates on debt;


• | the rate base, including the proper starting rate base;


• | the throughput underlying the rate; and


• | the proper allowance for federal and state income taxes.

For some time now, FERC has been issuing regulatory assurances that necessarily balance the anti-discrimination and undue preference requirements of common carriage with the expectations of investors in new and expanding petroleum pipelines. There is an inherent tension between the requirements imposed upon a common carrier and the need for owners of petroleum pipelines to be able to enter into long-term, firm contracts with shippers willing to make the commitments which underpin such large capital investments. For example, FERC has found that shipper contract rates are not per se violations of the duty of non-discrimination, 
21

provided that such rates are available to all similarly-situated shippers. In the same vein, FERC has approved varying term commitments with tiered rate discounts on the basis that committed shippers were not similarly situated with uncommitted shippers and further that different types of committed shippers were not similarly situated with each other if their commitment level materially differed. FERC has also found that shippers making certain capacity commitments to the pipeline can take advantage of priority or firm service, which is service that is not subject to typical capacity allocation requirements, so long as any interested shipper has an equal opportunity to make such a commitment to the carrier. FERC’s solution has been to allow carriers to hold an “open season” prior to the in-service date of pipeline, during which time interested shippers can make commitments to the proposed pipeline project. Throughput commitments from interested shippers during an open season can be for firm service or for non-firm service. Typically, such an open season is for a 30-day period, must be publicly announced, and culminates in interested parties entering into transportation agreements with the carrier. Under FERC precedent, a carrier typically may reserve up to 90% of available capacity for the provision of firm or priority service to shippers making a commitment. At least 10% of capacity ordinarily is reserved for uncommitted shippers, i.e., “walk-up” shippers.

Under the ICA, FERC does not have authority over the siting of oil transportation assets nor over the abandonment of facilities or services. Accordingly, no approval from FERC is necessary prior to placing a new petroleum pipeline project in operation. However, FERC highly encourages carriers to file a Petition for Declaratory Order to seek regulatory assurances for key terms of service offered during an open season. As long as the shippers on our Bakken crude oil gathering system move oil in interstate commerce, our crude oil gathering system will not be regulated by the North Dakota Public Service Commission.
Safety and Health Regulation
Pipeline Safety
Our pipeline facilities are subject to regulation under federal pipeline safety statutes and comparable state statutes. Federal pipeline safety statutes include the Natural Gas Pipeline Safety Act of 1968, or NGPSA, which provides for safety requirements in the design, construction, operation and maintenance of natural gas pipeline facilities, and the Hazardous Liquid Pipeline Safety Act of 1979, and the HLPSA, which provides for safety requirements for the design, construction, operation and maintenance of hazardous liquids pipelines facilities, including NGL and crude oil pipelines. The NGPSA and the HLPSA have been subject to a number of amendments and supplements including the Pipeline Safety Act of 1992, the Accountable Pipeline Safety and Partnership Act of 1996, the Pipeline Safety Improvement Act of 2002, the Pipeline Inspection, Protection, Enforcement and Safety Act of 2006, or the PIPES Act, and the Pipeline Safety, Regulatory Certainty, Job Creation Act of 2011, or the 2011 Pipeline Safety Act, and the Securing America’s Future Energy Protecting our Infrastructure of Pipelines and Enhancing Safety Act.
We are regulated under federal pipeline safety statutes by DOT through PHMSA. PHMSA sets and enforces pipeline safety regulations and standards. PHMSA’s enforcement authority includes the ability to assess civil penalties for violations of pipeline safety regulations. Under the 2011 Pipeline Safety Act, PHMSA has civil penalty authority of up to $200,000 per day per violation, with a maximum of $2 million for any related series of violations. In addition to governing the design, construction, operation and maintenance of natural gas and hazardous liquids pipeline facilities, PHMSA’s regulations require the following for certain pipelines: an inspection and maintenance plan; an integrity management program, which includes the determination of pipeline integrity risks and periodic assessments of pipeline segments in high consequence areas; a drug and alcohol testing program; an operator qualification program, which includes training for personnel performing tasks covered by pipeline safety rules; a public awareness program, which provides relevant information to residents, public officials and emergency responders; and a control room management plan. 
As part of regulating pipeline safety, PHMSA periodically promulgates pipeline safety regulations. For example, in December 2016, PHMSA published an interim final rule providing pipeline safety regulations for underground natural gas storage, and in April 2017, PHMSA published a final rule increasing the maximum penalties for violating federal safety standards. PHMSA also periodically publishes advisory bulletins. For example, in January 2011, PHMSA published an advisory bulletin stating that operators of natural gas and hazardous liquid pipeline facilities should perform detailed threat and risk analyses that integrate accurate data and information from their entire pipeline system and to utilize these risk analyses in the identification of appropriate assessment methods and preventive and mitigative measures, and in May 2012, PHMSA published an advisory bulletin stating that operators of gas and hazardous liquid pipeline facilities should verify records relating to operating specifications for maximum allowable operating pressure, MAOP, for gas pipelines and maximum operating pressure, or MOP, for hazardous liquid pipelines. 

Federal pipeline safety regulations contain an exemption that applies to gathering lines in certain rural locations. A substantial portion of our gathering lines qualify for that exemption and are currently not regulated under federal law. However, PHMSA is completing a congressionally-mandated review of the adequacy of the existing federal and state regulations for gathering lines and has indicated that it may apply additional safety standards to rural gas gathering lines in the future.

States are largely preempted by federal law from regulating pipeline safety but may assume responsibility for administering and enforcing intrastate pipeline regulations at least as stringent as the federal standards. For example, the OCC administers the intrastate pipeline safety program in Oklahoma, and the Texas Railroad Commission administers the intrastate pipeline safety program in Texas. In practice, states vary in their authority and capacity to address pipeline safety.
In complying with current federal and state pipeline safety laws and regulations, we incur significant costs. In 2017, we incurred maintenance capital expenditures and operation and maintenance expenses of $39 million to comply with existing pipeline safety laws and regulations, including costs related to integrity assessments and repairs, threat and risk analyses, implementing preventative and mitigative measures, and conducting activities to support MAOP or MOP. We currently estimate that we will incur maintenance capital expenditures and operation and maintenance expenses of up to $285 million from 2018 through 2022 to comply with existing pipeline safety laws and regulations. While we cannot predict the outcome of legislative or regulatory initiatives, we anticipate that pipeline safety requirements will continue to become more stringent over time. As a result, we may incur significant additional costs to comply with any new pipeline safety laws and regulations associated with our pipeline facilities.
Occupational Health and Safety

In addition to these pipeline safety requirements, we are subject to a number of federal and state laws and regulations, including the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 (OSHA) and comparable state statutes, whose purpose is to protect the safety and health of workers, both generally and within the pipeline industry. In addition, the OSHA hazard communication standard, the EPA community right-to-know regulations under Title III of the Federal Superfund Amendment and Reauthorization Act and comparable state statutes require that information be maintained concerning hazardous materials used or produced in our operations and that this information be provided to employees, state and local government authorities and citizens. We are also subject to OSHA Process Safety Management regulations, which are designed to prevent or minimize the consequences of catastrophic releases of toxic, reactive, flammable or explosive chemicals. These regulations apply to any process which involves a chemical at or above the specified thresholds or any process which involves flammable liquid or gas, pressurized tanks, caverns and wells in excess of 10,000 pounds at various locations. We have an internal program of inspection designed to monitor and enforce compliance with worker safety and health requirements. Management believes that we are in material compliance with all applicable laws and regulations relating to worker safety and health.
Security
The Department of Homeland Security Appropriation Act of 2007 requires the Department of Homeland Security, or DHS, to issue regulations establishing risk-based performance standards for the security of chemical and industrial facilities, including oil and gas facilities that are deemed to present “high levels of security risk.” The DHS issued an interim final rule in April 2007 regarding risk-based performance standards to be attained pursuant to this act and, on November 20, 2007, further issued an Appendix A to the interim rules that establish chemicals of interest and their respective threshold quantities that will trigger compliance with these interim rules. Covered facilities that are determined by DHS to pose a high level of security risk will be required to prepare and submit Security Vulnerability Assessments and Site Security Plans as well as comply with other regulatory requirements, including those regarding inspections, audits, recordkeeping, and protection of chemical-terrorism vulnerability information.

While we are not currently subject to governmental standards for the protection of computer-based systems and technology from cyber threats and attacks, proposals to establish such standards are being considered by the U.S. Congress and by U.S. Executive Branch departments and agencies, including the Department of Homeland Security, and we may become subject to such standards in the future. We have existing, and continue to develop, systems in place to monitor and address the risk of cyber-security breaches in our business, operations and control environments. We routinely review and update those systems as the nature of that risk requires. We are not aware of any cyber-security breach affecting any of our business, operations or control environments. A significant cyber-attack could have a material effect on our operations and those of our customers.
Environmental Regulation

General

Our operations are subject to extensive federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations. These laws and regulations can restrict or impact our business activities in many ways, such as requiring permits to conduct our activities, limiting our emissions of materials into the environment, requiring emissions control equipment, regulating our construction to mitigate harm to protected species, restricting the way we can handle or dispose of waste, and requiring remediation to mitigate the impact of materials 
23

discharged into the environment in connection with our current operations or attributable to former operation. Compliance with these laws and regulations increases our capital expenditures and operating expenses, and any failure to comply with these laws and regulations could result in the assessment of significant administrative, civil and criminal liabilities, injunctions or other penalties.
We have adopted policies, procedures, and practices to comply with environmental laws and regulations, and we incur significant costs in connection with compliance. In 2017, we incurred approximately $7 million in maintenance capital expenditures and operation and maintenance expenses in connection with routine environmental compliance with existing laws and regulations, such as sampling, monitoring, testing, remediation, and permit compliance. We anticipate our expenditures for routine environmental compliance with existing laws and regulations will average $8 million per year for 2018 through 2020. We also incur, and expect to continue to incur, additional costs in connection with spill response and construction. With respect to construction, existing environmental laws and regulations impact the cost of planning, design, permitting, installation, and start-up. While we cannot predict the outcome of legislative or regulatory initiatives, we anticipate that environmental requirements will continue to become more restrictive over time. As a result, we may incur significant additional costs to comply with any new environmental laws and regulations applicable to our operations. For more information, please read Item 1A. “Risk Factors–Costs of compliance with existing environmental laws and regulations are significant, and the cost of compliance with future environmental laws and regulations may adversely affect our financial position, results of operations and ability to make cash distributions to unitholders.”
Air
Our operations are subject to the federal Clean Air Act, as amended (CAA), and comparable state laws and regulations. These laws and regulations regulate emissions of air pollutants from various industrial sources, including natural gas processing plants and compressor stations, and also impose various monitoring and reporting requirements. Such laws and regulations may require that we obtain pre-approval for the construction or modification of certain projects or facilities expected to produce air emissions or result in the increase of existing air emissions (including greenhouse gas emissions as discussed below), obtain and strictly comply with air permits containing various emissions and operational limitations or install emission control equipment. We likely will be required to incur certain capital expenditures in the future for air pollution control equipment and technology in connection with obtaining and maintaining operating permits and approvals for air emissions. 
Climate Change

There has been a wide-ranging policy debate, both nationally and internationally, regarding climate change, greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions, and possible means for the regulation of GHG emissions. Examples of GHGs include methane, which is a primary component of natural gas, and carbon dioxide, which is a byproduct of the combustion of natural gas. Various laws and regulations exist or are under development to regulate the emission of GHGs, including EPA programs to control GHGs and state actions to develop statewide or regional programs to control GHGs. In addition, the United States Congress has, from time to time, considered adopting legislation to reduce GHG emissions.
The EPA has published findings that certain GHGs may endanger human health, and the EPA has adopted regulations requiring the reporting and permitting of GHG emissions under the CAA. Our operations are subject to those regulations. Those regulations include the “Mandatory Reporting of Greenhouse Gases Rule” that requires the annual calculation and reporting of GHG emissions from natural gas transmission, gathering and processing facilities which emit 25,000 metric tons or more of carbon dioxide equivalent per year and the permitting of large stationary sources of GHG under the CAA’s Prevention of Significant Deterioration and Title V programs.
Several states have adopted laws and regulations intended to reduce the emission of GHGs, including through the planned development of GHG emission inventories and/or regional GHG cap and trade programs. However, the states where our operations are currently located (Alabama, Arkansas, Illinois, Kansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Oklahoma, North Dakota, Tennessee, and Texas) are not among them. 
While we cannot predict the outcome of legislative or regulatory initiatives, we anticipate that initiatives to reduce GHG emissions will continue to develop. The adoption of state or federal legislation or regulatory programs to reduce emissions of GHGs, including methane and carbon dioxide, could require us to incur increased operating costs, such as costs to purchase and operate emissions monitoring and control systems, to acquire emissions allowances or comply with new regulatory or reporting requirements. Any such legislation or regulatory programs could also increase the cost of consuming, and thereby reduce demand for, the natural gas we gather, treat and transport. Consequently, legislation and regulatory programs to reduce emissions of GHGs could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

1A. “Risk Factors–Our operations may incur substantial liabilities to comply with climate change legislation and regulatory initiatives.”

National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA)

NEPA provides for an environmental impact assessment process in connection with certain projects that involve federal lands or require approvals by federal agencies. The NEPA process implicates a number of other environmental laws and regulations, including the Endangered Species Act, Migratory Bird Treaty Act, Rivers and Harbors Act, Clean Water Act, Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act, Fish and Wildlife Coordination Act, Marine Mammal Protection Act and National Historic Preservation Act. The NEPA review process can be lengthy and subjective and can cause delays in projects. Our projects that are subject to the NEPA can include pipeline construction and pipeline integrity projects that involve federal lands or require approvals by federal agencies. Ineffective implementation of the NEPA process could cause significant impacts to such projects.
Protected Species

Certain federal laws, including the Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act, the Migratory Bird Treaty Act and the Endangered Species Act, provide special protection to certain designated species. These laws and any state equivalents provide for significant civil and criminal penalties for unpermitted activities that result in harm to or harassment of certain protected animals and plants, including damage to their habitats. If such species are located in an area in which we conduct operations, or if additional species in those areas become subject to protection, our operations and development projects, particularly pipeline projects, could be restricted or delayed, or we could be required to implement expensive mitigation measures. The designation of previously unprotected species as threatened or endangered in areas where underlying property operations are conducted could cause us to incur increased costs arising from species protection measures or could result in limitations on our customer’s exploration and production activities that could have an adverse impact on demand for our services. Portions of the basins we serve are designated as critical or suitable habitat for threatened and endangered species. If additional portions of the basins we serve were designated as critical or suitable habitat for threatened and endangered species, it could adversely impact the cost of operating our systems and of constructing new facilities. Management believes that we are in material compliance with all applicable laws providing special protection to designated species.
Hazardous Substances and Waste

Our operations are subject to federal and state environmental laws and regulations relating to the management and release of hazardous substances, solid and hazardous wastes, and petroleum hydrocarbons. For instance, our operations are subject to the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 (CERCLA or Superfund) and comparable state cleanup laws that impose liability, without regard to the legality of the original conduct, on certain classes of persons responsible for the release of hazardous substances into the environment. These persons include current and prior owners or operators of the site where the release occurred and companies that disposed or arranged for the disposal of the hazardous substances found at the site. Under CERCLA, these persons may, jointly and severally, be subject to strict liability for the costs of cleaning up the hazardous substances that have been released into the environment, for damages to natural resources and for the costs of certain health studies. CERCLA also authorizes the EPA and, in some instances, third parties to act in response to threats to the public health or the environment and to seek to recover the costs they incur from the responsible classes of persons. It is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by hazardous substances or other pollutants released into the environment. Because we utilize various products and generate wastes that are considered hazardous substances for purposes of CERCLA, we could be subject to liability for the costs of cleaning up and restoring sites where those substances have been released to the environment.

Our operations also generate solid and hazardous wastes that are subject to the federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976 (RCRA) as well as comparable state laws. While RCRA regulates both solid and hazardous wastes, it imposes detailed requirements for the handling, storage, treatment and disposal of hazardous waste. RCRA currently exempts many natural gas gathering and field processing wastes from classification as hazardous waste. However, it is possible that these wastes, which could include wastes currently generated during our operations, will in the future be designated as “hazardous wastes” and therefore be subject to more rigorous and costly disposal requirements. Such changes to the law could have an impact on our capital expenditures and operating expenses. Further, these RCRA-exempt oil and gas exploration and production wastes may still be regulated under state law or RCRA’s less stringent solid waste requirements. The transportation of natural gas in pipelines may also generate some hazardous wastes that are subject to RCRA or a comparable state law regime.
25

Water
Our operations are subject to the federal Clean Water Act and analogous state laws and regulations. These laws and regulations impose detailed requirements and strict controls regarding the discharge of pollutants into state and federal waters. The discharge of pollutants, including discharges resulting from a spill or leak, is prohibited unless authorized by a permit or other agency approval. In addition, the federal Clean Water Act and analogous state laws require individual permits or coverage under general permits for discharges of storm water runoff from certain types of facilities. These permits may require us to monitor and sample the storm water runoff from some of our facilities. The federal Clean Water Act and regulations implemented thereunder also prohibit discharges of dredged and fill material in wetlands and other waters of the United States unless authorized by an appropriately issued permit. Spill prevention, control and countermeasure requirements of federal laws require appropriate containment berms and similar structures to help prevent the contamination of regulated waters in the event of a hydrocarbon tank spill, rupture or leak. Federal and state regulatory agencies can impose administrative, civil and criminal penalties for non-compliance with many of these requirements.
Certain of our operations are also subject to the Oil Pollution Act (the OPA) which amends and augments oil spill provisions of the Clean Water Act and imposes certain duties and liabilities on certain “responsible parties” related to the prevention of oil spills and damages resulting from such spills in or threatening United States waters or adjoining shorelines. A liable “responsible party” includes the owner or operator of a facility, vessel or pipeline that is a source of an oil discharge or that poses the substantial threat of discharge, or in the case of offshore facilities, the lessee or permittee of the area in which a discharging facility is located. Under OPA, joint and several liability, without regard to fault, may be assigned for oil removal costs and a variety of public and private damages. Although defenses exist to the liability imposed by OPA, they are limited. In the event of an oil discharge or substantial threat of discharge, we may be liable for costs and damages.
Hydraulic Fracturing

Hydraulic fracturing is an important and common practice that is used to stimulate production of hydrocarbons from tight formations. The process involves the injection of water, sand and chemicals under pressure into the formation to fracture the surrounding rock and stimulate production. The process is regulated by state agencies, typically the state’s oil and gas commission. A number of federal agencies, including the EPA and the U.S. Department of Energy, are analyzing, or have been requested to review, a variety of environmental issues associated with hydraulic fracturing. In addition, some states have adopted, and other states are considering adopting, regulations that could impose more stringent disclosure and/or well construction requirements on hydraulic fracturing operations. 
State and federal regulatory agencies also recently focused on a possible connection between the operation of injection wells used for oil and gas wastewater disposal and seismic activity. Similar concerns have been raised that hydraulic fracturing may also contribute to seismic activity. When caused by human activity, such events are called induced seismicity. In March 2016, the United States Geological Survey identified six states with the most significant hazards from induced seismicity: Oklahoma, Kansas, Texas, Colorado, New Mexico, and Arkansas. In light of these concerns, some state regulatory agencies have modified their regulations or issued orders to address induced seismicity. Certain environmental and other groups have also suggested that additional federal, state and local laws and regulations may be needed to more closely regulate the wastewater disposal process. 
If new laws or regulations that significantly restrict hydraulic fracturing or wastewater disposal wells are adopted, such laws could lead to greater opposition to, and litigation concerning, related oil and gas producing activities and to operational delays or increased operating costs for our customers, which in turn could reduce the demand for our services. For more information, please read Item 1A. “Risk Factors–Increased regulation of hydraulic fracturing could result in reductions or delays in natural gas production by our customers, which could adversely affect our financial position, results of operations and ability to make cash distributions to unitholders.”
