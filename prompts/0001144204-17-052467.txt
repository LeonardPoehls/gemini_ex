Item 1. Business.
Company Overview
 
Opiant Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (“we”, “our” or the “Company”), a Delaware corporation, is a specialty pharmaceutical company that develops pharmacological treatments for substance use, addictive and eating disorders. We were incorporated in the State of Nevada in June 2005 as Madrona Ventures, Inc. and, in September 2009, we changed our name to Lightlake Therapeutics Inc. In January 2016, we again changed our name to Opiant Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Our fiscal year end is July 31. On October 2, 2017, we changed our state of incorporation from the State of Nevada to the State of Delaware pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated October 2, 2017 whereby we merged with and into our recently formed, wholly-owned Delaware subsidiary, Opiant Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger, (i) we merged with and into our Delaware subsidiary, (ii) our separate corporate existence in Nevada ceased to exist, (iii) our Delaware subsidiary became the surviving corporation, (iv) each share of our common stock, $0.001 par value per share (the “Common Stock”), outstanding immediately prior to the effective time was converted into one fully-paid and non-assessable share of common stock of Opiant Pharmaceuticals, Inc., a Delaware corporation, $0.001 par value per share, and (v) the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of our Delaware subsidiary were adopted as our certificate of incorporation and bylaws at the effective time of the merger. The merger and the Agreement and Plan of Merger were approved by our Board of Directors (the “Board”) and stockholders representing a majority of outstanding Common Stock.
 
Our strategy is to develop pharmacological treatments for substance use, addictive and eating disorders based on our expertise using opioid antagonists.
 
We developed NARCAN® (naloxone hydrochloride) Nasal Spray, a treatment to reverse opioid overdose. This product was conceived, developed, licensed and approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) in November 2015. It is marketed by Adapt Pharma Operations Limited (“Adapt”), an Ireland based pharmaceutical company. We plan to replicate this relatively low cost, successful business strategy primarily through developing nasal opioid antagonists in the field of developing pharmacological treatments for substance use, addictive, and eating disorders. We aim to identify and progress drug development opportunities with the potential to file additional New Drug Applications (“NDA”) with the FDA within three to five years. We also plan to identify and progress drug development opportunities with potentially larger markets, potentially larger addressable patient populations and greater revenue potential. In addition, we plan to invest in long-term development opportunities by identifying early stage product candidates with novel modes of action.
 
Our current pipeline of product candidates includes treatments for eating disorders: Bulimia Nervosa (“BN”) and Binge Eating Disorder (“BED”), Alcohol Use Disorder (“AUD”), a long term treatment to prevent relapse for patients with Opioid Use Disorders (“OUDs”) and a heroin vaccine. We also are focused on other treatment opportunities.
 
Principal Products or Services and Markets
 
Opioid Overdose Reversal
 
Naloxone is a medicine that can reverse the overdose of prescription and illicit opioids and that historically has been available through injection. Our intranasal delivery system of naloxone could widely expand its availability and use in preventing opioid overdose deaths.
 
In December 2014, we entered into a license agreement with Adapt (the “Adapt Agreement”). The Adapt Agreement has no set duration but may be terminated, among other ways, by Adapt in its sole discretion, either in its entirety or in respect of one or more countries, at any time by providing 60 days prior notice to us. Pursuant to the Adapt Agreement, Adapt received our global license to develop and commercialize our intranasal naloxone Opioid Overdose Reversal Treatment Product. In exchange for licensing our treatment to Adapt, we could receive total potential regulatory and sales milestone payments of more than $55 million, plus up to double-digit percentage royalties on net sales. In February 2015, Adapt received “Fast Track” designation by the FDA and in July 2015, Adapt submitted a NDA to the FDA for NARCAN® (naloxone hydrochloride) Nasal Spray, an investigational drug intended to treat opioid overdose. In May 2016, Adapt submitted a new drug submission (NDS) for NARCAN® (naloxone hydrochloride) Nasal Spray to Health Canada. In October 2016, Health Canada approved Adapt’s naloxone hydrochloride nasal spray to treat opioid overdose, to be marketed as NARCAN® Nasal Spray.

In November 2015, the FDA approved NARCAN® (naloxone hydrochloride) Nasal Spray for the emergency treatment of known or suspected opioid overdose, to be marketed by Adapt. In December 2015, we received a $2 million milestone payment from Adapt. This milestone payment was triggered by the FDA approval of NARCAN® (naloxone hydrochloride) Nasal Spray. In March 2016, we announced the receipt of a $2.5 million milestone payment from Adapt. This milestone payment was triggered by the first commercial sale of NARCAN® (naloxone hydrochloride) Nasal Spray in the U.S. In April 2016, August 2016 and November 2016, we received $105,097, $234,498 and $524,142 in royalty payments due from Adapt from commercial sales of NARCAN® (naloxone hydrochloride) Nasal Spray in the U.S during the first quarter, second quarter and third quarter, respectively, of Adapt’s fiscal year.
 
In October 2016, one of our patents for NARCAN® Nasal Spray became listed in the FDA publication, Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations, commonly known as the Orange Book, patent number 9468747, which patent expires on March 16, 2035.
 
On December 13, 2016 (the “SWK Closing Date”), we entered into a Purchase and Sale Agreement (the “SWK Purchase Agreement”) with SWK Funding LLC (“SWK”) pursuant to which we sold, and SWK purchased, our right to receive, commencing on October 1, 2016, all Royalties (as defined in the SWK Purchase Agreement) arising from the sale by Adapt, pursuant to the Adapt Agreement, of NARCAN® or any other Product, up to (i) $20,625,000 and then the Residual Royalty thereafter or (ii) $26,250,000, if Adapt has received in excess of $25,000,000 of cumulative Net Sales (as defined in the SWK Purchase Agreement) for any two consecutive fiscal quarters during the period from October 1, 2016 through September 30, 2017 from the sale of NARCAN® (the “Earn Out Milestone”), and then the Residual Royalty thereafter. The Residual Royalty is defined in the SWK Purchase Agreement as follows: (i) if the Earn Out Milestone is paid, then SWK shall receive 10% of all Royalties; provided, however, if no generic version of NARCAN® is commercialized prior to the sixth anniversary of the SWK Closing Date, then SWK shall receive 5% of all Royalties after such date, and (ii) if the Earn Out Milestone is not paid, then SWK shall receive 7.86% of all Royalties; provided, however, that if no generic version of NARCAN® is commercialized prior to the sixth anniversary of the SWK Closing Date, then SWK shall receive 3.93% of all Royalties after such date. Under the SWK Purchase Agreement, we received an upfront purchase price of $13,750,000 less $40,000 of legal fees on the SWK Closing Date, and received an additional $3,750,000 from SWK on August 10, 2017 when the Earn Out Milestone was achieved (the “Purchase Price”).

In addition, on December 13, 2016, in connection with the SWK Purchase Agreement, we entered into Amendment No. 1 to the Adapt Agreement (the “Adapt Amendment”) which amends the terms of the Adapt Agreement relating to the grant of a commercial sublicense outside of the U.S and diligence efforts for commercialization of our intranasal-naloxone opioid overdose reversal treatment (the “Product” or “OORT”). Under the terms of the Adapt Amendment, Adapt is required to use commercially reasonable efforts to commercialize the Product in the U.S. In the event that Adapt wishes to grant a commercial sublicense to a third party in the European Union or the United Kingdom, we have agreed to negotiate an additional amendment to the Adapt Agreement to include reduced financial terms with respect to the commercial sublicense in such territory. Under such terms, we would receive an escalating double-digit percentage of all net revenue received by Adapt from a commercial sublicensee in the European Union or the United Kingdom. Net revenue received by Adapt from a commercial sublicensee in European Union or the United Kingdom would be included in determining sales-based milestones due to us.
 
In January 2017, the FDA approved the 2mg formulation of NARCAN® for opioid-dependent patients expected to be at risk for severe opioid withdrawal in situations where there is a low risk for accidental or intentional opioid exposure by household contacts.
 
In March 2017, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office issued U.S. Patent Numbers 9,480,644 and 9,561,177 covering methods of use for NARCAN®. These patents are listed in the FDA publication, Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations, commonly known as the Orange Book, and expire on March 16, 2035.
 
Eating Disorders
 
Bulimia Nervosa (BN) is a serious and potentially life-threatening eating disorder mainly affecting females. BN is characterized by binge eating followed by purging, fasting, and other strategies to prevent weight gain.  It has a lifetime prevalence of 1-2%, and patients are at a heightened risk of other psychiatric disorders including depression, anxiety and substance abuse. Fluoxetine is currently the only FDA approved medication to treat BN. However, the remission rate with fluoxetine, both alone and combination with psychotherapy, ranges only between 19-41%.
 
The compulsive bingeing characteristic of BN has features in common with other addictive disorders, providing the basis for using of opioid antagonists to mitigate their frequency.
 
We have initiated a Phase II clinical trial to evaluate our nasally-delivered opioid antagonist candidate as a potential treatment for BN. The drug candidate has already demonstrated a rapid absorption profile, which together with a targeted dosing strategy, may address the unique needs of patients suffering from this serious disorder.
 
We are developing a treatment for Binge Eating Disorder (“BED”). BED is defined in the American Psychiatric Association’s (“APA”) fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders chapter on feeding and eating disorders as a diagnosis for individuals who experience persistent, recurrent episodes of overeating, marked by loss of control and significant clinical distress.
 
BED is the most common eating disorder in the U.S. Approximately 8 million Americans are diagnosed with BED and it is correlated with obesity. In addition, according to the APA, BED is associated with significant physical and psychological problems.”
 
In 2015, Shire PLC received FDA approval to use Vyvanse to treat BED in adults. We consider naloxone to be a potentially compelling drug for the pharmacological treatment of BED. It has a well-known safety profile and has the potential to block the reward that patients experience from bingeing.
 
Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD)
 
We are developing a nasal naltrexone for AUD. Alcohol triggers the release of naturally occurring endorphins, which then bind to the opiate receptor, leading to dopamine release in the reward center.  Opioid antagonists can reduce the risk of heavy drinking by blocking opioid receptors, which results in dampening of alcohol-induced dopamine release.
 
Our product will be taken intranasally on an as needed basis in anticipation of drinking and/or in high risk situations to moderate alcohol intake.  Taking our product in response to these situations could also help individuals increase their situational awareness of drinking, and perhaps help make drinking less habitual.
 
We have generated encouraging Phase 1 clinical data demonstrating rapid intranasal absorption.  The Company has also received supportive feedback from the FDA on a proposed development plan that we plan to advance.
 
There are approximately 17 million people in the U.S. who suffer from some form of AUD. Alcohol misuse and alcohol use disorders cost the United States roughly $249 billion annually in lost productivity, healthcare expenses and criminal justice costs.

Opioid Use Disorder
 
Opioid use disorder (OUD) is a major global health issue, particularly in the U.S., where opioid abuse, in particular involving opioid painkillers and subsequent addiction has become widespread and driven the increase in prevalence, to the point of it being a public health crisis. As these painkillers have become more expensive, undergone tighter controls for distribution, and abuse deterrent formulations have become available, there has been an increase in heroin use, which is cheaper and often easier to obtain than painkillers. At the same time with the abuse of fentanyl and its derivatives, synthetic opioids are 50 times more potent than heroin and has become more widespread further driving the recent increase in deaths from opioid overdose in the US.
 
Current FDA-approved treatments for heroin addiction are methadone-based and buprenorphine-based substitution therapies, and the use of naltrexone depot injections. With respect to these substitution therapies, patients still take opioid-based treatments, which for many is undesirable, and there is frequently diversion and misuse of these treatments amongst addicts. With respect to naltrexone depot injections, patients must undergo detoxification before initiating treatment, which for several patients severely limits compliance and willingness to undergo this method of treatment. Therefore, being able to provide a vaccine to patients that potentially provides specific immunity against heroin and its metabolites without the need for prior detoxification and enabling patients to remain opioid-free is an attractive solution.
 
In October 2016, we in-licensed a heroin vaccine from Walter Reed Army Institute of Research (“Walter Reed”). This is an early stage pre-clinical asset, based on adjuvant technology, and requires further pre-clinical research before human testing. We plan to work alongside Walter Reed scientists to advance the program into the clinic and to determine whether the product is viable in a heroin addict population.
 
On October 2, 2017, we announced a collaboration with Titan Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (“Titan”) to explore development of a novel approach to the prevention of opioid relapse and overdose in individuals with opioid use disorder. We will conduct a feasibility assessment of a subcutaneous implant using Titan’s proprietary ProNeuraTM sustained release technology to administer an opioid antagonist. The objective of this collaboration is to develop a product that delivers non-fluctuating, therapeutic levels of opioid antagonist continuously for up to six months, which we believe may be ideally suited for this prevention of opioid relapse and overdose.
 
Cocaine Use Disorder
 
We conducted a pilot study to explore the potential of a nasal opioid antagonist as a treatment for Cocaine Use Disorder (“CocUD”) at the University of Pennsylvania, conducted by the Department of Psychiatry at the Perelman School of Medicine and began recruitment in December 2015. Funded by a Medications Development Centers of Excellence Cooperative (U54) Program from NIDA, the study uses functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) to better understand the impact of an opioid antagonist drug in the brain of patients with CocUD. The study results are now being prepared for publication
Other Activities
 
On December 1, 2014, we entered into a Material Transfer, Option and Research License Agreement (the “Aegis Agreement”) with Aegis Therapeutics LLC (“Aegis”) that provides us with an exclusive royalty-free research license for a period of time to Aegis’ proprietary delivery enhancement and stabilization agents, including Aegis’ ProTek® and Intravail® technologies (collectively, the “Technology”) to enable us to conduct a feasibility study of opioid antagonists when used with the Technology (the “Study”). During this period of time, we may also evaluate its interest in having an exclusive license to the Technology for use with opioid antagonists to treat, diagnose, predict, detect or prevent any disease, disorder, state, condition or malady in humans (the “Possible License”). Aegis had granted us an exclusive option to obtain the Possible License for a certain period after the study is completed. In consideration of the license granted to us pursuant to the Aegis Agreement, we paid Aegis a nonrefundable study fee.
 
On October 6, 2015, we entered into an amendment to the Aegis Agreement. This amendment had an effective date of May 19, 2015 and allowed us to evaluate the Technology through August 17, 2015. The amendment also provided an opportunity for us to elect to further extend the period of time during which we could evaluate the Technology through February 13, 2016. In exchange for electing to further extend this period of time, we paid Aegis $75,000 and issued 13,697 shares of our Common Stock. The shares issued in this transaction were valued using the stock price at issuance date and amounted to $106,152. During February 2016, we elected to further extend the period of time during which we could evaluate Aegis’ Technology through August 11, 2016. During February 2016, we paid Aegis $75,000 and issued 10,746 shares of our Common Stock. The shares issued in this transaction were valued using the stock price at issuance date and amounted to $106,385. On April 26, 2016, we entered into the Restated Aegis Agreement (as defined below).
 
On April 26, 2016, we entered into the Amended and Restated Material Transfer, Option and Research License Agreement (the “Restated Aegis Agreement”) with Aegis which amended and restated in its entirety the Aegis Agreement. Under the Restated Aegis Agreement, we have been granted an exclusive royalty-free research license to Aegis’ Technology for a period of time (the “Compound Research Period”), to enable us to conduct a feasibility study of opioid antagonists when used with the Technology and evaluate our interest in licensing the Technology through use of a “Compound” (as defined in the Restated Aegis Agreement) in additional studies.
 
We agreed to pay Aegis (i) an aggregate of $300,000, of which we elected to pay up to 50% by issuing shares of our Common Stock to Aegis as consideration for extending the Compound Research Period pursuant to two separate extension payments of $150,000 each, and (ii) 50,000 shares of Common Stock as partial consideration for entering into the Restated Aegis Agreement. We exercised such extensions through payment of the first and second extension fees prior to October 13, 2015 and prior to February 13, 2016, respectively.

On June 22, 2017, we entered into a license agreement with Aegis (the “License Agreement No. 2”) and a related supply agreement (the “Supply Agreement”) pursuant to which we granted an exclusive license (the “License”) to Aegis’ proprietary chemically synthesizable delivery enhancement and stabilization agents, including, but not limited to, Aegis’ Intravail® absorption enhancement agents, ProTek® and HydroGel® (collectively, the “Technology”) to exploit (a) the Compounds (as such are defined in the License Agreement No. 2) and (b) a product containing a Compound and formulated using the Technology (“Product”), in each case of (a) and (b) for any and all purposes. The License Agreement No. 2 restricts our ability to manufacture any Aegis excipients included in the Technology (“Excipients”), except for certain instances of supply failure, supply shortage or termination of the Supply Agreement, and we shall obtain all supply of such Excipients from Aegis under the Supply Agreement. The License Agreement No. 2 also restricts Aegis’s ability to compete with us worldwide with respect to the Exploitation (as defined in the License Agreement No. 2) of any therapeutic containing a Compound or derivative or active metabolite of a Compound without our prior written consent. The effective date of the License Agreement No. 2 and the Supply Agreement is January 1, 2017. 
 
As consideration for the grant of the License, we agreed to pay Aegis two immaterial upfront payments, of which we may elect to pay up to 50% by issuing our Common Stock to Aegis, with the number of shares to be issued equal to 75% of the average closing price of our Common Stock over the 20 trading days preceding the date of payment. The License Agreement No. 2 also provides for (A) additional developmental milestone payments for each Product containing a different Compound equal to up to an aggregate of $1.8 million, (B) additional commercialization milestone payments for each Product containing a different Compound equal to up to an aggregate of $5.0 million, and (C) single low digit royalties on the Annual Net Sales (as defined in the License Agreement No. 2) of all Products during the Royalty Term (as defined in the License Agreement No. 2) according to a tiered royalty rate based on Annual Net Sales of the Products by us, our sublicensees and affiliates. We shall also pay to Aegis a sublicense fee based on a sublicense rate to be negotiated in good faith by the parties. The License Agreement contains customary representations and warranties, ownership, patent rights, confidentiality, indemnification and insurance provisions. The License Agreement shall expire upon the expiration of our obligation to pay royalties under such License Agreement; provided, however, that we shall have the right to terminate the License granted on a Product-by-Product or country-by-country basis upon 30 days’ prior written notice to Aegis.
 
Under the terms of the Supply Agreement, Aegis shall deliver to us any preclinical, clinical and commercial supply of the Excipients, which Aegis sources from various contract manufacturers. The Supply Agreement has a term of 20 years but shall terminate automatically in the event of expiration or termination of the License Agreement No. 2 or at any time upon the written agreement of both parties. The Supply Agreement contains customary provisions relating to pricing for such materials, forecasts, delivery, inspection, indemnification, insurance and representations, warranties and covenants. The Supply Agreement includes technology transfer provisions for the transfer of all materials and know-how specific to the manufacturing of the Excipients that is necessary or useful for us to manufacture such Excipients. We do not have the right to manufacture such Excipients except in the event that Aegis is unable to supply and sell any portion of the material to us (subject to a 60-day cure period). 
 
In November 2016, Opiant Pharmaceuticals UK Limited (“OPUK”) was incorporated under the Companies Act of 2006 as a private company. OPUK is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company and Dr. Roger Crystal, the Chief Executive Officer and a director of the Company, and Kevin Pollack, the Chief Financial Officer, Secretary and Treasurer of the Company, served as the sole directors of OPUK as of July 31, 2017. On September 11, 2017, Mr. Pollack resigned as a director and the Chairman of OPUK and was replaced in his capacity as Chief Financial Officer and as a director of OPUK by David D. O’Toole, the Company’s new Chief Financial Officer (see note 13 – Subsequent Events).
 
On April 20, 2017, we entered into an Office Service Agreement (the “Office Service Agreement”) with Regus to lease office space at 83 Baker Street, London, England, W1U 6AG. Per the terms of the Office Service Agreement, the first month’s rent is £2,473 with monthly rental payments of £7,521 thereafter. We were required to pay a security deposit of £15,042, which is the equivalent of two months of rent. The Office Service Agreement commenced on May 22, 2017 and terminates on May 31, 2018, with either party being able to terminate this agreement as of May 31, 2018 by providing written notice three months in advance of the termination date of May 31, 2018.

Government Regulation
 
Government authorities in the United States, at the federal, state, and local levels, and in other countries and jurisdictions, including the European Union, extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, product approval, manufacture, quality control, safety, effectiveness, manufacturing changes, packaging, storage, record-keeping, labeling, promotion, advertising, sales, distribution, marketing, and import and export of drugs and biologic products. All of our foreseeable product candidates are expected to be regulated as drugs. In particular, therapeutic product candidates for human use are subject to rigorous preclinical and clinical testing and other requirements of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (“FFDCA”), implemented by the FDA, as well as similar statutory and regulatory requirements of foreign countries. The processes for obtaining regulatory approval in the U.S. and in foreign countries and jurisdictions, along with ongoing compliance with applicable statutes and regulations and other regulatory authorities both pre- and post-commercialization, are a significant factor in the production and marketing of our products and our R&D activities and require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Any failure by us or our collaborators, licensors or licensees to obtain, or any delay in obtaining, regulatory approvals or in complying with other regulatory requirements could adversely affect the commercialization of product candidates then being developed by us and our ability to receive product or royalty revenues.
Competition
 
The specialty pharmaceutical industry is intensely competitive and is characterized by rapid technological progress. Certain pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical companies and academic and research organizations currently engage in, or have engaged in, efforts related to the discovery and development of new medicines for the treatment of substance use, addictive and eating disorders. Significant levels of research in chemistry and biotechnology occur in universities and other nonprofit research institutions. These entities have become increasingly active in seeking patent protection and licensing revenues for their research results. They also compete with us in recruiting skilled scientific talent. Some of these companies are larger and better-funded than us and there are no assurances that we can effectively compete with these competitors. Potential competitors include Indivior PLC, Alkermes PLC, H. Lundbeck A/S, Shire PLC, Camurus AB, Orexo AB, BioDelivery Services International, Inc., Braeburn Pharmaceuticals, Inc., INSYS Therapeutics, BioCorRx, Inc. and Cerecor Inc.
 
With respect to NARCAN® (naloxone hydrochloride) Nasal Spray, we face competition from other treatments, including injectable naloxone, auto-injectors and improvised nasal kits. Amphastar Pharmaceuticals, Inc. competes with NARCAN® (naloxone hydrochloride) Nasal Spray with their naloxone injection. Kaléo competes with NARCAN® (naloxone hydrochloride) Nasal Spray with their auto-injector known as EVZIO™ (naloxone HCl injection) Auto-Injector. In 2015, Indivior PLC received a Complete Response Letter from the FDA with respect to a naloxone nasal spray. In 2016, TEVA filed an NDA with the FDA seeking regulatory approval to market a generic version of NARCAN® (naloxone hydrochloride) Nasal Spray before the expiration of the ‘253 patent. Although NARCAN® (naloxone hydrochloride) Nasal Spray was the first FDA-approved naloxone nasal spray for the emergency reversal of opioid overdoses and has advantages over certain other treatments, we expect the treatment to face additional competition.
 
Patents and Proprietary Information
 
We have obtained and intend to actively seek to obtain, when appropriate, protection for our products and proprietary technology by means of U.S. and foreign patents, trademarks and contractual arrangements. In addition, we rely upon trade secrets and contractual agreements to protect certain of our proprietary technology and products. We have issued U.S. patents and pending U.S. patent applications, as well as pending foreign patent applications or issued foreign patents, relating to our marketed products and product candidates. We also have U.S. and foreign patent applications pending relating to novel product concepts. There can be no assurance that our patent applications will issue as patents or, with respect to our issued patents, that they will provide us with significant protection.

Renaissance will conduct quality control and testing, including non-stability, stability, in-use, raw material, and packaging component testing as part of the services provided to us under the Renaissance Agreement. We will own all formulations provided to Renaissance and any formulations developed in connection with the Renaissance Agreement. Renaissance will own all know-how developed in connection with the performance of the services that is not solely related to a product. We have the right to seek patent protection on any invention or know-how that relates solely to a product developed under the Renaissance Agreement or any our formulation, excluding general manufacturing or product development know-how of Renaissance. We have agreed to indemnify Renaissance in connection with claims arising out of any clinical trials, ownership, testing, use, application, consumption, distribution, marketing or sale of the Product, or any violation or infringement of any patent, copyright or trademark from the use of our designated formula, component or artwork related to the Product irrespective of whether we had knowledge of such infringement or violation. The Renaissance Agreement is effective until terminated by either party in accordance with its terms. We or Renaissance may terminate the project under a proposal to the Renaissance Agreement due to unforeseen circumstances in the development. The Renaissance Agreement may be terminated by us, with or without cause, upon 45 days’ written notice. There are also mutual customary termination provisions relating to uncured breaches of material provisions. Renaissance may terminate the Renaissance Agreement in the event of bankruptcy of us or our failure for a period of 180 consecutive days to use commercially reasonable efforts to undertake or further activities to advance the possibility of the commercialization of a Product.
Employees
 
As of July 31, 2017, we had 11 full-time employees and zero part-time employees. In addition, we have numerous outside consultants that are not on our payroll.
