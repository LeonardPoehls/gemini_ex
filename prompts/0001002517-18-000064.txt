Using advanced analytics and algorithms, our technologies create personalized experiences and transform the way people interact with information and the technology around them. We market and sell our solutions and technologies around the world directly through a dedicated sales force, and also through a global network of resellers, including system integrators, independent software vendors, value-added resellers, distributors, hardware vendors, telecommunications carriers and e-commerce websites.
We are a global organization steeped in research and development. We have approximately 2,100 language scientists, developers, and engineers dedicated to continually refining our technologies and advancing our portfolio to better meet our customers’ diverse and changing needs. We have more than 60 international operating locations and a sales presence in more than 81 countries. Our corporate headquarters is located in Burlington, Massachusetts, with international headquarter in Dublin, Ireland. In fiscal year 2018, our revenue was $2.1 billion.
Our Strategy 
We have large addressable vertical markets, and we focus on growth by providing industry-leading, value-add solutions for our customers and partners through a broad set of flexible technologies, solutions, and service offerings available directly and through our channel partners. The key elements of our strategy include:

• | Focus on opportunities that leverage our core strengths in key vertical markets. During the third quarter of fiscal year 2018, we commenced a comprehensive portfolio and business review with the goal to improve long-term shareholder return and operational efficiency. We are moving toward a goal of a simplified and more efficient operational structure, capable of sustainable, long-term revenue and earnings growth, with resources keenly focused on opportunities that leverage our core strengths in key vertical markets. We plan to focus our resources and R&D capabilities on our core capabilities and shift our focus away from non-core businesses and solutions.

• | Maintain global leadership in all of our major markets and solutions areas. We have historically targeted markets where we benefit from strong technology, sales and vertical market differentiation. Today, we are one of the leading providers of voice recognition and NLU. We invest considerable time and resources to ensure that we maintain this position through customer satisfaction, technology leadership, deep domain experience and market specialization. 


• | Maintain depth in technology, solutions, and intellectual property portfolio. We have built a world-class portfolio of technologies, applications, solutions and intellectual property through both internal development and acquisitions. We expect to continue to pursue opportunities to expand our assets, geographic presence, distribution network and customer base through organic growth and strategic transactions. We continue to strengthen our core technologies in voice and language, and expand our offerings through research and innovations in AI, including cognitive computing and machine learning. 


• | Continue to expand our extensive network of global operations, distribution and services networks. We market and sell our solutions and technologies directly through a dedicated sales force and through a global network of resellers, including system integrators, independent software vendors, value-added resellers, distributors, hardware vendors, and telecommunications carriers and e-commerce websites. In addition, we continue to expand our presence within our markets, such as ambulatory markets in our Healthcare segment and omni-channel customer services in our Enterprise segment, and we have expanded initiatives in geographic markets such as China, Latin America and Southeast Asia. 


• | Continue to expand hosting and transaction-based offerings. We remain focused on increasing our hosting and transaction-based offerings. We generate hosting revenues through on-demand models that typically have multi-year terms with pricing based on volume of usage, number of transactions, number of seats or number of devices. This pricing structure allows customers to use our products at a lower initial cost when compared to the sale of a perpetual license. This will enable us to deliver applications that our customers use, and pay for, on a recurring basis, providing us with the opportunity to benefit from recurring revenue streams. 


• | Maintain significant presence and customer preference in our markets. We specialize in creating large, enterprise-class solutions that are used by many of the world’s largest companies. By combining our core technology, professional services, local presence and deep domain experience, we are able to deliver these specialized offerings for our customers and partners. We have established a trusted position in numerous markets and today work with a majority of the Fortune 100 companies. 


• | Strengthen financial profile with improvement in revenue, earnings per share, margin, and cash flow. We are focused on improving our financial performance by executing upon identified strategic initiatives and further evolving our business toward recurring revenue models, which are positioning us for increased future revenue and profitability growth. Recurring revenue represented 71.4%, 72.5% and 69.6% of total revenue in fiscal years 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.

As of September 30, 2018, we held approximately 4,070 patents and 575 patent applications. Our intellectual property is critical to our success and competitive position. 
Competition
The markets in which we compete are highly competitive and are subject to rapid technology changes. There are a number of companies that develop or may develop solutions and technologies that compete in our target markets; however, currently no company directly competes with us across all of our solutions and technologies. While we expect competition to continue to increase both from existing competitors and new market entrants, we believe that we will compete effectively based on many factors, including:

• | Specialized Professional Services. Our superior technology, when coupled with the high quality and domain knowledge of our professional services organization, allows our customers and partners to place a high degree of confidence and trust in our ability to deliver results. We support our customers in designing and building powerful innovative solutions that specifically address their needs and requirements. 


• | International Coverage. The international reach of our solutions and technologies is due to the broad language coverage of our offerings, including our ASR and NLU solutions, which provide recognition for approximately 70 languages and dialects and natural-sounding synthesized speech in over 160 voices, and support a broad range of hardware platforms and operating systems.

Technology publications, analyst research and independent benchmarks have consistently indicated that our solutions and technologies rank at or above performance levels of alternative solutions. 


• | Broad Distribution Channels. Our ability to address the needs of specific markets, such as financial, law, healthcare and government, and to introduce new solutions and technologies quickly and effectively is provided by our direct sales force, our extensive global network of resellers, comprising system integrators, independent software vendors, value-added resellers, hardware vendors, telecommunications carriers and distributors, and our e-commerce website. 

In our Healthcare business, we compete primarily with M*Modal, Optum, 3M and other smaller providers. In our Automotive business we compete, or may in the future compete, with Amazon, Google, iFlyTek and Microsoft as well as with other, smaller vendors, particularly in China. In our Imaging business we compete primarily with ABBYY and Adobe. Also, some of our partners such as Avaya, Cisco, and Genesys develop and market products that might be considered substitutes for our Enterprise solutions. Additionally, a number of smaller companies in voice recognition, natural language understanding, text input and imaging offer technologies or products that are competitive with our solutions. 
Current and potential competitors have established, or may establish, cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties to increase the ability of their technologies to address the needs of our prospective customers.
Some of our competitors or potential competitors, such as Adobe, Google, and 3M, have significantly greater financial, technical and marketing resources than we do. These competitors may be able to respond more rapidly than we can to new or emerging technologies or changes in customer requirements. They may also devote greater resources to the development, promotion and sale of their products than we do.
