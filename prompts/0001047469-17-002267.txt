  General 
         Hill International, Inc., with 4,300 professionals in 100 offices worldwide, provides program management, project management, construction management and other consulting services primarily to the buildings, transportation, environmental, energy and industrial markets. According to Engineering News-Record magazine Hill was recently ranked as the eighth largest construction management firm in the United States. The terms "Hill", the "Company", "we", "us" and "our" refer to Hill International, Inc. 
         We compete for business based on a variety of factors such as technical capability, global resources, price, reputation and past experience, including client requirements for substantial experience in similar projects. We have developed significant long-standing relationships, which bring us repeat business and would be very difficult to replicate. We believe we have an excellent reputation for attracting and retaining professionals. In addition, we believe there are high barriers to entry for new competitors especially in the project management market. 
   Our Strategy 
         Our strategy emphasizes the following key elements:
 

Increase Revenues from Our Existing Clients. We have long-standing relationships with a number
of public and private sector entities. Meeting our clients' diverse needs in managing construction risk and generating repeat business from our clients to expand our project base is one of our key
growth strategies. We accomplish this objective by providing a broad range of project management consulting services in a wide range of geographic areas that support our clients during every phase of
a project, from concept through completion. We believe that nurturing our existing client relationships expands our project base through repeat
business.
 Capitalize Upon the Continued Spend in the Markets We Serve.  We believe
that the demand for project management services will grow with increasing construction and infrastructure spending in the markets we serve. We believe that our reputation and experience combined with
our broad platform of service offerings will enable us to capitalize on increases in demand for our services. In addition, we strategically open new offices to expand into new geographic areas and we
aggressively hire individuals with significant contacts to accelerate growth of these new offices and to strengthen our presence in existing markets. 
 Strengthen Professional Resources.  Our biggest asset is the people that
work for Hill. We intend to continue spending significant time recruiting and retaining the best and the brightest to improve our competitive position. Our independent status has attracted top project
management

talent
with varied industry experience. We believe maintaining and bolstering our team will enable us to continue to grow our business. 


 Pursue Acquisitions Selectively.  We operate in a highly fragmented industry
with many smaller, regional competitors. Our acquisition strategy has allowed us to manage risk by diversifying our markets, which has enabled us to compete better by integrating capabilities and
obtaining new relationships. We have pursued acquisitions primarily for three reasons: to expand into new geographic markets, to improve capabilities, resources and critical mass in existing
geographic markets, and to enhance our capabilities and resources in certain strategic market sectors. Selectively, we intend to focus primarily on U.S. acquisitions to expand our domestic presence
and enhance capabilities in specific areas and secondarily on foreign acquisitions that bring new relationships as well as expand our geographic base. 

 Reporting Segments 
         On December 20, 2016, we entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement to sell our Construction Claims Group, which is reported herein as discontinued operations. This transaction will permit us to strengthen our balance sheet and better focus on our Project Management business. See Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements for a description of the transaction. 
         Our Project Management Group provides fee-based or "agency" construction management services to our clients, leveraging our construction expertise to identify potential trouble, difficulties and sources of delay on a construction project before they develop into costly problems. Our experienced professionals are capable of managing all phases of the construction process from concept through completion, including cost and budget controls, scheduling, estimating, expediting, inspection, contract administration and management of contractors, subcontractors and suppliers. 
         Our clients are typically billed a negotiated multiple of the actual direct cost of each professional assigned to a project and we are reimbursed for our out-of-pocket expenses. We believe our fee-based consulting has significant advantages over traditional general contractors. Specifically, because we do not assume project completion risk, our fee-based model eliminates many of the risks typically associated with providing "at risk" construction services. 
         Our total revenue consists of two components: consulting fee revenue ("CFR") and reimbursable expenses. Reimbursable expenses are reflected in equal amounts in both total revenue and total direct expenses. Because these revenue/costs may be subject to significant fluctuation from year to year, we measure the performance of many of our key operating metrics as a percentage of CFR, as we believe that this is a better and more consistent measure of operating performance than total revenue. Throughout this report we have used CFR as the denominator in many of our ratios.

  Grow Organically and Through Selective Acquisitions 
         Over the years, our business has expanded through organic growth and the acquisition of a number of project management businesses. Over the past 18 years, we have completed 14 acquisitions of project management businesses. 
         We believe that our industry includes a number of small regional companies in a highly fragmented market. We believe that we have significant experience and expertise in identifying, negotiating, completing and integrating acquisitions and view the acquisition of these smaller competitors as a key part of our growth strategy. Through our acquisitions, we gained entry into Spain, Mexico, Poland, Brazil and Turkey and expanded our presence in the United States. These transactions have enabled us to strengthen our geographic diversity and compete more effectively. 
   Clients 
         Our clients consist primarily of the United States and other national governments, state and local governments, and the private sector. The following table sets forth our breakdown of CFR attributable to these categories of clients for each of the past three fiscal years (dollars in thousands):

  Business Development 
         The process for acquiring business from each of our categories of clients is principally the same, by participating in a competitive request-for-proposal ("RFP") process, with the primary difference among clients being that the process for public sector clients is significantly more formal and complex than for private sector clients as a result of government procurement rules and regulations that govern the public-sector process. 
         Although a significant factor in our business development consists of our standing in our industry, including existing relationships and reputation based on performance on completed projects, our marketing department undertakes a variety of activities in order to expand our exposure to potential new clients. These activities include media relations, advertising, promotions, market sector initiatives and maintaining our website and related web marketing. Media relations include placing articles that feature us and our personnel in trade publications and other media outlets. Our promotions include arranging speaking engagements for our personnel, participation in trade shows and other promotional activities. Market sector initiatives are designed to broaden our exposure to specific sectors of the construction industry, such as, for example, participating in or organizing industry seminars. 
         Doing business with governments is complex and requires the ability to comply with intricate regulations and satisfy periodic audits. We believe that the ability to understand these requirements and to successfully conduct business with government agencies is a barrier to entry for smaller, less experienced competitors. Most government contracts, including those with foreign governments, are subject to termination by the government, to government audits and to continued appropriations. For the year ended December 31, 2016, CFR from U.S. and foreign government contracts represented approximately 59.3% of our total CFR. 
         We are required from time to time to obtain various permits, licenses and approvals in order to conduct our business in many of the jurisdictions where we operate. Our business of providing project management services is not subject to significant regulation by state, federal or foreign governments. 
   Contracts 
         The price provisions of our Project Management related contracts can be grouped into three broad categories: cost-plus, time and materials, and fixed-price. Cost-plus contracts provide for reimbursement of our costs and overhead plus a predetermined fee. Under some cost-plus contracts, our fee may be based partially on quality, schedule and other performance factors. We also enter into contracts whereby we bill our clients monthly at hourly billing rates. The hourly billing rates are determined by contract terms. For governmental clients, the hourly rates are generally calculated as salary costs plus overhead costs plus a negotiated profit percentage. For commercial clients, the hourly rate can be taken from a standard fee schedule by staff classification or it can be at a discount from this schedule. In 
 7

   some cases, primarily for foreign work, a monthly rate is negotiated rather than an hourly rate. This monthly rate is a build-up of staffing costs plus overhead and profit. We account for these contracts on a time-and-materials method, recognizing revenue as costs are incurred. Fixed-price contracts are accounted for using the "percentage-of-completion" method, wherein revenue is recognized as costs are incurred. 
   Backlog 
         We believe a strong indicator of our future performance is our backlog of uncompleted projects under contract or awarded. Our backlog represents management's estimate of the amount of contracts and awards in hand that we expect to result in future consulting fees. Our backlog is evaluated by management on a project-by-project basis and is reported for each period shown based upon the binding nature of the underlying contract, commitment or letter of intent, and other factors, including the economic, financial and regulatory viability of the project and the likelihood of the contract being extended, renewed or cancelled. 
         Our backlog is important to us in anticipating and planning for our operational needs. Backlog is not a measure defined in U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, and our methodology for determining backlog may not be comparable to the methodology used by other companies in determining their backlog. 
         At December 31, 2016, our Project Management backlog was $831,000,000, compared to approximately $807,000,000 at December 31, 2015. Our net bookings during 2016 of $ 458,147,000, which equates to a book-to-bill ratio of 106% compared to our goal of at least 110%. While this is short of our expectations, it is consistent with the slowdown of project activity in the Middle East due to the economic impact caused by the drop in oil prices and political upheaval and civil unrest in certain parts of the region. This will continue to be a major area of focus for 2017. We estimate that approximately $334,000,000, or 40.2% of the backlog at December 31, 2016, will be recognized during our 2017 fiscal year. 
         Although backlog reflects business that we consider to be firm, cancellations or scope adjustments may occur. Further, substantially all of our contracts with our clients may be terminated at will, in which case the client would only be obligated to us for services provided through the termination date. Historically, the impact of terminations and modifications on our realization of revenue from our backlog has not been significant, however, in December 2016, the Company had two contracts, one in the Middle East and one in Africa, cancelled. As a result, approximately $73,000,000 was excluded from our backlog at December 31, 2016. Furthermore, reductions of our backlog as a result of contract terminations and modifications may be offset by additions to the backlog. 
         We adjust backlog to reflect project cancellations, deferrals and revisions in scope and cost (both upward and downward) known at the reporting date. Future contract modifications or cancellations, 
 8

   however, may increase or reduce backlog and future revenue. The following tables show our backlog by geographic region (in thousands):

  Competition 
         The project management industry is highly competitive. We compete for contracts, primarily on the basis of technical capability, with numerous entities, including design or engineering firms, general contractors, other "pure" construction management companies, management consulting firms and other entities. Compared to us, many of these competitors are larger, well-established companies that have broader geographic scope and greater financial and other resources. During 2016, some of our largest project management competitors included: AECOM, ARCADIS N.V., Jacobs Engineering Group, Inc., WSP Parsons Brinckerhoff, Inc., Parsons Corp. and Turner Construction Co. 
 Insurance 
         We maintain insurance covering general and professional liability, involving bodily injury and property damage. We have historically enjoyed a favorable loss ratio in all lines of insurance and our management considers our present limits of liability, deductibles and reserves to be adequate. We endeavor to reduce or eliminate risk through the use of quality assurance/control, risk management, workplace safety and similar methods to eliminate or reduce the risk of losses on a project. Although our actual rates have decreased, we have experienced and expect to continue to experience increases in the dollar amount of our insurance premiums because of the increase in our revenue.

      Item 1A.    Risk Factors. 
        Our business involves a number of risks, some of which are beyond our control. The risks and uncertainties described below could individually or collectively have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. While these are not the only risks and uncertainties we face, we believe that the more significant risks and uncertainties are as follows: 
 Risks Affecting the Business 
   Acts of terrorism, political, governmental and social upheaval and threats of armed conflicts in or around various areas in which we operate could limit or disrupt markets and our operations, including disruptions resulting from the evacuation of personnel, cancellation of contracts or the loss of personnel. 
         Acts of terrorism, political, governmental and social upheaval and threats of armed conflicts in or around various areas in which we operate could limit or disrupt markets and our operations, including disruptions resulting from the evacuation of personnel, cancellation of contracts or the loss of personnel, and may affect timing and collectability of our accounts receivable. Such events may cause further disruption to financial and commercial markets and may generate greater political and economic instability in some of the geographic areas in which we operate. In addition, any possible reprisals as a consequence of the wars and ongoing military action in the Middle East and Africa, such as acts of terrorism in the United States or elsewhere, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial position. 
   If our clients delay in paying or fail to pay amounts owed to us, it could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, results of operations and financial condition. 
         Accounts receivable represent the largest asset on our balance sheet. While we take steps to evaluate and manage the credit risks relating to our clients, economic downturns or other events can adversely affect the markets we serve and our clients ability to pay, which could reduce our ability to collect all amounts due from clients. In addition, political unrest in countries in which we operate and 
 12

   the effect of the decline of oil prices have impacted and may in the future impact our collections on accounts receivable. If our clients delay in paying or fail to pay us a significant amount of our outstanding receivables, it could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, results of operations, and financial condition. 
   Our business is sensitive to oil and gas prices, and fluctuations in oil and gas prices may negatively affect our business. 
         Historically, oil and natural gas prices have been volatile and are subject to fluctuations in response to changes in supply and demand, market uncertainty and a variety of additional factors that are beyond our control. Consulting fee revenue derived from our operations in major oil and gas producing countries in the Middle East and Africa is approximately 52.0% of CFR. Significant drops in oil or gas prices have led, and could lead to further slowdowns, in construction in these regions, which has had and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. 
   Unfavorable global economic conditions could adversely affect our business, liquidity and financial results. 
         The markets that we serve are cyclical and subject to fluctuation based on general global economic conditions and other factors. Unfavorable global economic conditions, including disruption of financial markets in the United States, Europe, Brazil and elsewhere, could adversely affect our business and results of operations, primarily by limiting our access to credit and disrupting our clients' businesses. The reduction in financial institutions' willingness or ability to lend has increased the cost of capital and reduced the availability of credit. Although we currently believe that the financial institutions with which we do business will be able to fulfill their commitments to us, there is no assurance that those institutions will be able or willing to continue to do so, which could have a material adverse impact on our business. The current European debt crisis and Brazil economic crisis may cause the value of European and Brazilian currencies, including the Euro, British pound sterling and Brazilian real, to deteriorate, thus reducing the purchasing power of European and Brazilian clients and reducing the translated amounts of U.S. dollar revenues. For the year ended December 31, 2016, 8.8% and 4.3% of our consulting fee revenue was attributable to European and Brazilian clients, respectively. In addition, any negative change in general market conditions in the United States, Europe or other national economies important to our businesses may adversely affect our clients' level of spending, ability to obtain financing, and ability to make timely payments to us for our services, which could require us to increase our allowance for doubtful accounts, negatively impact our days sales outstanding and adversely affect our results of operations and liquidity. 
   The sale of our Construction Claims Group is contingent upon the satisfaction of a number of conditions, may require significant time and attention of our management, and may have a material adverse effect on us whether or not the transaction is completed. 
         On December 20, 2016, we announced the entrance into a Stock Purchase Agreement which would sell our Construction Claims Group. This transaction is subject to customary conditions. In addition, unanticipated developments or changes in our ability to satisfy closing conditions, in the buyer's willingness to waive unsatisfied closing conditions, or in certain litigation matters, as well as other developments, conditions, or changes may affect the closing of the sale. For these and other reasons, we may not complete the sale as expected or at all. 
 13

           Our ongoing businesses may be adversely affected and we may be subject to certain risks and consequences as a result of pursuing the transaction, including, among others, the following:
 

 Execution of the proposed transaction will continue to require significant time and attention from management, which may distract them from the
operation of our business and the execution of other initiatives that may have been beneficial to us; 
 Our employees may be distracted due to uncertainty about their future roles with the Company or the Construction Claims Group pending the
completion of the transaction; 
 We will be required to pay significant costs and expenses relating to the transaction, such as legal, accounting and other professional fees,
whether or not the transaction is completed; and 
 We may experience negative reactions from the financial markets if we fail to complete the transaction. 

         Any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows or the price of our common stock. 
   We may be unable to win new contract awards if we cannot provide clients with letters of credit, bonds or other forms of guarantees. 
         In certain international regions, primarily the Middle East, it is industry practice for clients to require letters of credit, bonds, bank guarantees or other forms of guarantees. These letters of credit, bonds or guarantees indemnify our clients if we fail to perform our obligations under our contracts. We currently have relationships with various domestic and international banking institutions to assist us in providing clients with letters of credit or guarantees. In the event there are limitations in worldwide banking capacity, we may find it difficult to find sufficient bonding capacity to meet our future bonding needs. Failure to provide credit enhancements on terms required by a client may result in our inability to compete or win a project. 
   International operations and doing business with foreign governments expose us to legal, political, operational and economic risks in different countries and currency exchange rate fluctuations could adversely affect our financial results. 
         Our international operations contributed 68.3%, 73.8% and 76.2% of our consulting fee revenue for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. There are risks inherent in doing business internationally, including:
 

 Lack of developed legal systems to enforce contractual rights; 
 Foreign governments may assert sovereign or other immunity if we seek to assert our contractual rights thus depriving us of any ability to seek
redress against them; 
 Greater difficulties in managing and staffing foreign operations; 
 Differences in employment laws and practices which could expose us to liabilities for payroll taxes, pensions and other expenses; 
 Inadequate or failed internal controls, processes, people, and systems associated with foreign operations; 
 Increased logistical complexity; 
 Increased selling, general and administrative expenses associated with managing a larger and more global business; 
 Greater risk of uncollectible accounts and longer collection cycles; 

 14

   

 Currency exchange rate fluctuations; 
 Restrictions on the transfer of cash from certain foreign countries; 
 Imposition of governmental controls; 
 Political and economic instability; 
 Changes in U.S. and other national government policies affecting the markets for our services and our ability to do business with certain
foreign governments or their political leaders; 
 Conflict between U.S. and non-U.S. law; 
 Changes in regulatory practices, tariffs and taxes; 
 Less well established bankruptcy and insolvency procedures; 
 Potential non-compliance with a wide variety of non-U.S. laws and regulations; and 
 General economic, political and civil conditions in these foreign markets. 

         Any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. 
   We operate in many different jurisdictions and we could be adversely affected by any violations of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act or similar worldwide and local anti-corruption laws. 
         The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act and similar worldwide and local anti-corruption laws in other jurisdictions, generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Our internal policies mandate compliance with these anti-corruption laws. The policies also are applicable to agents through which we do business in certain non-U.S. jurisdictions. We operate in many parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree, and in certain circumstances, strict compliance with anti-corruption laws may conflict with local customs and practices. Despite our training and compliance programs, we cannot assure you that our internal control policies and procedures always will protect us from improper or criminal acts committed by our employees or agents. Our continued expansion outside the U.S., including in developing countries, could increase the risk of such violations in the future. Violations of these laws, or allegations of such violations, could disrupt our business, subject us to fines, penalties and restrictions and otherwise result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition. All of our recently acquired businesses are subject to our internal policies. However, because our internal policies are more restrictive than some local laws or customs where we operate, we may be at an increased risk for violations while we train our new employees to comply with our internal policies and procedures. 
   Our business sometimes requires our employees to travel to and work in high security risk countries, which may result in employee injury, repatriation costs or other unforeseen costs. 
         Many of our employees often travel to and work in high security risk countries around the world that are undergoing or that may undergo political, social and economic upheavals resulting in war, civil unrest, criminal activity or acts of terrorism. For example, we have had and expect to have significant projects in the Middle East and Africa, including in Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Oman. As a result, we may be subject to costs related to employee injury, repatriation or other unforeseen circumstances. Further, circumstances in these countries could make it difficult or impossible to attract and retain qualified employees. Our inability to attract and retain qualified employees to work in these countries could have a material adverse effect on our operations. 
 15

     We depend on government contracts for a significant portion of our consulting fee revenue. Our inability to win profitable government contracts could harm our operations and adversely affect our net earnings. 
         In 2016, U.S. federal government contracts and U.S. state, regional and local government contracts contributed approximately 2.2% and 21.8%, respectively, of our consulting fee revenue, and foreign government contracts contributed approximately 35.3% of our consulting fee revenue. Our inability to win profitable government contracts could harm our operations and adversely affect our net earnings. Government contracts are typically awarded through a heavily regulated procurement process. Some government contracts are awarded to multiple competitors, causing increases in overall competition and pricing pressure. In turn, the competition and pricing pressure may require us to make sustained post-award efforts to reduce costs under these contracts. If we are not successful in reducing the amount of costs, our profitability on these contracts may be negatively impacted. Also, some of our federal government contracts require U.S. government security clearances. If we or certain of our personnel were to lose these security clearances, our ability to continue performance of these contracts or to win new contracts requiring such clearances may be negatively impacted. 
   We depend on long-term government contracts, many of which are funded on an annual basis. If appropriations are not made in subsequent years of a multiple-year contract, we will not realize all of our potential revenue and profit from that project. 
         During the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, approximately 59.3%, 61.2% and 63.7%, respectively, of our consulting fee revenue was derived from contracts with federal, state, regional, local and foreign governments. 
         Most government contracts are subject to the continuing availability of legislative appropriation. Legislatures typically appropriate funds for a given program on a year-by-year basis, even though contract performance may take more than one year. As a result, at the beginning of a program, the related contract is only partially funded, and additional funding is normally committed only as appropriations are made in each subsequent fiscal year. These appropriations and the timing of payment of appropriated amounts may be influenced by, among other things, the state of the economy, budgetary and other political issues affecting the particular government and its appropriations process, competing priorities for appropriation, the timing and amount of tax receipts and the overall level of government expenditures. If appropriations are not made in subsequent years on government contracts, then we will not realize all of our potential revenue and profit from those contracts. 
   We depend on contracts that may be terminated by our clients on short notice, which may adversely impact our ability to recognize all of our potential revenue and profit from the projects. 
         Substantially all of our contracts are subject to termination by the client either at its convenience or upon our default. If one of our clients terminates a contract at its convenience, then we typically are able to recover only costs incurred or committed, settlement expenses and profit on work completed prior to termination, which could prevent us from recognizing all of our potential revenue and profit from that contract. If one of our clients terminates the contract due to our default, we could be liable for excess costs incurred by the client in re-procuring services from another source, as well as other costs. 
   Our contracts with governmental agencies are subject to audit, which could result in adjustments to reimbursable contract costs or, if we are charged with wrongdoing, possible temporary or permanent suspension from participating in government programs. 
         Our books and records are subject to audit by the various governmental agencies we serve and by their representatives. These audits can result in adjustments to reimbursable contract costs and allocated overhead. In addition, if as a result of an audit, we or one of our subsidiaries is charged with 
 16

   wrongdoing or the government agency determines that we or one of our subsidiaries is otherwise no longer eligible for federal contracts, then we or, as applicable, that subsidiary, could be temporarily suspended or, in the event of convictions or civil judgments, could be prohibited from bidding on and receiving future government contracts for a period of time. Furthermore, as a U.S. government contractor, we are subject to an increased risk of investigations, criminal prosecution, civil fraud, whistleblower lawsuits and other legal actions and liabilities, the results of which could have a material adverse effect on our operations. 
   We submit change orders to our clients for work we perform beyond the scope of some of our contracts. If our clients do not approve these change orders, our net earnings could be adversely impacted. 
         We typically submit change orders under some of our contracts for payment for work performed beyond the initial contractual requirements. The clients may not approve or may contest these change orders and we cannot assure you that these claims will be approved in whole, in part or at all. If these claims are not approved, our net earnings could be adversely impacted. 
   Because our backlog of uncompleted projects under contract or awarded is subject to unexpected adjustments and cancellations, including the amount, if any, of future appropriations by the applicable contracting governmental agency, it may not be indicative of our future revenue and profits. 
         At December 31, 2016, our backlog of uncompleted projects under contract or awarded was approximately $831 million. The inability to obtain financing or governmental approvals, changes in economic or market conditions or other unforeseen events, such as terrorist acts or natural disasters, could lead to us not realizing any revenue under some or all of these contracts. We cannot assure you that the backlog attributed to any of our uncompleted projects under contract will be realized as revenue or, if realized, will result in profits. 
         Many projects may remain in our backlog for an extended period of time because of the size or long-term nature of the contract. In addition, from time to time projects are scaled back or cancelled. These types of backlog reductions adversely affect the revenue and profit that we ultimately receive. Included in our backlog is the maximum amount of all indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity ("ID/IQ"), or task order, contracts, or a lesser amount if we do not reasonably expect to be issued task orders for the maximum amount of such contracts. A significant amount of our backlog is derived from ID/IQ contracts and we cannot provide any assurance that we will in fact be awarded the maximum amount of such contracts. 
   Our dependence on subcontractors, partners and specialists could adversely affect our business. 
         We rely on third-party subcontractors as well as third-party strategic partners and specialists to complete our projects. To the extent that we cannot engage such subcontractors, partners or specialists or cannot engage them on a competitive basis, our ability to complete a project in a timely fashion or at a profit may be impaired. If we are unable to engage appropriate strategic partners or specialists in some instances, we could lose the ability to win some contracts. In addition, if a subcontractor or specialist is unable to deliver its services according to the negotiated terms for any reason, including the deterioration of its financial condition or over-commitment of its resources, we may be required to purchase the services from another source at a higher price. This may reduce the profit to be realized or result in a loss on a project for which the services were needed. 
   If our partners fail to perform their contractual obligations on a project, we could be exposed to legal liability, loss of reputation or reduced profits. 
         We sometimes enter into joint venture agreements and other contractual arrangements with outside partners to jointly bid on and execute a particular project. The success of these joint projects 
 17

   depends on the satisfactory performance of the contractual obligations of our partners. If any of our partners fails to satisfactorily perform its contractual obligations, we may be required to make additional investments and provide additional services to complete the project. If we are unable to adequately address our partner's performance issues, then our client could terminate the joint project, exposing us to legal liability, loss of reputation or reduced profits. 
   The project management business is highly competitive and if we fail to compete effectively, we may miss new business opportunities or lose existing clients and our revenues may decline. 
         The project management industry is highly competitive. We compete for contracts, primarily on the basis of technical capability, with numerous entities, including design or engineering firms, general contractors, other "pure" construction management companies, management consulting firms and other entities. Compared to us, many of these competitors are larger, well-established companies that have broader geographic scope and greater financial and other resources. If we cannot compete effectively with our competitors, or if the costs of competing, including the costs of retaining and hiring professionals, become too expensive, our revenue growth and financial results may differ materially from our expectations. 
   We have acquired and may continue to acquire businesses as strategic opportunities arise and may be unable to realize the anticipated benefits of those acquisitions, or if we are unable to take advantage of strategic acquisition situations, our ability to expand our business may be slowed or curtailed. 
         Over the past 18 years, we have acquired 14 companies related to the Project Management business and our strategy is to continue to expand and diversify our operations with additional acquisitions as strategic opportunities arise. If the competition for acquisitions increases, or if the cost of acquiring businesses or assets becomes too expensive, the number of suitable acquisition opportunities may decline, the cost of making an acquisition may increase or we may be forced to agree to less advantageous acquisition terms for the companies that we are able to acquire. Alternatively, at the time an acquisition opportunity presents itself, internal and external pressures (including, but not limited to, borrowing capacity under our credit facilities or the availability of alternative financing), may cause us to be unable to pursue or complete an acquisition. Our ability to grow our business, particularly through acquisitions, may depend on our ability to raise capital by selling equity or debt securities or obtaining additional debt financing. There can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain financing when we need it or on terms acceptable to us. 
         In addition, managing the growth of our operations will require us to continually increase and improve our operational, financial and human resources management and our internal systems and controls. If we are unable to manage growth effectively or to successfully integrate acquisitions or if we are unable to grow organically, that could have a material adverse effect on our business. 
   Systems and information technology interruption and breaches in data security could adversely impact our ability to operate and our operating results. 
         As a global company, we are heavily reliant on computer, information and communications technology and related systems in order to properly operate. From time to time, we experience system interruptions and delays. In the event we are unable to regularly deploy software and hardware, effectively upgrade our systems and network infrastructure, and take other steps to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of our systems, the operation of such systems could be interrupted or delayed, or our data security could be breached. In addition, our computer and communications systems and operations could be damaged or interrupted by natural disasters, power loss, telecommunications failures, acts of war or terrorism, acts of God, computer viruses, physical or electronic security breaches. Any of these or other events could cause system interruptions, delays, and loss of critical data including private data. While we have taken steps to address these concerns by 
 18

   implementing sophisticated network security, training and internal control measures, there can be no assurance that a system failure or loss or data security breach will not materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results. 
   Risks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock 
   We have identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting and determined that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective which could, if not remediated, result in additional material misstatements in our financial statements. 
         Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over our financial reporting, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 13a-15(f), respectively, under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. As disclosed in Item 9A of this Form 10-K, management identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting and determined our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective based upon our identification of certain errors related to the estimation of potential losses on our accounts receivable and ineffective procedures related to the accounting close process, accounting estimates, and non-routine transactions in addition to a newly identified material weakness related to certain tax controls. A material weakness is defined as a deficiency, or combination of significant deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a more than a remote likelihood that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. As a result of these material weaknesses, our management concluded that the Company did not maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016. 
         We have developed and implemented a remediation plan designed to address these material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting and ineffective disclosure controls and procedures. If our remedial measures are insufficient, or if additional material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in our internal controls are discovered or occur in the future, our consolidated financial statements may contain material misstatements and we could be required to restate our financial results, which could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations or financial condition, restrict our ability to access the capital markets, require us to expend significant resources to correct the weaknesses or deficiencies, subject us to fines, penalties or judgments, harm our reputation or otherwise cause a decline in investor confidence. 
   Future sales of our common and preferred stock may depress the price of our common stock. 
         As of March 17, 2017, there were 51,859,479 shares of our common stock outstanding. An additional 6,627,473 shares of our common stock may be issued upon the exercise of options held by employees, management and directors. We also have the authority to issue up to 1,000,000 shares of preferred stock upon terms that are determined by our Board of Directors and additional options to purchase 2,077,459 shares of our common stock without stockholder approval. In addition, we have a registration statement on file with the SEC for an aggregate issuance of 20,000,000 common shares (of which 10,453,371 shares remain available for issuance), which may be used for working capital and general corporate purposes, subject to the restrictions of our Secured Credit Facilities and another registration statement on file with the SEC for an aggregate issuance of 20,000,000 common shares, (of which 18,926,804 shares remain available for issuance), which may be used in future acquisitions. Sales of a substantial number of these shares in the public market, or factors relating to the terms we may determine for our preferred stock, options or warrants, could decrease the market price of our common stock. In addition, the perception that such sales might occur may cause the market price of our common stock to decline. Future issuances or sales of our common stock could have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock. 
 19



  Because we have no current plans to pay cash dividends on our common stock, you may not receive any return on investment unless you sell your common stock for a price greater than that which you paid for it. 
         We may retain future earnings, if any, for future operations, expansion and debt repayment and have no current plans to pay any cash dividends. Any decision to declare and pay dividends in the future will be made at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend on, among other things, our results of operations, financial condition, cash requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors that our Board of Directors may deem relevant. In addition, our ability to pay dividends is limited by covenants of our Secured Credit Facilities and may be limited by future indebtedness incurred by us or our subsidiaries. As a result, you may not receive any return on an investment in our common stock unless you sell our common stock for a price greater than that which you paid for it. 
   We are able to issue shares of preferred stock with greater rights than our common stock. 
         Our Board of Directors is authorized to issue one or more series of preferred stock from time to time without any action on the part of our stockholders. Our Board of Directors also has the power, without stockholder approval, to set the terms of any such series of preferred stock that may be issued, including voting rights, dividend rights and preferences over our common stock with respect to dividends and other terms. If we issue preferred stock in the future that has a preference over our common stock with respect to the payment of dividends or other terms, or if we issue preferred stock with voting rights that dilute the voting power of our common stock, the rights of holders of our common stock or the market price of our common stock could be adversely affected. 
   Provisions in our organizational documents and Delaware law could discourage potential acquisition proposals, could delay or prevent a change in control of the Company that our stockholders may consider favorable and could adversely affect the market value of our common stock. 
         Provisions in our organizational documents and Delaware law could discourage potential acquisition proposals, could delay or prevent a change in control of the Company that our stockholders may consider favorable and could adversely affect the market value of our common stock. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws include provisions that:
 

 Our Board of Directors is expressly authorized to make, alter or repeal our bylaws; 
 Our Board of Directors is divided into three classes of service with staggered three-year terms. This means that only one class of directors
will be elected at each annual meeting of stockholders, with the other classes continuing for the remainder of their respective terms; 
 Our Board of Directors is authorized to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval; 
 Only our Board of Directors, our Chairman of the Board, our Chief Executive Officer or the holders of not less than 25% of our outstanding
common stock and entitled to vote may call a special meeting of stockholders; 
 Our bylaws require advance notice for stockholder proposals and director nominations; 
 Our bylaws limit the removal of directors and the filling of director vacancies; and 
 We will indemnify officers and directors against losses that may incur in connection with investigations and legal proceedings resulting from
their services to us, which may include services in connection with takeover defense measures. 

         These provisions may make it more difficult for stockholders to take specific corporate actions and could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of the Company. 
 20

           In addition, Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law imposes certain restrictions on mergers and other business combinations between the Company and any holder of 15% or more of our outstanding common stock. This provision is applicable to Hill and may have an anti-takeover effect that may delay, defer or prevent a tender offer or takeover attempt that a stockholder might consider in the stockholder's best interest. In general, Section 203 could delay for three years and impose conditions upon "business combinations" between an "interested shareholder" and Hill, unless prior approval by our Board of Directors is given. The term "business combination" is defined broadly to include mergers, asset sales and other transactions resulting in financial benefit to a stockholder. An "interested shareholder," in general, would be a person who, together with affiliates and associates, owns or within three years did own, 15% or more of a corporation's voting stock. 
   A small group of stockholders own a large quantity of our common stock, thereby potentially exerting significant influence over the Company. 
         As of December 31, 2016, Irvin E. Richter, David L. Richter and other members of the Richter family beneficially owned approximately 20.5% of our common stock. This concentration of ownership could significantly influence matters requiring stockholder approval and could delay, deter or prevent a change in control of the Company or other business combinations that might otherwise be beneficial to our other stockholders. Accordingly, this concentration of ownership may impact the market price of our common stock. In addition, the interest of our significant stockholders may not always coincide with the interest of the Company's other stockholders. In deciding how to vote on such matters, they may be influenced by interests that conflict with our other stockholders.
