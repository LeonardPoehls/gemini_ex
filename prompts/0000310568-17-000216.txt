Sales
Net sales were $1.81 billion, $1.65 billion and $1.25 billion in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Net sales by originating geographic area and end market are disclosed in Note 13 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, which information is incorporated herein by reference. A discussion of the risks attendant to our international operations are included in Item 1A, Risk Factors, under the heading, "International operations and sales expose us to material risks and may increase the volatility of our operating results," which information is incorporated herein by reference. A discussion of results of operations may be found in "Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" in Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
ACQUISITIONS AND DIVESTITURES
We have implemented a growth strategy through continuous innovation complemented by strategic acquisitions to strengthen our product and technology portfolio with the intent of broadening our customer base and increasing our technology footprint in customers' end designs in markets where performance matters, security is non-negotiable and reliability is vital. This allows us to offer an increased value proposition, gather a larger portion of the bill of materials, and engage with customers as a strategic "total solution" partner as opposed to a single socket provider. We believe this strategy strengthens our position in the industry as it protects and grows our share within those markets with the highest barriers to entry, and increases our served available market.
We have in the past acquired a number of businesses or companies, additional product lines and assets. We currently expect to continue to expand and diversify our operations with additional acquisitions that allow Microsemi to strengthen its position in high-value, high barrier-to-entry markets, while delivering increased value to shareholders and customers.
Microsemi’s acquisition strategy focuses on combining our technical talent, product portfolios and roadmaps with those companies that allow us to leverage customer synergies, expand design capabilities and increase market share with key customers in the Aerospace & Defense, Communications, Data Center and Industrial markets. Our customer base benefits from access to a broader portfolio of cutting-edge solutions from a single source, while adding greater scale and efficiencies to our business model. Acquisitions are an important component of Microsemi’s growth strategy and the Company will continue to evaluate acquisitions that support its objectives.
MANUFACTURING AND SUPPLIERS
We rely on third party subcontractors, primarily in Asia, for wafer fabrication, assembly, testing and packaging of an increasing portion of our products. Over the last three years, at least 90% of our wafer, assembly and test requirements were sourced from third party foundries and subcontractors. We expect this percentage may increase due, in part, to the manufacturing of our next-generation products by third party subcontractors in Asia and from activity at recently acquired operations. By subcontracting manufacturing, we focus resources on design and test applications where we believe we have greater competitive advantages. This strategy also avoids high capital costs associated with owning and operating semiconductor wafer fabrication facilities. See "Risk Factors" under Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of the risks associated with our dependence on independent foundry subcontractors.
Many of our manufacturing and processing operations are controlled in accordance with aerospace, defense and other rigid commercial and industrial specifications. At our facilities with wafer processing capabilities, we manufacture and process products, starting from purchased silicon wafers. At our locations without wafer processing capabilities, processed wafers are sourced from third parties or our other facilities. We purchase silicon wafers, other semiconductor materials and packaging piece parts from domestic and international suppliers generally on long-term purchase commitments, that are cancelable on 30 to 90-days’ notice. In the ordinary course of business, we enter into cancelable purchase agreements with some of our major suppliers to supply products over periods of up to 18 months. We also purchase a portion of our finished wafers from several foundry sources. See "Risk Factors" under Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of the risks associated with our dependence on independent suppliers.

Processed silicon wafers are separated into individual dice that are then assembled in packages and tested in accordance with our test procedures. A major portion of our semiconductor manufacturing effort takes place after the semiconductor is assembled. Parts are tested a number of times, visually screened and environmentally subjected to shock, vibration, burn-in and electrical tests in order to prove and assure reliability. As noted above, certain subcontract suppliers provide packaging and testing for our products necessary to deliver finished products. We pay those suppliers for assembled or fully-tested products meeting predetermined specifications.
RAW MATERIALS
Our manufacturing processes use certain key raw materials critical to our products. These include silicon wafers, certain chemicals and gases, ceramic and plastic packaging materials and various precious metals. We also rely on subcontractors to supply finished or semi-finished products that are marketed through our various sales channels. We obtain raw materials and semi-finished or finished products from various sources, although the number of sources for any particular material or product may be limited. We feel our current supply of essential materials is adequate; however, shortages have occurred from time to time and could occur again.
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
We believe continuing timely development and introduction of new products is essential to maintaining our competitive position. We currently conduct most of our product development effort in-house. We also employ outside consultants to assist with product design. We expense the cost of research and development as incurred. Research and development expenses are principally comprised of payroll and related costs, masks and supplies, software tools, and consulting costs. 
We spent $341.6 million, $309.1 million and $200.3 million in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively, for research and development. The principal focus of our research and development activities has been to improve processes and to develop new products that support the growth of our businesses. While incremental costs from recent acquisitions contributed to increased research and development expenses, the increases were partially offset by selectively investing in strategic product roadmaps. The spending on research and development was principally to develop new higher-margin application-specific products, including, among others, our processor and core architecture development for next generation programmable products, storage and optical products, Ethernet switches, medical communications and signal processing devices, the continued roadmap development of our industry-leading timing and synchronization products, and the ongoing development of gallium nitride (GaN) and silicon carbide (SiC) power solutions.
PATENTS, LICENSES, AND OTHER INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS
We have registered several of our trademarks with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office and in foreign jurisdictions. We rely to some extent upon confidential trade secrets and patents to develop and maintain our competitive position. It is our policy to seek patent protection for significant inventions that may be patented, though we may elect, in appropriate cases, not to seek patent protection even for significant inventions if other protection, such as maintaining the invention as a trade secret, is considered more advantageous or cost-effective. We believe patent and mask work protection could grow in significance but presently is of less significance in our business than experience, innovation, and management skill. No individual patent contributed significantly to our 2017, 2016 or 2015 net sales. 
Due to the many technological developments and the technical complexity of the semiconductor industry, it is possible certain of our designs or processes may involve infringement of patents or other intellectual property rights held by others. From time to time, we have received, and in the future may receive, notice of claims of infringement by our products on intellectual property rights of third parties. If any such infringements were alleged to exist, we might be obligated to seek a license from the holder of the rights and might have liability for past infringement. In the past, it has been common semiconductor industry practice for patent holders to offer licenses on reasonable terms and rates. Although in some situations, typically where the patent directly relates to a specific product or family of products, patent holders have refused to grant licenses. The practice of offering licenses appears to be generally continuing. However, no assurance can be given that we will be able to obtain licenses as needed in all cases or that the terms of any license that may be offered will be acceptable to us. In those circumstances where an acceptable license is not available, we would need either to change the process or product so that it no longer infringes or stop manufacturing the product or products involved in the infringement, which might be costly and could adversely affect our revenues and operating results.

SALES TO THE U.S. GOVERNMENT
Approximately 26% of total net sales in 2017 were in the Aerospace & Defense end market and while we service defense markets outside of the United States, a portion of sales in this end market correlate to direct sales to U.S. government agencies, customers whose principal sales are to U.S. government agencies or to subcontractors whose material sales are to U.S. government agencies. Future sales are subject to the uncertainties of governmental appropriations and national defense policies and priorities, including sequestration impacts similar to those we experienced under the Budget Control Act of 2011, constraints of the budgetary process and timing and potential changes in these policies and priorities. Additionally, the long-term outlook for the fiscal position of the U.S. federal government is also uncertain, as illustrated by the 2013 budget negotiations and the shutdown of non-essential U.S. federal government services in October 2013. 
We have experienced delays and reduction in appropriations on programs that include our products. Further delays, reductions in, or terminations of, government contracts or subcontracts, including those caused by any past or future shutdown of the U.S. federal government, could materially and adversely affect our operating results. While we generally function as a subcontractor, further changes in U.S. government procurement regulations and practices, particularly surrounding initiatives to reduce costs, may adversely impact the contracting environment and our operating results.
Generally, the U.S. government and its contractors and subcontractors may terminate their contracts with us at any time, with or without cause. We have in the past experienced the termination of a contract due to the termination of the underlying government contract. All government contracts are also subject to price renegotiation in accordance with the U.S. Government Renegotiation Act. By reference to such contracts, all of the purchase orders we receive that are related to government contracts are subject to these possible events. In addition, the recent shutdown of non-essential U.S. government services and any future government shutdowns may significantly increase the risk of further contract terminations or renegotiations, and any such termination or renegotiation could have a material adverse impact upon our revenues and results of operations.
In addition, we are required to maintain compliance with government regulations, particularly for our facilities and products that service the defense and security markets. Maintaining compliance with these regulations, including audit requirements of the U.S. government and our customers that are subject to these requirements, requires that we devote resources to matters that include training, personnel, information technology and facilities. Failure to maintain compliance may result in the loss of certifications, fines and penalties that may materially and adversely affect our operating results.
From time to time, we have experienced declining defense-related sales, primarily as a result of contract award delays and reduced security and defense program funding. We may be unable to adequately forecast or respond to the timing of and changes to demand for defense-related products. In the past, defense-related spending on programs we participate in has increased at a rate that has been slower than expected, been delayed or declined. Our prospects for additional defense related sales may be adversely affected in a material manner by numerous events or actions outside our control.
COMPETITIVE CONDITIONS
The semiconductor industry, including the areas in which we do business, is highly competitive. We expect intensified competition from existing competitors and new entrants. Competition is based on price, product performance, product availability, quality, reliability and customer service. In addition, companies not currently in direct competition with us may introduce competing products in the future. Some of our current competitors are Altera Corporation; Analog Devices, Inc.; Broadcom Limited; Integrated Device Technology, Inc.; M/A COM Technology Solutions Inc.; Maxim Integrated Products, Inc.; Semtech Corp.; Silicon Laboratories, Inc.; Skyworks Solutions, Inc.; Texas Instruments, Inc.; and Xilinx, Inc. Several of these companies are larger than we are and have greater financial and other resources than we have and may therefore be better able than we are to penetrate new markets, pursue acquisition candidates, and withstand adverse economic or market conditions. In addition, the semiconductor industry has experienced, and may continue to experience, significant consolidation, which may permit some of our competitors to benefit from economies of scale, provide more comprehensive product portfolios or increase the size of their serviceable markets. Consolidation among our competitors may erode our market share and adversely impact our capacity to compete. We expect 

Microsemi Corporation | 9

intensified competition from existing and consolidated competitors as well as new entrants into our markets. To the extent we are not able to compete successfully in the future, our financial condition, operating results or cash flows could be harmed.
We have implemented a growth strategy through continuous innovation complemented by strategic acquisitions with the intent of increasing our technology footprint in customers’ end designs in high-value, high barrier-to-entry markets. This allows us to offer an increased value proposition, gather a larger portion of the bill of materials, and engage with customers as a strategic partner as opposed to a socket provider. We believe this strategy strengthens our position in the industry as it protects and grows our share within those markets with the highest barriers to entry.
SEASONALITY
Generally, we are affected by the seasonal trends of the semiconductor and related industries. The impacts of seasonality are to some extent dependent on product and market mix of products shipped. These impacts can change from time to time and are not predictable. Factors that increase seasonality include, for example, holiday work schedules during our first fiscal quarter that tend to limit production and customer demand.
ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATIONS
Federal, state and local laws and regulations impose various restrictions and controls on the discharge of materials, chemicals and gases used in semiconductor manufacturing processes. In addition, under some laws and regulations, we could be held financially responsible for remedial measures if our properties are contaminated or if we send waste to a landfill or recycling facility that becomes contaminated, even if we did not cause the contamination. Also, we may be subject to common law claims if we release substances that damage or harm third parties. Further, future changes in environmental laws or regulations may require additional investments in capital equipment or the implementation of additional compliance programs in the future. Any failure to comply with environmental laws or regulations could subject us to serious liabilities and could have material adverse effects on our operating results and financial condition. 
In the conduct of our manufacturing operations, we have handled and do handle materials that are considered hazardous, toxic or volatile under federal, state or local laws. The risk of accidental release of such materials cannot be completely eliminated. In addition, we operate or own facilities located on or near real property that was formerly owned and operated by others. These properties were used in ways that involved hazardous materials. Contaminants may migrate from or within or through property. These risks may give rise to claims. We may be financially responsible for third parties, who are responsible for contamination, if they do not have funds, or if they do not make funds available when needed, to pay remediation costs imposed under environmental laws and regulations.
To date, our compliance with federal, state and local laws or regulations that have been enacted to regulate the environment has not had a material adverse effect on our capital expenditures, earnings, or competitive or financial position.
EMPLOYEES
At the end of 2017, we employed approximately 2,100 persons domestically and 2,400 persons at our international facilities. None of our employees are represented by a labor union; however, some employees in Europe are represented by an employee works council pursuant to local regulations. We have experienced no work stoppages and believe our employee relations are good.
