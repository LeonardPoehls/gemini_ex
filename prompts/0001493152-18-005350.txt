Unless the context indicates or suggests otherwise, references to “we,” “our,” “us,” the “Company,” or “Green Spirit” refer to Green Spirit Industries Inc., a Nevada corporation, individually, or as the context requires, collectively with its consolidated subsidiaries.
 
Organizational History
 
Green Spirit Industries Inc., formerly known as Cyberspace Vita, Inc. (“we”, “us”, “our”, the “Company” or “Cyberspace”), was organized on November 7, 2006 in Nevada. Our initial business plan was related to the online sale of vitamins and supplements. Effective May 5, 2008, we discontinued these operations. Prior to the Exchange Agreement described above, we did not have any significant assets or operations.
 
Project 1493, LLC, is a limited liability company organized under the laws of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico. 1493 was organized on March 24, 2011 under the name “Grey Finland Advisors, LLS.” 1493 filed a Certificate of Restoration on March 17, 2017 and elected to change its name to “Project 1493, LLC.” 1493’s business plan relates to the acquisition, development and operation of medical cannabis dispensaries. 1493 intends to initially operate in Puerto Rico and may potentially expand into other markets located within the U.S. and U.S. territories in the future.

Overview of Business
 
We are a vertically integrated retail, production and cultivation company, with an emphasis on providing the highest quality and unique medical and adult use cannabis products.
 
We have a presence in Puerto Rico and California. In Puerto Rico, all of our medicinal cannabis dispensaries operate under the name “Green Spirit RX” and our dispensary in California operates as “The Green Room” in Mendocino County. We are currently in the process of securing leases to commence operations of our new ventures in San Francisco and Oakland. Once we begin those operations, we plan to offer a broad selection of medical and adult use products including flowers, concentrates and edibles.

We are currently in various stages of construction of our dispensaries in Puerto Rico. We anticipate that construction at five of our medicinal cannabis dispensaries in Puerto Rico will be complete by the second quarter of 2018, with the remaining dispensaries to be completed by the end of 2018. We currently hold pre-qualifications for a dispensary license for these locations, and they will not be fully licensed until construction is completed, and the Department of Health of Puerto Rico (“DHPR”) issues the requisite operating permit for each of the dispensaries. In California, we are currently negotiating lease terms for our Spirulinex and Sunset ventures.
 
Puerto Rico Operations
 
We are in the business of acquiring, developing and operating retail dispensaries, growing facilities, extraction and manufacturing related to the cannabis industry in Puerto Rico and California. As of the date of this Form 10-K, we have acquired all of the legal rights, permits, pre-qualified licenses, leasing contracts and assets pertaining to six medical cannabis dispensaries in Puerto Rico. The dispensaries are located in the following cities: (1) Fajardo; (2) Carolina; (3) Dorado; (4) San Juan; (5) Hato Rey; (6) Bayamon; and (7) Isla Verde.
 
During the first quarter of 2018, we completed construction at our Dorado location and were issued the requisite operating license by the DHPR. On March 28, 2018, we opened our first medicinal cannabis dispensary in Puerto Rico under the name “Green Spirit RX.” We expect construction to be completed at five of our locations during the second quarter of 2018 and that construction at the last location will be completed during the fourth quarter of 2018. These six medical cannabis dispensaries will not be fully licensed until construction is completed, and the DHPR issues the requisite operating permit for each of the dispensaries.
 
California Operations
 
The Green Room
 
On March 7, 2018, Mendocino entered into an asset purchase agreement (the “Asset Purchase Agreement”) with a third-party seller, pursuant to which Mendocino acquired all of the assets relating to a retail cannabis business in Point Arena, Mendocino County, California for total cash consideration of $350,000.
 
On March 26, 2018, Mendocino was granted the local permit to operate by the City of Point Arena. On April 2, 2018, Mendocino received its State of California permit to operate its adult use and recreational cannabis dispensary.
 
As of January 1, 2018, the retail dispensary was available for adult use sales in addition to medical cannabis. Featuring more than 15 strains grown locally and products only found in this location, many customers have made The Green Room a destination place. Coupled with our current plans in establishing new cultivation and manufacturing operations through our other subsidiaries, we intend to increase product offerings by producing unique product lines and branded items solely for purchase at The Green Room. We believe that this will result in return-customers.
 
We also assumed the prior owner’s delivery license, which allows delivery of The Green Room product through telephone or on-line orders to any county in California that allows such product delivery. The delivery car is allowed to carry $3,000 of product at retail price, but may make as many daily deliveries as necessary. Once the product is delivered, the driver must reload to continue deliveries. The car contains GPS and a built in safe for security, and the sales proceeds are returned to the store’s safe after each delivery to avoid having cash in the car.
 
Spirulinex
 
On March 3, 2018, we entered into an operating agreement with Solunas Aqua Corp., a California corporation (“Solunas”), relating to the formation of Spirulinex, LLC, a California limited liability company. Spirulinex was formed as a joint venture between Green Spirit and Solunas (the “Joint Venture”) for the purpose of carrying out the manufacturing cannabis and cannabinoid products for distribution in the State of California.

Sunset 
 
On March 26, 2018, we entered into an operating agreement with Sunset Connect SF, Inc. (formerly Happy VA Corp.), a California corporation (“Happy”), relating to the formation of Sunset Connect Oakland, LLC, a California limited liability company (“Sunset”). Sunset was formed as a joint venture between Green Spirit and Happy for the purpose of carrying out the growing of cannabis for distribution in the State of California.
 
As of the date of this report, Sunset is in lease negotiations for a 23,500 square foot facility in Oakland, California. We believe that such facility would provide ample space to grow quality product for sale to distributors and retailers in California, including our dispensary in Point Arena. However, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in entering into this lease agreement.
 
GS Essentials
 
On March 26, 2018, we entered into an operating agreement with Sunset Connect SF, Inc. (formerly Happy VA Corp.), a California corporation (“Happy”), relating to the formation of Sunset Connect Oakland, LLC, a California limited liability company (“Sunset”). Sunset was formed as a joint venture between Green Spirit and Happy for the purpose of carrying out the extraction of cannabis oils for distribution in the State of California. We plan to have GS Essentials sublease space from Sunset. As noted above, Sunset is currently in lease negotiations for a 23,500 square foot facility in Oakland, California. We expect that approximately 3,000 square feet will be allocated to GS Essentials’ extraction business. However, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in leasing such facility.
 
Through GS Essentials, we plan to run a mix of volatile and non-volatile closed loop extractions as well as an ethanol distillation process to allow us to manufacture a broad spectrum of products, including topical applications, cartridges, oils, wax, shatter, crumble and oral for sale in California.
 
Business Model 
 
We plan to operate as a service business specializing in the sale of medical cannabis, edibles and paraphernalia, including, oils, lotions, THC pills, vaporizers, rigs, grinders, t-shirts, hats, logo items, and bongs and pipes with vaporizer attachments through our strategically located dispensaries; and operating several growing, extraction and manufacturing facilities.
 
In Puerto Rico, we have entered into a long-term supply agreement (the “Supply Agreement”) to purchase our products from one of the largest growers on the island, who operates a state-of-the art facility and currently has over 36 strands available and is able to produce up to 2,000 pounds a week. Pursuant to the terms of the Supply Agreement, the supplier agrees to sell products to us, upon the issuance by the Department of Health of Puerto Rico of the requisite operating permit for each of the dispensaries, at a 20% discount to current wholesale market prices. We anticipate that based on such prices, we will realize gross margins of approximately 75%. However, there can be no assurance that we will realize such margins. The Company has also begun researching available locations to open its own flower growing facility in Puerto Rico in order to develop its new strains not currently found in Puerto Rico. In addition, the Company will continue the vertical chain with its own extraction and manufacturing units.
 
In California, we are currently evaluating four dispensaries to purchase and operate. If purchased, the new dispensaries will use the current grow, extraction and manufacturing subsidiaries to furnish the majority of product while still buying certain strains of flowers, edibles oils and lotions from local suppliers. Mendocino also holds a delivery license, which enables the dispensary to pick up and deliver products in any county in California which allows a delivery service. Similar to “Uber Eats” or “Grub Hub”, a customer may place an order by telephone or the internet, and a driver will deliver the requested product to the customer’s doorstep. The driver may carry a maximum of $3,000 of product (retail value).
 
We also intend to continue evaluating retail, extraction and manufacturing opportunities in multiple states and Puerto Rico. During the past six months, we have performed due diligence on eight facilities, but rejected them due to their business plan or questionable records. Currently, we have one dispensary in the due diligence phase, and we are reviewing seven other dispensaries in California and Puerto Rico to determine whether to continue pursuing those opportunities and commence due diligence.

We intend to sell and keep inventory of the top 5 selling brands, which will be determined by sales velocity. We intend to use a state-of-art CRM to track our customers, their buying habits and monthly spend. Customer Segments will be categorized by age, occupation and medical condition.
 
Over the next 12 months, we plan to continue identifying, purchasing and operating medical cannabis dispensaries in various states. We expect to operate 5 locations in the next 12 months and 10 locations by the end of 2019. It is anticipated that costs associated with purchasing or constructing the dispensary, licensing, stocking inventory and operating these dispensaries will be approximately $2.5 million. Our current fixed overhead, which includes our ongoing leasing obligations, is approximately $140,000 per month. We anticipate that fixed overhead will increase at such time as the dispensaries begin operations. In addition, we expect that our fixed costs will continue to increase so long as we are successful in our plan of expansion. We anticipate supporting our operations through the proceeds from the offerings previously conducted, from anticipated revenue once the dispensaries become fully operational and, if necessary, through the sale of our securities in order to complete the development of our dispensaries. However, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in raising sufficient revenues necessary to support our operations, or that we will be successful in selling our securities.
 
We anticipate earning revenue by selling medical cannabis, edibles, pills, creams, patches and oral drops, and paraphernalia such as vaporizers. The average net profit for medical marijuana dispensaries is 20% in the U.S., according to a study conducted by Marijuana Business Daily and the media annual revenue is $1,200,000. We aim to undercut our competition by acquiring our goods at a lower than average cost which we anticipate will allow us to achieve 30% net margins, 50% higher than the industry average.
 
In addition, we will focus on providing the best and most friendly customer service, and provide the highest quality brands and widest variety possible in order to attract repeat business. We expect to realize, although no assurance can be given, approximately 30% net margins on edibles, with 50% net margins on edibles and paraphernalia.
 
Revenue Streams:
 
We anticipate that revenues will be generated from the following:
 

● | Medical Cannabis, up to 10 strains in each dispensary. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Derivatives (oils, lotions, edibles, THC pills) 
● | Paraphernalia (vaporizers, grinders, rigs, bongs and pipes with vaporizer attachments) 
● | Clothing (hats, t-shirts, logos) 

Cost Structure:
 
We intend to price our product at below market rates, however we intend to market certain items as “boutique” items, such as gourmet style edibles or exotic strains and clothing and paraphernalia.
Marketing
 
Our marketing and sales strategy will be aimed at generating long-term, repeat customers, as well as attracting tourists who visit the dispensaries who wish to purchase cannabis and cannabis products.. In order to generate repeat customers, we intend to provide the highest quality medical cannabis, at the lowest possible cost to insure we build a loyal customer base. Further, we have built aesthetically pleasing dispensaries and have hired and trained all of our employees to provide excellent customer service.
 
At this time Puerto Rico only allows digital advertising for medical cannabis. Thus, we intend to leverage the Internet and social media platforms, including, Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Google+, LinkedIn, the Yellow Pages online, YELP and over 50 cannabis websites we have identified. Our marketing will focus on the wide variety of our cannabis products and their high quality and low cost point relative to our competition. In California, in addition to the above, we will purchase billboards in the vicinity of our dispensaries to gain further awareness of our locations.

We also intend to utilize blogs, micro-ads, testimonial interviews, articles and deploy this media across all social media channels and websites accessed by our customer targets.
 
The Cannabis Industry—Market Opportunity
 
The legal cannabis markets in the United States are expanding rapidly. There are now thirty (30) states and Washington, D.C., with medical cannabis programs and eight of these states (Alaska, California, Colorado, Maine, Massachusetts, Nevada, Oregon and Washington), plus Washington, D.C., have also legalized cannabis for recreational use.
 
We believe the market will continue to rapidly expand as existing states broaden the definition of the approved uses for cannabis (i.e. from medicinal to recreational use) and additional states legalize cannabis for at least some other purposes. Despite the fact that the Federal Controlled Substances Act makes the use and possession of marijuana illegal on a national level, recent guidance from the previous administration under President Obama suggested that it will continue to tolerate legalization at the state level, especially when backed by strong and effective regulation. On December 11, 2014, the DOJ issued another memorandum about its position and enforcement protocol with regard to Indian Country, stating that the Eight Priorities in the Cole Memo would guide the United States Attorneys’ cannabis enforcement efforts in Indian Country. On December 16, 2014, as a component of the federal spending bill, the Obama administration enacted regulations that prohibit the DOJ from using funds to prosecute state-based legal medical cannabis programs. We believe it is significant that in 2016, the Congressional Spending Bill specifically prevented the Justice Department from spending money to enforce the federal ban on growing or selling cannabis in states where cannabis has been approved.
 
More recently under the Trump administration, on January 4, 2018, the DOJ suspended the Cole Memo and replaced it with a new Memorandum titled with the subject “Marijuana Enforcement” from Attorney General Jeff Sessions which provides that each U.S. Attorney has the discretion to determine which types of cannabis-related cases should be federally prosecuted, thus ending the broad safe harbor provided under the Cole Memo.
 
As of January 26, 2018, 30 states, the District of Columbia and Guam allow their citizens to use medical cannabis through de-criminalization. Voters in the States of Alaska, California, Colorado, Maine, Massachusetts, Nevada, Oregon, Washington and the District of Columbia have legalized cannabis for adult recreational use.
 
We continue to follow and monitor the actions and statements of the Trump administration, the DOJ and Congress’ positions on federal law and cannabis policy. As the possession and use of cannabis is illegal under the CSA, we could be deemed to be aiding and abetting illegal activities through the equipment we intend to sell in the U.S. and directly violating federal law if we should begin producing Cannabis under State law. Under federal law, and more specifically the CSA, the possession, use, cultivation, and transfer of cannabis is illegal. Our equipment could be used by persons or entities engaged in the business of possession, use, cultivation, and/or transfer of cannabis.
 
As a result, law enforcement authorities, in their attempt to regulate the illegal use of cannabis, could seek to bring an action or actions against us, including, but not limited to, a claim of aiding and abetting another’s criminal activities or directly violating the CSA. The federal aiding and abetting statute provides that anyone who “commits an offense against the United States or aids, abets, counsels, commands, induces or procures its commission, is punishable as a principal” (18 U.S.C. §2(a).) Enforcement of federal law regarding cannabis would likely result in the Company being unable to proceed with our business plans, could expose us to potential criminal liability and could subject our properties to civil forfeiture. Any changes in banking, insurance or other business services may also affect our ability to operate our business.

Target Markets
 
We believe that not since the repeal of Prohibition in 1933, has a consumer product business opportunity of this magnitude been created simply by changes in the law. According to an IBISWorld report, the cannabis industry is expected to achieve rapid growth over the next five years. We believe the industry will continue to benefit from increasingly favorable attitudes towards medical cannabis-based treatments and applications as acceptance and legitimacy of cannabis continues to grow.
 
Our target markets are those where states or U.S. territories have legalized the production and use of cannabis, such as Puerto Rico, New Jersey, Tennessee, Georgia, Texas and Iowa.
 
Most recently, voters in California, Nevada, Maine and Massachusetts approved ballot measures to legalize cannabis for adult recreational use, bringing the total number of states with legalized recreational cannabis use to eight, in addition to the District of Columbia.
 
As of the date of this filing, 30 U.S. states, the District of Columbia and the territories of Guam and Puerto Rico have legalized the use of cannabis for medical use in some form, including five states in 2016 alone. While it is difficult to estimate the amount of time it would take for a state to establish regulations relating to the sale of cannabis, or for those businesses engaged in this activity to begin generating revenue from operations, we anticipate, but no assurance can be given, that for new states legalizing the medical use of cannabis, revenues will begin to be realized in 2018 and 2019.
 
Continued development of the regulated cannabis industry depends on continued legislative authorization at the state level. Progress, while encouraging, is not assured and any number of factors could slow or halt progress in the cannabis industry.
 
Puerto Rico – Market Opportunity
 
Puerto Rico benefits from a large and growing tourism industry. According to an article published by Travel Pulse in March 2016 and by PRT Newswire dated December 2016, Puerto Rico’s tourism doubled from 5 million visitors in 2015 to 10 million in 2016. Importantly, patients who hold a license to buy medical marijuana in the 30 states where it is now legal may use their patient license to purchase marijuana at Puerto Rico’s dispensaries.
 
The Academic Sciences of Puerto Rico (ASPR), in collaboration with the Cannabis Doctors of Puerto Rico, conducted a certification program for doctors to obtain the Health Department (HD) license and recommended medicinal cannabis to nearly 200,000 patients. Based on such, and considering that Puerto Rico is an island with a population of 3.5 million, there is a potential market of 200,000 patients, or 6% of Puerto Rico’s current population. In addition, there is a potentially very large market opportunity presented by the burgeoning tourist industry. If only 2% of the tourist visiting Puerto Rico purchase medical marijuana, that would add another 200,000 patients on an annual basis or an average of approximately 18,000 patients per month.
 
We believe our initial locations present significant revenue potential and growth opportunity. We have strategically picked our initial locations based on the following factors: population density, disposable income, and proximity to commercial and districts tourist destinations.
 
California – Market Opportunity
 
California is the most populous state in the United States with a population of 39.3 million residents. California’s $2.67 trillion economy is larger than any other state. If it were a country, it would be the fifth largest in the world. In 2016, Proposition 64 was passed allowing the use of medicinal cannabis, and effective January 1, 2018, it became legal for adult use. Proposition 64 legalized commercial cultivation and sale of cannabis in California for medical use as of the date of passage. All cannabis activity is exclusively controlled through registration and permitting by local governments, and then the State issues the final operating license.
 
California’s tourism has been growing for seven straight years, having 268 million tourists spending $126.3 billion. The growth has been fueled by a strong economy and is a popular destination spot. Sales of cannabis products are estimated to be $7 billion and create 103,000 new jobs in California.

Medical Cannabis Market
 
The last five years have seen a dramatic shift in public opinion on medical marijuana, which is reflected in the direction of individual states toward legalization. A Quinnipiac Poll published by Politico on June 6, 2016 showed 89% of registered voters in the United States favor the use of medically prescribed cannabis. Thirty states and Washington, D.C., have enacted medical cannabis laws, and there are approximately 1.2 million registered patients within these states. The five states with the largest known current medical marijuana patient populations are: California, Colorado, Michigan, Oregon and Washington.
 
Cannabis is used for medicinal purposes and has proven to be an effective treatment for pain relief, inflammation and a number of other medical disorders. According to an IBISWorld report, new medical research and changing public opinion have boosted industry growth.
 
Doctors may prescribe ‘legalized’ medical cannabis in approved states where patients can receive a “recommendation” from a state-approved, licensed physician for the treatment of certain conditions specified by the state. Medical cannabis is being used to treat severe or chronic pain, inflammation, nausea and vomiting, neurologic symptoms (including muscle spasticity), glaucoma, cancer, multiple sclerosis, post-traumatic stress disorder, anorexia, arthritis, Alzheimer’s, Crohn’s disease, fibromyalgia, ADD, ADHD, Tourette’s syndrome, spinal cord injury and numerous other conditions. Cannabis oil has also been proven effective in treating epileptic seizures in children.
 
Recreational Cannabis Market
 
Eight states have legalized recreational cannabis – Alaska, California, Colorado, Maine, Massachusetts, Nevada, Oregon, Washington, plus Washington, D.C. In November 2012, Colorado voters legalized recreational marijuana use. This history-changing legislation created a window of opportunity for the commercialization and state taxation of a plant group that has, until recently, been virtually untouchable and has set the wheels in motion for other states to follow. In July of 2014, Washington State launched its recreational program, while Oregon and Alaska and the District of Columbia voted to introduce recreational programs commencing in 2015. In November 2016, California, Maine, Massachusetts, and Nevada all passed ballot initiatives for the legalization of recreational cannabis. A Gallup Poll survey from October 2016 showed that 60% of Americans are in favor of legalizing cannabis.

Competition
 
We face significant competition in all aspects of our business. Specifically, we face competition from a number of companies that operate dispensaries in the legal cannabis market within the United States and U.S. territories.
 
While such competition exists within the industry as a whole, there is limited competition in Puerto Rico. Currently, there are seven dispensaries with approved licenses in Puerto Rico, and one of the seven is currently closed for lack of proper permits. There are 170 pre-qualified dispensary licenses, but it is expected that only 70-80 of those pre-qualified for dispensary licenses will meet all the government criteria and will have the necessary funding to operate.
 
We also anticipate additional competition from the unauthorized sale and purchase of cannabis through the “black market” in Puerto Rico, which is estimated by the government at $200 million annually. While we deem the “black market” to be a major competitor, we believe, although no assurance can be given, that we can transition those consumers by offering a greater variety of product at competitive prices.
 
Competitive Strengths
 
The Chief Scientist of Spirulinex, Sarah Rodriguez, is a leading researcher with experience in strain development and metabolic engineering for terpene production, restructuring of carbon metabolic fluxes, cellular metabolic analysis, bio-separation, and fermentation engineering. She holds a PhD from the University of California, Berkeley.
 
Consumers generally choose their dispensary based on several factors, including proximity to where they live and work, price, quality, variety and the overall service experience. We believe that our advantage stems from our relationships with our supplier. Our supplier, who operates a state-of-the art facility, has over 36 strands available and can produce up to 2,000 pounds a week. Our supplier, the largest in Puerto Rico in total production capacity, has agreed to sell products to us at reduced prices which we believe will allow us to achieve 75% gross margins, all while maintaining a major price advantage over competitors.
 
We also believe we possess certain other competitive strengths and advantages in the industries in which we intend to operate:
 
Range of Services. We intend to leverage our breadth of services and resources to deliver comprehensive, integrated solutions to companies in the cannabis industry—from operational, compliance and marketing consulting to products, security and financing services.
 
Strategic Alliances. We are dedicated to growing our business through strategic acquisitions, partnerships and agreements that will enable us to enter and expand into new markets. Our strategy is to pursue alliances with potential targets that have the ability to generate positive cash flow, effectively meet customer needs and supply desirable products, services or technologies, among other considerations. We anticipate that strategic alliances will play a significant role as more states pass legislation permitting the cultivation and sale of hemp and cannabis.
 
Regulatory Compliance. The state laws regulating the cannabis industry are changing at a rapid pace. Currently, there are 30 U.S. states, the District of Columbia and the territories of Guam and Puerto Rico that have created a legislative body to manage the medical cannabis industry. Eight of those states also allow recreational use. We intend to take such steps necessary to ensure that all aspects of our operations are in compliance with all laws, policies, guidance and regulations to which we are subject and providing an opportunity to our customers and allies to use our services in order to ensure that they, too, are in full compliance are both critical components of our business plan.
 
Industry Knowledge. We continue to create, share and leverage information and experiences with the purpose of creating awareness and identifying opportunities to increase stockholder value. Our management team has business expertise, extensive knowledge of the cannabis industry and closely monitors changes in legislation. We intend to work with partners who will enhance the breadth of our industry knowledge.

Lending Capabilities. In February 2014, the Treasury Department issued guidelines for financial institutions dealing with cannabis-related businesses. Nevertheless, many banks and traditional financial institutions refuse to provide financial services to cannabis-related businesses. We plan to provide finance and leasing solutions to market participants using the FinCEN guidelines as a primary guide for compliance with federal law.
 
Government and Industry Regulation
 
Cannabis is currently a Schedule I controlled substance under the CSA and is, therefore, illegal under federal law. Even in those states in which the use of cannabis has been legalized pursuant to state law, its use, possession or cultivation remains a violation of federal law. A Schedule I controlled substance is defined as one that has no currently accepted medical use in the United States, a lack of safety for use under medical supervision and a high potential for abuse. The U.S. Department of Justice (the “DOJ”) defines Schedule I controlled substances as “the most dangerous drugs of all the drug schedules with potentially severe psychological or physical dependence.” If the federal government decides to enforce the CSA in Colorado with respect to cannabis, persons that are charged with distributing, possessing with intent to distribute or growing cannabis could be subject to fines and/or terms of imprisonment, the maximum being life imprisonment and a $50 million fine.
 
Notwithstanding the CSA, as of the date of this filing, 30 U.S. states, the District of Columbia and the U.S. territories of Guam and Puerto Rico allow their residents to use medical cannabis. Voters in the states of Alaska, California, Colorado, Maine, Massachusetts, Nevada, Oregon and Washington have approved ballot measures to legalize cannabis for adult recreational use. Such state and territorial laws are in conflict with the federal CSA, which makes cannabis use and possession illegal at the federal level.
 
In light of such conflict between federal laws and state laws regarding cannabis, the previous administration under President Obama had effectively stated that it was not an efficient use of resources to direct federal law enforcement agencies to prosecute those lawfully abiding by state-designated laws allowing the use and distribution of medical cannabis. For example, the prior DOJ Deputy Attorney General of the Obama administration, James M. Cole, issued a memorandum (the “Cole Memo”) to all United States Attorneys providing updated guidance to federal prosecutors concerning cannabis enforcement under the CSA. The Cole Memo ultimately emphasizes the need for robust state regulation of marijuana. The memorandum “rests on its expectation that state and local governments that have enacted laws authorizing marijuana-related conduct will implement strong and effective regulatory and enforcement systems that will address the threat those state laws could pose to public safety, public health, and other law enforcement interests.” In addition, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (“FinCEN”) provided guidelines (the “FinCEN Guidelines”) on February 14, 2014, regarding how financial institutions can provide services to cannabis-related businesses consistent with their Bank Secrecy Act (“BSA”) obligations.
 
Additional existing and pending legislation provides, or seeks to provide, protection to persons acting in violation of federal law but in compliance with state laws regarding cannabis. The Rohrabacher-Farr Amendment to the Commerce, Justice, Science and Related Agencies Appropriations Bill, which funds the DOJ, prohibits the DOJ from using funds to prevent states with medical cannabis laws from implementing such laws. The Rohrabacher-Farr Amendment is effective through April 28, 2017, but as an amendment to an appropriations bill, it must be renewed annually. As of the date of this Form 10-K, it has not been renewed. The Compassionate Access Compassionate Access, Research Expansion, and Respect States Act (the “CARERS Act”) has been introduced in the U.S. Senate, which proposes to reclassify cannabis under the CSA to Schedule II, thereby changing the plant from a federally criminalized substance to one that has recognized medical uses. More recently, the Respect State Marijuana Laws Act of 2017 has been introduced in the U.S. House of Representatives, which proposes to exclude persons who produce, possess, distribute, dispense, administer or deliver marijuana in compliance with state laws from the regulatory controls and administrative, civil and criminal penalties of the CSA.
 
However, as of the date of this filing, neither the CARERS Act nor the Respect State Marijuana Laws Act of 2017 has been enacted, the Rohrabacher-Farr Amendment has been renewed as part of an omnibus spending bill, in effect through September 30, 2018.

Furthermore, on January 4, 2018, the U.S. Attorney General, Jeff Sessions, issued the Sessions Memo stating that the Cole Memo was rescinded effectively immediately. In particular, Mr. Sessions stated that “prosecutors should follow the well-established principles that govern all federal prosecutions,” which require “federal prosecutors deciding which cases to prosecute to weigh all relevant considerations, including federal law enforcement priorities set by the Attorney General, the seriousness of the crime, the deterrent effect of criminal prosecution, and the cumulative impact of particular crimes on the community.” Mr. Sessions went on to state in the memorandum that given the Justice Department’s well-established general principles, “previous nationwide guidance specific to marijuana is unnecessary and is rescinded, effective immediately.”
 
In response to the Sessions Memo, U.S. Attorney Bob Troy for the District of Colorado, the state in which our principal business operations are presently located, issued a statement on January 4, 2018, stating that the United States Attorney’s Office in Colorado is already guided by the well-established principles referenced in the Sessions Memo, “focusing in particular on identifying and prosecuting those who create the greatest safety threats to our communities around the state. We will, consistent with the Attorney General’s latest guidance, continue to take this approach in all of our work with our law enforcement partners throughout Colorado.”
 
It is unclear at this time whether the Sessions Memo indicates that the Trump administration will strongly enforce the federal laws applicable to cannabis or what types of activities will be targeted for enforcement. However, a significant change in the federal government’s enforcement policy with respect to current federal laws applicable to cannabis could cause significant financial damage to us. While we do not currently harvest, distribute or sell cannabis, we may be irreparably harmed by a change in enforcement policies of the federal government depending on the nature of such change. As of the date of this Form 10-K, we have provided products and services to state-approved cannabis cultivators and dispensary facilities. As a result, we could be deemed to be aiding and abetting illegal activities, a violation of federal law. While we do not currently harvest, distribute or sell cannabis, we may be irreparably harmed by a change in enforcement policies of the federal government. However, once we commence operations, we could be deemed to be aiding and abetting illegal activities, a violation of federal law.
 
The Cole Memo
 
Because of the discrepancy between the laws in some states, which permit the distribution and sale of medical and recreational cannabis, from federal law that prohibits any such activities, DOJ Deputy Attorney General James M. Cole issued the Cole Memo concerning cannabis enforcement under the CSA. The Cole Memo guidance applies to all of the DOJ’s federal enforcement activity, including civil enforcement and criminal investigations and prosecutions, concerning cannabis in all states.
 
The Cole Memo reiterates Congress’s determination that cannabis is a dangerous drug and that the illegal distribution and sale of cannabis is a serious crime that provides a significant source of revenue to large-scale criminal enterprises, gangs, and cartels. The Cole Memo notes that the DOJ is committed to enforcement of the CSA consistent with those determinations. It also notes that the DOJ is committed to using its investigative and prosecutorial resources to address the most significant threats in the most effective, consistent, and rational way. In furtherance of those objectives, the Cole Memo provides guidance to DOJ attorneys and law enforcement to focus their enforcement resources on persons or organizations whose conduct interferes with any one or more of the following important priorities (the “Enforcement Priorities”) in preventing:
 

● | the distribution of cannabis to minors; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | revenue from the sale of cannabis from going to criminal enterprises, gangs and cartels; 
● | the diversion of cannabis from states where it is legal under state law in some form to other states; 
● | state-authorized cannabis activity from being used as a cover or pretext for the trafficking of other illegal drugs or other illegal activity; 
● | violence and the use of firearms in the cultivation and distribution of cannabis; 
● | drugged driving and the exacerbation of other adverse public health consequences associated with cannabis use; 
● | the growing of cannabis on public lands and the attendant public safety and environmental dangers posed by cannabis production on public lands; and 
● | cannabis possession or use on federal property. 

 
Although the Sessions Memo has rescinded the Cole Memo and it is unclear at this time what the ultimate impact of that rescission will have on our business, if any, we intend to continue to conduct rigorous due diligence to verify the legality of all activities that we engage in and ensure that our activities do not interfere with any of the Enforcement Priorities set forth in the Cole Memo.

FinCEN
 
FinCEN provided guidance regarding how financial institutions can provide services to cannabis-related businesses consistent with their BSA obligations. For purposes of the FinCEN guidelines, a “financial institution” includes any person doing business in one or more of the following capacities:
 

● | bank (except bank credit card systems); 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | broker or dealer in securities; 
● | money services business; 
● | telegraph company; 
● | card club; and 
● | a person subject to supervision by any state or federal bank supervisory authority. 

 
In general, the decision to open, close, or refuse any particular account or relationship should be made by each financial institution based on a number of factors specific to that institution. These factors may include its particular business objectives, an evaluation of the risks associated with offering a particular product or service, and its capacity to manage those risks effectively. Thorough customer due diligence is a critical aspect of making this assessment.
 
In assessing the risk of providing services to a cannabis-related business, a financial institution should conduct customer due diligence that includes: (i) verifying with the appropriate state authorities whether the business is duly licensed and registered; (ii) reviewing the license application (and related documentation) submitted by the business for obtaining a state license to operate its cannabis-related business; (iii) requesting from state licensing and enforcement authorities available information about the business and related parties; (iv) developing an understanding of the normal and expected activity for the business, including the types of products to be sold and the type of customers to be served (e.g., medical versus recreational customers); (v) ongoing monitoring of publicly available sources for adverse information about the business and related parties; (vi) ongoing monitoring for suspicious activity, including for any of the red flags described in this guidance; and (vii) refreshing information obtained as part of customer due diligence on a periodic basis and commensurate with the risk. With respect to information regarding state licensure obtained in connection with such customer due diligence, a financial institution may reasonably rely on the accuracy of information provided by state licensing authorities, where states make such information available.
 
As part of its customer due diligence, a financial institution should consider whether a cannabis-related business implicates one of the Cole Memo Enforcement Priorities or violates state law. This is a particularly important factor for a financial institution to consider when assessing the risk of providing financial services to a cannabis-related business. Considering this factor also enables the financial institution to provide information in BSA reports pertinent to law enforcement’s priorities. A financial institution that decides to provide financial services to a cannabis-related business would be required to file suspicious activity reports. It is unclear at this time what impact the Sessions Memo will have on customer due diligence by a financial institution.
 
While we believe we do not qualify as a financial institution in the United States, we cannot be certain that we do not fall under the scope of the FinCEN guidelines. We plan to use the FinCEN Guidelines, as may be amended, as a basis for assessing our relationships with potential tenants, clients and customers. As such, as we engage in financing activities, we intend to adhere to the guidance of FinCEN in conducting and monitoring our financial transactions. Because this area of the law is uncertain and is expected to evolve rapidly, we believe that FinCEN’s guidelines will help us best operate in a prudent, reasonable and acceptable manner. There is no assurance, however, that our activities will not violate some aspect of the CSA. If we are found to violate the federal statute or any other in connection with our activities, our company could face serious criminal and civil sanctions.
 
Moreover, since the use of cannabis is illegal under federal law, we may have difficulty acquiring or maintaining bank accounts and insurance, and our stockholders may find it difficult to deposit their stock with brokerage firms.

Licensing and Local Regulations
 
Where applicable, we will apply for state licenses that are necessary to conduct our business in compliance with local laws. Local laws at the city, county and municipal levels add a layer of complexity to legalized cannabis. Despite a state’s adoption of legislation legalizing cannabis, cities, counties and municipalities within the state may have the ability to otherwise restrict cannabis activities, including but not limited to cultivation, retail or consumption.
 
Zoning sets forth the approved use of land in any given city, county or municipality. Zoning is set by local governments or local voter referendum, and may otherwise be restricted by state laws. For example, under certain state laws a seller of liquor may not be allowed to operate within 1,000 feet of a school. There may be similar restrictions imposed on cannabis operators, which will restrict where cannabis operations may be located and the manner and size to which they can grow and operate. Zoning can be subject to change or withdrawal, and properties can be re-zoned. The zoning of our properties will have a direct impact on our business operations.
 
Regulatory Environment
 
The regulatory status of the cannabis industry is shifting rapidly at the state level, with momentum toward a change at the federal level through pressure on the U.S. Congress and the White House. Current federal regulations classify cannabis as a Schedule 1 substance, defined as “drugs with no currently accepted medical use and a high potential for abuse.” This drug classification also includes heroin, LSD and ecstasy.
 
The legal cannabis industry has evolved considerably over the past 3-5 years. We believe the industry has reached the tipping point for legalization through pressure from citizens’ groups in individual states for the legalization of medical and/or recreational marijuana. As reported by Pew Research Center in April 2015, nearly half (49%) of Americans say they have tried marijuana, and 12% have tried it within the past year.
 
In a national poll in October 2014 by Third Way, a public policy think tank, 78% of respondents favored allowing individuals to use marijuana for medical purposes if “recommended” by a doctor. This trend is further illustrated in recent surveys of public opinion for marijuana legalization rapidly outpacing opposition. A majority of Americans now favor broad legalization of marijuana. Opinions have changed drastically since 1969, when Gallup first asked the question and found that just 12% favored legalizing marijuana use compared to 89% as of June 6, 2016 showed 89%.
 
Millennials (currently 18-34) have been in the forefront of this change: 68% favor legalizing marijuana use, by far the highest percentage of any age group. But across all generations - except for the Silent Generation (ages 70- 87) – support for legalization has risen sharply over the past decade. Third Way also found that 67% of respondents favor Congress passing a bill giving states that have legalized marijuana a safe haven from federal marijuana laws, so long as they have a strong regulatory system, and when given an option of state or federal control, 60% favor states’ control in deciding whether to legalize marijuana.
 
Public support has given rise to the passage of new marijuana laws and regulations in a number of states, as well as multiple legal reforms on legislative dockets. Each state’s legal environment is unique, making it critical for businesses to know and understand the regulatory landscape on a state-by-state basis.
 
Another regulatory variable adding to the complexity of the legal cannabis market are the local laws at the municipality and county levels. Even when a state enacts legislation legalizing cannabis, each level of local government has the right to exercise restrictions on cannabis activities, such as retail, consumption, transportation and cultivation. Zoning is an area of particular concern, which is set forth at the local level. This can restrict where businesses can be located and the manner and size in which they operate. Understanding individual state’s laws and local regulations requires business operators and investors to account for multiple levels of regulatory compliance, such as how marijuana may be sourced, processed, distributed, and to whom, where and how it may be sold.

State Legal Status
 
While new state-level legalization efforts continue to expand the number of states involved in the cannabis industry, only a handful of existing states have any meaningful full-scale operations for the cultivation and distribution of cannabis. This presents a significant growth opportunity for investment over the next several years as the existing legalized states and new states’ markets come online.

● | Medical Cannabis Legalization - 30 states have legalized medical marijuana, plus Washington, D.C. and the U.S. territories of Guam and Puerto Rico 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Recreational Cannabis Legalization - 8 states (AK, CA, CO, ME, MA, NV, OR, WA, plus Washington, D.C.) have passed laws that allow for adult recreational use of marijuana 

Federal Legal Status
 
Cannabis is still classified as an illegal substance in the U.S. The Drug Enforcement Agency (“DEA”) and the Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) currently classify cannabis as a Schedule 1 drug under the Controlled Substances Act. The classification makes cannabis illegal under federal law to cultivate, manufacture, distribute or possess cannabis, and has created a discrepancy between state’s rights and federal law.
 
This discrepancy has created a complicated environment for cannabis businesses in regards to restrictive banking regulations, interstate trade, IRS tax code and federal bankruptcy laws, especially for companies that directly “touch the plant” such as growers and distributors. For example, FinCEN provided guidance regarding how financial institutions can provide services to cannabis-related businesses consistent with their BSA obligations. While we believe we do not qualify as a financial institution in the United States, we cannot be certain that we do not fall under the scope of the FinCEN guidelines. We plan to use the FinCEN Guidelines, as may be amended, as a basis for assessing our relationships with potential tenants, clients and customers. As such, as we engage in financing activities, we intend to adhere to the guidance of FinCEN in conducting and monitoring our financial transactions. Because this area of the law is uncertain but expected to evolve rapidly, we believe that FinCEN’s guidelines will help us best operate in a prudent, reasonable and acceptable manner. There is no assurance, however, that our activities will not violate some aspect of the CSA. If we are found to violate the federal statute or any other in connection with our activities, our company could face serious criminal and civil sanctions.
 
Additionally, because the possession or distribution of cannabis violates federal law, banks that provide services may face the threat of prosecution or sanctions and thus we may have difficulty acquiring or maintaining bank accounts and insurance, and our stockholders may find it difficult to deposit their stock with brokerage firms.
 
The banking issues created by the federal laws have required the cannabis industry to focus on viable alternatives and have created opportunities for new providers, from finance companies to security and software firms. The issue of interstate trade requires companies that grow or distribute cannabis to duplicate efforts within each state they wish to legally operate and has limited the development of ‘national’ brands. These laws do not directly affect companies operating in ancillary businesses.
 
In February 2014, the White House and the Department of the Treasury gave a roadmap for conducting transactions with cannabis companies operating within state regulations. The most sweeping federal reforms to date, however, have come from Congress in the federal spending bill that passed both Houses in June 2015 and continued in June 2016. Congress voted to protect state medical marijuana and hemp laws from federal interference and cut the DEA’s budget. As an example of increased support for the removal of federal laws banning medical marijuana, the medical marijuana-protecting amendment passed the House 219-189 and became law last year and was accepted by a larger 242-186 majority this year, with even more Republican members’ support.
 
The Senate also introduced The Compassionate Access, Research Expansion and Respect States (CARERS) Act in March 2015, co-sponsored by Senator Rand Paul (R-Ky.) and now by 19 total U.S. Senators, which seeks to drastically reduce the federal government’s ability to crack down on state-legal medical marijuana programs, open the banking system, reclassify cannabis’ Schedule 1 drug rating and encourage more research through several major changes in federal law. This legislation currently is waiting for the Senate Judiciary Chair to grant the bill a hearing.

Ancillary Cannabis-Related Businesses
 
As more states enact cannabis legislation, the demand for cannabis-related products and services grows. The rapid expansion of the cannabis market combined with more sophisticated management teams and business models entering the market has spurred the development of numerous cannabis-related niche markets. These ancillary markets that do not physically “touch the plant” include infrastructure and support for the cannabis industry in such areas as social media, security, consulting, delivery systems, financial services, software & high-tech, electronic hardware, infused products, extracts & oils, hemp production, ancillary cultivation solutions, and retail.
 
As mentioned, the federal government still classifies cannabis as a Schedule 1 substance, which leaves many traditional businesses fearing reputational and legal risks of serving the cannabis industry. However, ancillary businesses that do cater to the legal cannabis industry are well positioned to benefit from the growth in the industry.
 
Employees
 
As of April 17, 2018, we have seven full-time employees and no part time employees. None of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We consider our relationship with our employees to be good.
