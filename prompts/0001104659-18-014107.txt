ITEM 1.                        BUSINESS
Overview
 
Loxo Oncology is a biopharmaceutical company innovating the development of highly selective medicines for patients with genetically defined cancers. Our pipeline focuses on cancers that are uniquely dependent on single gene abnormalities, such that a single drug has the potential to treat the cancer with dramatic effect. We believe that the most selective, purpose-built medicines have the highest probability of maximally inhibiting the intended target, thereby delivering best-in-class disease control and safety. Our management team seeks out experienced industry partners, world-class scientific advisors and innovative clinical-regulatory approaches to deliver new cancer therapies to patients as quickly and efficiently as possible.
 
As genetic testing in cancer becomes more routine, we are learning that cancers arising in diverse sites in the body may share common genetic alterations. Increasingly, tumors may be identified and treated according to their distinguishing genetic alterations, while in the past, the organ of origin was most important. Both research and clinical data suggest that some tumors, while having many identifiable genetic alterations, are primarily dependent on a single genetic alteration or signaling pathway for their proliferation and survival. This dependency, often referred to as oncogene addiction, renders such tumors highly susceptible to small molecule inhibitors targeting the relevant alteration or pathway.
 
We identify and prioritize our targets in two ways. First, we use reported clinical trial data to assess the response signals of drugs in development and identify those that show promise but also demonstrate drug-specific limitations such as poor absorption, poor distribution, unwanted side effects or limited efficacy against important patient subsets. Second, we monitor and/or sponsor academic research to quickly identify novel targets with emerging validation. Once an attractive target is identified, we launch internal discovery efforts, work with technology partners or identify business development opportunities to advance product candidates with the desired product profiles in a rapid, risk-mitigated, and cost-effective manner. After a compelling opportunity has been identified, we implement a stepwise approach to clinical development designed to reduce risk and identify response signals early in development. In early-stage trials, whenever possible, we seek to evaluate our product candidates in well-defined patient populations in order to maximize the likelihood of demonstrating a clinical benefit. This approach allows for the possibility of rapid clinical development and expedited regulatory strategies. We intend to develop companion diagnostics when appropriate, with the help of technology partners, to identify patients whose tumors harbor relevant genetic alterations.
 
Our Strategy
 
Our goal is to translate key scientific insights relating to underlying oncogenic drivers into the development of potent and highly selective therapeutics. To execute our strategy, we intend to:
 
·                  Rapidly advance our product candidates through clinical development and, if successful, commercialize them ourselves or with partners. Our product candidate pipeline currently consists of:
 
·                  Larotrectinib, an oral, potent and selective inhibitor of tropomyosin receptor kinases (TRK), a family of signaling proteins. In December 2017, we announced that we initiated submission of a rolling New Drug Application (NDA) to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for larotrectinib for the treatment of unresectable or metastatic solid tumors with NTRK-fusion proteins in adult and pediatric patients who require systemic therapy and who have either progressed following prior treatment or who have no acceptable alternative treatments. We expect to complete the NDA submission in the first quarter of 2018, and expect our partner Bayer Consumer Care AG (Bayer) to submit a Marketing Authorisation Application (MAA) to the European Medicines Agency in 2018.
 
·                  LOXO-195, an oral, potent and selective inhibitor of TRKthat retains inhibitory activity against certain mutated TRK fusion proteins no longer sensitive to larotrectinib or other TRK inhibitors. LOXO-195 is

currently being studied in a multi-center Phase 1/2 trial. We expect to provide a clinical data update on this program in a scientific forum in the second half of 2018. Preclinical data on our LOXO-195 preclinical program and clinical proof-of-concept data from the first two patients treated with LOXO-195 were published in an article in Cancer Discovery in June 2017.
 
In November 2017, we and Bayer entered into an exclusive global collaboration agreement for the development and commercialization of larotrectinib and LOXO-195, a next-generation TRK inhibitor. We lead worldwide development and U.S. regulatory activities. Bayer leads ex-U.S. regulatory activities and worldwide commercial activities. In the U.S., we and Bayer will co-promote the products.
 
·                  LOXO-292, an oral, potent and selective inhibitor of Rearranged during Transfection (RET) tyrosine kinase, a signaling protein. Following IND clearance by the FDA, we enrolled the first patient into our Phase 1 trial of LOXO-292 in May 2017. This first-in-human, global, multi-center Phase 1 trial is evaluating LOXO-292 as a single agent in patients with advanced solid tumors. In October 2017, we presented preliminary clinical data from the LOXO-292 program at the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer (IASLC) 18th World Conference on Lung Cancer, in Yokohama, Japan. We expect to provide a more comprehensive trial update in a scientific forum in the first half of 2018.
 
·                  LOXO-305, an oral, potent and selective inhibitor of Brutons tyrosine (BTK) that retains inhibitory activity against certain mutated BTK proteins no longer sensitive to covalent BTK inhibitors. LOXO-305 is a novel, potent selective, and reversible BTK inhibitor with equivalent potency against wild-type and cysteine-481 (C481) mutated BTK. We believe that the widespread use of covalent BTK inhibitors, such as ibrutinib and acalabrutinib, will increasingly drive acquired resistance through a mutational event in BTK called C481, leading to a group of relapsing patients in need of new therapies. LOXO-305 was designed to reversibly bind BTK and preserve activity in the presence of the C481 acquired resistance mutation. Additionally, it was designed to avoid off-target kinases that have complicated the development of both covalent and other more promiscuous reversible BTK inhibitors, such as EGFR, ITK, BMX, TEC, ITK, BLK, LCK and SRC. LOXO-305 is expected to enter clinical development in the second half of 2018.
 
·                  Develop a pipeline of potent and highly selective targeted therapeutics. Our insights into cancer biology and target identification, coupled with our focus on purpose-built medicinal chemistry, have allowed us to build a proprietary pipeline of targeted product candidates. Our management team and Scientific Advisory Board have a history of success in the identification, translation and development of oncology therapeutics, and together we determine which programs merit advancement and continued development. We may engage in complementary activities to gain access to attractive drug candidates, including some or all of the following: 1) collaboration with third-party discovery partners to build new drugs that meet desired specifications; 2) internal discovery conducted by Loxo Oncology in its laboratory facilities in Boulder, CO; or 3) business development, such as licensing or acquisition.
 
·                  Increase the probability for clinical success by prioritizing targets for development that are believed to be oncogenic drivers. We attempt to select targets for drug development that behave as oncogenic drivers. If we are successful in inhibiting these targets with our product candidates, we may increase the likelihood of achieving tumor responses. This approach has been validated by others in the setting of epidermal growth factor (EGFR) mutated lung cancer, BRAF mutated melanoma, BCR-ABL translocated chronic myelogenous leukemia and ALK translocated lung cancer.
 
·                  Work with experienced third parties in the field of diagnostics. In initial clinical development, we will attempt to employ existing diagnostic tools to identify patient subsets with the highest likelihood of clinical benefit. In late-stage clinical development, once the most important screening criteria have been established, we will work with third-party technology partners to develop companion diagnostic assays that could support registration and marketing of our product candidates. Thus, relationships with established diagnostics partners are important to enrolling our clinical trials and identifying patients in the eventual commercial setting.
 
·                  Conduct international clinical and regulatory programs to support our global approval and commercialization strategy. Cancer is a global disease and we are pursuing clinical and regulatory programs for approval in the U.S. and internationally. As programs advance towards potential regulatory approvals and commercialization, we may license our drugs to partners, either in specific territories or globally, or build a focused commercial organization ourselves to launch the products.
 
Background on Cancer
 
Cancer is the second-leading cause of death in the U.S. The American Cancer Society estimates that in 2018 there will be approximately 1.74 million new cases and approximately 610,000 deaths from cancer in the U.S. Cancer originates from defects in the cells genetic code (DNA), which disrupt the mechanisms that normally prevent uncontrolled cell growth, invasion and programmed cell death. Increasingly, doctors are using diagnostic tests to identify these genetic defects and select better treatment options. As genetic

testing in cancer becomes more routine, we are learning that cancers arising in diverse sites in the body may share common genetic alterations.
 
The most common methods of treating patients with cancer are surgery, radiation and drug therapy. A cancer patient often receives treatment with a combination of these modalities. Surgery and radiation therapy are particularly effective in patients in whom the disease is localized. Physicians generally use systemic drug therapies in situations in which the cancer has spread beyond the primary site or cannot otherwise be treated through surgery. The goal of drug therapy is to damage and kill cancer cells or to interfere with the molecular and cellular processes that control the development, growth and survival of cancer cells. In many cases, drug therapy entails the administration of several different drugs in combination. Over the past several decades, drug therapy has evolved from non-specific drugs that kill both healthy and cancerous cells, to drugs that target specific molecular pathways involved in cancer and more recently to therapeutics that target specific oncogenic drivers. These therapies often require genetic testing of a cancer to identify the subsets of patients for whom a drug will most effectively impact tumor growth.
 
Cytotoxic Therapies.  The earliest approach to cancer drug therapy was the development of cytotoxic drugs, commonly referred to as chemotherapy, designed to kill rapidly proliferating cancer cells. Cytotoxic drug therapies act in an indiscriminate manner, killing healthy as well as cancerous cells. Due to their mechanism of action, many cytotoxic drugs have a narrow therapeutic range; doses above this range cause unacceptable or even fatal levels of damage to normal organs, while doses below the range are not effective in eradicating the cancer cells. Examples of cytotoxic drugs include carboplatin (Paraplatin), docetaxel (Taxotere) and doxorubicin (Adriamycin).
Targeted Therapies.  A newer class of medicines targets specific biological signaling pathways that play a role in rapid cell growth or the spread of cancer. While these drugs have been effective in the treatment of some cancers, most of them do not address the genetic alterations that cause oncogenesis. As normal cells may also rely on these signaling pathways, there are often toxicities associated with inhibition of these pathways. In addition, targeted therapies may hit signaling pathways adjacent and in addition to the intended pathway, thus causing off-target toxicities. Examples of targeted therapies include sunitinib (Sutent), sorafenib (Nexavar), and cabozantinib (Cometriq).
Targeted Therapies and Oncogene Addiction.  The dissemination of approved and experimental targeted therapies into large populations revealed that some patients had particularly robust responses to these therapies. This observation was consistent with lab evidence that some tumors, despite having many measurable genetic alterations, are primarily dependent on a single activated kinase for their growth and survival advantage. Such cancers are highly susceptible to small molecule inhibitors. Often described as an oncogenic driver mutation or a dominant activating mutation, oncogene addiction is a term used to describe a tumors particular dependence on a specific pathway. Oncogene addiction has become an important concept in clinical development because patients with tumors governed by this behavior typically show rapid and measurable tumor shrinkage when exposed to drugs targeting the relevant alteration. These responses can be sufficiently dramatic in some cases to support expedited regulatory approval for the associated targeted therapy.
 
Kinase inhibitors against EGFR in stage IV lung cancer provide an informative case study regarding the importance of identifying oncogenic drivers in enabling more efficient drug development and improving clinical care. In 2004, researchers first discovered that a subset of lung cancer was caused by a genetic defect in EGFR. Drugs called erlotinib (Tarceva and gefitinib (Iressa), which target EGFR, were in development for lung cancers of unknown mutation status. Investigators learned that patients with mutations in EGFR receiving Tarceva or Iressa experienced a much higher response rate, defined as the proportion of patients with meaningful tumor shrinkage on their clinical imaging scans, than unselected patients. Patients with EGFR mutations have a response rate in the 65% range, as opposed to the 10% range noted in unselected lung patients. Tarceva is approved in the U.S. as first-line treatment for non-small cell lung cancer patients with EGFR mutations, afatinib (Gilotrif) is approved in the U.S. for patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer with specific EGFR mutations, and in November 2015, the U.S. FDA granted accelerated approval to osimertinib (Tagrisso) for the treatment of patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer who have a specific genetic marker and have progressed on or after treatment with a prior EGFR inhibitor.
 
Inhibitors of other kinases associated with oncogenic driver events have shown compelling clinical effects in patients whose tumors harbor alterations in genes with acronyms such as ALK, BRAF, and ABL. Drugs such as crizotinib (Xalkori), vemurafenib (Zelboraf), imatinib (Gleevec) and others have been successfully developed against these oncogenic drivers.
 
Researchers and clinical oncologists now often incorporate genetic assessments into clinical trials and routine care with the hope of directing patients to medicines that may have a greater chance of treating their cancers effectively. As more driver oncogenes in cancer are identified, clinicians and investigators are more willing to test routinely with an expanded panel genetic test. In turn, it is possible to develop drugs for defined subsets of patients, and to look for patients whose tumor types harbor genetically similar alterations. As such, doctors may begin to identify tumors and select therapies based on the type of mutations they share, rather than the part of the body from which they arise. Such a system should afford more efficient drug development, the opportunity for robust clinical responses and a better understanding of the underlying mechanisms of cancer.

The Loxo Approach
 
Step 1Target Selection
 
Target selection requires an understanding of which genetic alterations are oncogenic drivers. Some targets have already been clinically validated as oncogenic drivers of cancer and offer increased likelihood of program success; these targets require improved chemistry or innovative development for competitive differentiation. Other targets are still emerging, so the understanding of oncogenic driver behavior requires careful analysis of new biological evidence. We believe we are well-positioned to exploit both types of opportunities.
Learning from Clinical Trial Data.  Response signals for third-party drugs in clinical trials can point to the promise of a target that has been inadequately exploited. An important emerging concept in cancer drug development is that of target coverage, or the extent to which a drug fully engages its intended target. We believe that maximal target inhibition is required for maximal clinical effect. However, drugs often fail to reach sufficient concentrations in the human body because they are poorly absorbed, poorly distributed, rapidly cleared, or cause off-target toxicities at doses lower than those needed for optimal efficacy. Sometimes these limitations can be overcome with better chemistry, which improves drug exposure and reduces unwanted off-target effects. A second lesson that can be gleaned from clinical trial data relates to the concept of acquired resistance. Acquired resistance describes the clinical situation where a patients oncogene addicted tumor is at first sensitive to the relevant drug but then mutates again such that it becomes resistant. It is sometimes possible to understand how a new, acquired mutation has led to drug resistance. In turn, it is sometimes possible to develop a next-generation drug inhibitor that can re-induce a response in the patient. For example, the drug osimertinib (Tagrisso) addresses acquired resistance in patients who have progressed on a prior EGFR inhibitor. Developing second-generation drugs against validated targets with acquired resistance can be of great clinical value to patients because it extends the time of durable disease control, while the well-characterized biology offers a compelling drug development opportunity.
Learning from Academic Research.  Lab research can help identify and qualify emerging targets. Genetic studies across groups of patient tumor samples generate rich data sets, which are often publicly available. Bioinformatic approaches can help identify the alterations most likely to have clinical relevance. Lab experiments involving cell and animal models can be used to explore whether a novel target is an oncogenic driver and whether targeted drugs can be effective. Consistency of results across highly respected labs is especially important. We apply our judgment to synthesize these diverse data streams to identify the most promising targets.
Step 2Drug Profiling
 
We translate target insight into a drug through the application of chemistry to a biologic problem. Whether our target of interest is fully validated or novel, we strive to understand, on a structural level, whether the relevant protein can be inhibited with a compound we can design and synthesize. We assess compounds based on their ability to fully engage their targets, avoid unwanted effects and have favorable pharmacologic properties. Target specificity also affords increased potential for combination therapy with other targeted agents. We have observed that better chemistry can unlock novel biology in the clinic. We rely on extensive experimental data from two domains to justify advancing a program.
Biologic Relevance.  In consultation with our Scientific Advisory Board, we identify experiments with the intent to answer the underlying hypothesis of oncogenic driver potential, target validation, or a differentiated profile relative to competitive programs. These experiments may be conducted internally at our lab facilities in Boulder, CO, with third-party partners and vendors or with academic collaborators.
 
Chemistry Feasibility.  Our internal discovery capability in Boulder, Colorado and our collaborations with leading third-party partners and vendors allow us to exploit structural biology and chemistry insights to solve problems that have historically plagued many cancer drugs. For each target under evaluation, we develop molecules with the specific pharmacokinetic properties that we have identified and are able to compile a comprehensive data review prior to advancing a molecule to preclinical toxicology studies. This understanding of how a molecule might behave in vivo prevents us from advancing products with undesirable physiochemical properties.
 
Step 3Clinical Trial and Regulatory Execution
 
Our clinical development strategy employs a stepwise approach designed to identify response signals early in development and reduce development risks. In early stage development, we seek to explore one or more doses in well-defined patient populations and believe this gives us a higher likelihood of demonstrating a clinical benefit. This approach is intended to allow for early insight into the therapeutic potential of a product candidate and the possibility for rapid clinical development and expedited regulatory strategies, such as Breakthrough Therapy Designation, Fast Track Designation, Priority Review and Accelerated Approval. We intend to develop companion diagnostics as appropriate, with the help of technology partners, to identify patients whose tumors harbor the relevant genetic alterations.

Product Candidates
 
Larotrectinib (TRK Inhibitor)
 
Overview.  Larotrectinib is an oral, selective inhibitor of the TRK family in development for the treatment of tumors with TRK fusions. TRK fusions have been implicated in diverse tumor types such as appendiceal cancer, breast cancer, cholangiocarcinoma, colorectal cancer, GIST, infantile fibrosarcoma, lung cancer, mammary analogue secretory carcinoma of the salivary gland, melanoma, pancreatic cancer, thyroid cancer, and various sarcomas. We selected larotrectinib from a portfolio of TRK inhibitors invented by our partner Array that had distinct chemical scaffolds and were initially developed to treat pain, a setting in which positive efficacy signals had been seen with therapeutic antibodies targeting the TRK pathway. As a result of the initial focus on a pain indication, the TRK inhibitors were designed for both potency and specificity. In purified enzyme inhibition studies, larotrectinib has demonstrated potent inhibition activity against TRKA, TRKB and TRKC at low nanomolar concentration levels. These studies also demonstrated that larotrectinib was highly selective, as it was not a strong inhibitor of any other tested kinase. Similarly, in cells expressing these TRK receptors, larotrectinib also demonstrated potent inhibition activity at low nanomolar concentrations. We believe that potent and selective inhibition of the TRK pathway may provide clinical benefit in patients whose tumors have relevant TRK alterations. Given larotrectinibs specificity, we do not anticipate clinical activity in patients whose tumors are not driven by TRK.
 
TRK Biology.  TRK signaling is important to neuronal development, including the growth and function of neuronal synapses, memory development and maintenance and the protection of neurons after ischemia or other injuries. TRK expression decreases after birth in most tissues and in adults expression is restricted primarily to cells of neural crest with a low level of expression under normal conditions. More recently, the role of TRK in non-neural tissues has also been recognized; these tissues include the kidney, prostate, B-lymphocytes, eosinophils, marrow-derived endothelial precursors (involving heart, muscle and ovary) and embryonic stem cells. Three high-affinity TRK receptors have been identified: TRKA, TRKB and TRKC. These proteins are encoded by the NTRK1, NTRK2 and NTRK3 genes, respectively.
 
The Role of TRK in Cancer.  TRK has been widely implicated in multiple cancer types and research suggests that the genes that code TRK can be involved in fusion events, or the abnormal connection of two genes. Fusion events can result in pathologic activation of cellular growth and proliferation pathways. Multiple downstream pathways believed to be important in cancer are stimulated by activated TRK receptors, including the PI3-kinase, phospholipase C-gamma, and MAP-kinase pathways. Drugs targeting some of these pathways have demonstrated clinical activity in the treatment of cancer. The first TRK fusion kinases that were discovered in solid tumors involved the NTRK1 gene in colon cancer. In 2002, fusion kinases involving NTRK3 were identified in secretory breast carcinoma, a rare subtype of breast cancer. More recently, research has uncovered multiple other instances of fusions involving the genes that code TRK. For example, scientists identified NTRK1 gene fusions as oncogenic in lung adenocarcinomas in 2013. We believe that the growing body of scientific literature suggesting the presence of NTRK fusions suggests a possible dependency for cellular proliferation and survival, or an oncogenic addictive role, across multiple cancers.
 
Larotrectinib Clinical Development Program.  We are evaluating larotrectinib in the following clinical trials:
 
·                  Phase 1 multicenter, open-label dose escalation trial in adult patients with advanced solid tumors refractory to standard therapy. The primary endpoints of this open label, multicenter, dose escalation trial include safety assessments, determining the maximum tolerated dose and identifying the appropriate dose for further clinical investigation. Secondary endpoints include pharmacokinetic assessments of orally administered larotrectinib, evaluation of tumor response and duration of response.
 
·                  Phase 2 basket trial, a multicenter, international open-label trial in adult cancer patients whose tumors harbor TRK fusions (NAVIGATE). The larotrectinib Phase 2 basket trial is enrolling patients with TRK fusions across all solid tumor types. A basket trial is a type of clinical study that seeks to enroll cancer patients with a common genetic feature, in this case, a TRK fusion, as opposed to patients with a particular type of cancer. During this trial, larotrectinib is administered orally as a single agent continuously in 28-day cycles. The 100 mg twice-daily dose was selected for this trial. The
 
6




primary endpoint of the trial is the objective response rate (ORR) to larotrectinib, as measured by the proportion of subjects with best overall confirmed response of complete response or partial response by RECIST v1.1, or Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology RANO, criteria, as appropriate. Secondary endpoints include duration of response, the proportion of subjects that have any tumor regression as a best response, progression-free survival, overall survival, safety and tolerability.
 
·                  Phase 1/2 multicenter, open-label trial in pediatric patients with advanced solid or primary central nervous system (CNS) tumors (SCOUT). The trial utilizes the capsule dosage form as well as a liquid formulation of larotrectinib designed specifically for pediatric patients unable to swallow capsules. The primary objective of the trial is to explore the safety of larotrectinib. Secondary objectives include the characterization of pharmacokinetics, the identification of the maximum tolerated dose and/or the Phase 2 dose, and a description of antitumor activity.
 
In February 2017, we announced that we had completed clinical trial enrollment consistent with written FDA feedback which we believe affirmed a path forward for a tissue-type agnostic NDA filing strategy for adult and pediatric TRK fusion patients and that provided specific advice regarding the primary analysis set that could potentially support an NDA filing. The primary efficacy analysis for larotrectinib is based on RECIST v1.1 ORR, as determined by independent radiology review, for NTRK fusion patients enrolled across the three ongoing aforementioned larotrectinib clinical studies. Durability and magnitude of response and safety are also critical elements of the regulatory risk-benefit determination. The larotrectinib clinical trials remain open to continue long-term follow-up of enrolled patients and provide a mechanism for continued drug access to newly identified patients through trial enrollment during regulatory interactions.
 
In December 2017, we announced that we initiated the submission of a rolling NDA to the FDA for larotrectinib for the treatment of unresectable or metastatic solid tumors with NTRK-fusion proteins in adult and pediatric patients who require systemic therapy and who have either progressed following prior treatment or who have no acceptable alternative treatments. We expect to complete the NDA submission by the end of March 2018. However, we can make no assurances that the FDA will grant us approval for the indication that we are seeking, or at all.  We expect our partner Bayer to submit a European MAA in 2018.
 
In February 2018, we announced a publication in the February 22, 2018 issue of the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) for larotrectinib in the treatment of pediatric and adult patients whose tumors harbor TRK gene fusions.
 
The NEJM publication provides additional clinical detail and patient follow-up from the 2017 American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Annual Meeting presentation. It includes the first 55 consecutively enrolled adult and pediatric patients with TRK fusion cancers treated across our Phase 1 adult trial, Phase 2 trial (NAVIGATE), and Phase 1/2 pediatric trial (SCOUT) and uses a July 17, 2017 data cutoff. The initial NDA submission utilized this same patient population and data cutoff.
 
The published data were based on the intent to treat (ITT) principle, using the first 55 TRK fusion patients with RECIST-evaluable disease enrolled to the three clinical trials, regardless of prior therapy or tumor tissue diagnostic method. The analysis included both adult and pediatric patients, ranging in age from four months to 76 years, who carried 17 unique TRK fusion-positive tumor diagnoses. Tumor types included salivary gland, infantile fibrosarcoma, thyroid, colon, lung, melanoma, gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST), and other cancers.
 
The primary endpoint for the analysis was ORR. Secondary endpoints included duration of response, progression-free survival, and safety. As shown below, as previously reported, the ORR was 75% by central assessment and 80% by investigator assessment.
 
 
 | Central Assessment (%) (n=55) | Investigator Assessment (%) (n=55) 
---------------------------------------------+---------------------------------+-------------------------------------
Overall response rate (95% CI) (ORR=PR+CR) | 75% (6185%) | 80% (6790%) 
Partial response | 62% | 64%* 
Complete response | 13% | 16% 
Stable disease | 13% | 9% 
Progressive disease | 9% | 11% 
Could not be evaluated | 4% | 0 



* Data include one patient who had a partial response that was pending confirmation at the time of the July 17, 2017 data cut-off. The response was subsequently confirmed, and the patients treatment and response were ongoing as of the data cut-off date.
 
Median duration of response (DOR) and median progression-free survival (PFS) had not been reached after median follow-up durations of 8.3 months and 9.9, respectively. At 1 year, 71% of responses were ongoing. As of the July 17, 2017 data cutoff, 86% of responding patients remained on treatment or had undergone surgery with curative intent. The first patient treated with a TRK fusion tumor remained in response and on therapy at 27 months.

Larotrectinib was well tolerated with the majority of all adverse events being grade 1 or 2. Few grade 3 or 4 adverse events, regardless of attribution, were observed with the most common being anemia (11%), alanine or aspartate aminotransferase increase (7%), weight increase (7%), and neutrophil count decrease (7%) (all grade 3 events). There were no treatment-related grade 4 or 5 events, and no treatment-related grade 3 adverse events occurred in more than 5% of patients. Eight patients required larotrectinib dose reductions. Adverse events leading to dose reductions included AST/ALT elevation, dizziness, and neutrophil count decrease, all grade 2 or 3 events. In all cases, patients whose doses were reduced maintained their best response at the lower dose and none discontinued larotrectinib due to an adverse event.
 
Primary resistance was observed in six patients in the study. Of the six, one patient had been previously treated with another TRK inhibitor and tumor sequencing prior to larotrectinib dosing revealed a solvent front mutation, a known resistance mechanism. Tumor tissue was analyzed for three of the five remaining patients. In all three patients, TRK immunohistochemistry failed to demonstrate TRK expression, potentially implicating a false positive initial TRK fusion test result and therefore explaining the lack of response in these patients.
 
The publication also details mechanisms of acquired resistance to larotrectinib. Ten patients experienced disease progression while on treatment after a documented objective response or stable disease for at least six months, a phenomenon known as acquired resistance. Nine of the ten patients had assessments of post-progression tumor or plasma samples, and NTRK kinase domain mutations were identified in all of those samples tested. In seven of those assessed, investigators identified solvent front mutations as a convergent mechanism of acquired resistance; other NTRK kinase domain mutations were identified in the remaining two patients tested. Of the 10 patients who developed acquired resistance, 80% continued treatment with larotrectinib beyond progression due to ongoing clinical benefit.
 
Orphan Drug Status.  In September 2015, we announced that the FDA granted larotrectinib orphan drug designation for the treatment of soft tissue sarcoma. In January 2016, we announced that the European Commission designated larotrectinib as an orphan medicinal product for treatment of patients with soft tissue sarcoma. In May 2017, we announced that the FDA granted orphan drug designation to larotrectinib for the treatment of solid tumors with NTRK-fusion proteins.
Breakthrough Therapy Designation.  In July 2016, the FDA granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation to larotrectinib for the treatment of unresectable or metastatic solid tumors with NTRK-fusion proteins in adult and pediatric patients who require systemic therapy and who have either progressed following prior treatment or who have no acceptable alternative treatments. The larotrectinib Breakthrough Therapy Designation application, submitted approximately 60 days prior to designation receipt, included TRK fusion patient data from all three ongoing larotrectinib clinical trials.
Commercial Opportunity.  To add to evidence from the literature, we have worked closely with tumor banks, third party labs, and various assay technology partners to better understand TRK fusion frequency and how to improve testing sensitivity. Our work required certain assumptions based on detection assays with known limitations with regard to sensitivity (i.e. ability to detect TRK fusions that truly exist) and specificity (i.e. ability to detect only TRK fusions). In light of these assay limitations, we provided an estimated range of patient numbers for TRK fusion cancers, which in the United States is 1,500 to 5,000 late-line eligible patients each year. We also believe there are similar numbers of patients in the large European countries and Japan relative to those population sizes, as has been shown for other targeted therapies.
 
The patient opportunity numbers we cite above reflect our best understanding of the peak addressable opportunity for larotrectinib. However, as patients with NTRK fusions must be identified in practice if they are to receive larotrectinib, two factors relating to the diagnostics market must continue to evolve for the full realization of the commercial potential of the drug. First, the diagnostic tools themselves must continue to demonstrate improving sensitivity for NTRK fusions. Available assays, especially those depending on next-generation sequencing, are imperfectly sensitive, though they are improving. Second, patients need better access to high quality diagnostic tests with the ability to comprehensively characterize the biology of their tumors. In large part, patient access is a byproduct of lab reimbursementwhen financial incentives exist that encourage or discourage testing, testing volumes change accordingly. We believe that both assay sensitivity and patient access are improving and will continue to improve. The rate at which these trends evolve is key to finding the 1,500 to 5,000 patients who we believe exist each year in the United States. Our pre-launch preparations are therefore highly focused on the diagnostics and pathology lab communities.
 
In November 2017, we entered into a license, development and commercialization agreement (Bayer Agreement) with Bayer, pursuant to which we and Bayer will collaborate to develop and commercialize larotrectinib and LOXO-195, our franchise of highly selective TRK inhibitors for patients with TRK fusion cancers. Pursuant to the Agreement, we granted co-exclusive development and commercialization licenses to Bayer for both larotrectinib and LOXO-195. (See Agreements section below.)
 
LOXO-195 (TRK Inhibitor)
 
LOXO-195 is a drug candidate in clinical development. It was designed as a second-generation TRK inhibitor intended to address predicted acquired resistance mechanisms resulting from therapy with a first-generation TRK inhibitor such as larotrectinib, or multikinase inhibitors with significant anti-TRK activity. In preclinical models, LOXO-195 appears to be particularly active against so-called solvent front mutations, which are a class of structural mutations that have been described in the literature as relevant to TRK

acquired resistance, but also ALK and ROS1 acquired resistance. Given the limited clinical experience with TRK inhibitors, and the preliminary nature of the research describing mechanisms of acquired resistance in TRK fusion cancers, it is reassuring to see a resistance mechanism, i.e. solvent front mutations, which have been described in the setting of other oncogenic fusion events, namely those involving ALK and ROS1. Solvent front mutations often require novel medicinal chemistry solutions, and we believe LOXO-195 represents a structurally diverse solution to this mechanism of acquired resistance. With the LOXO-195 program, we hope to offer certain patients who progress on larotrectinib or other agents an opportunity to extend their time of durable disease control.
 
We presented preclinical data at the EORTC-NCI-AACR Molecular Targets and Cancer Therapeutics Symposium in December 2016 in Munich, Germany on our LOXO-195 preclinical program. In preclinical models, LOXO-195 demonstrated potent and selective inhibition of solvent front mutations, as well as other predicted resistance mutations reported in recent literature to date. LOXO-195 also exhibited favorable preclinical in vivo properties in relevant in vivo models.
 
Preclinical data on our LOXO-195 preclinical program and clinical proof-of-concept data from the first two patients treated with LOXO-195 were published in an article in Cancer Discovery in June 2017. An adult with colorectal cancer and a child with infantile fibrosarcoma were biopsied at the time of tumor progression and found to have a solvent front TRK mutation in the existing TRK fusion, which explained the diminished activity of larotrectinib. As no other treatment options exist to address TRK fusion solvent front mutations, the FDA permitted these patients to access LOXO-195 through emergency use Investigational New Drug Applications (Emergency Use INDs). Both patients had confirmed partial responses based on RECIST v1.1 ORR to LOXO-195, with minimal adverse events reported (grade 2 dizziness and grade 1 diarrhea reported, though neither interfered with dosing).
 
We submitted an Investigational New Drug (IND), application for a Phase 1/2 study of LOXO-195 in adults with NTRK fusion or non-fusion NTRK altered cancers and received clearance from the FDA to proceed in May 2017. LOXO-195 is currently being studied in a multi-center Phase 1/2 trial. The primary objective of the trial is to determine the maximum tolerated dose or recommended dose for further study. Key secondary objectives include measures of safety, pharmacokinetics, and anti-tumor activity (i.e. Objective Response Rate and Duration of Response, as determined by RECIST v1.1). The trial includes a dose escalation phase and a dose expansion phase. We expect to provide a clinical data update on this program in a scientific forum in the second half of 2018.
 
In November 2017, we entered into a license, development and commercialization agreement with Bayer pursuant to which we and Bayer will collaborate to develop and commercialize larotrectinib and LOXO-195, our franchise of highly selective TRK inhibitors for patients with TRK fusion cancers. Pursuant to the Agreement, we granted co-exclusive development and commercialization licenses to Bayer for both larotrectinib and LOXO-195. (See Agreements section below.)
 
LOXO-292 (RET Inhibitor)
 
LOXO-292 is a drug candidate in clinical development. It targets a cancer oncogene known as Rearranged during Transfection (RET). In normal physiology, RET is a tyrosine kinase receptor that binds the glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) ligand family, a signaling pathway important to the development of the nervous system and kidneys. In cancer, activating fusions and mutations in RET have been identified across a range of cancer types, including lung, thyroid, breast and colon cancers. There are multiple peer-reviewed articles of patients with RET gene alterations demonstrating preliminary anti-tumor activity in experimental trials of multikinase inhibitors with anti-RET activity. LOXO-292 is designed to be a highly specific RET inhibitor that is intended to optimize on-target potency for RET fusions, activating mutations, and anticipated mechanisms of acquired resistance in these settings.
 
RET fusions account for approximately 2% of non-small cell lung cancer. RET fusions also account for 10-20% of papillary thyroid cancer, and may be found in other tumors such as colon cancer, where prevalence is not well understood. RET mutations account for approximately 60% of medullary thyroid cancer. Based on literature reports, we estimate that in lung and thyroid cancers, there are approximately 5,000 late-line eligible patients per year in the United States who might benefit from a targeted RET inhibitor such as LOXO-292. This estimate reflects our best understanding of the peak addressable opportunity for LOXO-292. However, as patients with activating RET alterations must be identified in practice if they are to receive LOXO-292, two factors relating to the diagnostics market must continue to evolve for the full realization of the commercial potential of the drug. First, the diagnostic tools themselves must continue to demonstrate improving sensitivity for activating RET alterations. Available assays, especially those depending on next-generation sequencing, are imperfectly sensitive, but improving. Second, patients need better access to high quality diagnostic tests with the ability to comprehensively characterize the biology of their tumors. In large part, patient access is a byproduct of lab reimbursementwhen financial incentives exist that encourage or discourage testing, testing volumes change accordingly. We believe that both assay sensitivity and patient access are improving and will continue to improve. The rate at which these trends evolve is key to finding the approximately 5,000 patients who we believe exist each year in the United States.
 
We presented preclinical data at the EORTC-NCI-AACR Molecular Targets and Cancer Therapeutics Symposium in December 2016 in Munich, Germany on our LOXO-292 preclinical program. LOXO-292 demonstrated RET potency in enzyme and cellular assays with minimal activity against highly related kinases and other off-targets. In preclinical data, in vivo, LOXO-292 demonstrated its ability to drive tumor regressions in relevant RET-driven models, while having minimal effect on body weight, a proxy for toxicity. LOXO-292 also demonstrated potency against many anticipated mechanisms of acquired resistance, both in vitro and in vivo.

Following IND clearance by the FDA, we enrolled the first patient into our Phase 1 trial of LOXO-292 in May 2017. This first-in-human, global, multi-center Phase 1 trial is evaluating LOXO-292 as a single agent in patients with advanced solid tumors. The primary objective of the trial is to determine the maximum tolerated dose or recommended dose for further study. Key secondary objectives include measures of safety, pharmacokinetics, and anti-tumor activity (i.e. Objective Response Rate and Duration of Response, as determined by RECIST v1.1). The trial includes a dose escalation phase and dose expansion phase. During the dose escalation phase, patients with advanced solid tumors may be enrolled to inform the selection of a dose and schedule for the expansion phase. In the expansion phase, five cohorts are planned to allow for the characterization of preliminary activity of LOXO-292 in the following genetically-defined populations: 1) RET-fusion lung cancer patients with prior RET inhibitor experience; 2) RET-fusion lung cancer patients with no prior RET inhibitor experience; 3) RET-mutant medullary thyroid cancer patients with prior RET inhibitor experience; 4) RET-mutant medullary thyroid cancer patients with no prior RET inhibitor experience; and 5) other RET-altered solid tumors.
 
In October 2017, we presented preliminary clinical data from the LOXO-292 program at the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer (IASLC) 18th World Conference on Lung Cancer, in Yokohama, Japan. The presentation, which employed a September 26, 2017 data cut-off date, described the first two patients with RET-fusion lung cancer with and without brain metastases treated with LOXO-292. Both patients had disease progression while receiving prior multi-kinase inhibitors (MKIs). On LOXO-292, both patients achieved partial responses. The first patient was previously treated with RXDX-105, enrolled on the first dose cohort of the Phase 1 trial, received LOXO-292 20 mg daily, and demonstrated a RECIST confirmed partial response. The second patient was previously treated with alectinib (starting at 600 mg twice daily and increased to 900 mg twice daily) and experienced disease progression systemically and in the brain. Due to the rapidly progressive nature of the brain metastases, the patient was ineligible for the Phase 1 trial and received LOXO-292 in doses ranging from 20-100 mg twice daily under an intra-patient dose escalation single patient protocol. The patient demonstrated a RECIST confirmed partial response, including a response in the brain. Both patients remained on LOXO-292 as of the data cut-off date. In this early two patient data set, LOXO-292 was well-tolerated, with no adverse events attributed to LOXO-292. Additionally, the presentation included pharmacology data from all patients enrolled at that time (n=28), providing evidence that the highest dose level shown (60mg twice daily) provides IC90 RET target coverage in patients. We expect to provide a more comprehensive trial update in a scientific forum in the first half of 2018.
 
LOXO-305 (BTK Inhibitor)
 
In July 2017, we announced that we entered into a definitive agreement to purchase the BTK inhibitor program from Redx Pharma Plc. Under the terms of the agreement, we made a $40 million payment to Redx Pharma Plc for the full acquisition of the BTK discovery program, including lead candidate LOXO-305 (formerly RXC005). We are not subject to milestone or royalty obligations.
 
LOXO-305 is a novel, potent selective, and reversible BTK inhibitor with equivalent potency against wild-type and cysteine-481 (C481) mutated BTK. We believe that the widespread use of covalent BTK inhibitors, such as ibrutinib and acalabrutinib, will increasingly drive acquired resistance through a mutational event in BTK called C481, leading to a group of relapsing patients in need of new therapies. Our work suggests that a highly selective, reversible BTK inhibitor can address this emerging unmet need in patients whose disease has progressed on a covalent BTK inhibitor.
 
LOXO-305 was designed to reversibly bind BTK and preserve activity in the presence of the C481 acquired resistance mutation. Additionally, it was designed to avoid off-target kinases that have complicated the development of both covalent and other more promiscuous reversible BTK inhibitors, such as EGFR, ITK, BMX, TEC, ITK, BLK, LCK and SRC. LOXO-305 is expected to enter clinical development in the second half of 2018.
 
FGFR
 
We are seeking a drug candidate capable of potently inhibiting fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) isoforms 2 and/ or 3, while sparing isoforms 1 and 4. There are numerous FGFR1-3 inhibitors that have shown anti-tumor activity in Phase 1-2 human clinical trials, but they are associated with significant toxicities that limit dose intensity (see Lewin et al Journal of Clinical Oncology 33 (2015) 3372-3374). FGFR4 inhibitors are also in clinical development, tend to spare FGFR1-3, target different biologic hypotheses, and are not of interest to Loxo.
 
The FGFR family of receptors consists of four isoforms with tyrosine kinase domains, numbered one through four, which play important roles in embryonic development and adult angiogenesis, hormone regulation, and renal function. Fusions, point mutations, and gene amplifications in individual isoforms of the FGFR family have been associated with distinct cancer types in patients, and preliminary anti-tumor activity has been demonstrated in genitourinary, lung, and breast cancers in experimental trials of kinase inhibitors with anti-FGFR activity. However, most small molecule FGFR inhibitors are functionally equipotent against isoforms FGFR1, FGFR2 and FGFR3, and are associated with metabolic and systemic toxicities that limit dose, duration of therapy and target engagement.
 
We presented preclinical data at the AACR-NCI-EORTC International Conference on Molecular Targets and Cancer Therapeutics meeting in November 2015 in Boston, Massachusetts on our FGFR preclinical program. Data for our potent and selective FGFR inhibitor tool compounds show a relative sparing of FGFR1, while exhibiting high oral bioavailability and favorable PK properties in animal models.

Agreements
 
Bayer License, Development and Commercialization Agreement
 
In November 2017, we entered into a license, development and commercialization agreement with Bayer pursuant to which we and Bayer will collaborate to develop and commercialize larotrectinib and LOXO-195, our franchise of highly selective TRK inhibitors for patients with TRK fusion cancers. Pursuant to the Bayer Agreement, we granted co-exclusive development and commercialization licenses to Bayer for both larotrectinib and LOXO-195.
 
In addition to an upfront cash payment of $400.0 million, we are eligible to receive $450.0 million in milestone payments upon larotrectinib regulatory approvals and first commercial sale events in certain major markets and an additional $200.0 million in milestone payments upon LOXO-195 regulatory approvals and first commercial sale events in certain major markets.
 
We will lead global development activities and regulatory activities in the U.S. Bayer will lead regulatory activities outside the U.S. and global commercial activities. Globally, we will be responsible for 50% of development costs. In the U.S., where we and Bayer will co-promote the products, we will be responsible for 50% of the commercial costs and receive 50% of the profits. Bayer will pay us a $25.0 million milestone upon achieving a certain U.S. net sales threshold. We will have the right to opt-out of the U.S. co-promotion, in which case we would receive a royalty in the low thirties percent range on U.S. net sales, which is meant to approximate the economics of the 50/50 profit split.
 
Outside of the U.S., where Bayer will commercialize, Bayer will pay us tiered, double digit royalties on net sales, and sales milestones totaling $475.0 million.
 
The Bayer Agreement also includes a standstill provision that prevents Bayer from acquiring five percent or more of our voting securities.
 
The Bayer Agreement will terminate as to a product or country upon the expiration of the royalty term applicable to such product in such country. The Bayer Agreement may be terminated by either party for material breach or bankruptcy. In addition, Bayer may terminate the Bayer Agreement after the fourth anniversary of the effective date upon written notice to us, or in the event that we receive a complete response letter from the U.S. FDA with respect to larotrectinib, or if we do not receive marketing approval for larotrectinib by December 31, 2018.
 
Array Collaboration
 
Overview.  On July 3, 2013, we entered into a Drug Discovery Collaboration Agreement with Array (Array Agreement) which was subsequently amended on November 26, 2013, April 10, 2014, October 13, 2014, March 31, 2015 and February 18, 2016. Pursuant to the Array Agreement, Array agreed to design, conduct and perform research and preclinical testing for certain compounds that we select, including larotrectinib, targeting TRKA, TRKB and TRKC, identify IND candidates for TRK and other targets, and undertake manufacturing activities sufficient to conduct Phase 1 clinical studies for a subset of these compounds. Array granted us exclusive licenses worldwide for clinical and commercial development of compounds that inhibit a defined number of targets. The Array Agreement also contains mechanisms for the replacement of a discovery program by substituting a new target for a target for which discovery activities were discontinued. As consideration, Array received or receives 1) shares of our capital stock; 2) ongoing cash payments proportionate to Arrays commitment of full-time equivalents to conduct preclinical research for our programs during a discovery research phase through July 2016, which we may extend for up to two additional one-year periods, with the Array Agreement now set to conclude in September 2018; 3) payments for certain other costs and research requirements related to the targets; 4) milestone payments of up to approximately (i) $223 million with respect to products related to TRK, including larotrectinib and its backup compounds, and (ii) $213 million with respect to product candidates directed to targets other than TRK, if certain clinical and sales milestones are achieved; and 5) single-digit royalties on sales of any resulting drugs.
 
In the October 2014 amendment to the Array Agreement, in addition to larotrectinib, the parties designated 12 discovery targets, of which seven were selected for additional study in January 2015, which was to be reduced to four on or before January 2016. The October 2014 amendment also created mechanisms through which we and Array could evaluate additional targets outside of the named targets to implement the originally contemplated potential substitution of one or more of the named targets. We had the option to maintain the total target number at five for an additional payment, and we exercised this option to maintain five discovery programs in January 2016. In the October 2014 and March 2015 amendments to the Array Agreement, we agreed to provide additional headcount support for Arrays research activities on our agreed-upon targets.
 
In the February 2016 amendment to the Array Agreement, we agreed to continue to support increased headcount for an additional interim period. Additionally, the parties extended the agreement term through September 30, 2017, with Loxo retaining an option to extend the term for up to one additional year. This option was exercised during the three-month period ended June 30, 2017. This headcount support for Arrays research activities on our agreed-upon targets currently expires on September 30, 2018.  Also in the February 2016 amendment, the parties increased the discovery program list from five to six targets by adding a new target that was not previously worked on by either party, and further refined the original mechanism through which we and Array could evaluate additional targets outside of the named targets for potential substitution with one or more of the named targets. Lastly, the February 2016
 
11




amendment allowed Array to be eligible for milestones and royalties on any back-up compounds developed through the collaboration. This amendment also included an additional payment from us to Array, satisfying an obligation of the April 2014 amendment.
 
We and Array jointly own the intellectual property developed by the combined efforts of both our employees, and we each retain ownership of intellectual property that we develop independently pursuant to the collaboration. Array has granted us an exclusive license under all of Arrays intellectual property rights, including intellectual property rights developed in the collaboration, to research, develop and commercialize products resulting from the collaboration.
 
In October 2014, Array notified us in writing that it planned to begin substantial negotiations with third parties regarding the development and/or commercialization of compounds that selectively modulate TRKA for oncology indications. That notification triggered a 90-day period whereby we had the right to discuss the terms and conditions under which Array would grant such rights to us. This period has expired and Array is free to negotiate with, and grant such rights to, a third-party.
 
Governance.  Our collaboration with Array is guided by a joint research committee (JRC). Decisions of the JRC are made by majority vote. If the votes required to approve a decision cannot be reached within the JRC, we have the deciding vote except with respect to matters that would cause Array to violate any obligation or agreement it may have with a third-party or unilaterally impose on Array any financial obligation that is beyond the scope of Arrays obligation under the Array Agreement.
Exclusivity Restrictions.  Subject to exceptions specified in the Array Agreement, for so long as we have an active research or development program for a target selected by us or are commercializing a product for such a target, Array may not research, develop, manufacture or commercialize any product comprising a small molecule, whose primary mechanism of action for therapeutic or prophylactic effect, binds to or modulates the activity of such target, or binds or modulates at least two of TRKA, TRKB or TRKC. For any target added to the Array Agreement after the February 2016 amendment, whether by substitution or otherwise, Array may not conduct discovery research with respect to a product comprising a small molecule that, as a primary mechanism of action for therapeutic or prophylactic effect, binds to or modulates the activity of such target.
Term and Termination.  The Array Agreement expires on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis on the date of the expiration of the applicable royalty term with respect to each licensed product in each country and in its entirety upon the expiration of all applicable royalty terms for all licensed products in all countries. The royalty term for each licensed product in each country is the period commencing with first commercial sale of the applicable licensed product in the applicable country and ending on the latest of (i) ten years following the date of the first commercial sale in the country and (ii) expiration of the last to expire of any patent specified by the Array Agreement that includes at least one valid claim covering the manufacture, use or sale of such product in such country. Following expiration of the Array Agreement, we will have a perpetual, fully paid-up, non-exclusive license to conduct research, develop and commercialize the products developed under the Array Agreement.
 
The Array Agreement may be terminated by either party upon the failure of the other party to cure any material breach of its obligations under the Array Agreement, provided that, so long as we are reasonably able to pay our debts as they are due, in the event of our breach after expiration of the discovery research phase, Array will only be entitled to seek monetary damages and will not have the right to terminate the Array Agreement. We also have the right to terminate the Array Agreement or to terminate discovery research with respect to any compounds under development on six months notice to Array. If we terminate the Array Agreement for convenience, all licenses granted to us will terminate and Array will receive a license under any intellectual property rights generated by us under the collaboration to further develop and commercialize the licensed programs. If we terminate the Array Agreement as a result of Arrays uncured breach, then the licenses granted by Array would continue and we would remain obligated to pay the milestone and royalty payments. For each specific compound for which we terminate research and development activities before the expiration of the research discovery phase, all licenses granted to us directed at that abandoned compound will concurrently terminate and Array will receive a license under any intellectual property rights generated by us under the collaboration to further develop and commercialize such abandoned compound. We and Array have each also agreed to indemnify the other party for breaches of representations and warranties under the Array Agreement, and we have agreed to indemnify Array against any claims relating to personal injury or death resulting from a compound developed, manufactured, used, sold or otherwise distributed under the Array Agreement.
 
Intellectual Property
 
Our intellectual property is critical to our business and we strive to protect it through the use of trade secrets and by seeking and maintaining patent protection in the U.S. and internationally for our product candidates, back-up compounds, and other inventions that are important to our business. For our product candidates, we generally strive for patent protection covering both composition of matter and methods of use. As more fully described below, we have an exclusive license from Array to issued composition of matter and method of use patents covering larotrectinib that expire in 2029, without taking into account any applicable extensions.
 
Through our internal discovery efforts and our work with third-parties, we patent wholly-owned, joint and/or exclusively licensed inventions in the U.S. and internationally. In addition, during the development of our product candidates, we may pursue patent protection to potentially enhance commercial success, such as method of use, formulation, treatment regimens, methods of making, synthetic intermediates, polymorphs, or other patent claims. We also rely on trade secrets relating to our discovery programs and product
 
12




candidates, and seek to protect and maintain the confidentiality of proprietary information to protect aspects of our business that are not amenable to, or that we do not consider appropriate for, patent protection.
 
The patent positions of biotechnology companies like ours are generally uncertain and involve complex legal, scientific and factual questions. In addition, the coverage claimed in a patent application can be significantly reduced before the patent is issued, and its scope can be reinterpreted after issuance. Consequently, we may not obtain or maintain adequate patent protection for any of our product candidates. We cannot predict whether the patent applications we are currently pursuing will issue as patents in any particular jurisdiction or whether the claims of any issued patents will provide sufficient protection from competitors. Any patents that we hold may be challenged, circumvented or invalidated by third parties.
 
Our patent portfolio includes patents and patent applications we exclusively license from or jointly own with Array, exclusive worldwide licenses from Array for all therapeutic indications for new intellectual property developed in our Loxo/Array discovery programs, and Loxo-only owned patents and patent applications directed to formulations and methods of use of larotrectinib.
 
We also solely own patents acquired from Redx Pharma Plc when we purchased its BTK program. This patent portfolio includes issued patents and pending patent applications covering compositions of matter, methods of use, methods of making, and synthetic intermediates. The term of individual patents depends upon the legal term of the patents in the countries in which they are obtained. In most countries in which we file, the patent term is 20 years from the earliest date of filing a non-provisional patent application.
 
Larotrectinibs patent portfolio includes patents and applications exclusively licensed to us by Array for our product candidates on a worldwide basis for all therapeutic indications. Composition of matter patents for larotrectinib are issued in the U.S., Hong Kong, New Zealand, Australia, Chile, Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC), Indonesia, China, Columbia, Costa Rica, Korea, Japan, Russia, Taiwan, Ukraine, the Philippines, and Europe (which have been validated in all member and extension states). The issued U.S. and European patents expire in 2029, not taking into account any applicable extensions for patent office and/or regulatory delay in the relevant jurisdictions. The larotrectinib patent portfolio also includes separate US and foreign patent families directed to treatment regimens for larotrectinib, manufacturing processes for making larotrectinib, crystalline forms of larotrectinib, and pharmaceutical formulations of larotrectinib, which will expire in the range of 2035 to 2037, not taking into account any applicable extensions for patent office and/or regulatory delay in the relevant jurisdictions.
 
We have licensed from Array three other patent families that cover our next-generation selective TRK inhibitor program, including one patent family covering LOXO-195; some of the next-generation TRK inhibitors have activity against various mechanisms of acquired resistance to TRK inhibition, including LOXO-195. We have issued patents in Australia, the EPO (validated in all member states and extension states), Chile, China, Columbia, Hong Kong, Japan, Mexico, New Zealand, Philippines, Russia, Taiwan, Ukraine, and the U.S. providing composition of matter and method of use coverage for LOXO-195, with allowed cases in Korea and the GCC. The issued patents expire in 2031, not taking into account any applicable extensions for patent office and/or regulatory delay in the relevant jurisdiction. The LOXO-195 patent portfolio also includes pending U.S. and foreign applications related to methods of use for LOXO-195, manufacturing processes for making LOXO-195, crystalline forms of LOXO-195, and pharmaceutical formulations of LOXO-195, which will expire in the range of 2036 to 2038, not taking into account any applicable extensions for patent office and/or regulatory delay in the relevant jurisdictions.
 
In addition to the TRK inhibitor programs, we have pending patent applications directed to compositions of matter, methods of use, methods of making, and synthetic intermediates for our RET inhibitors, including LOXO-292, BTK inhibitors, including LOXO-305, and FGFR inhibitors programs. With respect to our RET inhibitors program, we have eight families of applications pending in the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions with terms ranging from 2036 to 2039, not taking into account any other term extensions that might be available for patent office and/or regulatory delay in the relevant jurisdiction. The BTK inhibitors program includes three families of applications pending in the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions with terms ranging from 2035 to 2036, not taking into account other term extensions that might be available for patent office and/or regulatory delay in the relevant jurisdiction. Finally, for the FGFR inhibitors program, we have pending applications in the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions with a term of 2035, not taking into account other term extensions that might be available for patent office and/or regulatory delay in the relevant jurisdiction.
 
In the U.S., the term of a patent that covers an FDA-approved drug may also be eligible for patent term extension, which permits patent term restoration as compensation for the patent term lost during FDA regulatory review process. The Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984 (the Hatch-Waxman Act) permits a patent term extension of up to five years beyond the expiration of the patent. The length of the patent term extension is related to the length of time the drug is under regulatory review. Patent term extension cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the date of product approval and only one patent applicable to an approved drug may be extended. Similar provisions are available in Europe and other foreign jurisdictions to extend the term of a patent that covers an approved drug. In the future, if and when our products receive FDA approval, we expect to apply for patent term extensions on patents covering those products. We plan to seek patent term extensions to any of our issued patents in any jurisdiction where these are available, however there is no guarantee that the applicable authorities, including FDA in the U.S., will agree with our assessment of whether such extensions should be granted, and if granted, the length of such extensions.
 
We also rely on trade secret protection for our confidential and proprietary information. Although we take steps to protect our proprietary information and trade secrets, including through contractual means with our employees and consultants, third parties may
 
13




independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information and techniques or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or disclose our technology. Thus, we may not be able to meaningfully protect our trade secrets. It is our policy to require our employees, consultants, outside scientific collaborators, sponsored researchers and other advisors to execute confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of employment or consulting relationships with us. These agreements provide that all confidential information developed or made known to the individual during the course of the individuals relationship with us is to be kept confidential and not disclosed to third parties except in specific circumstances. In the case of employees, the agreements provide that all inventions conceived by the individual shall be our exclusive property. There can be no assurance, however, that these agreements will provide meaningful protection or adequate remedies for our trade secrets in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of such information.
 
Competition
 
Our industry is intensely competitive and subject to rapid and significant technological change. While we believe that our knowledge, experience and scientific resources provide us with competitive advantages, we face substantial competition from major pharmaceutical companies, specialty pharmaceutical companies and biotechnology companies worldwide. Many of our competitors have significantly greater financial, technical and human resources. Smaller and early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. As a result, our competitors may discover, develop, license or commercialize products before or more successfully than we do.
 
We face competition with respect to our current product candidates, and will face competition with respect to future product candidates, from segments of the pharmaceutical, biotechnology and other related markets that pursue targeted approaches to addressing activating molecular alterations in cancer. While there are currently no approved drugs targeting TRK, we are aware of a number of TRK RTK inhibitors, including Daiichi Sankyo and its subsidiary Plexxikon (PLX-7486), Tesaro (TSR-011), Roche (entrectinib), Novartis AG (dovitinib), Mirati (MGDC516), Ono Pharmaceutical (ONO-4474 and ONO-5390556), Chugai Pharmaceutical, a member of the Roche Group (CH7057288), Blueprint Medicines, TP Therapeutics (TPX-0005) and Deciphera. In addition, our collaboration partner, Array, has retained rights to development of compounds that target only one of the TRKA, TRKB or TRKC kinases, which if developed by Array or a licensee could be competitively significant. If larotrectinib or our future product candidates do not offer sustainable advantages over competing products, we may not be able to successfully compete against current and future competitors.
 
There are no selective RET inhibitors approved in RET-specific indications. Several multikinase inhibitors with anti-RET activity are part of ongoing RET-focused development programs: Eisai (lenvatinib), Exelixis (cabozantinib), AstraZeneca (vandetanib), Ariad (ponatinib), Novartis (dovitinib), Roche (alectinib), Pfizer (sunitinib) and Roche (RXDX-105). A compound from Blueprint Medicines (BLU-667) was developed to be a selective RET inhibitor and is currently in clinical development and there are preclinical selective RET inhibitor programs from Taiho Oncology, Nerviano Medical Sciences, and Cancer Research UK.
 
For LOXO-305, there are several covalent inhibitors that inhibit BTK, such as those from Abbvie/Pharmacyclics (ibrutinib), AstraZeneca/Acerta (acalabrutinib), Beigene (BGB-3111), Celgene (CC-292), Principia (PRN1008, PRN2246), and Gilead/Ono (GS-4059). They could be competitive if the LOXO-305 development program extends beyond the acquired resistance application. There are also inhibitors with reversible binding modes like LOXO-305, like those from ArQule (ARQ-531), Sunesis (SNS-062), Biogen (BIIB-068), Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMS-986142), Genentech (GDC-0853), Roche (RN983) and Impetis (PNQ-154). Lastly, drugs that work by different mechanisms, other than BTK inhibition, are available or could be developed in patient populations relevant to LOXO-305these include classes such as BCL-2 inhibitors (e.g. Roche/Abbvie, venetoclax), anti-CD20 biologics (e.g. Roche, rituximab), PI3Kd inhibitors (e.g. Gilead, idelalisib) and cytotoxic chemotherapy.
 
While there are no approved selective FGFR inhibitors, we are aware of the following compounds with ongoing FGFR-focused programs: J&J (JNJ-42756493), QED Therapeutics (BGJ-398, dovitinib), AstraZeneca (AZD4547), Clovis Oncology (lucitinib), Chugai (CH5183284), Bayer (BAY 1163877, BAY 1179470), Lilly (LY2874455), Eisai (E7090), Taiho (TAS-120), BI (nintedanib), Ariad (ponatinib), FivePrime (FP-1039, FPA144), Incyte (INCB54828), ArQule (ARQ087), BioClinica (MFGR1877S) and Principia (PRN1371).
 
Our competitors may obtain regulatory approval of their products more rapidly than us or may obtain patent protection or other intellectual property rights that limit our ability to develop or commercialize our product candidates. Our competitors may also develop drugs that are more effective, more convenient, more widely used and less costly or have a better safety profile than our products and these competitors may also be more successful than us in manufacturing and marketing their products. In addition, we will need to develop our product candidates in collaboration with diagnostic companies, and we will face competition from other companies in establishing these collaborations. Our competitors will also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific, management and commercial personnel, establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs.
 
Furthermore, we also face competition more broadly across the market for cost-effective and reimbursable cancer treatments. The most common methods of treating patients with cancer are surgery, radiation and drug therapy, including chemotherapy, hormone therapy and targeted drug therapy or a combination of such methods. There are a variety of available drug therapies marketed for cancer. In many cases, these drugs are administered in combination to enhance efficacy. While our product candidates, if any are approved, may compete with these existing drug and other therapies, to the extent they are ultimately used in combination with or as an adjunct to these therapies, our product candidates may not be competitive with them. Some of these drugs are branded and subject to patent protection,
 
14




and others are available on a generic basis. Insurers and other third-party payers may also encourage the use of generic products or specific branded products. We expect that if our product candidates are approved, they will be priced at a significant premium over competitive generic, including branded generic, products. As a result, obtaining market acceptance of, and gaining significant share of the market for, any of our product candidates that we successfully introduce to the market will pose challenges. In addition, many companies are developing new therapeutics, and we cannot predict what the standard of care will be as our product candidates progress through clinical development.
 
The acquisition or licensing of pharmaceutical products is also very competitive. If we seek to acquire or license products, we will face substantial competition from a number of more established companies, some of which have acknowledged strategies to license or acquire products and many of which are bigger than us and have more institutional experience and greater cash flows than we have. These more established companies may have competitive advantages over us, as may other emerging companies taking similar or different approaches to product licenses and/or acquisitions. In addition, a number of established research-based pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies may acquire products in late stages of development to augment their internal product lines, which may provide those companies with an even greater competitive advantage.
 
Government Regulation
 
FDA Approval Process
 
In the U.S., pharmaceutical products are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and other federal and state statutes and regulations govern, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, storage, recordkeeping, approval, labeling, promotion and marketing, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, sampling and import and export of pharmaceutical products. Failure to comply with applicable U.S. requirements may subject a company to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as FDA refusal to approve pending NDAs, warning or untitled letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, civil penalties and criminal prosecution.
 
Pharmaceutical product development for a new product or certain changes to an approved product in the U.S. typically involves preclinical laboratory and animal tests, the submission to the FDA of an IND, which must become effective before clinical testing may commence, and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to establish the safety and effectiveness of the drug for each indication for which FDA approval is sought. Satisfaction of FDA pre-market approval requirements typically takes many years and the actual time required may vary substantially based upon the type, complexity and novelty of the product or disease.
 
Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry, formulation and toxicity, as well as animal trials to assess the characteristics and potential safety and efficacy of the product. The conduct of the preclinical tests must comply with federal regulations and requirements, including good laboratory practices. The results of preclinical testing are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND along with other information, including information about product chemistry, manufacturing and controls, and a proposed clinical trial protocol. Long-term preclinical tests, such as animal tests of reproductive toxicity and carcinogenicity, may continue after the IND is submitted.
 
A 30-day waiting period after the submission of each IND is required prior to the commencement of clinical testing in humans. If the FDA has neither commented on nor questioned the IND within this 30-day period, the clinical trial proposed in the IND may begin.
 
Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational new drug to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of a qualified investigator. Clinical trials must be conducted: (i) in compliance with federal regulations; (ii) in compliance with good clinical practices (GCPs), an international standard meant to protect the rights and health of patients and to define the roles of clinical trial sponsors, administrators and monitors; as well as (iii) under protocols detailing the objectives of the trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. Each protocol involving testing on U.S. patients and subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to FDA as part of the IND.
 
The FDA may order the temporary, or permanent, discontinuation of a clinical trial at any time, or impose other sanctions, if it believes that the clinical trial either is not being conducted in accordance with FDA requirements or presents an unacceptable risk to the clinical trial patients. The study protocol and informed consent information for patients in clinical trials must also be submitted to an institutional review board (IRB) for approval. An IRB may also require the clinical trial at the site to be halted, either temporarily or permanently, for failure to comply with the IRBs requirements, or may impose other conditions.
 
Clinical trials to support NDAs for marketing approval are typically conducted in three sequential phases, but the phases may overlap. In Phase 1, the initial introduction of the drug into healthy human subjects or patients, the drug is tested to assess metabolism, pharmacokinetics, pharmacological actions, side effects associated with increasing doses, and, if possible, early evidence of effectiveness. Phase 2 usually involves trials in a limited patient population to determine the effectiveness of the drug for a particular indication, dosage tolerance and optimum dosage, and to identify common adverse effects and safety risks. If a compound demonstrates evidence of effectiveness and an acceptable safety profile in Phase 2 evaluations, Phase 3 trials are undertaken to obtain the additional information about clinical efficacy and safety in a larger number of patients, typically at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites, to permit the FDA to evaluate the overall benefit-risk relationship of the drug and to provide adequate information for the labeling of the
 
15




drug. In most cases the FDA requires two adequate and well-controlled Phase 3 clinical trials to demonstrate the efficacy of the drug. A single Phase 3 or Phase 2 trial with other confirmatory evidence may be sufficient in rare instances where the study is a large multicenter trial demonstrating internal consistency and a statistically very persuasive finding of a clinically meaningful effect on mortality, irreversible morbidity or prevention of a disease with a potentially serious outcome and confirmation of the result in a second trial would be practically or ethically impossible.
 
Pursuant to the 21st Century Cures Act, which was enacted on December 13, 2016, the manufacturer of an investigational drug for a serious or life-threatening disease is required to make available, such as by posting on its website, its policy on evaluating and responding to requests for expanded access. This requirement applies on the later of 60 days after the date of enactment or the first initiation of a Phase 2 or Phase 3 trial of the investigational drug.
 
After completion of the required clinical testing, an NDA is prepared and submitted to the FDA. FDA approval of the NDA is required before marketing of the product may begin in the U.S. The NDA must include the results of all preclinical, clinical and other testing and a compilation of data relating to the products pharmacology, chemistry, manufacture and controls. The cost of preparing and submitting an NDA is substantial. The submission of most NDAs is additionally subject to a substantial application user fee, currently exceeding $2,421,000 for fiscal year 2018, and the manufacturer and/or sponsor under an approved new drug application are also subject to annual program fees, currently exceeding $304,000 per program for fiscal year 2018.
 
The FDA has 60 days from its receipt of an NDA to determine whether the application will be accepted for filing based on the agencys threshold determination that it is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review. The FDA has agreed to certain performance goals in the review of new drug applications to encourage timeliness. Applications under standard review are to be reviewed within ten months. Applications under priority review are to be reviewed within 6 months. Priority review can be applied to drugs that the FDA determines offer major advances in treatment, or provide a treatment where no adequate therapy exists. The review process for both standard and priority review may be extended by the FDA for three additional months to consider certain late-submitted information, or information intended to clarify information already provided in the submission.
 
The FDA may also refer applications for novel drug products, or drug products that present difficult questions of safety or efficacy, to an outside advisory committeetypically a panel that includes clinicians and other expertsfor review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, but it generally follows such recommendations.
 
Before approving an NDA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCPs. Additionally, the FDA will inspect the facility or the facilities at which the drug is manufactured. The FDA will not approve the product unless compliance with current good manufacturing practices (cGMPsa quality system regulating manufacturing) is satisfactory and the NDA contains data that provide substantial evidence that the drug is safe and effective in the indication studied.
 
After the FDA evaluates the NDA and the manufacturing facilities, it issues either an approval letter or a complete response letter. A complete response letter generally outlines the deficiencies in the submission and may require substantial additional testing, or information, in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. If, or when, those deficiencies have been addressed to the FDAs satisfaction in a resubmission of the NDA, the FDA will issue an approval letter. The FDA has committed to reviewing such resubmissions in two or six months depending on the type of information included.
 
An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications. As a condition of NDA approval, the FDA may require a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy (REMS) to help ensure that the benefits of the drug outweigh the potential risks. REMS can include medication guides, communication plans for healthcare professionals, and elements to assure safe use (ETASU). ETASU can include, but are not limited to, special training or certification for prescribing or dispensing, dispensing only under certain circumstances, special monitoring and the use of patient registries. The requirement for a REMS can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the drug. Moreover, product approval may require substantial post-approval testing and surveillance to monitor the drugs safety or efficacy. Once granted, product approvals may be withdrawn if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or problems are identified following initial marketing.
 
Changes to some of the conditions established in an approved application, including changes in indications, labeling, or manufacturing processes or facilities, require submission and FDA approval of a new NDA or NDA supplement before the change can be implemented. An NDA supplement for a new indication typically requires clinical data similar to that in the original application, and the FDA uses the same procedures and actions in reviewing NDA supplements as it does in reviewing NDAs.
 
Fast Track Designation and Accelerated Approval
 
The FDA is required to facilitate the development, and expedite the review, of drugs that are intended for the treatment of a serious or life-threatening disease or condition for which there is no effective treatment and which demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the condition. Under the Fast Track program, the sponsor of a new drug candidate may request that the FDA designate the drug candidate for a specific indication as a Fast Track drug concurrent with, or after, the filing of the IND for the drug
 
16




candidate. The FDA must determine if the drug candidate qualifies for Fast Track Designation within 60 days of receipt of the sponsors request.
 
Under the Fast Track program and the FDAs Accelerated Approval regulations, the FDA may approve a drug for a serious or life-threatening illness that provides meaningful therapeutic benefit to patients over existing treatments based upon a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments.
 
In clinical trials, a surrogate endpoint is a measurement of laboratory or clinical signs of a disease or condition that substitutes for a direct measurement of how a patient feels, functions, or survives. Surrogate endpoints can often be measured more easily or more rapidly than clinical endpoints. A drug candidate approved on this basis is subject to rigorous post-marketing compliance requirements, including the completion of post-approval clinical trials, often referred to as Phase 4 trials, to confirm the effect on the clinical endpoint. Failure to conduct required post-approval studies, or confirm a clinical benefit during post-marketing studies, will allow the FDA to withdraw the drug from the market on an expedited basis. All promotional materials for drug candidates approved under accelerated regulations are subject to priority review by the FDA.
 
If a submission is granted Fast Track Designation, the sponsor may engage in more frequent interactions with the FDA, and the FDA may review sections of the NDA before the application is complete. This rolling review is available if the applicant provides, and the FDA approves, a schedule for the submission of the remaining information and the applicant pays applicable user fees. However, the FDAs time period goal for reviewing an application does not begin until the last section of the NDA is submitted. Additionally, Fast Track Designation may be withdrawn by the FDA if the FDA believes that the designation is no longer supported by data emerging in the clinical trial process.
 
Breakthrough Therapy Designation
 
The FDA is also required to expedite the development and review of the application for approval of drugs that are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition where preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints. Under the Breakthrough Therapy program, the sponsor of a new drug candidate may request that the FDA designate the drug candidate for a specific indication as a breakthrough therapy concurrent with, or after, the filing of the IND for the drug candidate. The FDA must determine if the drug candidate qualifies for Breakthrough Therapy designation within 60 days of receipt of the sponsors request.
Orphan Drugs
 
Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant Orphan Drug Designation to drugs intended to treat a rare disease or conditiongenerally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the U.S. Orphan Drug designation must be requested before submitting an NDA. After the FDA grants Orphan Drug Designation, the generic identity of the drug and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Orphan Drug Designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process. The first NDA applicant to receive the FDA approval for a particular active ingredient to treat a particular disease with FDA Orphan Drug Designation is entitled to a seven-year exclusive marketing period in the U.S. for that product, for that indication. During the seven-year exclusivity period, the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug for the same disease, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan drug exclusivity. Orphan drug exclusivity does not prevent the FDA from approving a different drug for the same disease or condition, or the same drug for a different disease or condition. Among the other benefits of Orphan Drug Designation are tax credits for certain research and a waiver of the NDA application user fee.
 
Post-Approval Requirements
 
Once an NDA is approved, a product will be subject to certain post-approval requirements. For instance, the FDA closely regulates the post-approval marketing and promotion of drugs, including standards and regulations for direct-to-consumer advertising, off-label promotion, industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities and promotional activities involving the internet. Drugs may be marketed only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved labeling.
 
Adverse event reporting and submission of periodic reports are required following the FDA approval of an NDA. The FDA also may require post-marketing testing, known as Phase 4 testing, REMS, and surveillance to monitor the effects of an approved product, or the FDA may place conditions on an approval that could restrict the distribution or use of the product. In addition, quality control, drug manufacture, packaging and labeling procedures must continue to conform to cGMPs after approval. Drug manufacturers and certain of their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies. Registration with the FDA subjects entities to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA, during which the Agency inspects manufacturing facilities to assess compliance with cGMPs. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the areas of production and quality-control to maintain compliance with cGMPs. Regulatory authorities may withdraw product approvals or request product recalls if a company fails to comply with regulatory standards, if it encounters problems following initial marketing, or if previously unrecognized problems are subsequently discovered.
 
17




Pediatric Information
 
Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act (PREA), NDAs or supplements to NDAs must contain data to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the drug is safe and effective. The FDA may grant full or partial waivers, or deferrals, for submission of data. Unless otherwise required by regulation, PREA does not apply to any drug for an indication for which orphan designation has been granted.
 
The Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act (BPCA), provides NDA holders a six-month extension of any exclusivitypatent or non-patentfor a drug if certain conditions are met. Conditions for exclusivity include the FDAs determination that information relating to the use of a new drug in the pediatric population may produce health benefits in that population, the FDA making a written request for pediatric studies, and the applicant agreeing to perform, and reporting on, the requested studies within the statutory timeframe. Applications under the BPCA are treated as priority applications, with all of the benefits that designation confers.
 
FDA Regulation of Companion Diagnostics
 
Our drug products may rely upon in vitro companion diagnostics for use in selecting the patients that we believe will respond to our cancer therapeutics. If an in vitro diagnostic is essential to the safe and effective use of the therapeutic product, then the FDA generally will either require approval or clearance of the diagnostic at the same time that FDA approves the therapeutic product, or as a post-marketing commitment at the time of the therapeutic products approval. Companion diagnostics may have both regulatory and commercial importance for our cancer therapies.
 
Pursuing FDA approval of an in vitro companion diagnostic would require us or our partners to obtain a pre-market approval (PMA) for that diagnostic. Based on a final FDA guidance document, and the FDAs past treatment of companion diagnostics, we believe that the FDA will require PMA approval of one or more in vitro companion diagnostics to identify patient populations suitable for our cancer therapies. The review of these in vitro companion diagnostics involves coordination of review by the FDAs Center for Drug Evaluation and Research and by the FDAs Center for Devices and Radiological Health. Approval of a companion diagnostic may be required at the time of new drug approval, or as a post-marketing commitment post-approval.
 
The PMA process, including the gathering of clinical and nonclinical data and the submission to and review by the FDA, can take several years or longer. It involves a rigorous premarket review during which the applicant must prepare and provide the FDA with reasonable assurance of the devices safety and effectiveness and information about the device and its components regarding, among other things, device design, manufacturing and labeling. PMA applications are subject to an application fee, which exceeds $310,000 for most PMAs for fiscal year 2018. In addition, PMAs for devices must generally include the results from extensive preclinical and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to establish the safety and effectiveness of the device for each indication for which FDA approval is sought. In particular, for a diagnostic, the applicant must demonstrate that the diagnostic produces reproducible results when the same sample is tested multiple times by multiple users at multiple laboratories. As part of the PMA review, the FDA will typically inspect the manufacturers facilities for compliance with the Quality System Regulation (QSR), which imposes elaborate testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance requirements.
 
PMA approval is not guaranteed, and the FDA may ultimately respond to a PMA submission with a not approvable determination based on deficiencies in the application and require additional clinical trial or other data that may be expensive and time-consuming to generate and that can substantially delay or prevent approval. If the FDAs evaluation of the PMA application is favorable, the FDA typically issues an approvable letter requiring the applicants agreement to specific conditions, such as changes in labeling, or specific additional information, such as submission of final labeling, in order to secure final approval of the PMA. If the FDA concludes that the applicable criteria have been met, the FDA will issue a PMA for the approved indications, which can be more limited than those originally sought by the applicant. The PMA can include post-approval conditions that the FDA believes necessary to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the device, including, among other things, restrictions on labeling, promotion, sale and distribution.
 
After a device is placed on the market, it remains subject to significant regulatory requirements. Medical devices may be marketed only for the uses and indications for which they are cleared or approved. Device manufacturers must also establish registration and device listings with the FDA. A medical device manufacturers manufacturing processes and those of its suppliers are required to comply with the applicable portions of the QSR, which cover the methods and documentation of the design, testing, production, processes, controls, quality assurance, labeling, packaging and shipping of medical devices. Domestic facility records and manufacturing processes are subject to periodic unscheduled inspections by the FDA. The FDA also may inspect foreign facilities that export products to the U.S.
 
Failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements can result in enforcement action by the FDA, which may include any of the following sanctions: warning letters, fines, injunctions, civil or criminal penalties, recall or seizure of current or future products, operating restrictions, partial suspension or total shutdown of production, denial of submissions for new products, or withdrawal of PMA approvals. Since we may not be the primary developers of the PMA product, our ability to ensure compliance with relevant regulatory requirements may be limited, even though our drug products depend on the successful development, commercialization and regulatory compliance of the product.
 
18




Disclosure of Clinical Trial Information
 
Sponsors of clinical trials of FDA regulated products, including drugs, are required to register and disclose certain clinical trial information. Information related to the product, patient population, phase of investigation, study sites and investigators, and other aspects of the clinical trial is then made public as part of the registration. Sponsors are also obligated to discuss the results of their clinical trials after completion. Sponsors may also elect to provide interim disclosures of results for reasons such as the education of relevant stakeholders and accelerating clinical trial enrollment. Forums for such disclosures include, but are not limited to, scientific conferences, medical journals and press releases. Disclosure of the results of these trials can be delayed in certain circumstances for up to two years after the date of completion of the trial. Competitors may use this publicly available information to gain knowledge regarding the progress of development programs.
 
Review and Approval of Drug Products in the European Union
 
In order to market any product outside of the United States, a company must also comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements of other countries and jurisdictions regarding quality, safety and efficacy and governing, among other things, clinical trials, marketing authorization, commercial sales and distribution of products. Whether or not it obtains FDA approval for a product, the company would need to obtain the necessary approvals by the comparable foreign regulatory authorities before it can commence clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries or jurisdictions. The approval process ultimately varies between countries and jurisdictions and can involve additional product testing and additional administrative review periods. The time required to obtain approval in other countries and jurisdictions might differ from and be longer than that required to obtain FDA approval. Regulatory approval in one country or jurisdiction does not ensure regulatory approval in another, but a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one country or jurisdiction may negatively impact the regulatory process in others.
 
Procedures Governing Approval of Drug Products in the European Union
 
Pursuant to the European Clinical Trials Directive, a system for the approval of clinical trials in the E.U. has been implemented through national legislation of the member states. Under this system, an applicant must obtain approval from the competent national authority of an E.U. member state in which the clinical trial is to be conducted. Furthermore, the applicant may only start a clinical trial after a competent ethics committee has issued a favorable opinion. A clinical trial application (CTA) must be accompanied by an investigational medicinal product dossier (IMPD) with supporting information prescribed by the European Clinical Trials Directive and corresponding national laws of the member states and further detailed in applicable guidance documents.
 
To obtain marketing approval of a product under E.U. regulatory systems, an applicant must submit an MAA either under a centralized or decentralized procedure. The centralized procedure provides for the grant of a single marketing authorization by the European Commission that is valid for all E.U. member states. The centralized procedure is compulsory for specific products, including for medicines produced by certain biotechnological processes, products designated as orphan medicinal products, advanced therapy products and products with a new active substance indicated for the treatment of certain diseases. For products with a new active substance indicated for the treatment of other diseases and products that are highly innovative or for which a centralized process is in the interest of patients, the centralized procedure may be optional.
 
Under the centralized procedure, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP), established at the European Medicines Agency (EMA) is responsible for conducting the initial assessment of a product. The CHMP is also responsible for several post-authorization and maintenance activities, such as the assessment of modifications or extensions to an existing marketing authorization. Under the centralized procedure in the E.U., the maximum timeframe for the evaluation of an MAA is 210 days, excluding clock stops, when additional information or written or oral explanation is to be provided by the applicant in response to questions of the CHMP. Accelerated evaluation might be granted by the CHMP in exceptional cases, when a medicinal product is of major interest from the point of view of public health and in particular from the viewpoint of therapeutic innovation. In this circumstance, the EMA ensures that the opinion of the CHMP is given within 150 days.
 
The decentralized procedure is available to applicants who wish to market a product in various E.U. member states where such product has not received marketing approval in any E.U. member states before. The decentralized procedure provides for approval by one or more other, or concerned, member states of an assessment of an application performed by one member state designated by the applicant, known as the reference member state. Under this procedure, an applicant submits an application based on identical dossiers and related materials, including a draft summary of product characteristics, and draft labeling and package leaflet, to the reference member state and concerned member states. The reference member state prepares a draft assessment report and drafts of the related materials within 210 days after receipt of a valid application. Within 90 days of receiving the reference member states assessment report and related materials, each concerned member state must decide whether to approve the assessment report and related materials.
 
If a member state cannot approve the assessment report and related materials on the grounds of potential serious risk to public health, the disputed points are subject to a dispute resolution mechanism and may eventually be referred to the European Commission, whose decision is binding on all member states.
 
19




Within this framework, manufacturers may seek approval of hybrid medicinal products under Article 10(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC. Hybrid applications rely, in part, on information and data from a reference product and new data from appropriate preclinical tests and clinical trials. Such applications are necessary when the proposed product does not meet the strict definition of a generic medicinal product, or bioavailability studies cannot be used to demonstrate bioequivalence, or there are changes in the active substance(s), therapeutic indications, strength, pharmaceutical form or route of administration of the generic product compared to the reference medicinal product. In such cases the results of tests and trials must be consistent with the data content standards required in the Annex to the Directive 2001/83/EC, as amended by Directive 2003/63/EC.
 
Hybrid medicinal product applications have automatic access to the centralized procedure when the reference product was authorized for marketing via that procedure. Where the reference product was authorized via the decentralized procedure, a hybrid application may be accepted for consideration under the centralized procedure if the applicant shows that the medicinal product constitutes a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation, or the granting of a community authorization for the medicinal product is in the interest of patients at the community level.
 
Clinical Trial Approval in the European Union
 
Requirements for the conduct of clinical trials in the E.U. including GCP are set forth in the Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC and the GCP Directive 2005/28/EC. Pursuant to Directive 2001/20/EC and Directive 2005/28/EC, as amended, a system for the approval of clinical trials in the E.U. has been implemented through national legislation of the E.U. member states. Under this system, approval must be obtained from the competent national authority of each E.U. member state in which a study is planned to be conducted. To this end, a CTA is submitted, which must be supported by an IMPD and further supporting information prescribed by Directive 2001/20/EC and Directive 2005/28/EC and other applicable guidance documents. Furthermore, a clinical trial may only be started after a competent ethics committee has issued a favorable opinion on the CTA in that country.
 
In April 2014, the E.U. passed the new Clinical Trials Regulation, (EU) No 536/2014, which will replace the current Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC. To ensure that the rules for clinical trials are identical throughout the E.U., the new E.U. clinical trials legislation was passed as a regulation that is directly applicable in all E.U. member states. All clinical trials performed in the E.U. are required to be conducted in accordance with the Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC until the new Clinical Trials Regulation (EU) No 536/2014 becomes applicable. According to the current plans of the EMA, the new Clinical Trials Regulation will become applicable in 2019. The Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC will, however, still apply three years from the date of entry into application of the Clinical Trials Regulation to (i) clinical trials applications submitted before the entry into application and (ii) clinical trials applications submitted within one year after the entry into application if the sponsor opts for old system.
 
The new Clinical Trials Regulation aims to simplify and streamline the approval of clinical trial in the E.U. The main characteristics of the regulation include: a streamlined application procedure via a single entry point, the E.U. portal; a single set of documents to be prepared and submitted for the application as well as simplified reporting procedures that will spare sponsors from submitting broadly identical information separately to various bodies and different member states; a harmonized procedure for the assessment of applications for clinical trials, which is divided in two parts (Part I is assessed jointly by all member states concerned, and Part II is assessed separately by each member state concerned); strictly defined deadlines for the assessment of CTAs; and the involvement of the ethics committees in the assessment procedure in accordance with the national law of the member state concerned but within the overall timelines defined by the Clinical Trials Regulation.
 
Periods of Authorization and Renewals
 
Marketing authorization is valid for five years in principle and the marketing authorization may be renewed after five years on the basis of a re-evaluation of the risk-benefit balance by the EMA or by the competent authority of the authorizing member state. To this end, the marketing authorization holder must provide the EMA or the competent authority with a consolidated version of the file in respect of quality, safety and efficacy, including all variations introduced since the marketing authorization was granted, at least six months before the marketing authorization ceases to be valid. Once renewed, the marketing authorization is valid for an unlimited period, unless the European Commission or the competent authority decides, on justified grounds relating to pharmacovigilance, to proceed with one additional five-year renewal. Any authorization which is not followed by the actual placing of the drug on the E.U. market (in case of centralized procedure) or on the market of the authorizing member state within three years after authorization ceases to be valid (the so-called sunset clause).
 
Data and Market Exclusivity in the European Union
 
In the E.U., new chemical entities qualify for eight years of data exclusivity upon marketing authorization and an additional two years of market exclusivity. This data exclusivity, if granted, prevents regulatory authorities in the E.U. from referencing the innovators data to assess a generic (abbreviated) application for eight years, after which generic marketing authorization can be submitted, and the innovators data may be referenced, but not approved for two years. The overall ten-year period will be extended to a maximum of eleven years if, during the first eight years of those ten years, the marketing authorization holder obtains an authorization for one or more new therapeutic indications which, during the scientific evaluation prior to their authorization, are held to bring a significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies. Even if a compound is considered to be a new chemical entity and the
 
20




sponsor is able to gain the prescribed period of data exclusivity, another company nevertheless could also market another version of the product if such company can complete a full MAA with a complete database of pharmaceutical test, preclinical tests and clinical trials and obtain marketing approval of its product.
 
Orphan Drug Designation and Exclusivity in the European Union
 
Regulation 141/2000 provides that a drug shall be designated as an orphan drug if its sponsor can establish: that the product is intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of a life-threatening or chronically debilitating condition affecting not more than five in ten thousand persons in the European Community when the application is made, or that the product is intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of a life-threatening, seriously debilitating or serious and chronic condition in the European Community and that without incentives it is unlikely that the marketing of the drug in the European Community would generate sufficient return to justify the necessary investment. For either of these conditions, the applicant must demonstrate that there exists no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention or treatment of the condition in question that has been authorized in the European Community or, if such method exists, the drug will be of significant benefit to those affected by that condition.
 
Regulation 847/2000 sets out criteria and procedures governing designation of orphan drugs in the E.U. Specifically, an application for designation as an orphan product can be made any time prior to the filing of an application for approval to market the product. Marketing authorization for an orphan drug leads to a ten-year period of market exclusivity. This period may, however, be reduced to six years if, at the end of the fifth year, it is established that the product no longer meets the criteria for orphan drug designation, for example because the product is sufficiently profitable not to justify market exclusivity. Market exclusivity can be revoked only in very selected cases, such as consent from the marketing authorization holder, inability to supply sufficient quantities of the product, demonstration of clinically relevant superiority by a similar medicinal product, or, after a review by the Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products, requested by a member state in the fifth year of the marketing exclusivity period (if the designation criteria are believed to no longer apply). Medicinal products designated as orphan drugs pursuant to Regulation 141/2000 shall be eligible for incentives made available by the European Community and by the member states to support research into, and the development and availability of, orphan drugs.
 
Regulatory Requirements After Marketing Authorization in the European Union
 
As in the United States, both marketing authorization holders and manufacturers of medicinal products are subject to comprehensive regulatory oversight by the EMA and the competent authorities of the individual E.U. Member States both before and after grant of the manufacturing and marketing authorizations. The holder of an E.U. marketing authorization for a medicinal product must, for example, comply with E.U. pharmacovigilance legislation and its related regulations and guidelines which entail many requirements for conducting pharmacovigilance, or the assessment and monitoring of the safety of medicinal products. The manufacturing process for medicinal products in the E.U. is also highly regulated and regulators may shut down manufacturing facilities that they believe do not comply with regulations. Manufacturing requires a manufacturing authorization, and the manufacturing authorization holder must comply with various requirements set out in the applicable E.U. laws, including compliance with E.U. cGMP standards when manufacturing medicinal products and active pharmaceutical ingredients.
 
In the E.U., the advertising and promotion of approved products are subject to E.U. Member States laws governing promotion of medicinal products, interactions with clinicians, misleading and comparative advertising and unfair commercial practices. In addition, other legislation adopted by individual E.U. Member States may apply to the advertising and promotion of medicinal products. These laws require that promotional materials and advertising in relation to medicinal products comply with the products Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC), as approved by the competent authorities. Promotion of a medicinal product that does not comply with the SmPC is considered to constitute off-label promotion, which is prohibited in the European Union.
 
Brexit and the Regulatory Framework in the United Kingdom
 
On June 23, 2016, the electorate in the United Kingdom, or U.K. voted in favor of leaving the E.U, which is commonly referred to as Brexit. Thereafter, on March 29, 2017, the country formally notified the E.U. of its intention to withdraw pursuant to Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty. The withdrawal of the U.K. from the E.U. will take effect either on the effective date of the withdrawal agreement or, in the absence of agreement, two years after the U.K. provides a notice of withdrawal pursuant to the E.U. Treaty. Since the regulatory framework for pharmaceutical products in the U.K. covering quality, safety and efficacy of pharmaceutical products, clinical trials, marketing authorization, commercial sales and distribution of pharmaceutical products is derived from E.U. directives and regulations, Brexit could materially impact the future regulatory regime which applies to products and the approval of product candidates in the U.K. It remains to be seen how, if at all, Brexit will impact regulatory requirements for product candidates and products in the U.K.
 
Pharmaceutical Coverage, Pricing and Reimbursement
 
Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of products approved by the FDA and other government authorities. Sales of products will depend, in part, on the extent to which third-party payors, including government health programs in the United States such as Medicare and Medicaid, commercial health insurers and managed care organizations, provide coverage, and establish adequate reimbursement levels for, such products. The process for determining whether a payor will provide coverage for a product may be separate from the process for setting the price or reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the
 
21




product once coverage is approved. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged, examining the medical necessity, and reviewing the cost-effectiveness of medical products and services and imposing controls to manage costs. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific products on an approved list, or formulary, which might not include all of the approved products for a particular indication.
 
In order to secure coverage and reimbursement for any product that might be approved for sale, a company may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of the product, in addition to the costs required to obtain FDA or other comparable regulatory approvals. Nonetheless, product candidates may not be considered medically necessary or cost effective. Additionally, a payors decision to provide coverage for a drug product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Further, one payors determination to provide coverage for a drug product does not assure that other payors will also provide coverage for the drug product. Third-party reimbursement may not be sufficient to maintain price levels high enough to realize an appropriate return on investment in product development.
 
The containment of healthcare costs also has become a priority of federal, state and foreign governments and the prices of drugs have been a focus in this effort. Governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products. Adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could further limit a companys revenue generated from the sale of any approved products. Coverage policies and third-party reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which a company or its collaborators receive regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future.
 
Outside the United States, ensuring adequate coverage and payment for our product candidates will face challenges. Pricing of prescription pharmaceuticals is subject to governmental control in many countries. Pricing negotiations with governmental authorities can extend well beyond the receipt of regulatory marketing approval for a product and may require us to conduct a clinical trial that compares the cost effectiveness of our product candidates or products to other available therapies. The conduct of such a clinical trial could be expensive and result in delays in our commercialization efforts.
 
In the E.U., pricing and reimbursement schemes vary widely from country to country. Some countries provide that drug products may be marketed only after a reimbursement price has been agreed. Some countries may require the completion of additional studies that compare the cost-effectiveness of a particular drug candidate to currently available therapies. For example, the E.U. provides options for its member states to restrict the range of drug products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. E.U. member states may approve a specific price for a drug product or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the drug product on the market. Other member states allow companies to fix their own prices for drug products, but monitor and control company profits. The downward pressure on healthcare costs in general, particularly prescription drugs, has become intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products. In addition, in some countries, cross-border imports from low-priced markets exert competitive pressure that may reduce pricing within a country. Any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for drug products may not allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements.
 
Manufacturing
 
We do not have any manufacturing facilities or personnel. We currently rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the manufacture of our product candidates undergoing preclinical and clinical testing, as well as for commercial manufacture if our product candidates receive marketing approval. We have identified, qualified and begun manufacturing with numerous manufacturers to provide active pharmaceutical ingredients, fill-and-finish services and commercial drug supply as our drug products progress through clinical development towards potential regulatory approvals, and future commercialization.
 
We expect to rely on third parties for the manufacture of our companion diagnostics. Depending on the technology solutions we choose, we may rely on multiple third parties to manufacture and sell a single test. For example, we may develop analyte specific reagents with one vendor, rely on another vendor for qualification and assembly in a finished in vitro diagnostic kit and rely on additional third parties for distribution and/or commercialization.
 
Commercialization
 
As programs advance towards potential regulatory approvals and commercialization, we may license our drugs to partners, in certain territories or globally, or build a focused commercial organization ourselves to launch the products, depending on risk-adjusted analyses of value and the larger strategic imperatives of the business
 
For larotrectinib and LOXO-195, in November 2017, we entered into the Bayer Agreement with Bayer as described above, pursuant to which the Company and Bayer will collaborate to develop and commercialize larotrectinib and LOXO-195. Pursuant to the Bayer Agreement, we granted co-exclusive development and commercialization licenses to Bayer for both larotrectinib and LOXO-195. We will lead global development activities and regulatory activities in the U.S. Bayer will lead regulatory activities outside the U.S. and
 
22




global commercial activities. For additional details regarding the Bayer Agreement see AgreementsBayer License, Development and Commercialization Agreement.
 
For LOXO-292, LOXO-305 and future product candidates not subject to a development or commercialization license, subject to receiving marketing approvals, we expect to commence commercialization activities by building a focused sales and marketing organization to sell our products. We believe that such an organization will be able to address the community of oncologists and pathologists who are the key specialists in diagnosing and treating the patient populations for which our product candidates are being developed. Outside the U.S., we plan to strategically evaluate building our own commercial organization, as well as commercial partnership opportunities for any of our product candidates that obtain marketing approval.
 
Employees
 
As of December 31, 2017, we had a total of 59 full-time employees, all located in the U.S. None of our employees is represented by a labor union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We have not experienced any work stoppages, and we consider our relations with our employees to be good. Of the 59 employees, 37 perform research and development activities and 22 serve in general and administrative functions.
