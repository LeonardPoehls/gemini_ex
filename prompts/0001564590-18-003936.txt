Item 1. 
Business
GENERAL
 We are a healthcare services company that through our subsidiaries operates a home health, hospice and community care business, TC hospitals, IRFs, and a contract rehabilitation services business across the United States. We are organized into three operating divisions: the Kindred at Home division, the hospital division, and the Kindred Rehabilitation Services division. At December 31, 2017, our (1) Kindred at Home division primarily provided home health, hospice, and community care services from 608 sites of service in 40 states, (2) hospital division operated 75 TC hospitals (certified as LTAC hospitals under the Medicare program) in 17 states, and (3) Kindred Rehabilitation Services division operated 19 IRFs and 99 hospital-based acute rehabilitation units (“ARUs”) (certified as IRFs), and provided rehabilitation services primarily in hospitals and long-term care settings in 45 states.
 All financial and statistical information presented in this Annual Report on Form 10-K reflects the continuing operations of our businesses for all periods presented unless otherwise indicated. 
  Merger Agreement.  On December 19, 2017, we announced that our Board of Directors (the “Board”) had approved a definitive agreement under which we will be acquired by a consortium of three companies: TPG Capital (“TPG”), Welsh, Carson, Anderson & Stowe (“WCAS”) and Humana Inc. (“Humana”). Subject to the terms and conditions of an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”) among the Company, Kentucky Hospital Holdings, LLC (“HospitalCo Parent”), Kentucky Homecare Holdings, Inc. (“Parent”) and Kentucky Homecare Merger Sub, Inc. (“Merger Sub”), Merger Sub will be merged with and into Kindred (the “Merger”), with Kindred continuing as the surviving company in the Merger (the “Surviving Entity”).
 At the effective time of the Merger, each share of our common stock, par value $0.25 per share (“Common Stock”) issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger (other than shares held by Parent, HospitalCo Parent, Merger Sub or Kindred and their respective wholly owned subsidiaries (which will be cancelled) and shares that are owned by stockholders who have properly exercised and perfected a demand for appraisal rights under Delaware law), will be cancelled and converted into the right to receive $9.00 in cash, without interest (the “Merger Consideration”).
 The Merger Agreement contains customary representations, warranties and covenants for a transaction of this nature. The Merger Agreement also contains customary covenants, including, among others, covenants (i) providing for us and our respective subsidiaries to conduct business in all material respects in the ordinary course and not to take certain actions without Merger Sub’s consent and (ii) for each of the parties to use reasonable best efforts to cause the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement to be consummated. Additionally, the Merger Agreement provides for customary pre-closing covenants, including covenants not to solicit proposals relating to alternative transactions or, subject to certain exceptions, enter into discussions concerning or provide information in connection with alternative transactions, covenants to call and hold a meeting of our stockholders and a covenant to recommend that our stockholders adopt the Merger Agreement, subject to certain exceptions to permit our directors to satisfy their applicable fiduciary duties.
 Consummation of the Merger is subject to various conditions, including, among others, adoption of the Merger Agreement by the requisite vote of our stockholders, the receipt of certain licensure and regulatory approvals, the expiration of the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvement Act of 1976, as amended (this condition was satisfied on February 20, 2018), the consummation of the purchase of the two remaining skilled nursing facilities from Ventas and payment of corresponding expense reimbursements to Ventas (this condition was satisfied on December 21, 2017), the satisfaction of the closing conditions to the Separation Agreement (as defined below) and certain related entity conversions, the absence of any material adverse effect on each of us, our home health, hospice and community care business, and our TC hospitals, IRFs and contract rehabilitation services business, and certain other customary closing conditions.
 The Merger Agreement also contains certain termination rights for us and Merger Sub (including if the Merger is not consummated by August 17, 2018 (the “End Date”)) and provides that upon termination of the Merger Agreement under specified circumstances, including, among others, following a change in recommendation of our Board or our termination of the Merger Agreement to enter into a written definitive agreement for a “superior proposal,” we will be required to pay Merger Sub a termination fee of $29 million and reimburse the documented out-of-pocket expenses of Parent, HospitalCo Parent and certain of their affiliates in connection with the Merger Agreement (the “Parent Expenses”) up to $10 million.
 If the Merger Agreement is submitted to a vote of our stockholders and approval of the Merger Agreement is not obtained, we will be required to reimburse Merger Sub for the amount of the Parent Expenses, up to $7.5 million.
 5

Parent will be required to pay us a reverse termination fee of $61.5 million, and to reimburse certain of our expenses, including the reasonable and documented out-of-pocket expenses we incurred in connection with the implementation of the Separation Transactions (as defined in the Separation Agreement), up to $13.5 million, in the event the Merger Agreement is terminated (i) by us, subject to certain limitations set forth in the Merger Agreement, if (A) there has been a breach of a representation, warranty or covenant of Parent or Merger Sub that would cause the related closing condition to be incapable of being satisfied or cured by the End Date or, if curable, is not cured by Parent or Merger Sub by the earlier of 30 days after receipt of written notice of such breach and the End Date, (B) the conditions to Parent, HospitalCo Parent and Merger Sub’s obligations to consummate the closing have been satisfied (other than those conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied at or immediately prior to the closing, provided that such conditions are then capable of being satisfied at the closing), we have irrevocably confirmed to Parent in writing that we are prepared and able to consummate the closing, and Parent and Merger Sub fail to consummate the Merger by the later of the date the closing should have occurred and three business days following the date of the notice from us described above, or (ii) by us or Parent if the Merger has not occurred by the End Date and at the time of termination all of the conditions to Parent, HospitalCo Parent and Merger Sub’s obligations to consummate the closing have been satisfied (other than those conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied by actions taken at the closing, provided that such conditions are then capable of being satisfied at the closing) other than those relating to obtaining specified licensure and regulatory approvals and/or there being any injunction or other order by a governmental entity charged with jurisdiction over the granting of such approvals.
 In connection with the Merger Agreement, Parent and HospitalCo Parent have obtained equity and debt financing commitments for the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement and the Separation Agreement, the aggregate proceeds of which will be sufficient to consummate the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement and the Separation Agreement on the closing date, including the payment of any amounts required to be paid by Parent pursuant to the Merger Agreement on the closing date, the repayment of our existing indebtedness, and the payment of all fees and expenses reasonably expected to be incurred in connection therewith. Pursuant to equity commitment letters executed and delivered concurrently with the Merger Agreement, subject to the terms and conditions set forth therein, Humana, TPG, WCAS and Port-aux-Choix Private Investments Inc. (“PSP”), have committed to, severally but not jointly, capitalize Parent, and TPG, WCAS and PSP have committed, severally but not jointly, to capitalize HospitalCo Parent, with the aggregate amount of the equity financing. In addition, each of Humana, TPG, WCAS and PSP have provided us limited guarantees, guaranteeing Parent’s obligation to pay the reverse termination fee and certain other reimbursement obligations of the Parent and Merger Sub pursuant to the Merger Agreement.
 Separation Agreement.  Concurrently with the execution and delivery of the Merger Agreement, on December 19, 2017, Kindred, Parent, HospitalCo Parent, and Kentucky Hospital Merger Sub, Inc., entered into a Separation Agreement (the “Separation Agreement”), pursuant to which, promptly following the effective time of the Merger, the Surviving Entity will be separated from our home health, hospice and community care services business and acquired by HospitalCo Parent.
 The Separation Agreement relates to, among other things (i) certain restructuring transactions that are to take place with respect to us and our subsidiaries, (ii) procedures concerning the transfer of certain assets and employees used or employed in our respective businesses and (iii) the allocation of costs and expenses related to the separation of the Surviving Entity from the Homecare Business (as defined in the Separation Agreement). The Separation Agreement requires, among other things, us to take certain actions and expend certain efforts prior to the closing of the Merger in preparation for such separation transactions.
 Ventas Lease Amendment.  Concurrently with the execution and delivery of the Merger Agreement, on December 19, 2017, we and Ventas entered into Amendment No. 2 (the “Ventas Lease Amendment”) to the Second Amended and Restated Master Lease Agreement No. 5 (the “Master Lease Agreement”) pursuant to which, among other things, (i) Ventas agreed that the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement and the Separation Agreement comply with the Master Lease Agreement, subject to the satisfaction of the remaining requirements in the Master Lease Agreement related thereto, including payment to Ventas of a transaction fee equal to 10% of annual base rent under the Master Lease Agreement upon closing of the transactions, (ii) we agreed to pay to Ventas an additional $5 million fee within one business day of the signing of the Merger Agreement in exchange for Ventas’ approval of and agreement not to challenge the transaction structure (this condition was satisfied on December 20, 2017), (iii) we agreed to complete the purchase of the two remaining skilled nursing facilities under the Master Lease Agreement and our former Second Amended and Restated Master Lease No. 2 from Ventas, and pay corresponding expense reimbursements to Ventas, on or before December 31, 2017 (this condition was satisfied on December 21, 2017), and (iv) we agreed to make certain minimum expenditures for the leased facilities remaining under the Master Lease Agreement going forward. 
 Skilled nursing facility business exit.  On June 30, 2017, we entered into a definitive agreement with BM Eagle Holdings, LLC, a joint venture led by affiliates of BlueMountain Capital Management, LLC (“BlueMountain”), under which we agreed to sell our skilled nursing facility business for $700 million in cash (the “SNF Divestiture”). The SNF Divestiture included 89 nursing centers with 11,308 licensed beds and seven assisted living facilities with 380 licensed beds in 18 states. During 2017, we completed the sale of 81 skilled nursing facilities and five assisted living facilities on various dates for total sales proceeds of approximately $664 million. The completion of the remainder of the sales is subject to customary conditions to closing, including the receipt of all licensure, regulatory and other approvals.
 6

Thirty-six of these skilled nursing facilities were previously leased from Ventas (the “Ventas Properties”). We had an option to acquire the real estate of the Ventas Properties for aggregate consideration of $700 million, which we exercised as we closed on the sale of the Ventas Properties in connection with the SNF Divestiture during 2017. On each respective closing date, we paid Ventas the allocable portion of the $700 million purchase price for the Ventas Properties and Ventas conveyed the real estate for the applicable Ventas Property to BlueMountain or its designee. We paid Ventas approximately $647 million for 34 of the Ventas Properties in connection with closings that occurred during 2017. Additionally, as required under the Merger Agreement, we paid Ventas approximately $53 million to purchase the two remaining Ventas Properties that had yet to be sold in the SNF Divestiture at the end of 2017.
In accordance with authoritative guidance for assets held for sale and discontinued operations accounting, the skilled nursing facility business is reported as assets held for sale and was moved to discontinued operations for all periods presented.
 Gentiva Merger. On October 9, 2014, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Gentiva Merger Agreement”) with Gentiva Health Services, Inc. (“Gentiva”), providing for our acquisition of Gentiva. On February 2, 2015, we consummated the acquisition with one of our subsidiaries merging with and into Gentiva (the “Gentiva Merger”), with Gentiva continuing as the surviving company and our wholly owned subsidiary.
 At the effective time of the Gentiva Merger, each share of common stock, par value $0.10 per share, of Gentiva (“Gentiva Common Stock”) issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the Gentiva Merger (other than shares held by us, Gentiva, and any wholly owned subsidiaries (which were cancelled) and shares owned by stockholders who properly exercised and perfected a demand for appraisal rights under Delaware law), including each deferred share unit, were converted into the right to receive (i) $14.50 in cash (the “Gentiva Cash Consideration”), without interest, and (ii) 0.257 of a share of our Common Stock (the “Gentiva Stock Consideration” and, together with the Gentiva Cash Consideration, the “Gentiva Merger Consideration”).
 Centerre Acquisition. On November 11, 2014, we entered into an agreement to acquire Centerre Healthcare Corporation (“Centerre”), a company dedicated to operating IRFs (the “Centerre Acquisition”). On January 1, 2015, we completed the Centerre Acquisition for a purchase price of approximately $195 million in cash. At the time of the Centerre Acquisition, Centerre operated 11 IRFs with 614 beds in partnership with some of the nation’s leading acute care hospital systems. Centerre had two additional hospitals with a total of 90 beds under construction that were opened in 2015, and a pipeline of additional potential hospitals in various stages of development.
  Spin-off from Ventas. On May 1, 1998, Ventas completed the spin-off of its healthcare operations to its stockholders through the distribution of our former common stock. Ventas retained ownership of substantially all of its real property and leases a portion of such real property to us. In anticipation of the spin-off from Ventas we were incorporated on March 27, 1998 as a Delaware corporation.
 
Discontinued Operations 
 We have completed several strategic divestitures to improve our future operating results. For accounting purposes, the operating results of these businesses and the gains, losses or impairments associated with these transactions have been classified as discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations for all periods presented in accordance with the authoritative guidance in effect through December 31, 2014. Effective January 1, 2015, the authoritative guidance modified the requirements for reporting discontinued operations. A disposal is now required to be reported in discontinued operations only if the disposal represents a strategic shift that has (or will have) a major effect on our operations and financial results. In connection with the SNF Divestiture, the results of operations of the skilled nursing facility business, which previously were reported in the nursing center division, and the losses or impairments associated with the SNF Divestiture, have been classified as discontinued operations for all periods presented. In addition, direct overhead and the profits from applicable RehabCare contracts servicing our skilled nursing facility business that were not retained by new operators were moved to discontinued operations for all periods presented. We have reclassified certain retained businesses and expenses previously reported in the nursing center division to other business segments, including hospital-based sub-acute units and a skilled nursing facility to the hospital division and a small therapy business to the Kindred Hospital Rehabilitation Services operating segment for all periods presented. See notes 6 and 7 of the notes to consolidated financial statements.
HEALTHCARE OPERATIONS
 We are organized into three operating divisions: the Kindred at Home division, the hospital division, and the Kindred Rehabilitation Services division. 
 The Kindred at Home division primarily provides home health, hospice, and community care services to patients in a variety of settings, including their homes, nursing centers, and other residential settings. The hospital division operates TC hospitals. The 
 7

Kindred Rehabilitation Services division operates IRFs and ARUs and provides rehabilitation services primarily in hospitals and long-term care settings. 
 Based upon the authoritative guidance for business segments, our operating divisions represent five reportable operating segments, including (1) home health services, (2) hospice services, (3) hospitals, (4) Kindred Hospital Rehabilitation Services, and (5) RehabCare. The home health services and hospice services operating segments are contained within the Kindred at Home division while the Kindred Hospital Rehabilitation Services and RehabCare operating segments are both contained within the Kindred Rehabilitation Services division. 
 KINDRED AT HOME DIVISION
 Our Kindred at Home division primarily provides home health, hospice, and community care services for patients in a variety of settings, including their homes, nursing centers, and other residential settings. Kindred at Home provides services from 608 sites of service in 40 states, making us one of the largest and geographically diversified home health and hospice companies in the United States as of December 31, 2017. 
 Our home health operations offer medical care and other services for patients in their homes or other residential settings. Experienced nurses, therapists, and home health aides work with the patient and his or her family members to maximize the patient’s ability to handle a wide variety of daily activities and to educate the patient regarding medications and management of their medical conditions. Our services include nursing, physical, occupational and speech therapies, and medical social work. 
 Our hospice operations provide family-oriented care designed to meet the spiritual, emotional, and physical needs of terminally ill patients and their families. We provide hospice services in the home or other settings such as nursing centers, assisted living facilities, hospitals, and inpatient hospice units. Working in conjunction with a patient’s attending physician and/or the hospice medical director, our team of hospice professionals develops a plan of care designed to support the patient’s individual needs, which may include pain and symptom management, emotional and spiritual counseling, homemaking, and dietary services. 
 Our community care services include personal care (bathing and grooming), meal preparation, companionship, light housekeeping, shopping, respite care, and transportation. 
 In key markets, we also provide physician services focused on delivering primary and urgent care for patients in home-based settings such as assisted living facilities, independent living facilities, and patients’ homes, as well as care-transition managers to follow patients with specific diagnoses and/or risk factors through the entire care continuum.

 The term “segment adjusted operating income” is defined as earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation, amortization, and total rent reported for each of our operating segments, excluding litigation contingency expense, impairment charges, restructuring charges, transaction costs, and the allocation of support center overhead. A reconciliation of “segment adjusted operating income” to our consolidated results of operations is included in note 10 of the notes to consolidated financial statements. The term “episodes” refers to healthcare services provided to a patient over a base period of 60 days. “Average length of stay” is computed by dividing each facility’s patient days by the number of admissions in the respective period. “Patient days” refers to the total number of days of patient care provided for the periods indicated. “Average daily census” is computed by dividing each facility’s patient days by the number of calendar days in the respective period. Routine capital expenditures include expenditures at existing facilities that generally do not result in the expansion of services.
 Sources of Kindred at Home Division Revenues 
 Kindred at Home division revenues are derived principally from the Medicare and Medicaid programs, private insurers, and private pay patients. Medicare reimburses both home health and hospice services under prospective payment systems, which are subject to numerous qualifications, standards, and adjustments. Medicaid reimburses home health and hospice service providers using a number of state-specific systems. We often negotiate contract rates of reimbursement with private insurers. 
 The following table sets forth the approximate percentages of home health (including community care and home-based physician services) revenues derived from the payor sources indicated: 
 
 
Year ended December 31, | Medicare | | | Medicaid | | Medicare Advantage | Commercial and other | 
------------------------+----------+------+---+----------+------+--------------------+----------------------+--
2017 | | 63.6 | % | | 15.2 | % | 9.5 | % | 11.7 | %

2017 | | 93.8 | % | | 3.6 | % | 2.6 | %
2016 | | 93.7 | | | 3.4 | | 2.9 | 
2015 | | 94.1 | | | 3.6 | | 2.3 | 

 For the year ended December 31, 2017, revenues of the Kindred at Home division totaled approximately $2.6 billion or 42% of our total revenues (before eliminations). For more information regarding the reimbursement of our Kindred at Home division, see “—Governmental Regulation—Kindred at Home Division—Overview of Kindred at Home Division Reimbursement.” 
 Kindred at Home Division Management and Operations 
 At December 31, 2017, the Kindred at Home division was headed by a president, overseeing a chief operating, and clinical, financial, and administrative officers, and a senior vice president of sales. A president for each of the five geographic regions and a sixth president over the community care operations, report to the chief operating officer of the division. In addition, the Kindred at Home division has division-level sales, clinical services, finance, and operations executives. 
 We provide our Kindred at Home division with centralized administrative support in the areas of information systems, regulatory compliance, reimbursement guidance, licensing support as well as legal, finance, accounting, purchasing, marketing, and human resources management. The centralization of these services improves operating efficiencies, promotes standardization of processes, and enables our healthcare professionals to focus on delivering quality care to our patients.
Kindred at Home Division Competition 
 Our Kindred at Home division operates in a highly competitive and significantly fragmented industry. Our competitors include large providers of home health and hospice services, both for-profit and nonprofit and smaller independent local operators. There often are no significant barriers to entry in many of the markets in which our Kindred at Home division operates and new providers of home health and/or hospice services may enter into our current and future markets. Many of our competitors may have greater financial and other resources than we do. 
 Although there is limited, if any, price competition with respect to Medicare and Medicaid patients (since revenues received for services provided to these patients are based generally on fixed rates), there is substantial price competition for private payment patients. We believe our Kindred at Home division competes based upon its reputation for providing quality services, charging competitive prices, and being consistently responsive to the needs of our patients and their families and physicians.
 HOSPITAL DIVISION
 Our hospital division provides long-term acute care services to post-intensive care and medically complex patients through the operation of a national network of 75 TC hospitals with 5,553 licensed beds in 17 states as of December 31, 2017. We operate one of the largest networks of TC hospitals in the United States based upon revenues. Our TC hospitals are certified as LTAC hospitals under the Medicare program. 
 As a result of our commitment to the hospital business, we have developed a comprehensive program of care for post-intensive care and medically complex patients that allows us to deliver high-quality care in a cost-effective manner. A number of our hospitals also provide skilled nursing, sub-acute, and outpatient services. Outpatient services may include diagnostic services, outpatient wound care, rehabilitation therapy, CT scanning, one-day surgery, and laboratory tests. 
 In our TC hospitals, we treat post-intensive care and medically complex patients, including the critically ill, suffering from multiple organ system failures, most commonly of the cardiovascular, pulmonary, kidney, gastro-intestinal, and cutaneous (skin) systems. In particular, we have a core competency in treating patients with cardio-pulmonary disorders, skin and wound conditions, and life-threatening infections. Prior to being admitted to one of our TC hospitals, many of our patients have undergone a major surgical procedure or developed a neurological disorder following head and spinal cord injury, cerebrovascular incident, or metabolic instability. Our expertise lies in the ability to simultaneously deliver comprehensive and coordinated medical interventions directed at all affected organ systems, while maintaining a patient-centered, integrated care plan. Post-intensive care and medically complex patients are characteristically dependent on technology for continued life support, including mechanical ventilation, total parenteral nutrition, respiratory or cardiac monitors, and kidney dialysis machines. 
 Our TC hospital patients generally have conditions that require a high level of monitoring and specialized care, yet may not need all of the services of a traditional intensive care unit. These patients are not clinically appropriate for admission to other post-
 10

acute settings because their severe medical conditions are periodically or chronically unstable. By providing a range of services required for the care of post-intensive care and medically complex patients, we believe that our TC hospitals provide our patients with high quality, cost-effective care. 
 Our TC hospitals employ a comprehensive program of care for their patients that draws upon the talents of interdisciplinary teams, including physician specialists. The teams evaluate patients upon admission to determine treatment programs. Our hospital division has developed specialized treatment programs focused on the needs of post-intensive care and medically complex patients. In addition to traditional medical services, our TC hospital patients receive individualized treatment plans, which may include rehabilitation, skin integrity management, and clinical pharmacology services. Where appropriate, the treatment programs may involve several disciplines, such as pulmonary medicine, infectious disease, and physical medicine.

 The term “licensed beds” refers to the maximum number of beds permitted in a facility under its license regardless of whether the beds are actually available for patient care. “Medicare case mix index” is the sum of the individual patient diagnostic related group weights for the period divided by the sum of the discharges for the same period. “Occupancy %” is computed by dividing average daily census by the number of operational licensed beds, adjusted for the length of time each facility was in operation during each respective period. Routine capital expenditures include expenditures at existing facilities that generally do not result in the expansion of services.

Sources of Hospital Revenues 
 The hospital division receives payment for its services from third party payors, including government reimbursement programs such as Medicare and Medicaid, and nongovernment sources such as Medicare Advantage, Medicaid Managed, commercial insurance companies, health maintenance organizations, preferred provider organizations, and contracted providers. Patients covered by nongovernment payors generally are more profitable to the hospital division than those covered by the Medicare and Medicaid programs. The following table sets forth the approximate percentages of our hospital division revenues, admissions, and patient days derived from the payor sources indicated:

Quality Assessment and Improvement 
 The hospital division maintains a clinical outcomes and customer service program that includes a review of its patient population measured against utilization and quality standards, clinical outcomes data collection, and patient/family, employee, and physician satisfaction surveys. In addition, our hospitals have integrated quality assurance and improvement programs administered by a director of quality management, which encompass quality improvement, infection control, and risk management. The programs seek to ensure that patients are managed appropriately in our hospitals and that quality healthcare is provided in a cost-effective manner. 
 The hospital division has implemented a program whereby internal quality auditors review our TC hospitals for compliance with standards of The Joint Commission (“TJC”). The purposes of this internal review process are to: (1) ensure ongoing compliance with industry-recognized standards for hospitals, (2) assist management in analyzing each hospital’s operations, and (3) provide consulting and educational programs for each hospital to identify opportunities to improve patient care. 
 Hospital Division Management and Operations
 Each of our TC hospitals has a fully credentialed, multi-specialty medical staff to meet the needs of post-intensive care and medically complex patients. Our TC hospitals offer a broad range of physician services including pulmonology, internal medicine, infectious diseases, neurology, nephrology, cardiology, radiology, and pathology. In addition, our TC hospitals have multi-disciplinary teams of healthcare professionals, including a professional nursing staff trained to care for long-term acute patients, respiratory, physical, occupational, and speech therapists, pharmacists, registered dietitians, and social workers, to address the needs of post-intensive care and medically complex patients. 
 Each TC hospital utilizes a pre-admission assessment system to evaluate clinical needs and other information in determining the appropriateness of each potential patient admission. After admission, the TC hospital’s interdisciplinary team reviews each patient’s case to determine a care plan. Typically, and where appropriate, the care plan involves the services of several disciplines, such as pulmonary medicine, infectious disease, and physical medicine. 
 A hospital chief executive officer or administrator supervises and is responsible for the day-to-day operations at each of our hospitals. Each hospital (or network of hospitals) also employs a chief financial or accounting officer who monitors the financial matters of such hospital or network. In addition, each hospital (or network of hospitals) employs a chief clinical officer to oversee the clinical operations and a director of quality management to oversee our quality assurance programs.
 13

We provide centralized administrative services in the areas of information systems, clinical operations, regulatory compliance, reimbursement guidance, state licensing, and Medicare and Medicaid certification and maintenance support, as well as legal, finance, accounting, purchasing, human resources management, and facilities management support to each of our hospitals. We believe that this centralization improves efficiency, promotes the standardization of certain processes, and allows staff in our hospitals to focus more attention on providing quality patient care. 
 A division president, chief operating officer, and a chief financial officer manage the hospital division. The operations of the hospital division are divided into eight operational districts, each headed by a vice president, a divisional vice president or executive director who reports directly to the division’s chief operating officer. The division’s chief medical officer and senior vice president of clinical operations manage clinical issues and quality concerns of the hospital division. The sales and marketing efforts for the division are led by district sales leaders, who in turn report to our hospital division senior vice president of sales and business development. 
 Hospital Division Competition 
 In each geographic market that we serve, there are generally several competitors that provide similar services to those provided by our hospital division. In addition, several of the markets in which the hospital division operates have other LTAC hospitals and healthcare facilities that provide services comparable to those offered by our hospitals. Certain competing hospitals and healthcare facilities are operated by not-for-profit, non-taxpaying, or governmental agencies, which can finance capital expenditures on a tax-exempt basis and receive funds and charitable contributions that are unavailable to our hospital division. 
 Competition for patients covered by nongovernment reimbursement sources is intense. The primary competitive factors in the LTAC hospital business include quality of services, charges for services, and responsiveness to the needs of patients, families, payors, and physicians. The competitive position of any LTAC hospital also is affected by the ability of its management to negotiate contracts with purchasers of, and to receive referrals from, group healthcare services, including managed care companies, preferred provider organizations, and health maintenance organizations. Such organizations attempt to obtain discounts from established charges, as well as to limit their overall expenditures by compressing average lengths of stay. The importance of obtaining contracts with preferred provider organizations, health maintenance organizations, and other organizations that finance healthcare varies from market to market, depending on the number and market strength of such organizations. 
 In addition, certain third parties, known as conveners, offer patient placement and care transition services to managed care companies, Medicare Advantage plans, bundled payment participants, accountable care organizations, and other healthcare providers as part of an effort to manage post acute-care provider (“PAC”) utilization and associated costs. Thus, conveners influence patient decision on which PAC setting to choose, as well as how long to remain in a particular PAC facility. Given their focus on perceived financial savings, conveners customarily suggest that patients avoid higher cost PAC settings altogether or move as soon as practicable to lower cost PAC settings. However, conveners are not healthcare providers and may suggest a PAC setting or duration of care that is not appropriate from a clinical perspective. Conveners may suggest that patients select alternate care settings to our TC hospitals, IRFs, or home health locations or otherwise suggest shorter lengths of stay in such settings. Efforts by conveners to avoid our care settings or suggest shorter lengths of stay in our care settings could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations, and liquidity.
 KINDRED REHABILITATION SERVICES DIVISION
 Our Kindred Rehabilitation Services division operates IRFs, manages ARUs, and provides rehabilitation services, including physical and occupational therapies and speech pathology services, to residents and patients of nursing centers, hospitals, outpatient clinics, home health agencies, and assisted living facilities. Within our Kindred Rehabilitation Services division, we are organized into two reportable operating segments: Kindred Hospital Rehabilitation Services and RehabCare. We are one of the largest providers of rehabilitation services in the United States based upon fiscal 2017 revenues of approximately $1.4 billion.
Kindred Hospital Rehabilitation Services Operations 
 Our Kindred Hospital Rehabilitation Services segment operates IRFs, manages ARUs, and provides program management and therapy services on an inpatient basis in LTAC hospitals, sub-acute (or skilled nursing) units, as well as on an outpatient basis to hospital-based and other satellite programs. As of December 31, 2017, our Kindred Hospital Rehabilitation Services segment operated 19 IRFs (which includes 17 joint ventures) and 99 ARUs and provided rehabilitation services in 104 LTAC hospitals, four sub-acute (or skilled nursing) units and 123 outpatient clinics. 
 Inpatient rehabilitation hospitals. Our IRFs provide services to patients who require intensive inpatient rehabilitative care. Our IRF patients typically have significant physical disability due to various medical and physical conditions, such as brain injuries, spinal cord injuries, stroke, hip fractures, certain orthopedic problems, and neuromuscular disease, which require medical and rehabilitative healthcare services in an inpatient setting. Our nurses and physical, occupational, and speech therapists work with physicians in a multi-disciplinary environment to get patients home and to work. Nursing and therapy staff provide patient care as directed by physician orders. Our IRFs use an interdisciplinary approach to treatment that leads to better care and superior outcomes. The medical, 
 14

nursing, therapy, and ancillary services provided by our IRFs comply with local, state, and federal regulations, as well as other accreditation standards. The majority of our IRFs are owned and operated through joint ventures with other health systems.
 Hospital-based inpatient rehabilitation units. We are a leading provider of contract-based ARU management services. The ARUs we manage provide high acuity rehabilitation for patients recovering from strokes, medically complex and orthopedic conditions, traumatic brain injuries, and other neurological disease. We assist in the development of ARUs in acute care hospitals that have vacant space and/or unmet rehabilitation needs in their markets. We also work with acute care hospitals that currently operate ARUs to improve the delivery of clinical services to patients by implementing our scheduling, clinical protocol, and outcome systems, as well as time-management training for existing staff. In the case of acute care hospitals that do not operate ARUs, we review their historical and existing hospital population, as well as the demographics of the geographic region, to determine the optimal size of the proposed ARUs and the potential of the new facility under our management to attract patients and generate revenues sufficient to cover anticipated expenses. Our relationships with these hospitals are customarily in the form of contracts for management services, which typically have a term of three to five years. 
 An ARU within a hospital allows the hospital to offer rehabilitation services to patients who might otherwise be discharged to a setting outside the acute care hospital, thus improving the hospital’s ability to provide a full continuum of care and consistency in clinical services and outcomes. An ARU within a hospital typically consists of about 20 beds and is staffed with a program director, a rehabilitation physician that usually serves as the medical director, and clinical staff, which may include psychologists, physical and occupational therapists, speech/language pathologists, a social worker, a case manager, and other appropriate support personnel. Additionally, compliance, clinical education, and clinical programming are supported by our clinical compliance experts in an effort to ensure that clinical practices support the provision of quality rehabilitation services. 
 LTAC hospitals. We provide rehabilitation and program management services, including physical and occupational therapies and speech pathology services, to LTAC hospitals. We provide specialized care programs that support patients with complex medical needs, such as wound care, pain management, and cognitive deficits, in addition to programs for neurologic, orthopedic, cardiac, and pulmonary recovery. As of December 31, 2017, we operated therapy programs in 104 LTAC hospitals, of which approximately one-third are owned by third parties. We also provide LTAC hospitals with clinical education and programming supported by our clinical experts in an effort to ensure that clinical practices support the provision of effective and efficient quality rehabilitation services in addition to enhancing overall prevention programs in accordance with applicable standards of care. 
 Sub-acute units. As of December 31, 2017, we managed therapy programs in four sub-acute (or skilled nursing) units. These hospital-based units provide lower intensity rehabilitation for medically complex patients. Patients’ diagnoses cover a wide range of medical conditions, including stroke, post-surgical conditions, pulmonary disease, cancer, congestive heart failure, burns, and wounds. These sub-acute units enable patients to remain in a hospital setting where emergency medical needs can be met quickly as opposed to having to be transported from a nursing center. These types of units are typically located within the acute care hospital and are either separately licensed or under the hospital’s license as permitted by applicable laws. The hospital benefits by retaining patients who otherwise would be discharged to another setting and by utilizing idle space. 
 Outpatient therapy programs. We manage outpatient therapy programs that provide therapy services to patients with a variety of medical, orthopedic, and neurological conditions that may be related to work or sports injuries. As of December 31, 2017, we managed 123 hospital-based and satellite outpatient therapy programs. An outpatient therapy program complements the hospital’s occupational medicine initiatives and allows therapy to be continued for patients discharged from inpatient rehabilitation facilities and medical/surgical beds. An outpatient therapy program also attracts patients into the hospital and is operated either on the hospital’s campus or in satellite locations controlled by the hospital. 
 We believe our management of outpatient therapy programs enables the efficient delivery of therapy services through our scheduling, clinical protocol, and outcome systems, as well as through time-management training for our therapy personnel. We also provide our customers with guidance on compliance and quality assurance objectives. 
 RehabCare Operations
Our RehabCare segment provides therapy management services primarily to nursing centers, assisted living facilities, independent living communities, home health agencies, and hospice providers, allowing our customers to fulfill their continuing need for therapists on a full-time or part-time basis without the need to hire, train, and retain their own staff. As of December 31, 2017, our RehabCare segment provided rehabilitative services in 1,616 sites of service in 42 states. 
 RehabCare provides specialized rehabilitation programs designed to meet the individual needs of the residents and patients we serve. Our specialized care programs address complex medical needs, such as wound care, pain management, and cognitive retraining, in addition to programs for fractures, neurologic, orthopedic, cardiac, and pulmonary conditions. We also provide clinical education and programming that is developed and supported by our clinical experts. These programs are implemented in an effort to ensure that clinical practices support the provision of quality rehabilitation services in accordance with applicable standards of care. 
 15

RehabCare recruits and retains qualified professionals with the clinical expertise to provide quality patient care and measurable rehabilitation outcomes. RehabCare also provides quality-assurance training for all clinicians to maintain compliance with regulatory requirements.

Sources of Kindred Rehabilitation Services Division Revenues 
 In the Kindred Hospital Rehabilitation Services segment, our IRFs derive a significant portion of their revenues from Medicare, Medicaid, and other payors that received discounts from their established billing rates. The Medicare and Medicaid regulations and various managed care contracts under which these discounts are calculated are complex and are subject to interpretation and adjustment. IRFs estimate the allowance for contractual discounts on a patient-specific basis given their interpretation of the applicable regulations or contract terms. These interpretations sometimes result in payments that differ from the IRFs’ estimates. Additionally, updated regulations and contract renegotiations occur frequently, necessitating regular review and assessment of the estimation process by management.
 16

Regarding the rehabilitation and program management services we provide to residents, patients, and customers, the basis for payment varies depending upon the type of service provided. In the Kindred Hospital Rehabilitation Services segment, our (1) ARU customers generally pay us on the basis of a negotiated fee per discharge, a flat monthly management fee, or a combination of the two, (2) LTAC hospital customers generally pay based upon a negotiated per patient day rate, (3) sub-acute rehabilitation customers generally pay based upon a flat monthly fee or a negotiated fee per patient day, and (4) outpatient therapy clients typically pay us on the basis of a negotiated fee per unit of service. In the RehabCare segment, our customers generally pay us on the basis of a negotiated patient per diem rate or a negotiated fee schedule based upon the type of service rendered.
 For the year ended December 31, 2017, revenues of the Kindred Rehabilitation Services division totaled approximately $1.4 billion or 24% of our total revenues (before eliminations). Approximately 6% of our Kindred Rehabilitation Services division revenues (before eliminations) in 2017 were generated from services provided to hospitals and care management functions that we operated. 
 As a provider of services to healthcare providers, trends and developments in healthcare reimbursement will impact our revenues and growth. Changes in the reimbursement provided by Medicare or Medicaid to our customers can impact the demand and pricing for our services.

Sales and Marketing 
 The Kindred Rehabilitation Services division’s sales and marketing efforts are tailored to each of its operating segments. Kindred Hospital Rehabilitation Services focuses on the provision of therapy services and therapy program management for IRFs and hospitals, while RehabCare primarily focuses on the outsourcing needs of freestanding skilled nursing facilities. Both the Kindred Hospital Rehabilitation Services and RehabCare segments emphasize the broad range of rehabilitation programs, clinical expertise, and competitive pricing for the services that we provide. Kindred Hospital Rehabilitation Services’ new business efforts are led by a 
 19

vice president of business development and three directors of business development in geographically defined regions. RehabCare’s new business efforts are led by nine directors of business development in geographically defined regions.
 Kindred Rehabilitation Services Division Management and Operations 
 At December 31, 2017, our Kindred Rehabilitation Services division was managed by a president, overseeing a chief operating, financial, medical, quality and other administrative officers. Our operations are further divided between the Kindred Hospital Rehabilitation Services and RehabCare operating segments. 
 The Kindred Hospital Rehabilitation Services segment is led by two vice presidents of operations who report to the division president, one in charge of IRF operations and the other in charge of ARU, LTAC hospital, sub-acute unit and outpatient therapy operations. With respect to our IRFs, a vice president of operations oversees the chief executive officers of our IRFs who are responsible for the day-to-day operations at each of our IRFs. Each IRF (or network of IRFs) also employs a controller to monitor financial matters, a chief clinical officer to oversee clinical operations, and a director of quality management to oversee quality assurance programs. With respect to our hospital-based contract rehabilitation services and program management, our operations are led by a vice president who manages five regional vice presidents. 
 The RehabCare segment is led by a chief operating officer, who reports to the division president. The chief operating officer has five division vice presidents reporting to her with six regional vice presidents reporting to the divisional vice presidents. 
 In both the Kindred Hospital Rehabilitation Services and RehabCare segments, area directors of operations report to the regional vice presidents. Each area director of operations is responsible for the overall management of 15 to 30 on-site program directors. Many of our rehabilitation customers have on-site program directors responsible for managing the therapy operations at such facility. There are two division vice presidents of clinical operations that manage clinical education for our therapists and implement quality care initiatives.
 We provide our Kindred Rehabilitation Services division with centralized administrative services in the areas of information systems, clinical operations, regulatory compliance, reimbursement guidance, professional licensing support, as well as legal, finance, accounting, purchasing, recruiting, and human resources management support. The centralization of these services improves operating efficiencies, promotes the standardization of certain processes, and permits program staff to focus on the delivery of quality, medically necessary rehabilitation services. 
 Kindred Rehabilitation Services Division Competition 
 The IRF industry is highly fragmented, and there are generally several competitors in each geographic market that we serve that provide similar services to those provided by our IRFs. In addition, several of the markets in which our IRFs operate have other IRFs that provide comparable services. Other providers of acute-care services may attempt to become competitors in the future. Also, other acute-care hospital operators may choose to expand their IRF services in our markets. Certain competing IRFs are operated by nonprofit, non-taxpaying, or governmental agencies, which can finance capital expenditures on a tax-exempt basis and receive funds and charitable contributions that are unavailable to us. Similarly, nursing facilities may market themselves as offering certain rehabilitation services even though they may not be required to offer the same level of care. 
 Competition for IRF patients covered by nongovernment reimbursement sources is intense. The primary competitive factors in the IRF business include quality of care and services, treatment outcomes achieved, charges for services, and responsiveness to the needs of patients, families, payors, and physicians. Other companies have entered the IRF business with licensed IRFs that compete with our IRFs. The competitive position of any IRF is also affected by the ability of its management to negotiate contracts with purchasers of, and to receive referrals from, group healthcare services, including managed care companies, preferred provider organizations, and health maintenance organizations. The importance of obtaining contracts with preferred provider organizations, health maintenance organizations, and other organizations that finance healthcare varies from market to market, depending on the number and market strength of such organizations.
 With respect to our program management and therapy services operations, there are national, regional, and local rehabilitation services providers that offer rehabilitation services comparable to ours. A number of our competitors may have greater financial and other resources than we do, may be more established in the markets in which we compete, and may be willing to provide services at lower prices. In addition, a number of nursing centers and hospitals may elect not to outsource rehabilitation services, thereby reducing our potential customer base. While there are several large rehabilitation providers, the market generally is highly fragmented and is primarily composed of smaller independent providers. 
 We believe our Kindred Rehabilitation Services division generally competes based upon its reputation for providing quality rehabilitation services, state of the art therapy programs, qualified and well-trained nurses and therapists, competitive pricing, outcome management, and technology systems.

GOVERNMENTAL REGULATION
 Medicare and Medicaid 
 A substantial portion of our revenues are derived from patients covered by the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Medicare is a federal program that provides certain hospital and medical insurance benefits to persons age 65 and over and certain disabled persons. Medicaid is a medical assistance program administered by each state, funded with federal and state funds pursuant to which healthcare benefits are available to certain indigent or disabled patients. Within the Medicare and Medicaid statutory framework, there are substantial areas subject to administrative rulings, interpretations, and discretion that may affect payments made under those programs. 
 We have been, and could be in the future, materially adversely affected by the continuing efforts of governmental and private third party payors to contain healthcare costs. We cannot assure you that reimbursement payments under governmental and private third party payor programs, including Medicare supplemental insurance policies, will remain at levels comparable to present levels or will be sufficient to cover the costs allocable to patients eligible for reimbursement pursuant to these programs. Medicare reimbursement in LTAC hospitals, IRFs, home health, and hospice is subject to fixed payments under the Medicare prospective payment systems. In accordance with Medicare laws, CMS makes annual adjustments to Medicare payment rates in many prospective payment systems under what is commonly known as a “market basket update.” Each year, the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission (“MedPAC”), a commission chartered by Congress to advise it on Medicare payment issues, recommends payment policies to Congress for a variety of Medicare payment systems. Congress is not obligated to adopt MedPAC recommendations and based on previous years, there can be no assurance that Congress will adopt MedPAC’s recommendations in any given year. Generally, these rates are adjusted annually for inflation. However, those adjustments may not reflect actual increases of the cost of providing healthcare services. In addition, Medicaid reimbursement can be impacted negatively by state budgetary pressures, which may lead to reduced reimbursement or delays in receiving payments. Moreover, we cannot assure you that the facilities operated by us, or the provision of goods and services offered by us, will meet the requirements for participation in such programs. 
 The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Healthcare Education and Reconciliation Act 
 Various healthcare reform provisions became law upon enactment of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Healthcare Education and Reconciliation Act (previously defined as the ACA). The reforms contained in the ACA have affected each of our businesses in some manner and are directed in large part at increased quality and cost reductions. Several of the reforms are very significant and could ultimately change the nature of our services, the methods of payment for our services, and the underlying regulatory environment. These reforms include possible modifications to the conditions of qualification for payment, bundling of payments to cover both acute and post-acute care, and the imposition of enrollment limitations on new providers. 
 The ACA also provides for: (1) reductions to the annual market basket payment updates for LTAC hospitals, IRFs, home health agencies, and hospice providers, which could result in lower reimbursement than in the preceding year; (2) additional annual “productivity adjustment” reductions to the annual market basket payment update as determined by CMS for LTAC hospitals and IRFs, home health agencies, and hospice providers; (3) a quality reporting system for hospitals (including LTAC hospitals and IRFs); and (4) reductions in Medicare payments to hospitals (including LTAC hospitals and IRFs) for failure to meet certain quality reporting standards or to comply with standards in new value-based purchasing demonstration project programs. 
 Further, the ACA mandates changes to home health and hospice benefits under Medicare. For home health, the ACA mandates creation of a value-based purchasing program, development of quality measures, a decrease in home health reimbursement that began in federal fiscal year 2014 and was phased-in over a four-year period, a reduction in the outlier cap, and reinstated a 3% add-on payment for home health services delivered to residents in rural areas on or after April 1, 2010 and before January 1, 2016. 
 In addition, the ACA requires the Secretary of HHS to test different models for delivery of care, some of which would involve home health services. It also requires the Secretary to establish a national pilot program for integrated care for patients with certain conditions, bundling payment for acute hospital care, physician services, outpatient hospital services (including emergency department services), and post-acute care services, which would include home health. The Secretary is also required to conduct a study to evaluate costs and quality of care among efficient home health agencies regarding access to care and treating Medicare beneficiaries with varying severity levels of illness and provide a report to Congress.
Potential efforts in the U.S. Congress to repeal, amend, modify, or retract funding for various aspects of the ACA create additional uncertainty about the ultimate impact of the ACA on us and the healthcare industry.
 The healthcare reforms and changes resulting from the ACA (including any repeal, amendment, modification or retraction thereof), as well as other similar healthcare reforms, including any potential change in the nature of services we provide, the methods or amount of payment we receive for such services, and the underlying regulatory environment, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations, and liquidity. 
 21

Congress, MedPAC, and CMS will continue to address reimbursement rates for a variety of healthcare settings. We cannot predict the adjustments to Medicare payment rates that Congress or CMS may make in the future. Any downward adjustment to rates for the types of services we provide could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations, and liquidity. 
 Congress continues to discuss additional deficit reduction measures, leading to a high degree of uncertainty regarding potential reforms to governmental healthcare programs, including Medicare and Medicaid. These discussions, along with other continuing efforts to reform governmental healthcare programs, could result in major changes in healthcare delivery and reimbursement systems on a national and state level, including changes directly impacting the government and private reimbursement systems for each of our businesses. Healthcare reform, future healthcare legislation, or other changes in the administration or interpretation of governmental healthcare programs, whether resulting from deficit reduction measures or otherwise, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations, and liquidity. 
 We believe that our operating margins also will continue to be under pressure as the growth in operating expenses, particularly professional liability, labor, and employee benefits costs, exceeds any potential payment increases from third party payors. In addition, as a result of competitive pressures, our ability to maintain operating margins through price increases to private patients is limited.
 See “—Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Reimbursement and Regulation of Our Business—Healthcare reform has initiated significant changes to the United States healthcare system” and “—Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Reimbursement and Regulation of Our Business—Changes in the reimbursement rates or methods or timing of payment from third party payors, including the Medicare and Medicaid programs, or the implementation of other measures to reduce reimbursement for our services and products could result in a substantial reduction in our revenues and operating margins.”
 Bundled Payment Programs
 The Comprehensive Care for Joint Replacement Bundled Payment Program.  CMS announced the final Comprehensive Care for Joint Replacement bundled payment program on November 16, 2015 (the “CJR Program”). The CJR Program implements a mandatory payment model in which acute care hospitals in designated metropolitan statistical areas (“MSAs”) are responsible for total spending for all inpatient care provided in connection with a lower extremity joint replacement or reattachment procedure, as well as for all spending related to care provided within a 90-day episode of care following discharge from such hospital. All providers will continue to receive fee-for-service payments under existing payment systems and total episode payments will subsequently be reconciled against a target price. The CJR Program will test this payment model over five performance periods between April 1, 2016 and December 31, 2020 to see if Medicare expenditures can be reduced while at the same time improving care coordination and preserving or enhancing the quality of care provided to Medicare beneficiaries. In November 2017, CMS reduced by half the number of MSAs where mandatory participation is required, effective January 1, 2018.
 Expansion to Cardiac and Other Orthopedic Services.  On November 30, 2017, CMS announced the cancellation of the expansion of the mandatory bundled payment program to cardiac and other orthopedic services. This bundled payment expansion was a mandatory payment model in which acute care hospitals in designated MSAs were responsible for total spending for all inpatient care provided in connection with acute myocardial infarction, coronary artery bypass graft, and surgical hip/femur fracture treatment, as well as for all spending related to care provided within a 90-day episode of care following discharge from such hospital. All providers would have continued to receive fee-for-service payments under existing payment systems with total episode payments subsequently reconciled against a target price.
 Bundled Payments for Care Improvement Advanced Initiative.  On January 9, 2018, CMS announced a new voluntary episode payment model, the Bundled Payments for Care Improvement Advanced Initiative. The program, which runs from October 1, 2018 through December 31, 2023, will include 32 clinical episodes (29 inpatient, 3 outpatient) including major joint replacement and stroke with the intention to align payment incentives, reduce expenditures and improve quality over a 90-day episode of care. Unlike prior bundled payment demonstration programs, which allowed PAC providers to be episode initiators, this program is focused on acute care hospitals and physician group practices as episode initiators. All providers will continue to receive fee-for-service payments under existing payment systems and total episode payments will subsequently be reconciled against a target price. 
The Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015
 The Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015 (“MACRA”) was signed into law on April 16, 2015. Among other items, MACRA: (1) permanently replaced the sustainable growth rate (“SGR”) formula previously used to determine updates to Medicare physician reimbursement, replacing these updates with quality and value measurements and participation in alternate payment models; (2) extended the Medicare Part B outpatient therapy cap exception process until December 31, 2017; (3) extended the 3% add-on payment for home health services delivered to residents in rural areas until December 31, 2017; and (4) set payment updates for post-acute providers at 1% after other adjustments required by the ACA for 2018.

The Improving Medicare Post-Acute Care Transformation Act of 2014
 The Improving Medicare Post-Acute Care Transformation Act of 2014 (the “IMPACT Act”), passed on October 6, 2014, requires standardized assessment data for quality improvement, payment, and discharge planning purposes across the spectrum of PACs, including LTAC hospitals, IRFs, and home health agencies.
 The IMPACT Act will require PACs to begin reporting (1) standardized patient assessment data at admission and discharge by October 1, 2018 for LTAC hospitals and IRFs and by January 1, 2019 for home health agencies, (2) new quality measures, including functional status, skin integrity, medication reconciliation, incidence of major falls, and patient preference regarding treatment and discharge at various intervals between October 1, 2016 and January 1, 2019, and (3) resource use measures, including Medicare spending per beneficiary, discharge to community, and hospitalization rates of potentially preventable readmissions. The Secretary of HHS will provide confidential feedback to PACs one year after this data is provided and public reports two years thereafter. Failure to report such data when required would subject a facility to a two percent reduction in market basket prices then in effect. The Secretary of HHS also plans to promulgate regulations requiring PACs to take certain of these quality, resource use, and other measures into account in the discharge planning process.
The IMPACT Act further requires HHS and MedPAC to study alternative PAC payment models, including payment based upon individual patient characteristics and not care setting, with corresponding Congressional reports required based on such analysis. MedPAC must provide a final report to Congress by June 30, 2022. The Secretary of HHS must also submit a final report no later than two years after it has collected two years of data. 
 The IMPACT Act also included provisions impacting Medicare-certified hospices, including (1) increasing survey frequency for Medicare-certified hospices to once every 36 months, (2) imposing a medical review process for facilities with a high percentage of stays in excess of 180 days, and (3) updating the annual aggregate Medicare payment cap.
 
The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018
 The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 (the “BBA”), enacted on February 9, 2018, includes several provisions impacting Medicare reimbursement to home health, hospice, LTAC hospital and rehabilitation therapy services providers.
 With respect to home health providers, the BBA (1) will base payment on a 30-day episode of care (beginning January 1, 2020), coupled with annual determinations by CMS to ensure budget neutrality (including taking into account provider behavior), (2) will eliminate retroactive payment adjustments based upon the level of therapy services required (beginning January 1, 2020), (3) extends the 3% add-on payment for home health services provided to residents in rural areas (beginning January 1, 2018), coupled with a reduction and phase out of such add-on payment over the following four fiscal years, and (4) will establish a market basket update of 1.5% for the federal fiscal year beginning January 1, 2020. 
 With respect to hospice providers, the BBA establishes a new payment policy related to early discharges to hospice care from hospitals. This policy will impose a financial penalty on hospitals for each early discharge to hospice care, beginning October 1, 2018.
 With respect to LTAC hospital providers, the BBA extends the initial two-year phase-in period of the new LTAC patient criteria under the LTAC Legislation (as defined below) for an additional two-year period, and will impose a mandatory 4.6% reduction in payments for services provided to site-neutral patients over a nine-year period beginning October 1, 2018.
 With respect to rehabilitation therapy services providers, the BBA (1) permanently repeals the Medicare Part B outpatient therapy cap (effective January 1, 2018), (2) continues the targeted medical review process, while reducing the applicable threshold triggering such review to $3,000 (effective January 1, 2018), and (3) reduces payment for services provided by a physical or occupational therapy assistant to 85% of the amount currently payable under Medicare for such services (effective January 1, 2022).
 

Federal, state, and local regulations 
 The extensive federal, state, and local regulations affecting the healthcare industry include, but are not limited to, regulations relating to licensure, billing, conduct of operations, ownership of facilities, addition of facilities, allowable costs, services and prices for services, facility staffing requirements, and the privacy and security of health-related information. In addition, various anti-fraud and abuse laws, including physician self-referral laws, anti-kickback laws, and laws regarding filing of false claims, codified under the Social Security Act and other statutes, prohibit certain business practices and relationships in connection with healthcare services for patients whose care will be paid by Medicare, Medicaid, or other governmental programs. Sanctions for violating these anti-fraud and abuse laws include criminal penalties, civil penalties, and possible exclusion from government programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. 
 In the ordinary course of our business, we are regularly subject to inquiries, investigations, and audits by federal and state agencies that oversee applicable healthcare program participation and payment regulations. Audits may include enhanced medical 
 23

necessity reviews pursuant to the Medicare, Medicaid, and the SCHIP Extension Act of 2007 and audits under the CMS Recovery Audit Contractor (“RAC”) program and other similar programs. 
 We believe that the regulatory environment surrounding most segments of the healthcare industry remains intense. Federal and state governments continue to impose intensive enforcement policies that result in a significant number of inspections, citations of regulatory deficiencies, and other regulatory penalties. This includes demands for refund of overpayments, terminations from the Medicare and Medicaid programs, bars on Medicare and Medicaid payments for new admissions, and civil monetary penalties. These enforcement policies, along with the costs incurred to respond to and defend reviews, audits, and investigations, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations, and liquidity. We vigorously contest such penalties where appropriate; however, these cases can involve significant legal and other expenses and consume our resources. 
 Section 1877 of the Social Security Act, commonly known as the “Stark Law,” provides that a physician may not refer a Medicare or Medicaid patient for a “designated health service” to an entity with which the physician or an immediate family member has a financial relationship unless the financial arrangement meets an exception under the Stark Law or its regulations. Designated health services include inpatient and outpatient hospital services, physical, occupational, and speech therapy, durable medical equipment, prosthetics, orthotics and supplies, diagnostic imaging, enteral and parenteral feeding and supplies, home health services, and clinical laboratory services. Under the Stark Law, a “financial relationship” is defined as an ownership or investment interest or a compensation arrangement. If such a financial relationship exists and does not meet a Stark Law exception, the entity may not submit or claim payment under the Medicare or Medicaid programs or collect from the patient or other payor. Many of the compensation arrangement exceptions permit referrals if, among other things, the arrangement is set forth in a written agreement signed by the parties, the compensation to be paid is set in advance, is consistent with fair market value, and is not determined in a manner that takes into account the volume or value of any referrals or other business generated between the parties. Exceptions may have other requirements. Any funds collected for an item or service resulting from a referral that violates the Stark Law must be repaid to Medicare or Medicaid, any other third party payor, and the patient. In addition, a civil monetary penalty of up to approximately $25,000 for each service may be imposed for presenting or causing to be presented, a claim for a service rendered in violation of the Stark Law. Many states have enacted healthcare provider referral laws that go beyond physician self-referrals or apply to a greater range of services than just the health services designated under the Stark Law. 
 The Anti-Kickback Statute, Section 1128B of the Social Security Act (the “Anti-Kickback Statute”), prohibits the knowing and willful offer, payment, solicitation, or receipt of any remuneration, directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind, to induce the referral of an individual in return for recommending or arranging for the referral of an individual for any item or service payable under any federal healthcare program, including Medicare or Medicaid. The OIG has issued regulations that create “safe harbors” for certain conduct and business relationships that are deemed protected under the Anti-Kickback Statute. In order to receive safe harbor protection, all of the requirements of a safe harbor must be met. The fact that a given business arrangement does not fall within one of these safe harbors, however, does not render the arrangement per se illegal. Business arrangements of healthcare service providers that fail to satisfy the applicable safe harbor criteria, if investigated, will be evaluated based upon all facts and circumstances and risk increased scrutiny and possible sanctions by enforcement authorities. The Anti-Kickback Statute is a criminal statute, with penalties of up to $25,000, up to five years in prison, or both. The OIG can pursue a civil claim for violation of the Anti-Kickback Statute under the Civil Monetary Penalty Statute of up to approximately $75,000 per claim and up to three times the amount received from the government for the items or services. We believe that business practices of providers and financial relationships between providers have become subject to increased scrutiny as healthcare reform efforts continue on the federal and state levels. State Medicaid programs are required to enact an anti-kickback statute. Many states have adopted or are considering similar legislative proposals, some of which extend beyond the Medicaid program, to prohibit the payment or receipt of remuneration for the referral of patients regardless of the source of payment for the care. 
 The U.S. Department of Justice (the “DOJ”) may bring an action under the federal False Claims Act (the “FCA”) alleging that a healthcare provider has defrauded the government by submitting a claim for items or services not rendered as claimed, which may include coding errors, billing for services not provided, and submitting false or erroneous cost reports. The Fraud Enforcement and Recovery Act of 2009 expanded the scope of the FCA by, among other things, creating liability for knowingly and improperly avoiding repayment of an overpayment received from the government and broadening protections for whistleblowers. The ACA clarifies that if an item or service is provided in violation of the Anti-Kickback Statute, the claim submitted for those items or services is a false claim that may be prosecuted under the FCA as a false claim. Civil penalties under the FCA range from approximately $10,000 to $25,000 for each claim and up to three times of the amount claimed. Under the qui tam or “whistleblower” provisions of the FCA, a private individual with knowledge of fraud may bring a claim on behalf of the federal government and receive a percentage of the federal government’s recovery. Due to these whistleblower incentives, lawsuits have become more frequent. 
 In addition to the penalties described above, if we violate any of these laws, we may be excluded from participation in federal and/or state healthcare programs. These fraud and abuse laws and regulations are complex, and we do not always have the benefit of significant regulatory or judicial interpretation of these laws and regulations. While we do not believe we are in violation of these prohibitions, we cannot assure you that governmental officials charged with the responsibility for enforcing these prohibitions will not assert that we are violating the provisions of such laws and regulations. 
 24

The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 (the “Balanced Budget Act”) also includes a number of anti-fraud and abuse provisions. The Balanced Budget Act contains additional civil monetary penalties for violations of the Anti-Kickback Statute discussed above and imposes an affirmative duty on healthcare providers to ensure that they do not employ or contract with persons excluded from the Medicare program. The Balanced Budget Act also provides a minimum ten-year period for exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs for persons or entities convicted of a prior healthcare offense. 
 Various states in which we operate hospitals and IRFs have established minimum staffing requirements or may establish minimum staffing requirements in the future. Our ability to satisfy such staffing requirements depends upon our ability to attract and retain qualified healthcare professionals, including nurses, certified nurse’s assistants, therapists, and other staff. Failure to comply with such minimum staffing requirements may result in the imposition of fines or other sanctions. If states do not appropriate sufficient additional funds to pay for any additional operating costs resulting from such minimum staffing requirements, our profitability may be materially adversely affected. 
 The International Classification of Diseases (“ICD”) is a classification system for diseases and signs, symptoms, abnormal findings, complaints, social circumstances, and external causes of injury or diseases promulgated by the World Health Organization. We, like all healthcare providers, payors, and vendors are required to report medical diagnoses under ICD-10 diagnosis codes. If claims are not reported properly under ICD-10, there can be a delay in the processing and payment of such claims or a denial of such claims, which can have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations, and liquidity.
 HIPAA Privacy and Security Laws and Regulations. The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”), among other things, broadened the scope of existing fraud and abuse laws. It also mandated the adoption of administrative simplification regulations aimed at standardizing transaction formats and billing codes for documenting medical services, handling claims submissions, and protecting the privacy and security of individually identifiable health information. HIPAA regulations that standardize transactions and code sets require standard formatting for healthcare providers, like us, that submit claims electronically. We are now required to use ICD-10 code sets for diagnoses and procedures on electronic claims forms, necessitating greater specificity in our coding and documentation practices.
 Many federal and state laws regulate how we handle certain patient health information and restrict the use and disclosure of that information, including medical and billing records. The HIPAA regulations apply to “protected health information,” defined generally as individually identifiable health information transmitted or maintained in any form or medium. The HIPAA privacy regulations provide individuals with the right to access, amend, and obtain an accounting of their own health information and restrict how and for what purposes we use and disclose that information. We are required to limit our disclosures to only the minimum amount information reasonably necessary to accomplish the intended purpose. 
 HIPAA’s security regulations require us to safeguard the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of electronic protected health information that we create, receive, maintain, or transmit. We must protect against reasonably anticipated threats or hazards to the security of such information and against the unauthorized use or disclosure of such information. HIPAA provides for the imposition of civil and criminal penalties if protected health information is improperly used or disclosed.
 The Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009 (the “HITECH Act”) strengthened HIPAA enforcement provisions and authorized state attorneys general to bring civil actions for HIPAA violations. It permits HHS to impose penalties even if we did not know or reasonably could not have known about the violation and increases civil monetary penalty amounts up to $50,000 per violation with a maximum of $1.5 million in a calendar year for violations of the same requirement. The HITECH Act also authorizes HHS to conduct audits of HIPAA compliance. On January 25, 2013, HHS published a final omnibus regulation implementing the HITECH Act changes (the “Omnibus Rule”). The Omnibus Rule extended certain privacy and security regulations to business associates and their subcontractors that handle protected health information and imposed new requirements on HIPAA business associate contracts. The Omnibus Rule also clarified a covered entity’s notification and reporting requirements in the event of a breach of unsecured protected health information. This reporting obligation supplements state laws that also may require notification in the event of a breach of personal information.
 In operating our business, we may be regulated either as a covered entity or a business associate under HIPAA depending on the circumstances. We are also subject to state laws that are more restrictive than the HIPAA regulations and tort claims based on violations of privacy or failure to protect data security. We expect continued active enforcement of state and federal privacy and security laws and significant costs on our business to comply with these laws. We cannot assure you that our potential noncompliance with HIPAA, the HITECH Act, the Omnibus Rule or any other privacy and security regulations will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations, and liquidity. 
 25

Certificates of need and state licensing. CON regulations control the development and expansion of healthcare services and facilities in certain states. Certain states also require regulatory approval prior to certain changes in ownership. Certain states that do not have CON programs may have other laws or regulations that limit or restrict the development or expansion of healthcare facilities. We operate hospitals in nine states, IRFs in two states, home health agencies in 12 states, and hospice agencies in seven states that require prior approval under CON programs for the development or expansion of our facilities and services. To the extent that CONs or other similar approvals are required for development or expansion of the operations of our services, either through facility development, acquisitions, expansion, or provision of new services or other changes, such development or expansion could be adversely affected by the failure or inability to obtain the necessary approvals, changes in the standards applicable to such approvals, or possible delays and expenses associated with obtaining such approvals.
 We are required to obtain state licenses to operate each of our hospitals and IRFs and to ensure their participation in government programs. Several states require similar licenses for home health and hospice operations. Once a hospital or an IRF becomes licensed and operational, it must continue to comply with federal, state, and local licensing requirements in addition to local building and life-safety codes. All of our hospitals, IRFs and home health and hospice operations have the necessary licenses. Failure of our hospitals, IRFs and home health and hospice operations to satisfy applicable licensure and certification requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations, and liquidity. 
 Kindred at Home division 
 General regulations. The activities of the Kindred at Home division primarily consist of the provision of home health and hospice services. The home health and hospice activities conducted through the Kindred at Home division are subject to various federal and state regulations. Many states require the entity through which the Kindred at Home division’s home health and hospice services are provided to obtain a license or certification from one or more state agencies. In addition, a substantial majority of our home health and hospice agencies achieved and/or maintain certification through one of the three private accreditation bodies: TJC, the Accreditation Commission for Health Care, and the Community Health Accreditation Program. The physicians, therapists, and other healthcare professionals employed by the Kindred at Home division are required to be individually licensed or certified pursuant to applicable state and federal laws. We have processes in place in an effort to ensure that our Kindred at Home division providers are licensed or certified in accordance with applicable federal and state laws. In addition, we require our physicians, therapists, and other employees to participate in continuing education programs. The failure to obtain, maintain, or renew required licenses or certifications by our home health and hospice agencies or the physicians, therapists, or other healthcare professionals employed through the Kindred at Home division could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations, and liquidity.
As noted above, the Kindred at Home division also is subject to federal and state laws that govern financial and other arrangements between healthcare providers. These laws prohibit, among other things, certain direct and indirect payments for the referral of patients, certain referrals by physicians if they or their immediate family members have a financial relationship with a home health or hospice agency or other provider, or fee-splitting arrangements between healthcare providers that are designed to induce or encourage the referral of patients to, or the recommendation of, a particular provider for medical products or services. Such laws include the Anti-Kickback Statute, the Stark Law, the FCA, and various state anti-kickback laws and physician self-referral prohibitions. In addition, some states restrict certain business relationships between physicians and ancillary service providers, and some states prohibit business corporations from providing, or holding themselves out as a provider of, medical care. Possible sanctions for violation of any of these restrictions or prohibitions include loss of licensure or eligibility to participate in Medicare, Medicaid, and other reimbursement programs, as well as civil and criminal penalties. These laws vary considerably from state to state. 
 Overview of Kindred at Home division reimbursement 
 Medicare 
 Home health. To be eligible to receive Medicare payments for home health services, a patient must be “homebound” (generally unable to leave home without considerable or taxing effort), require intermittent skilled nursing or physical or speech therapy services, and receive treatment under a plan of care established and periodically reviewed by a physician based upon a face-to-face encounter between the patient and the physician. 
 We currently receive a standard prospective payment for home health services provided over a 60-day base period, or “episode,” of care. There is no limit to the number of episodes of care a patient may receive as long as he or she remains Medicare eligible. The base episode payment is a flat rate subject to adjustment based on differences in the expected needs of each patient and upon the geographic location of the services provided. The adjustment is determined by each patient’s categorization into one of 153 payment groups, known as home health resource groups, and the cost of care for patients in each group relative to the average patient. Payment is further adjusted for differences in local prices using the home health wage index. The payment also is subject to retroactive adjustment in certain circumstances, including: (1) an outlier adjustment if the patient’s care was unusually costly; (2) a utilization adjustment if the number of visits to the patient was less than five; (3) a partial payment adjustment if the patient transferred to another provider during an episode; (4) an adjustment based upon the level of required therapy services; and (5) an adjustment based upon the number of episodes of care, with certain episodes of three or more receiving an increased rate. 
 26

The ACA mandates changes to home health benefits under Medicare, including creation of a value-based purchasing program, development of quality measures, a decrease in home health reimbursement that began in federal fiscal year 2014 and was phased-in over a four-year period, and a reduction in the outlier cap. In addition, the ACA requires the Secretary of HHS to test different models for delivery of care, some of which would involve home health services. It also requires the Secretary to establish a national pilot program for integrated care for patients with certain conditions, bundling payment for acute hospital care, physician services, outpatient hospital services (including emergency department services), and post-acute care services, which would include home health. The Secretary is also required to conduct a study to evaluate costs and quality of care among efficient home health agencies regarding access to care and treating Medicare beneficiaries with varying severity levels of illness and provide a report to Congress. 
 On October 29, 2015, CMS issued final regulations regarding Medicare payment rates for home health agencies effective January 1, 2016. These final regulations implement a net 1.4% reduction consisting of a 2.3% market basket inflation increase, less (1) a 0.4% productivity reduction, (2) a 2.4% rebasing adjustment mandated under the ACA, and (3) a 0.9% reduction to account for industry wide case mix growth. The regulations also implement a value-based purchasing demonstration model to be tested in nine states (Massachusetts, Maryland, North Carolina, Florida, Washington, Arizona, Iowa, Nebraska and Tennessee) through payment year 2022. 
 On October 31, 2016, CMS issued final regulations regarding Medicare payment rates for home health agencies effective January 1, 2017. These final regulations implement a net 0.7% reduction, consisting of a market basket update of 2.8%, less (1) a 0.3% productivity reduction, (2) a 2.3% rebasing adjustment mandated under the ACA, and (3) an additional 0.9% reduction adjustment to account for industry wide case mix growth.
 On November 1, 2017, CMS issued final regulations regarding Medicare payment rates for home health agencies effective January 1, 2018. Included in the final regulations is a net 0.4% reduction, consisting of a market basket update of 1.0% as required by MACRA, less (1) a 0.9% reduction adjustment to account for industry wide case mix growth, and (2) an additional 0.5% reduction for the elimination of the rural add-on provision. 
 CMS proposed a new payment methodology known as the home health grouping model (“HHGM”) in July 2017 (the “HHGM Proposal”). Under the HHGM Proposal, Medicare payments for home health services would have been based upon HHGM, utilizing a 30-day (rather than a 60-day) episode of care, comorbidities (rather than therapy service-use thresholds), and other criteria to set payments. In November 2017, CMS announced that it was not finalizing the HHGM Proposal and that it would instead take additional time to further engage with stakeholders to move towards a system that shifted the focus from volume of services to a more patient-centered model. If CMS decided to implement the HHGM Proposal or other payment reform for home health care providers, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations, and liquidity.
 The BBA, enacted on February 9, 2018, will implement several changes to Medicare home health reimbursement, including (1) basing payment on a 30-day episode of care (beginning January 1, 2020), coupled with annual determinations by CMS to ensure budget neutrality (including taking into account provider behavior), (2) eliminating the retroactive payment adjustment based upon the level of therapy services required (beginning January 1, 2020), (3) extending the 3% add-on payment for home health services provided to residents in rural areas (beginning January 1, 2018), coupled with a reduction and phase out of such add-on payment over the following four years, and (4) establishing a market basket update of 1.5% for the federal fiscal year beginning January 1, 2020.
 Hospice. To be eligible to receive hospice care under the Medicare program, a patient must have a certified terminal condition with a life expectancy of six months or less if the illness runs it normal course. The patient must affirmatively elect hospice treatment to the exclusion of other Medicare benefits related to his or her terminal condition. 
 We receive payment for our hospice services under Medicare through a prospective payment system that pays an established payment rate for each day that we provide hospice services to a Medicare eligible patient. The rates we receive from Medicare are subject to annual adjustments for inflation and vary based upon the geographic location of the services provided. The rate also varies depending upon which of four established levels of care we provide to the Medicare patient: (1) “routine home care,” which is the default level paid for each day a patient is in the hospice program and does not receive one of the higher levels of care; (2) “general inpatient care,” which is paid for a brief period when a patient needs inpatient services for pain or symptom management; (3) “continuous home care,” which is home care provided during a crisis period when the patient requires intensive monitoring and nursing care; and (4) “respite care,” which allows a patient to receive inpatient care for up to five consecutive days to provide relief for the patient’s family and other caregivers from the demands of providing care. We receive a higher routine home care rate for services provided within the first 60 days of an episode of care, and also may receive a service intensity add-on payment for routine home care services provided in person during the last seven days of a patient’s life.
 The Medicare payments we receive for hospice care are subject to two caps. First, the “80-20 Rule” provides that if the number of inpatient care days furnished to Medicare patients exceeds 20% of the total days of hospice care (measured during a 12-month period ending October 31 of each year) provided to Medicare patients, the excess is only eligible for the “routine home care” rate. 
 27

Second, there is a cap based upon an overall average payment per Medicare beneficiary. Any payments exceeding these caps must be refunded to Medicare. 
 For hospice patients who receive nursing home care under certain state Medicaid programs and who elect hospice care under Medicare or Medicaid, the state must pay, in addition to the applicable Medicare or Medicaid hospice per diem rate, an amount equal to at least 95% of the Medicaid per diem skilled nursing facility rate for “room and board” furnished to the patient by the skilled nursing facility. The reduction or elimination of Medicare payments for hospice patients residing in skilled nursing facilities would significantly reduce our hospice revenues and profitability. In addition, changes in the way skilled nursing facilities are reimbursed for “room and board” services provided to hospice patients residing in skilled nursing facilities could affect our ability to obtain referrals from skilled nursing facilities. A reduction in referrals from skilled nursing facilities would adversely affect our hospice revenues and profitability. 
 On July 31, 2015, CMS issued final regulations for Medicare reimbursement for hospice providers for the federal fiscal year beginning October 1, 2015. These final regulations implement a net market basket increase of 1.6% consisting of: (1) a market basket inflation increase of 2.4%, less (2) offsets to the standard payment conversion factor mandated by the ACA of: (a) a 0.5% adjustment to account for the effect of a productivity adjustment, and (b) 0.3% as required by statute. In addition, there is a 0.2% increase resulting from the blend of wage index values under the updated core based statistical areas and a 0.7% reduction for the final year of the phase-out of the wage index budget neutrality adjustment. The regulation also implements, effective January 1, 2016: (1) the creation of two different payment rates for routine home care, a higher base payment for the first 60 days and a reduced payment for days 61 and beyond; and (2) a new service intensity add-on which would pay an additional amount during the last seven days of life when a patient has direct care provided by a registered nurse or social worker.
On July 29, 2016, CMS issued final regulations for Medicare reimbursement for hospice providers effective October 1, 2016. Included in these final regulations are: (1) a market basket increase of 2.7%; (2) a multifactor productivity reduction of 0.3%; and (3) an additional 0.3% reduction as mandated in the ACA.
 On August 1, 2017, CMS issued final regulations for Medicare reimbursement for hospice providers effective October 1, 2017. These final regulations implement a net market basket increase to the standard federal payment rate of 1.0%, as required by MACRA.
 The BBA, enacted on February 9, 2018, establishes a new payment policy related to early discharges to hospice care from hospitals. The policy will impose a financial penalty on hospitals for each early discharge to hospice care, beginning October 1, 2018.
 Medicaid—Medicaid reimburses home health and hospice providers, physicians, and certain other healthcare providers for care provided to certain low-income patients. Reimbursement varies from state to state and is based upon a number of different systems, including cost-based, prospective payment, and negotiated rate systems. Rates are subject to multiple adjustments in different circumstances and are subject to statutory and regulatory changes and interpretations and rulings by individual state agencies. Medicaid is also the primary source of funding for the community care services provided by the Kindred at Home division.
 Nongovernment payments—The Kindred at Home division seeks to maximize the number of its nongovernment payment patients, including those covered under private insurance and managed care health plans. Nongovernment payment patients typically have financial resources (including insurance coverage) to pay for their services and do not rely upon government programs for support. We negotiate contracts with purchasers of group healthcare services, including private employers, commercial insurers, and managed care companies. Most payor organizations attempt to obtain discounts from established charges. We focus on demonstrating to these payors how our services can provide them and their customers with the most viable pricing arrangements in circumstances where they otherwise may be faced with funding treatments at higher rates at other healthcare providers. The importance of obtaining contracts with commercial insurers, managed care health plans, and other private payors varies among markets, depending on such factors as the number of commercial payors and their relative market strength.
 Hospital division 
 General regulations. The hospital division is subject to various federal and state regulations. In order to receive Medicare reimbursement, each hospital must meet the applicable conditions of participation set forth by HHS relating to the type of hospital, its equipment, personnel, and standard of medical care, as well as comply with state and local laws and regulations. We have developed a management system to facilitate our compliance with these various standards and requirements. Among other things, a person is responsible at each hospital for leading an ongoing quality assessment and improvement program. Hospitals undergo periodic on-site Medicare certification surveys, which are generally limited in frequency if the hospital is accredited by TJC, which is a national organization that establishes standards relating to the physical plant, administration, quality of patient care, and operation of hospital medical staffs. As of December 31, 2017, all 75 TC hospitals operated by the hospital division were certified as Medicare LTAC providers. In addition, 72 of our hospitals also were certified by their respective state Medicaid programs. Loss of certification could adversely affect a hospital’s ability to receive payments from the Medicare and Medicaid programs. 
 28

As noted above, the hospital division also is subject to federal and state laws that govern financial and other arrangements between healthcare providers. These laws prohibit, among other things, certain direct and indirect payments for the referral of patients, certain referrals by physicians if they or their immediate family members have a financial relationship with the hospital, or fee-splitting arrangements between healthcare providers that are designed to induce or encourage the referral of patients to, or the recommendation of, a particular provider for medical products or services. Such laws include the Anti-Kickback Statute, the Stark Law, and the FCA. In addition, some states restrict certain business relationships between physicians and ancillary service providers, and some states prohibit business corporations from providing, or holding themselves out as a provider of, medical care. Possible sanctions for violating any of these restrictions or prohibitions include loss of licensure or eligibility to participate in reimbursement programs, as well as civil and criminal penalties. These laws vary considerably from state to state. 
 Six of our TC hospitals are owned in part by physician investors. Under amendments to the Stark Law passed in the ACA, the physician ownership percentage in a hospital to which the physician investors refer Medicare or Medicaid patients may not increase, and these hospitals may not expand their bed capacity or number of operating rooms or procedure rooms except for certain hospitals that meet stated requirements and receive permission from CMS. 
 Accreditation by TJC. Hospitals may also receive accreditation from TJC. Hospitals and certain other healthcare facilities generally must have been in operation at least four months to be eligible for accreditation. After conducting on-site surveys, TJC awards accreditation for up to three years to hospitals found to be in substantial compliance with TJC standards. Accredited hospitals also are periodically resurveyed, at the option of TJC, upon a major change in facilities or organization and after a merger or consolidation. As of December 31, 2017, all of the TC hospitals operated by the hospital division were accredited by TJC. 
 Peer review. Federal regulations provide that admission to and utilization of hospitals by Medicare and Medicaid patients must be reviewed by peer-review organizations or quality-improvement organizations in order to ensure efficient utilization of hospitals and services. A quality-improvement organization may conduct such review either prospectively or retrospectively and may, as appropriate, recommend denial of payments for services provided to a patient. The review is subject to administrative and judicial appeals. Each of the hospitals operated by our hospital division employs a clinical professional to administer the hospital’s integrated quality assurance and improvement program. Although intensifying, denials by third party utilization review organizations historically have not had a material adverse effect on the hospital division’s operating results. 
 Overview of hospital division reimbursement 
 Medicare reimbursement of short-term acute care hospitals—Medicare reimburses general short-term acute care hospitals under a prospective payment system (“IPPS”). Under IPPS, Medicare inpatient costs are reimbursed based upon a fixed payment amount per discharge using various diagnostic categories. Payment under IPPS is based upon the national average cost of treating a Medicare patient’s condition, adjusted for regional wage variations. Although the average length of stay varies for each diagnostic category, we believe that the average stay for all Medicare patients subject to IPPS is approximately five days. An additional outlier payment is made for patients with higher treatment costs but these payments are designed only to cover marginal costs. Hospitals that are certified by Medicare as LTAC hospitals are excluded from IPPS.
 Medicare reimbursement of LTAC hospitals—Since October 2002, the Medicare payment system for LTAC hospitals has been based upon LTAC PPS, a prospective payment system specifically for LTAC hospitals. LTAC PPS maintains LTAC hospitals as a distinct provider type, separate from short-term acute care hospitals. Only providers certified as LTAC hospitals may be paid under this system. As of December 31, 2017, all of our TC hospitals were certified as LTAC hospitals. To maintain certification under LTAC PPS, the average length of stay of Medicare patients must be greater than 25 days, except for patients receiving a site-neutral rate under Medicare or to Medicare Advantage patients.
 In 2007, CMS issued final regulations adopting a new Medicare severity diagnostic related group system for LTAC hospitals (“MS-LTC-DRG”). LTAC PPS is based upon discharged-based MS-LTC-DRGs similar to IPPS. 
 While the clinical system, which groups procedures and diagnoses, is identical to IPPS, LTAC PPS utilizes different rates and formulas. Three types of payments are used in this system: (1) short-stay outlier payment, which provides for patients whose length of stay is less than 5/6th of the geometric mean length of stay for that MS-LTC-DRG, based upon a lesser-of methodology, of which the first three of four calculations are (a) a per diem based upon the average payment for that MS-LTC-DRG, (b) the estimated costs, or (c) the full MS-LTC-DRG payment. If the length of stay is less than an IPPS-comparable threshold for that MS-LTC-DRG, then the fourth payment calculation is an amount comparable to an IPPS per diem for that same diagnostic related group (“DRG”), capped at the full IPPS DRG amount. If the length of stay is above the IPPS-comparable threshold but below the 5/6th geometric length of stay for that MS-LTC-DRG, then the fourth payment calculation is a blend of an amount comparable to what would otherwise be paid under IPPS computed as a per diem, capped at the full IPPS DRG comparable payment amount and a per diem based upon the average payment for that MS-LTC-DRG under LTAC PPS; (2) MS-LTC-DRG fixed payment, which provides a single payment for all patients with a given MS-LTC-DRG, regardless of length of stay, cost of care, or place of discharge; and (3) high cost outlier payment which provides a partial coverage of costs for patients whose cost of care far exceeds the MS-LTC-DRG reimbursement. For patients 
 29

in the high cost outlier category, Medicare will reimburse 80% of the costs incurred above a threshold, defined as the MS-LTC-DRG reimbursement plus a fixed loss amount per discharge. 
 LTAC PPS provides for an adjustment for differences in area wages resulting from salary and benefit variations. There also are additional rules for payment for patients who are transferred from an LTAC hospital to another healthcare setting and are subsequently readmitted to the LTAC hospital. The LTAC PPS payment rates also are subject to annual adjustments. 
 LTAC Legislation—As part of the SGR Reform Act enacted in 2013, Congress adopted various legislative changes impacting LTAC hospitals (the “LTAC Legislation”). The LTAC Legislation creates new Medicare criteria and payment rules for LTAC hospitals. 
 Medicare payments to LTAC hospitals are now based upon one of two methods: (1) LTAC PPS, or (2) a site-neutral formula based upon the lesser of what a short-term acute care hospital would be paid, or estimated cost. As noted above, CMS regulations classify LTAC hospital patients into diagnostic categories called MS-LTC-DRGs. LTAC PPS is based upon discharged-based MS-LTC-DRGs similar to IPPS.
 Under the new criteria set forth in the LTAC Legislation, LTAC hospitals treating patients with at least a three-day prior stay in an acute care hospital intensive care unit and patients on prolonged mechanical ventilation admitted from an acute care hospital will continue to receive payment under LTAC PPS. Other patients will continue to have access to LTAC care, whether they are admitted to LTAC hospitals from acute care hospitals or directly from other settings or the community, and in such cases, LTAC hospitals will be paid at a site-neutral rate for these patients, based on the lesser of per diem Medicare rates paid for patients with the same diagnoses under IPPS or an estimate of cost. We expect the majority of these site-neutral payments will be materially less than the payments provided under LTAC PPS. The BBA imposes a mandatory 4.6% reduction in payments for services provided to site-neutral patients over a nine-year period beginning October 1, 2018.
 The effective date of the new patient criteria was October 1, 2015, tied to each individual LTAC hospital’s cost reporting period, followed by an initial two-year phase-in period, which was extended by an additional two years by the BBA. During the four-year phase-in period, payment for patients receiving the site-neutral rate is based 50% on LTAC PPS and 50% on the site-neutral rate.
 The majority of our TC hospitals (all of which are certified as LTAC hospitals under the Medicare program) have a cost reporting period starting on September 1 of each year, and thus the phase-in of new patient criteria did not begin for a majority of our TC hospitals until September 1, 2016, and, with the enactment of the BBA, full implementation of the new criteria will not occur until September 1, 2020. We expect that the full implementation of the new criteria on September 1, 2020 will have a further negative impact on Medicare payments to our TC hospitals.
 Beginning in 2020, the LTAC Legislation requires that at least 50% of a hospital’s patients must be paid under the new LTAC PPS system to maintain Medicare certification as a LTAC hospital. The failure of one or more of our TC hospitals to maintain its Medicare certification as a LTAC hospital could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations, and liquidity. 
 The new patient criteria imposed by the LTAC Legislation reduces the population of patients eligible for reimbursement under LTAC PPS and changes the basis upon which we are paid for other patients. In addition, the LTAC Legislation is subject to additional governmental regulations and the interpretation and enforcement of those regulations. The LTAC Legislation, the implementation of new patient criteria, changes in referral patterns, and other associated elements has had, and will continue to have, an adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations, and liquidity. 
 See “—Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Reimbursement and Regulation of Our Business—The implementation of patient criteria for LTAC hospitals under the LTAC Legislation reduces the population of patients eligible for reimbursement under LTAC PPS and changes the basis upon which we are paid for other patients, which has had, and will continue to have, an adverse affect on our business, revenues and profitability.”
 Satellite Facilities. Medicare regulations require that when two or more hospital facilities share the same provider number and are considered to be a single hospital, the “remote” or “satellite” facility must meet certain criteria with respect to the “main” facility. These criteria relate largely to demonstrating a high level of integration between the two facilities. If the criteria are not met, each facility would need to meet all Medicare requirements independently, including, for example, the minimum average length of patient stay for LTAC hospital qualification. It is advantageous for certain satellite facilities that may not independently be able to meet these Medicare requirements to maintain provider-based status so that they will be reimbursed under LTAC PPS. If CMS determines that facilities claiming to be provider-based (and being reimbursed accordingly) do not meet the integration requirements of the regulations, CMS may recover the amount of any excess reimbursements based upon that claimed status. We have 33 hospitals that share a Medicare provider number, and the failure of any one or more of them to meet the provider-based status regulations could materially and adversely affect our business, financial position, results of operations, and liquidity. 
 30

25 Percent Rule. CMS has regulations governing payments to a LTAC hospital that is co-located with another hospital (a “HIH”). The rules generally limit Medicare payments to the HIH if the Medicare admissions to the HIH from its co-located hospital exceed 25% of the total Medicare discharges for the HIH’s cost reporting period (the “25 Percent Rule”). There are limited exceptions for admissions from rural, urban single, or a “MSA Dominant hospital” that generates more than 25% of the Medicare discharges in a MSA. Patients transferred after they have reached the short-term acute care outlier payment status are not counted toward the admission threshold. Patients admitted prior to meeting the admission threshold, as well as Medicare patients admitted from a non co-located hospital, are eligible for the full payment under LTAC PPS. If the HIH’s admissions from the co-located hospital exceed the limit in a cost reporting period, Medicare will pay the lesser of: (1) the amount payable under LTAC PPS; or (2) the amount payable under IPPS, which will likely reduce our revenues for such admissions. At December 31, 2017, we operated 13 HIHs with 494 licensed beds.
 In 2007, CMS expanded the 25 Percent Rule to all LTAC hospitals, regardless of whether they are a HIH. Under these regulations, all LTAC hospitals were to be paid LTAC PPS rates for admissions from a single referral source up to 25% of aggregate Medicare admissions. Patients reaching high cost outlier status in the short-term hospital were not to be counted when computing the 25% limit. Admissions beyond the 25% threshold were to be paid at lower IPPS rates. Since 2007, various legislative enactments have created moratoriums on the expansion of the 25 Percent Rule to freestanding LTAC hospitals. The 21st Century Cures Act further extended the moratorium on the application of the 25 Percent Rule until October 1, 2017, which was later extended to October 1, 2018 pursuant to regulations issued by CMS during 2017. Generally, until October 1, 2018: (1) LTAC hospitals may admit up to 50% of their patients from a co-located hospital and still be paid according to LTAC PPS; and (2) LTAC hospitals that are co-located with an urban single hospital or a MSA Dominant hospital may admit up to 75% of their patients from such urban single or MSA Dominant hospital and still be paid according to LTAC PPS. The LTAC Legislation further provides that co-located LTAC hospitals certified on or before September 30, 1995 are exempt from the provisions of the 25 Percent Rule. The Secretary of HHS has issued a report to Congress indicating that it will continue to consider whether to further modify or extend the 25 Percent Rule.
 Development Moratorium. The LTAC Legislation imposed a moratorium between April 1, 2014 and September 30, 2017 on the establishment and classification of new LTAC hospitals, LTAC satellite facilities, and LTAC beds in existing LTAC hospitals or satellite hospitals, subject to certain exceptions. LTAC hospitals or satellite facilities were exempt if, as of April 1, 2014, such facility had: (1) begun its qualifying period for payment as a LTAC hospital; (2) a binding written contract with an outside, unrelated party for the development of a LTAC hospital or satellite facility and has expended at least 10% of the estimated cost of the project or, if less, $2.5 million; or (3) obtained an approved CON. This moratorium limited our ability to increase LTAC bed capacity, expand into new areas, or increase bed capacity in existing markets that we serve.
 Other recent Medicare rate changes 
 On July 31, 2015, CMS issued final regulations regarding Medicare reimbursement for LTAC hospitals for the federal fiscal year beginning October 1, 2015. Included in the final regulations are: (1) a market basket increase to the standard federal payment rate of 2.4%; (2) offsets to the standard federal payment rate mandated by the ACA of: (a) 0.5% to account for the effect of a productivity adjustment, and (b) 0.2% as required by statute; (3) a wage level budget neutrality factor of 1.000513 applied to the adjusted standard federal payment rate; (4) adjustments to area wage indexes; and (5) an increase in the high cost outlier threshold per discharge to $16,423. 
 On August 2, 2016, CMS issued final regulations regarding Medicare reimbursement for LTAC hospitals for federal fiscal year beginning October 1, 2016. Included in the final regulations are: (1) a market basket increase to the standard federal payment rate of 2.8%; (2) offsets to the standard federal payment rate by the ACA of: (a) 0.3% to account for the effect of a productivity adjustment, and (b) 0.75% as required by the statute; (3) a wage level budget neutrality factor of 0.999593 applied to the adjusted standard federal payment rate; (4) adjustments to area wage indexes; and (5) an increase in the high cost outlier threshold per discharge to $21,943. 
 On August 2, 2017, CMS issued final regulations regarding Medicare reimbursement for LTAC hospitals for the federal fiscal year beginning October 1, 2017. Included in the final regulations are: (1) a net market basket increase to the standard federal payment rate of 1.0%, as required by MACRA; (2) a wage level budget neutrality factor of 1.0006434 applied to the standard federal payment rate; (3) an additional budget neutrality adjustment for impact of changes in short stay outliers; (4) adjustments to area wage indexes; and (5) an increase in the high cost outlier threshold per discharge to $27,382. This final rule also extends the moratorium on the full implementation of the 25 Percent Rule until October 1, 2018.
 The ACA requires a quality reporting system for LTAC hospitals under which any market basket update would be reduced by 2% for any LTAC hospital that does not meet the quality reporting standards. CMS has issued final regulations that require LTAC hospitals to report quality measures related to, among other things, catheter-associated urinary tract infections, central line associated blood stream infections, new or worsening pressure ulcers, unplanned readmissions, and falls with major injury. 
 Medicaid reimbursement of LTAC hospitals — The Medicaid program is designed to provide medical assistance to individuals unable to afford care. Medicaid payments are made under a number of different systems, which include cost-based 
 31

reimbursement, prospective payment systems, or programs that negotiate payment levels with individual hospitals. Medicaid programs are subject to statutory and regulatory changes, administrative rulings, interpretations of policy by state agencies, and certain government funding limitations, all of which may increase or decrease the level of payments to our hospitals. 
 Nongovernment payments — The hospital division seeks to maximize the number of nongovernment payment patients admitted to its hospitals, including those covered under commercial insurance and managed care health plans. Nongovernment payment patients typically have financial resources (including insurance coverage) to pay for their services and do not rely on government programs for support. It is important to our business to establish relationships with commercial insurers, managed care health plans, and other private payors and to maintain our reputation with such payors as a provider of quality patient care. We negotiate contracts with purchasers of group healthcare services, including private employers, commercial insurers, and managed care companies. Some payor organizations attempt to obtain discounts from established charges. We focus on demonstrating to these payors how our services can provide them and their customers with the most viable pricing arrangements in circumstances where they may otherwise be faced with funding treatment at higher rates at other healthcare providers. The importance of obtaining contracts with commercial insurers, managed care health plans, and other private payors varies among markets, depending on factors such as the number of commercial payors and their relative market strength. Failure to obtain contracts with certain commercial insurers and managed care health plans or reductions in the lengths of stay or payments for our services provided to individuals covered by commercial insurance could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations, and liquidity. 
 In addition, certain third parties, known as conveners, offer patient placement and care transition services to managed care companies, Medicare Advantage plans, bundled payment participants, accountable care organizations, and other healthcare providers as part of an effort to manage PAC utilization and associated costs. Thus, conveners influence patient decision on which PAC setting to choose, as well as how long to remain in a particular PAC facility. Given their focus on perceived financial savings, conveners customarily suggest that patients avoid higher cost PAC settings altogether or move as soon as practicable to lower cost PAC settings. However, conveners are not healthcare providers and may suggest a PAC setting or duration of care that may not be appropriate from a clinical perspective. Conveners may suggest that patients select alternate care settings to our TC hospitals, IRFs, or home health locations or otherwise suggest shorter lengths of stay in such settings. Efforts by conveners to avoid our care settings or suggest shorter lengths of stay in our care settings could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations, and liquidity. 
 Kindred Rehabilitation Services division 
 General regulations. The Kindred Rehabilitation Services division is subject to various federal and state regulations. Therapists, nurses, and other healthcare professionals that we employ are required to be individually licensed or certified pursuant to applicable state and federal laws. We have processes in place in an effort to ensure that our therapists, nurses, and other healthcare professionals are licensed or certified in accordance with applicable federal and state laws. In addition, we require our clinicians and other employees to participate in continuing education programs. The failure of a therapist, nurse, or other healthcare professional to obtain, maintain, or renew required licenses or certifications could adversely affect a customer’s and our operations, including negatively impacting our financial results. 
 As noted above, the Kindred Rehabilitation Services division is subject to federal and state laws that govern financial and other arrangements between healthcare providers. These laws prohibit, among other things, certain direct and indirect payments or fee-splitting arrangements between healthcare providers that are designed to induce or encourage the referral of patients to, or the recommendation of, a particular provider for medical products or services. Such laws include the Anti-Kickback Statute, the Stark Law, and the FCA discussed previously and various state anti-kickback laws and physician self-referral prohibitions. In addition, some states restrict certain business relationships between physicians and ancillary service providers. Some states also prohibit for-profit corporations from providing rehabilitation services through therapists who are directly employed by the corporation or otherwise providing, or holding themselves out as a provider of, clinical care. Possible sanctions for violation of any of these restrictions or prohibitions include loss of eligibility to contract with nursing centers, hospitals, and other providers participating in Medicare, Medicaid, and other federal healthcare programs, as well as civil and criminal penalties. These laws vary considerably from state to state. 
 Our IRFs are subject to additional federal and state regulations. In order to receive Medicare reimbursement, each IRF must meet the applicable conditions of participation set forth by HHS relating to the type of hospital, its equipment, personnel, and standard of medical care, as well as comply with state and local laws and regulations. We have developed a management system to facilitate compliance with these various standards and requirements. Among other things, each IRF has an individual who is responsible for leading an ongoing quality assessment and improvement program. As of December 31, 2017, all 19 IRFs operated by the Kindred Rehabilitation Services division were certified by Medicare as an IRF provider. In addition, 15 of our IRFs also were certified by their respective state Medicaid programs. Loss of certification could adversely affect an IRF’s ability to receive payments from the Medicare and Medicaid programs. 
 32

Accreditation by TJC and the Commission on Accreditation of Rehabilitation Facilities. IRFs may receive accreditation from TJC. IRFs generally must have been in operation at least four months to be eligible for accreditation by TJC. After conducting on-site surveys, TJC awards accreditation for up to three years to IRFs found to be in substantial compliance with TJC standards. Accredited IRFs are periodically resurveyed, at the option of TJC, upon a major change in facilities or organization and after a merger or consolidation. As of December 31, 2017, all of the IRFs operated by the Kindred Rehabilitation Services division were accredited by TJC. 
 IRFs and other healthcare facilities are also eligible to apply for accreditation by the Commission on Accreditation of Rehabilitation Facilities (“CARF”). CARF accreditation focuses on continuous quality improvement, patient engagement with person-focused standards and an individualized approach to service and outcomes. Generally, a provider will need 9-12 months to prepare for a CARF survey. CARF accreditations are awarded as one or three-year terms. As of December 31, 2017, we have obtained 51 three-year CARF accreditations with 12 more pending in 2018.
 In addition to standard accreditations, both TJC and CARF award specialty accreditation in areas such as stroke, traumatic brain injury, spinal cord injury, pulmonary, cancer, amputation, and diabetes. Several of our programs have received specialty accreditation, including 40 for stroke, seven for traumatic brain injury and four for amputation.
 Peer review. Federal regulations provide that admission to and utilization of IRFs by Medicare and Medicaid patients must be reviewed by peer review organizations or quality improvement organizations in order to ensure efficient utilization of IRFs and services. Quality improvement organizations may conduct such reviews prospectively or retrospectively and may, as appropriate, recommend denial of payments for services provided to a patient. The review is subject to administrative and judicial appeals. Each IRF operated by our Kindred Rehabilitation Services division employs a clinical professional to administer the IRF’s integrated quality assurance and improvement program. Although intensifying, denials by third party utilization review organizations historically have not had a material adverse effect on the Kindred Rehabilitation Services division’s operating results.
Corporate Integrity Agreement—We entered into a five-year corporate integrity agreement with the OIG on January 11, 2016 (the “RehabCare CIA”). The RehabCare CIA imposes monitoring, auditing (including by an independent review organization), reporting, certification, oversight, screening, and training obligations with which we must comply. These obligations include:
  
• | Retention of an independent review organization to perform duties under the RehabCare CIA, which include reviewing compliance by RehabCare Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries (“RehabCare”), a therapy services company we acquired on June 1, 2011, with federal program requirements and accepted medical practices; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Annual reporting obligations to the OIG regarding RehabCare’s compliance with the RehabCare CIA (including corresponding certification by senior management and the Board of Directors or a committee thereof).
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 In the event of a breach of the RehabCare CIA, we could become liable for payment of certain stipulated penalties, or our RehabCare subsidiaries could be excluded from participation in federal healthcare programs. The costs associated with compliance with the RehabCare CIA could be substantial and may be greater than we currently anticipate. Any breach or failure to comply with the RehabCare CIA, the imposition of substantial monetary penalties, or any suspension or exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations, and liquidity. See “—Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our Operations—If we fail to comply with the terms of our Corporate Integrity Agreement, we could be subject to substantial monetary penalties or suspension or exclusion from participation in the Medicare and Medicaid programs” and note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements.
 Overview of Kindred Rehabilitation Services division reimbursement 
 IRF reimbursement 
 Medicare—Our IRFs receive fixed payment reimbursement amounts per discharge under the inpatient rehabilitation facility prospective payment system (“IRF PPS”) based upon certain rehabilitation impairment categories established by HHS. Under the IRF PPS, CMS is required to adjust the payment rates based upon a market basket index, known as the rehabilitation, psychiatric, and long-term care hospital market basket. The market basket update is designed to reflect changes over time in the prices of a mix of goods and services provided by IRFs. 
 Over the last several years, changes in regulations governing inpatient rehabilitation reimbursement have resulted in limitations on, and in some cases, reductions in, the levels of payments to IRFs. A rule known as the “60% Rule,” stipulates that to qualify as an IRF under the Medicare program a facility must show that a certain percentage of its patients are treated for at least one of a specified and limited list of medical conditions. Under the 60% Rule, any IRF that fails to meet its requirements would be subject to prospective reclassification as an acute care hospital, with lower acute care payment rates for rehabilitative services. IRFs are allowed to use a patient’s secondary medical conditions, or “comorbidities,” to determine whether a patient qualifies for inpatient rehabilitative care under the rule.

On July 31, 2015, CMS issued final regulations for Medicare reimbursement for IRFs for the federal fiscal year beginning October 1, 2015. Included in these final regulations are: (1) a market basket increase of 2.4%; (2) a productivity reduction of 0.5%; (3) an additional reduction of 0.2% as required by the ACA; and (4) a decrease in the high cost outlier threshold per discharge to $8,658.
On July 29, 2016, CMS issued final regulations regarding Medicare reimbursement for IRFs for the federal fiscal year beginning October 1, 2016. Included in these final regulations are: (1) a market basket increase of 2.7%; (2) a productivity reduction of 0.3%; (3) an additional reduction of 0.75% as required by the ACA; and (4) a decrease in the high cost outlier threshold per discharge to $7,984.
 On July 31, 2017, CMS issued final regulations regarding Medicare reimbursement for IRFs for the federal fiscal year beginning October 1, 2017. These final regulations implement a net market basket increase to the standard payment conversion factor of 1.0%, as required by MACRA, less a 0.1% reduction related to recalibrating the outlier threshold.
 The ACA requires a quality reporting system for IRFs in which any market basket update would be reduced by 2% for any IRF that does not meet quality reporting standards. CMS has finalized regulations that required IRFs to report measures related to, among other things, catheter-associated urinary tract infections, pressure ulcers, and unplanned readmissions. 
 Medicaid reimbursement of IRFs—The Medicaid program is designed to provide medical assistance to individuals unable to afford care. Medicaid payments are made under a number of different systems, which include cost-based reimbursement, prospective payment systems, or programs that negotiate payment levels with individual hospitals. Medicaid programs are subject to statutory and regulatory changes, administrative rulings, interpretations of policy by state agencies, and certain government funding limitations, all of which may increase or decrease the level of payments to our IRFs. 
 Nongovernment payments to IRFs—We seek to maximize the number of nongovernment payment patients admitted to our IRFs, including those covered under commercial insurance and managed care health plans. Nongovernment payment patients typically have financial resources (including insurance coverage) to pay for their services and do not rely on government programs for support. It is important to our business to establish relationships with commercial insurers, managed care health plans, and other private payors and to maintain our reputation with such payors as a provider of quality patient care. We negotiate contracts with purchasers of group healthcare services, including private employers, commercial insurers, and managed care companies. Some payor organizations attempt to obtain discounts from established charges. We focus on demonstrating to these payors how our services can provide them and their customers with the most viable pricing arrangements in circumstances where they may otherwise be faced with funding treatment at higher rates at other healthcare providers. The importance of obtaining contracts with commercial insurers, managed care health plans, and other private payors varies among markets, depending on such factors as the number of commercial payors and their relative market strength. Failure to obtain contracts with certain commercial insurers and managed care health plans or reductions in the lengths of stay or payments for our services provided to individuals covered by commercial insurance could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations, and liquidity. 
 Reimbursement for therapy management and therapy services
 The Kindred Rehabilitation Services division receives payment for the rehabilitation and program management services it provides to patients and customers. The basis for payment varies as more specifically set forth below. In the Kindred Hospital Rehabilitation Services segment, our (1) ARU customers generally pay a negotiated fee per discharge, a flat monthly management fee, or a combination of the two, (2) LTAC hospital customers generally pay a negotiated per patient day rate, (3) sub-acute rehabilitation customers generally pay a flat monthly fee or a negotiated fee per patient day, and (4) outpatient therapy clients typically pay a negotiated fee per unit of service. In the RehabCare segment, our customers generally pay a negotiated patient per diem rate or a negotiated fee schedule based upon the type of service rendered.
 Various federal and state laws and regulations govern reimbursement to nursing centers, hospitals, and other healthcare providers participating in Medicare, Medicaid, and other federal and state healthcare programs. Though these laws and regulations may not directly apply to our Kindred Rehabilitation Services division, they do apply to our customers. If our customers fail to comply with these laws and regulations they could be subject to possible sanctions, including loss of licensure or eligibility to participate in reimbursement programs, as well as civil and criminal penalties, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial position, results of operations, and liquidity. If our arrangements with our customers are found to violate the Anti-Kickback Statute or other fraud and abuse laws, we could be subject to criminal and civil penalties, as well as exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs and potential indemnity claims by our customers. In addition, there continue to be legislative and regulatory proposals to contain healthcare costs by imposing further limits on government and private payments to healthcare service providers. 
 Medicare Part B provides reimbursement for certain physician services, limited drug coverage, and other outpatient services, such as therapy and other services, outside of a Medicare Part A covered patient stay. Payment for these services is determined according to the Medicare Physician Fee Schedule (“MPFS”). Annually since 1997, the MPFS has been subject to the SGR, which is intended to keep spending growth in line with allowable spending. MACRA permanently replaces the SGR formula previously used to 
 34

determine updates to Medicare physician reimbursement, replacing these updates with quality and value measurements and participation in alternative payment models.
 Since 2006, federal legislation has provided for an annual Medicare Part B outpatient therapy cap. In years since 2006, CMS has increased the amount of the therapy cap. In addition, legislation was passed that required CMS to implement a broad process for reviewing medically necessary therapy claims, creating an exception to the cap. Legislation has annually extended the Medicare Part B outpatient therapy cap exception process. MACRA further extended the therapy cap exception process until December 31, 2017 and eliminated the manual medical review process for claims above a $3,700 threshold, replacing it with a targeted review process. This review process has had an adverse effect on the provision and billing of services for patients and can negatively impact therapist productivity. Patients whose stay is not reimbursed by Medicare Part A must seek reimbursement for their therapy under Medicare Part B and are subject to the therapy cap. 
 The BBA (1) permanently repeals the Medicare Part B outpatient therapy cap (effective January 1, 2018), (2) continues the targeted medical review process, while reducing the applicable threshold triggering such review to $3,000 (effective January 1, 2018), and (3) reduces payment for services provided by a physical or occupational therapy assistant to 85% of the amount currently payable under Medicare for such services (effective January 1, 2022).
 Reductions in the reimbursement provided to our customers by Medicare or Medicaid could negatively impact the demand and price for our services, impair our ability to collect for our services from customers, and could have a material adverse effect on our rehabilitation revenues and growth prospects. 
 Although reductions or changes in reimbursement from governmental or third party payors and regulatory changes affecting our business represent one of the most significant challenges to our business, our operations are also affected by coverage rules and determinations. Medicare providers like us can be negatively affected by the adoption of coverage policies, either at the national or local level, that determine whether an item or service is covered and under what clinical circumstances it is considered to be reasonable, necessary, and appropriate. Current CMS coverage rules require inpatient rehabilitation services to be ordered by a qualified rehabilitation physician and be coordinated by an interdisciplinary team. The interdisciplinary team must meet weekly to review patient status and make any needed adjustments to the individualized plan of care. Qualified personnel provide rehabilitation nursing, physical therapy, occupational therapy, speech language pathology, social services, psychological services, and prosthetic and orthotic services, as medically necessary. CMS has also noted that it is considering specific standards governing the use of group therapies. For individual claims, Medicare contractors make coverage determinations regarding medical necessity that can reflect more restrictive interpretations of the CMS coverage rules. We cannot predict how future CMS coverage rule interpretations or any new local coverage determinations will affect us. 
 VENTAS MASTER LEASE AGREEMENT
 At December 31, 2017, we leased from Ventas and its affiliates 29 TC hospitals under one master lease agreement (as previously defined, the “Master Lease Agreement”). The Master Lease Agreement includes land, buildings, structures, and other improvements on the land, easements, and similar appurtenances to the land and improvements, and permanently affixed equipment, machinery, and other fixtures relating to the operation of the leased properties. There are one or more bundles of leased properties under the Master Lease Agreement, with each bundle containing several TC hospitals. 
 As part of our strategic decision to exit the skilled nursing facility business, we entered into an agreement with Ventas in 2016 which provided us with the option to acquire the real estate for all 36 skilled nursing facilities (previously defined as the “Ventas Properties”) that were leased from Ventas for an aggregate consideration of $700 million. As of December 31, 2017, we have acquired all of the Ventas Properties from Ventas. 
 Recent Master Lease Amendments
 On November 7, 2017, we and Ventas amended the Master Lease Agreement in connection with our purchase and closure of one of the TC hospitals leased thereunder. As part of such amendment, we paid Ventas $3 million for the real estate of such TC hospital, with the annual rent otherwise payable for such TC hospital of $5 million reallocated among the remaining facilities leased under the Master Lease Agreement. For accounting purposes, the reallocated rent is treated as a one-time non-cash lease termination charge. The Company recorded a $32 million lease termination charge in the fourth quarter of 2017 in connection with this transaction. The lease termination fee was recorded as a long-term liability discounted at our credit-adjusted risk-free rate through the end of 2025, which is the original lease term of the TC hospital. This lease termination fee was recorded as a restructuring charge in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations. 
 Concurrently with the execution and delivery of the Merger Agreement, on December 19, 2017, we and Ventas entered into the Ventas Lease Amendment to the Master Lease Agreement pursuant to which, among other things, (i) Ventas agreed that the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement and the Separation Agreement comply with the Master Lease Agreement, subject 
 35

to the satisfaction of the remaining requirements in the Master Lease Agreement related thereto, including payment to Ventas of a transaction fee equal to 10% of annual base rent under the Master Lease Agreement upon closing of the transactions, (ii) we agreed to pay to Ventas an additional $5 million fee within one business day of the signing of the Merger Agreement in exchange for Ventas’ approval of and agreement not to challenge the transaction structure (this condition was satisfied on December 20, 2017), (iii) we agreed to complete the purchase of the two remaining skilled nursing facilities under the Master Lease Agreement and our former Second Amended and Restated Master Lease No. 2 from Ventas, and pay corresponding expense reimbursements to Ventas, on or before December 31, 2017 (this condition was satisfied on December 21, 2017), and (iv) we agreed to make certain minimum expenditures for the leased facilities remaining under the Master Lease Agreement going forward.
 Rental Amounts and Escalators 
 The Master Lease Agreement is commonly known as a triple-net lease or an absolute-net lease. Accordingly, in addition to rent, we are required to pay the following: (1) all insurance required in connection with the leased properties and the business conducted on the leased properties, (2) certain taxes levied on or with respect to the leased properties (other than taxes on the income of Ventas), and (3) all utilities and other services necessary or appropriate for the leased properties and the business conducted on the leased properties. 
 We paid rents to Ventas (including amounts classified within discontinued operations) approximating $154 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, $168 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, and $172 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. 
 The Master Lease Agreement provides for rent escalations each May 1. All annual rent escalators are payable in cash. The contingent annual rent escalator for the Master Lease Agreement is based upon annual increases in the Consumer Price Index, subject to a ceiling of 4%. In 2017, the contingent annual rent escalator was 2.74% for the Master Lease Agreement. 
 Restrictive Covenants
 Pursuant to the provisions of the Master Lease Agreement, we may not (1) develop any additional TC hospitals within a ten-mile radius of each of the TC hospitals subject to the Master Lease Agreement, (2) develop any additional nursing centers within a five-mile radius of each of the nursing centers formerly subject to the Master Lease Agreement, or (3) increase the number of licensed beds at TC hospitals that are within the restricted areas and not leased to us by Ventas under the Master Lease Agreement. We are not restricted, however, from acquiring or operating TC hospitals or nursing centers within (or outside of) the restricted areas. 
 Remedies for an Event of Default 
 The Master Lease Agreement contains several restrictions and covenants related to our operation of the TC hospitals subject to the Master Lease Agreement. Upon an event of default under one of the Master Lease Agreement, Ventas may, at its option, exercise the following remedies: 
 (1)after at least ten days notice to us, terminate the Master Lease Agreement, repossess any leased property, relet any leased property to a third party, and require that we pay Ventas, as liquidated damages, the net present value of the rent for the balance of the term, discounted at the prime rate, 
 (2)without terminating the Master Lease Agreement, repossess the leased property and relet the leased property with us remaining liable for all obligations to be performed by us thereunder, including the difference, if any, between the rent under the Master Lease Agreement and the rent payable as a result of the reletting of the leased property, and 
 (3)seek any and all other rights and remedies available under law or in equity. 
 In addition to the remedies noted above, under the Master Lease Agreement, in the case of a facility-specific event of default, Ventas may terminate the Master Lease Agreement as to the leased property to which the event of default relates, and may, but need not, terminate the entire Master Lease Agreement. The Master Lease Agreement also includes special rules relative to Medicare/Medicaid events of default and a licensed bed event of default.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
 Employees 
 As of December 31, 2017, we had approximately 43,100 full-time and 42,200 part-time and per diem employees. We had approximately 2,400 unionized employees at 12 of our facilities as of December 31, 2017. 
 We, like other healthcare providers, have experienced difficulties in attracting and retaining qualified healthcare personnel in a highly competitive market, including nurses, therapists, home health and hospice employees, physicians, and other healthcare professionals. Our operations are particularly dependent on nurses, therapists, and home health and hospice employees for patient care. As the demand for our services continues to exceed the supply of available and qualified staff, our operators have been forced to offer more attractive wage and benefit packages to these professionals. Our difficulty in hiring and retaining qualified personnel has increased our average wage rates and may force us to increase our use of contract personnel. We expect to continue to experience increases in our labor costs primarily due to higher wages and greater benefits required to attract and retain qualified healthcare personnel. Salaries, wages, and benefits were approximately 67% of our consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2017. Our ability to manage labor costs will significantly affect our future operating results. 
Professional and General Liability Insurance 
 In October 2017, in connection with the review of our insurance programs as part of the SNF Divestiture, we restructured the funding and retention mechanism of recent policy years of our professional liability and workers compensation insurance programs (the “Insurance Restructuring”) provided through our wholly owned limited purpose insurance subsidiary, Cornerstone Insurance Company (“Cornerstone”). As a result of the Insurance Restructuring, on a per-claim basis we maintain a self-insured retention and Cornerstone insures all losses in excess of this retention. Cornerstone maintains commercial reinsurance through unaffiliated commercial reinsurers for these losses in excess of our retention. The Insurance Restructuring had no impact upon the financial risk transfer aspect of Cornerstone’s reinsurance agreements with its third party reinsurers. Cornerstone continues to insure claims in all states up to a per-occurrence limit without the benefit of any aggregate stop loss limit. 
 We believe that our insurance is adequate in amount and coverage. There can be no assurance that in the future such insurance will be available at a reasonable price or that we will be able to maintain adequate levels of professional and general liability insurance coverage.
