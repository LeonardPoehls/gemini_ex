The Company’s wholly owned subsidiary, Pristine Solutions Limited, was incorporated under the laws of Jamaica. The Company’s original business plan focused on developing a network of sales points for the sale and service of tankless water heaters in Jamaica, through Pristine Solutions Limited. The Company’s aim was to become the first tankless water heater company specializing in tankless-only products to enter the Jamaican market, and the only company in the Jamaican market offering solar-powered tankless water heater products.  As part of its plan, on December 30, 2009, the Company entered into a distribution agreement with Zhongshan Guangsheng Industry Co., Ltd., of China (“Zhongshan”), the manufacturer of the tankless water heaters.   Zhongshan manufactures the tankless water heaters under the brand Gleamous Electric Appliances.

On the same day, Mr. Michael Borkowski was appointed as President, Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Secretary, Treasurer, and the sole member of the Board of Directors of the Company. Concurrently the Company determined to change its business focus.
   On August 23, 2012, the Company changed its fiscal year from December 31 to January 31.
   On August 23, 2012, the Company and its controlling stockholders entered into a Share Exchange Agreement (the “Share Exchange”) with Eaton Scientific Systems, Ltd., a Nevada corporation (“ESSL”) and the shareholders of ESSL (the “ESSL Shareholders”), whereby the Company acquired 25,000 shares of common stock (100%) of ESSL (the “ESSL Stock”) from the ESSL Shareholders.

Current Business and Strategy
   Currently our business is in a pre-revenue stage, wherein we are building both consumer and enterprise technology, consumer package goods, investing in Research & Development and advertising to consumer and professional traffic for both our apps and web properties. Once we have gained a large enough audience the Company will begin to monetize that audience through: 1) paid advertisements from business seeking exposure to users the Herbo services; 2) enterprise license agreements with professional customers; and 3) sales of products targeting general health and wellness and alternative medicines.
 
Currently the Company’s Herbo apps, Fitrix app, UseHerbo.com and “The Pursuit of Fine Herb” original content are all available  for use, either through Apple and Google app stores or online through a web-browser or through social channels, such as Facebook, Instagram and YouTube.

Right now the Company is investing our internal enterprise capabilities that will allow for us to best service, deliver and account for all transactions.

According to a special report on Digital, Social and Mobile Worldwide users released in January 2015 by We Are Social Ltd.

The social applications market continues to grow with successful companies establishing focused services. For example, Facebook brought a person's "friends" in view, Pinterest socialized a browser's bookmarking feature and Waze socialized the GPS. Cornerstone networking consists of Facebook, Twitter, WordPress, Instagram, LinkedIn, Pinterest, YouTube, Skype and Tumblr. Our goal, supported by our owned and licensed technologies and based upon content created in house by our officers and directors, and available in various formats, is to provide consumers and enthusiasts easy access to connect with health-and-wellness businesses and like-minded enthusiasts, and to facilitate the research of and purchasing of eco-friendly products ... anytime, anywhere.
 
Competition
   The market for social media applications and information and education based content sites is large and growing. According to various media venues, it is speculated that nearly over one in four people around the world are using social technologies (42% of the world’s population according to the study by We Are Social (http://wearesocial.com/uk/special-reports/digital-social-mobile-worldwide-2015). The largest social media networks in the world, measured by active users, as of January 2016 according to a report by Statistica.com (http://www.statista.com/statistics/272014/global-social-networks-ranked-by-number-of-users/) were Facebook (1.55bn), WhatsApp (900mm), Chinese social network QZone (653mn), WeChat (650mn), Tumblr (555mn), Twitter (320mn) and Instagram (400mm). This market is extremely competitive and characterized by well-funded existing players, high capital inflows, and rapidly changing technologies. In addition to competitive and technological challenges, participants in the social media industry must remain flexible enough to accommodate changes in consumer preferences and tastes. We hope to reduce competition by targeting only those topics, concepts and content focused on building eco-friendly businesses and living healthy lifestyles, with our unique apps, channels and other social media efforts, including blogs.

Government Regulations
 
The cannabis industry has recently shown indication of the promise that many had projected several years ago.  Currently, there are 29 states and Washington D.C. that have legalized medical marijuana, and 8 jurisdictions have gone on to legalize recreational use of marijuana.  In addition, there are 11 states that have indicated interest in putting recreational use of marijuana to a vote in 2017.  The domestic recognized cannabis industry is estimated to be a $44 Billion in revenues opportunity over the next several years, with double-digit growth estimated for the foreseeable future.
 
The budgetary impact of removing cannabis from Schedule I of the Controlled Substances Act and legalizing its use in the United States could save billions by reducing government spending for prohibition enforcement in the criminal justice system. Additionally, billions in annual tax revenues could be generated through proposed taxation and regulation.  It is estimated that for every $1 spent on medical and recreational cannabis, there is an infusion of approximately $2.60 to the local economy, which is termed the “marijuana multiplier” effect. With the current Administration hyper-focused on growing domestic job opportunities, the Company believes that the cannabis movement will be a boon for creating such job opportunities.
 
Eco Science Solutions, Inc. has no control of the legislative environment, while Management believes that the cannabis and cannabis related markets will only become more main-stream, it is important to indicate that the removal of cannabis from Schedule I of the Controlled Substances Act, the most tightly restricted category reserved for drugs that have "no currently accepted medical use," has been proposed repeatedly since 1972 and has not been granted.
 
Rescheduling proponents argue that cannabis does not meet the Controlled Substances Act's strict criteria for placement in Schedule I and so the government is required by law to permit medical use or to remove the drug from federal control altogether. The US government, on the other hand, maintains that cannabis is dangerous enough to merit Schedule I status. The dispute is based on differing views on both how the Act should be interpreted and what kinds of scientific evidence are most relevant to the rescheduling decision.
 
The Act provides a process for rescheduling controlled substances by petitioning the Drug Enforcement Administration. The first petition under this process was filed in 1972 to allow cannabis to be legally prescribed by physicians. The petition was ultimately denied after 22 years of court challenges, but a pill form of cannabis's psychoactive ingredient, THC, was rescheduled in 1985 to allow prescription under schedule II. In 1999, it was again rescheduled to allow prescription under schedule III.
 
 A second petition, based on claims related to clinical studies, was denied in 2001. The most recent rescheduling petition filed by medical cannabis advocates was in 2002, but it was denied by the DEA in July 2011. Subsequently, medical cannabis advocacy group Americans for Safe Access filed an appeal, Americans for Safe Access v. Drug Enforcement Administration in January 2012 with the District of Columbia Circuit, which was heard on 16 October 2012 and denied on 22 January 2013.
 
Currently, the FDA is conducting an analysis, at the request of the DEA, on whether marijuana should be downgraded, said Douglas Throckmorton, Deputy Director for Regulatory Programs at the FDA, at a congressional hearing in June 2014. In August 2016, the DEA reaffirmed its position and refused to remove Schedule I classification. However, the DEA announced that it will end restrictions on the supply of marijuana to researchers and drug companies that had previously only been available from the government's own facility at the University of Mississippi.
