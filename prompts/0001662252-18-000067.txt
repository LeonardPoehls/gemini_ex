Forward-Looking Statements
 
Certain statements, other than purely historical information, including estimates, projections, statements relating to our business plans, objectives, and expected operating results, and the assumptions upon which those statements are based, are “forward-looking statements.” These forward-looking statements generally are identified by the words “believes,” “project,” “expects,” “anticipates,” “estimates,” “intends,” “strategy,” “plan,” “may,” “will,” “would,” “will be,” “will continue,” “will likely result,” and similar expressions. Forward-looking statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties which may cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements. Our ability to predict results or the actual effect of future plans or strategies is inherently uncertain.
 
Description of Our Company
 
Company Overview
 
We were incorporated in the State of Nevada on December 31, 2013 as Artesanias Corp. Our original business plan involved distribution of the arts and crafts of the indigenous tribes of Panama via the Internet. On January 20, 2015, we underwent a change in control when our former majority shareholder and sole officer, Jose Soto, sold his controlling interest and resigned after appointing our current CEO and Director, Chitan Mistry, and our former CFO and Director, Lucie Lettelier. Following the change in control, we are no longer pursuing our original business plan. On June 12, 2015, the Board of Directors of the Company changed the name from Artesanias Corp. to SocialPlay USA, Inc. to reflect the business focus of the Company.
 
On April 27, 2015, we entered into an Exclusive License Agreement (the “Agreement”) with Social Play, Inc. (“Social Play”). Under the Agreement, we have been granted the exclusive rights within the U.S. and Canada to develop, market and sell products and services based upon Social Play’s patent-pending “SP Cloud Goods” system. SP Cloud Goods is cloud-based game hosting and management system where video game developers can add and remove virtual goods from the game, manage players, manage virtual store pricing, and view vital game and player statistics.  Using this system, game developers can affect their games in real-time, without the need to rebuild or republish the game. The SP Cloud Goods intellectual property also includes a system for game developers to collect payments for virtual goods sold to players in their games, as well as a marketplace component that will allow advertisers and game developers to choose where, when, and how advertisements are placed in games. The system will also facilitate the transfer of funds from advertisers to game developers.
 
The Agreement runs for an initial term of five (5) years, with an optional extension for an additional five years. In consideration for the license, we agreed to issue Social Play 1,000,000 (200,000 after reverse split) shares of common stock and an additional 1,000,000 (200,000 after reverse split) shares on each anniversary of the Agreement for so long as it is in effect. Further, we agreed to make cash payments to Social Play in the total amount of $120,000, payable in monthly payments of not less than $20,000 until paid in full.
 
On August 22, 2016, the board of directors appointed Robert Rosner as our new President, CEO, CFO and Director. Following these appointments, the board accepted the resignation of Chitan Mistry as our former sole officer and director.
 
Letter of Intent with Spot and Play, Inc.
 On March 11, 2017, we entered into a binding Letter of Intent (the “LOI”) with Spot and Play, Inc. (“Spot and Play”) and its sole shareholder, Karthik Mani. Spot and Play is developing the “Spot and Pay” application, which provides a way to centralize payment or donate money using a unique business code in form of a visual code at location, or using business name if remote. The LOI contemplates our acquisition of up to 100% of Spot and Play for a total purchase price of $1,000,000. Our initial investment will consist of $300,000 in cash, to be paid for a 30% ownership interest in Spot and Play. These funds are to be paid as follows: (i) $50,000 to be paid upon execution of the LOI, (ii) an additional $100,000 to be paid upon certain development milestones for Spot and Play’s business, and no later than 15 days after the execution of a definitive agreement, and (iii) the final $150,000 upon Spot and Play’s achievement of certain additional milestones, and no later than 75 days after the execution of a definitive agreement.

Further, we will be granted the exclusive option to purchase the remaining 70% of Spot and Play to be paid as follows: (i) issuance of shares of our common stock valued at $200,000, no later than 150 days from execution of a definitive agreement, in order to purchase an additional 19% of Spot and Play, and (ii) issuance of shares of our common stock valued at $500,000, no later than 180 days from execution of a definitive agreement, in order to purchase the remaining 51% of Spot and Play. Shares issued as purchase consideration will be valued based on the five-day average trading price of our common stock immediately preceding their issuance. Shares to be issued as consideration for our acquisition of Spot and Play will be subject to a one (1) year lock-up, with certain leak-out restrictions on their re-sale thereafter. Upon our acquisition of 100% of the ownership interests in Spot and Play, Mr. Mani will be granted a royalty based on the gross profits of Spot and Play, with specific royalty terms to be negotiated.
 On April 9, 2018, we entered into a definitive Share Exchange and Funding Agreement (the “Agreement”) with Spot and Pay, Inc., a Nevada corporation (“Spot and Pay”). Under the Agreement, the Company is acquiring a 90% ownership stake in Spot and Pay.
 
Under the Agreement, we acquired 90% of the outstanding capital stock of Spot and Pay from its founder and sole shareholder, Karthikeyan Mani. In exchange, the Company has agreed to issue Mr. Mani 500,000 shares of the common stock of the Company. The Company has agreed to provide a total of $300,000 in funding for development of the Spot & Pay platform. The $300,000 includes $50,000 paid previously to Spot and Pay, together with an additional $250,000 to be paid in one or more tranches over the next 180 days. The Spot & Pay platform as developed after the Agreement will be considered work-for-hire belonging to SocialPlay USA, Inc. Mr. Mani and Spot and Pay will use their best efforts to develop the mobile payment platform, with Mr. Mani to be bound by a two-year non-competition agreement following the conclusion of such efforts. In the event that the Company fails to fund the full $300,000 within 180 days from the Agreement, the Spot and Pay shares acquired by the Company and the Company’s shares issued to Mr. Mani will be returned in part based on a sliding scale set forth in the Agreement.
 
The Company's software development plan has evolved to include a substantially more robust proprietary platform wallet feature that will allow users to create their own wallet so that they may buy and sell bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies directly from the Spot&Pay platform. It also provides seamless abilities to transfer money within the Spot&Pay user network instantly from one account to another without any processing delays. As part of its strategy going forward, SocialPlay will focus significant development efforts on the integration of cryptocurrency and blockchain technologies into its product offerings. 

Working with Spot and Pay, we have recently integrated Bitcoin payments into the Spot&Pay mobile payment platform. Bitcoin is the first digital currency to be added to the existing Spot&Pay payment system infrastructure and allows users an additional choice when it comes to paying for goods and services. In addition to the current method of paying by credit card or direct debit, users can scan a QR code and choose the Bitcoin payment option on the checkout screen. If Bitcoin is selected, Spot&Pay will connect to our gateway and generate the URL for the user to complete the transaction by opening their Bitcoin wallet and providing payment for the purchase.
 The Spot&Pay platform is now integrated with Bitpay, a leading Bitcoin payment gateway and digital currency wallet service and is available on both IOS and Android apps. As the digital currency market continues to grow, Spot and Pay plans to add other cryptocurrencies such as Ethereum, Ripple, and Speedcoin options to its payment solutions.
 Additionally, we are in the initial stages of planning and developing our own reward based cryptocurrency, which will form the basis of a planned strategic User Loyalty Program.

Letter of Intent with Friendship Socks, Inc.
 On May 30, 2017, we entered into a binding Letter of Intent (the “LOI”) with Friendship Socks, Inc., a British Columbia corporation (“Friendship Socks”). Friendship Socks is a company that manufactures a line of unique designer socks in the USA and markets its products online. The company leverages social media to connect people through the gifting of a pair of socks. The LOI contemplates our acquisition of a 33% ownership interest in Friendship Socks for a total purchase price of $150,000. Our initial investment will consist of $50,000 in cash to be delivered immediately for an 11% ownership interest in Friendship Socks. Upon the parties’ execution of a definitive acquisition agreement, we have agreed to acquire an additional 11% interest in exchange for an additional $50,000 upon Friendship Socks achievement of certain business milestones within 30 days of the execution of the definitive agreement. The final 11% ownership interest will be acquired for a final $50,000 upon Friendship Socks achievement of certain additional business milestones within 60 days of the execution of the definitive agreement. Upon completion of all payments as set forth above, Friendship Socks shall immediately issue sufficient shares of its capital in the name of the Company equal to 33% of its issued and outstanding stock. Should the definitive acquisition agreement not be entered into, we shall receive 11% equity interest in Friendship Socks as a result of the initial $50,000 Investment. In the event that the definitive agreement is executed but Friendship Socks does not achieve the specified milestones, we will have the option to waive the milestones and proceed with acquisition of the additional 22% ownership interest or, in the alternative, to terminate the agreement without penalty. Finally, the LOI specifies that will have the right of first refusal with regard to any additional equity investment, loan, or other financing for Friendship Socks. On November 8, 2017 we advanced $30,000 to Friendship Socks.
 Although the agreements with Spot and Play and Friendship Socks have not been extended in writing or amended, the parties to both agreements remain verbally committed to moving forward, and we are working toward completing these acquisitions.
