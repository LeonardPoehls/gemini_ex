ITEM 1: BUSINESS
General
 We are a publicly traded (OTCQB: ATLS) Delaware limited liability company formed in October 2011.
 On February 27, 2015, our former owner, Atlas Energy, L.P. (“Atlas Energy”), transferred its assets and liabilities, other than those related to its midstream assets, to us, and effected a pro rata distribution of our common units representing a 100% interest in us, to Atlas Energy’s unitholders (the “Separation”). Concurrently with the distribution of our units, Atlas Energy and its remaining midstream interests merged with Targa Resources Corp. (“Targa”; NYSE: TRGP) and ceased trading.
 Our operations primarily consisted of our ownership interests in the following:
  
• | All of the incentive distribution rights, an 80.0% general partner interest and a 2.1% limited partner interest in Atlas Growth Partners, L.P. (“AGP”), a Delaware limited partnership and an independent developer and producer of natural gas, crude oil and NGLs with operations primarily focused in the Eagle Ford Shale in South Texas;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | A 12.0% limited partner interest in Lightfoot Capital Partners, L.P. (“Lightfoot L.P.”) and a 15.9% general partner interest in Lightfoot Capital Partners GP, LLC (“Lightfoot G.P.” and together with Lightfoot L.P., “Lightfoot”), the general partner of Lightfoot L.P., an entity for which Jonathan Cohen, Executive Chairman of the Company’s board of directors, is the Chairman of the board of directors. Lightfoot focuses its investments primarily on incubating new MLPs and providing capital to existing MLPs in need of additional equity or structured debt. On August 29, 2017, Lightfoot announced a proposed sale transaction. Please see “Recent Developments—Lightfoot Transactions” for further disclosures regarding Lightfoot;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | A membership interest in the founder shares of Osprey Sponsor, LLC (“Osprey Sponsor”) received in August 2017. Osprey Sponsor is the sponsor of Osprey Energy Acquisition Corp (“Osprey”). We received our membership interest in recognition of potential utilization, if any, of our office space, advisory services and personnel by Osprey. Please see “Recent Developments – Osprey Sponsor Interest” for further disclosures regarding Osprey;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Commencing September 1, 2016, Titan Energy, LLC (“Titan”), an independent developer and producer of natural gas, crude oil and natural gas liquids (“NGL”) with operations in basins across the United States but primarily focused on the horizontal development of resource potential from the Eagle Ford Shale in South Texas. Titan Energy Management, LLC, our wholly owned subsidiary (“Titan Management”), holds the Series A Preferred Share of Titan, which entitles us to receive 2% of the aggregate of distributions paid to shareholders (as if we held 2% of Titan’s members’ equity, subject to potential dilution in the event of future equity interests) and to appoint four of seven directors. Titan sponsors and manages tax-advantaged investment partnerships (the “Drilling Partnerships”), in which it coinvests, to finance a portion of its natural gas, crude oil and NGL production activities. As discussed further below, Titan is the successor to the business and operations of Atlas Resource Partners, L.P. (“ARP”);
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Through August 31, 2016, 100% of the general partner Class A units, all of the incentive distribution rights, and an approximate 23.3% limited partner interest in ARP. As discussed further below, ARP was the predecessor to the business and operations of Titan. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Our cash flows and liquidity are substantially dependent upon AGP’s annual management fee and distributions from AGP, Lightfoot, and Titan. Neither AGP nor Titan are currently paying distributions. Though we consolidate the operations of AGP (and, prior to July 27, 2016, we consolidated the operations of ARP) for financial reporting purposes, AGP’s annual management fee and distributions from Lightfoot are currently our only sources of liquidity to satisfy our obligations, including under our credit agreements.  In addition, Lightfoot completed a portion of its sale transaction that will result in lower quarterly distributions to us. 
 We used the net proceeds from the Lightfoot transaction to repay a portion of the outstanding borrowings under our first lien credit agreement, the maturity of which was recently extended to June 30, 2018. As a result, we continue to face significant liquidity issues and are currently considering, and are likely to make, changes to our capital structure to maintain sufficient liquidity, meet our debt obligations and manage and strengthen our balance sheet.  Without a further extension or 
 7


other significant transaction or capital infusion, we do not expect to have sufficient liquidity to repay our first lien credit agreement at maturity.  Please see “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business— Our long term liquidity requirements and the adequacy of our capital resources are difficult to predict at this time, and we are currently considering, and are likely to make, changes to our capital structure to maintain sufficient liquidity, meet our debt obligations and manage and strengthen our balance sheet.”
 AGP Overview
 As of December 31, 2017, AGP’s production positions were in the following areas:
 Eagle Ford. The Eagle Ford Shale is an Upper Cretaceous-age formation that is prospective for horizontal drilling in approximately 26 counties across South Texas. Target vertical depths range from 4,000 to some 11,000+ feet with thickness from 40 to over 400 feet. The Eagle Ford formation is considered to be the primary source rock for many conventional oil and gas fields including the prolific East Texas Oil Field, one of the largest oil fields in the contiguous United States. AGP acquired its Eagle Ford position through a series of acquisitions in 2014 and 2015 for approximately $100 million. AGP estimates 31 Bcfe of total proved reserves for our Eagle Ford position, of which 87% are oil. Over 92% of AGP’s production volumes and 96% of AGP’s revenues are derived from its Eagle Ford operations.
 Marble Falls. The Marble Falls play is Pennsylvanian-age formation located above the Barnett Shale and beneath the Atoka at depths of approximately 5,500 feet and ranges in thickness from 50 and 500 feet. 
 Mississippi Lime. The Mississippi Lime formation is an expansive carbonate hydrocarbon system and is located at depths between 4,000 and 7,000 feet between the Pennsylvanian-aged Morrow formation and the Devonian-age world- class source rock Woodford Shale formation. The Mississippi Lime formation can reach 600 feet in gross thickness, with a targeted porosity zone between 50 and 100 feet thickness.
Lightfoot Overview
 Lightfoot is a private investment vehicle that focuses on investing directly in master limited partnership-qualifying businesses and assets. Lightfoot investors include affiliates of, and funds under management by, GE EFS, us, BlackRock Investment Management, LLC, Magnetar Financial LLC, CorEnergy Infrastructure Trust, Inc. and Triangle Peak Partners Private Equity, LP. As of December 31, 2016, we own an approximate 15.9% interest in Lightfoot’s general partner and a 12.0% interest in Lightfoot’s limited partner.
 On December 21, 2017, Lightfoot completed a portion of their sale transaction, which resulted in $21.6 million of net proceeds to us.  See Recent Developments below, for further disclosures regarding Lightfoot and the sale transaction.
 Titan Overview
 Titan is a publicly traded (OTCQX: TTEN) Delaware limited liability company and independent developer and producer of natural gas, crude oil and NGLs, with operations in basins across the United States with a focus on the horizontal development of significant resource potential from the Eagle Ford Shale in South Texas. Titan sponsors and manages tax-advantaged investment partnerships (the “Drilling Partnerships”) in which it co-invests, to finance a portion of its natural gas, crude oil and natural gas liquids production activities. Titan Management holds the Series A Preferred Share of Titan, which entitles us to receive 2% of the aggregate of distributions paid to shareholders (as if we held 2% of Titan’s member’ equity, subject to potential dilution in the event of future equity interests) and to appoint four of seven directors. As discussed further in Item 8: Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Note 1, Titan is the successor to the business and operations of ARP.

Recent Developments
 AGP Eagle Ford Drilling. AGP is deploying $6.5 million of cash on hand to drill and complete one Eagle Ford shale well, expected to be in-line during the second quarter of 2018. The well is expected to significantly increase AGP’s production and provide substantial cash flow. The economics of drilling new oil wells across the AGP’s acreage position in the Eagle Ford shale in South Texas have improved substantially over the last twelve months, driven by both a rise in oil prices, as well as significant advancements in drilling and completion technology.
 Credit Agreement Maturity Date Extensions. On April 26, 2018, we entered into an additional agreement with our lenders to extend the maturity date of our first lien credit agreement to June 30, 2018.  See Item 7: Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Liquidity and Ability to Continue as a Going Concern section for further disclosures.
 Lightfoot Transactions. On August 29, 2017, Lightfoot, announced a purchase agreement and plan of merger with Zenith Energy U.S., L.P. (together with its affiliates, “Zenith”), pursuant to which Zenith would acquire the general partner of Arc Logistics Partners, LP and all of the outstanding common units of Arc Logistics Partners, LP, a subsidiary of Lightfoot. On December 21, 2017 Lightfoot completed the first portion of this transaction, which resulted in net proceeds to us of $21.6 million.  We used the net proceeds from this transaction to pay down $21.6 million of outstanding borrowings under our first lien credit agreement.  The remaining portion of the transaction is targeted to close in the second quarter 2018.  We anticipate receiving additional net proceeds of approximately $3.0 million and plan to further pay down outstanding obligations under our first lien credit agreement. See Item 8: Financial Statement and Supplementary Data – Note 2 for additional disclosures regarding the Lightfoot transactions.
 Osprey Sponsor Interest. In August 2017, we received a membership interest in Osprey Sponsor, which is the sponsor of Osprey.  Osprey was formed for the purpose of acquiring, through a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization, or other similar business transaction, one or more operating businesses or assets (a “Business Combination”) that Osprey has not yet identified.  Our membership interest in Osprey Sponsor consists of an allocation of 1,250,000 founder shares, consisting of 1,250,000 shares of Class B common stock of Osprey that are automatically convertible into Class A common stock of Osprey upon the consummation of a business combination on a one-for-one basis.  There can be no certainty, however, that Osprey will consummate a business combination transaction or that we will ultimately experience any value from our interest in Osprey. See Item 8: Financial Statement and Supplementary Data – Note 2 for additional disclosures regarding our Osprey Sponsor Interest.
Gas and Oil Production
 See Item 7 – Management Discussion and Analysis for a summary of our total net natural gas, oil and NGL production volumes, production per day, production revenue and average sales prices for our direct interest natural gas, oil and NGL production.

Natural Gas, Oil and NGL Reserves
 The following tables summarize information regarding our estimated proved natural gas, oil and NGL reserves.  See Item 1A: Risk Factors – Risks Relating to Our Business and Item 8: Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 15 to the financial statements for additional information and considerations regarding the preparation and estimates used in our reserves.
 In accordance with SEC guidelines, we make the standardized measure estimates of future net cash flows from proved reserves using natural gas, oil and NGL sales prices in effect as of the dates of the estimates which are held constant throughout the life of the properties. Our estimates of proved reserves are calculated on the basis of the unweighted adjusted average of the first-day-of-the-month prices for the preceding twelve months from the periods indicated, which are listed below along with our average realized prices over the same twelve month period.
 
 
 | December 31, | 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------+---------------------------------+-------
Unadjusted Prices | 2017 | | 2016 | 
Natural gas (per MMBtu) | $ | 2.98 | | $ | 2.48 
Oil (per Bbl) | $ | 51.34 | | $ | 42.75 
NGLs (per Bbl) | $ | 20.33 | | $ | 19.57 
Average Realized Prices, Before Hedge | | | | | 
Natural gas (per Mcf) | $ | 2.83 | | $ | 2.32

NGLs (per Bbl) | $ | 20.19 | | $ | 13.87 
 | Proved Reserves at December 31, | 
 | 2017 | | 2016 | 
Proved reserves: | | | | | 
Natural gas reserves (MMcf): | | | | | 
Proved developed reserves | | 613 | | | 652 
Proved undeveloped reserves | | 1,253 | | | 780 
Total proved reserves of natural gas | | 1,866 | | | 1,432 
Oil reserves (MBbl): | | | | | 
Proved developed reserves | | 788 | | | 925

Total proved reserves of NGL | | 416 | | | 267 
Total proved reserves (MMcfe) | | 31,213 | | | 23,356
Standardized measure of discounted future cash flows (in thousands) | $ | 40,449 | | $ | 17,381

 Proved developed reserves are those reserves of any category that can be expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods or in which the cost of the required equipment is relatively minor compared to the cost of a new well; and through installed extraction equipment and infrastructure operational at the time of the reserve estimate if the extraction is by means not involving a well. Proved undeveloped reserves are reserves of any category that are expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage, or from existing wells on which a relatively major expenditure is required for recompletion.
 Proved Undeveloped Reserves (“PUDs”)
 PUD Locations. As of December 31, 2017, we had 10 PUD locations totaling approximately 25 net Bcfe of natural gas, oil and NGLs. These PUDs are based on the definition of PUDs in accordance with the SEC’s rules allowing the use of techniques that have been proven effective through documented evidence, such as actual production from projects in the same reservoir or an analogous reservoir or by other evidence using reliable technology that establishes reasonable certainty.
 10


Material changes in PUDs. As of January 1, 2017, we had 10 PUD locations totaling approximately 17 net Bcfeof natural gas, oil, and NGLs.  Material changes in PUDs that occurred during the year ended December 31, 2017 were due to development plan modifications focused on longer lateral lengths, resulting in positive revisions of approximately 8 Bcfe.
 Development Costs. There were no costs incurred for the development of PUDs for the year ended December 31, 2017. As of December 31, 2017, there were no PUDs that had remained undeveloped for five years or more since initial booking.  The proved undeveloped reserves disclosed at December 31, 2017 are included within our five-year development plan and are expected to be developed within five years of the initial disclosure.
Productive Wells
 The following table sets forth information regarding productive natural gas and oil wells in which AGP has a working interest as of December 31, 2017. Productive wells consist of producing wells and wells capable of production, including natural gas wells awaiting pipeline connections to commence deliveries and oil wells awaiting connection to production facilities. Gross wells are the total number of productive wells in which AGP has an interest directly and net wells are the sum of our fractional working interests in gross wells:

 | Number of productive wells(1)
-------------+------------------------------
 | Gross | Net
Gas wells(2) | 13 | 8 
Oil wells(3) | 12 | 9 
Total | 25 | 17 


(1) | There were no exploratory wells drilled in any of our operating areas. There were no gross or net dry wells within any of our operating areas.
----+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(2) | 11 gross gas wells are in our Marble Falls position and 2 gross gas wells are in our Mississippi Lime position.
----+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(3) | 10 gross oil wells are in our Eagle Ford position and 2 gross oil wells are in our Marble Falls position.
----+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Developed and Undeveloped Acreage
 The following table sets forth information about our developed and undeveloped natural gas and oil acreage as of December 31, 2017:
 
 
 | Developed acreage (1) | Undeveloped acreage(2)
---------+-----------------------+-----------------------
 | Gross (3) | Net (4) | Gross (3) | Net (4)
Texas | 4,289 | 4,266 | 816 | 770 
Oklahoma | 76 | 9 | — | — 
Total | 4,365 | 4,275 | 816 | 770 


(1) | Developed acres are acres spaced or assigned to productive wells.
----+------------------------------------------------------------------


(2) | Undeveloped acres are acres on which wells have not been drilled or completed to a point that would permit the production of commercial quantities of natural gas or oil, regardless of whether such acreage contains proved reserves.
----+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(3) | A gross acre is an acre in which we own a working interest. The number of gross acres is the total number of acres in which we own a working interest.
----+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(4) | Net acres is the sum of the fractional working interests owned in gross acres. For example, a 50% working interest in an acre is one gross acre but is 0.5 net acres.
----+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The leases for our developed acreage generally have terms that extend for the life of the wells, while the leases on our undeveloped acreage have primary terms that vary from less than one year to two years with options to extend. There are no concessions for undeveloped acreage as of December 31, 2017. As of December 31, 2017, there are no leases set to expire on or before December 31, 2018 and 2019. 
 We believe that we hold good and indefeasible title related to our producing properties, in accordance with standards generally accepted in the industry, subject to exceptions stated in the opinions of counsel employed by us in the various areas in which we conduct our activities. We do not believe that these exceptions detract substantially from our use of any property. As is customary in the industry, we conduct only a perfunctory title examination at the time we acquire a property. Before we commence drilling operations, we conduct an extensive title examination and we perform curative work on defects 
 11


that we deem significant. We or our predecessors have obtained title examinations for substantially all of our managed producing properties. No single property represents a material portion of our holdings. 
 Our properties are subject to royalty, overriding royalty and other outstanding interests customary in the industry. Our properties are also subject to burdens such as liens incident to operating agreements, taxes, development obligations under natural gas and oil leases, farm-out arrangements and other encumbrances, easements and restrictions. We do not believe that any of these burdens will materially interfere with our use of our properties. 
 Drilling Activities 
 Our drilling activities are conducted mostly on AGP’s undeveloped acreage. There were no gross or net dry wells drilled during the periods presented below. The following table presents the number of wells we drilled and the number of wells we turned in line, both gross and net during the periods indicated: 

 | Years Ended December 31, | 
-------------------------------+--------------------------+--
 | 2017 | | 2016 | | 2015
Gross wells drilled(1) | | — | | — | | —
Net wells drilled(1) | | — | | — | | —
Gross wells turned in line (2) | | — | | 2 | | 6
Net wells turned in line(2) | | — | | 2 | | 6


(1) | There were no exploratory wells drilled for each of the periods presented.
----+---------------------------------------------------------------------------


(2) | Wells turned in line refers to wells that have been drilled, completed and connected to a gathering system. The wells turned in line were in our Eagle Ford position.
----+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We do not operate any of the rigs or related equipment used in our drilling operations, relying instead on specialized subcontractors or joint venture partners for all drilling and completion work. This enables us to streamline operations and conserve capital for investments in new wells, infrastructure and property acquisitions, while generally retaining control over all geological, drilling, engineering and operating decisions. We perform regular inspection, testing and monitoring functions on each of our operated wells.
 As of December 31, 2017, we did not have any ongoing drilling activities.  In 2018, AGP is deploying $6.5 million of cash on hand to drill and complete one Eagle Ford shale well, expected to be turned in-line during the second quarter of 2018. 
 Contractual Revenue Arrangements 
 Natural Gas and Oil Production 
 Natural Gas. We market the majority of our natural gas production to gas marketers directly or to third party plant operators who process and market our gas. The sales price of natural gas produced is a function of the market in the area and typically tied to a regional index. The pricing index for our Eagle Ford production is primarily Houston Ship Channel, primarily Waha for our Marble Falls production and primarily Southern Star for our Mississippi Lime production. 
 We sell the majority of natural gas produced at monthly, fixed index first of the month prices and a smaller portion at index daily prices. We do not have delivery commitments or firm transportation contracts for fixed and determinable quantities of natural gas in any future periods under existing contracts or agreements.
 Crude Oil. Crude oil produced from our wells flows directly into leasehold storage tanks where it is picked up by an oil company or a common carrier acting on behalf of the oil purchaser. The crude oil is typically sold at the prevailing spot market price for each region, less appropriate trucking/pipeline charges. We do not have delivery commitments or firm transportation contracts for fixed and determinable quantities of crude oil in any future periods under existing contracts or agreements. 
 Natural Gas Liquids. NGLs are extracted from the natural gas stream by processing and fractionation plants enabling the remaining “dry” gas to meet pipeline specifications for transport or sale to end users or marketers operating on the receiving pipeline. The resulting plant residue natural gas is sold as indicated above and our NGLs are generally priced and sold using the Mont Belvieu (TX) or Conway (KS) regional processing indices. The cost to process and fractionate the NGLs from the gas stream is typically either a volumetric fee for the gas and liquids processed or a percentage retention by the 
 12


processing and fractionation facility. We do not have delivery commitments or firm transportation contracts for fixed and determinable quantities of NGLs in any future periods under existing contracts or agreements.
 
For the year ended December 31, 2017, Shell Trading Company individually accounted for approximately 91% of AGP’s total natural gas, crude oil and NGLs production revenue with no other single customer accounting for more than 10% for this period, excluding the impact of all financial derivative activity.
 Oil Hedging
 We seek to provide greater stability in our cash flows through our use of financial hedges for our oil production. The financial hedges may include purchases of regulated NYMEX futures and options contracts and non-regulated over-the-counter futures and options contracts with qualified counterparties. Financial hedges are contracts between ourselves and counterparties and do not require physical delivery of hydrocarbons. Financial hedges allow us to mitigate hydrocarbon price risk, and cash is settled to the extent there is a price difference between the hedge price and the actual NYMEX settlement price. Settlement typically occurs on a monthly basis, at the time in the future dictated within the hedge contract. Financial hedges executed in accordance with our secured credit facility do not require cash margin and are secured by our natural gas and oil properties. To assure that the financial instruments will be used solely for hedging price risks and not for speculative purposes, we have a management committee to assure that all financial trading is done in compliance with our hedging policies and procedures. We do not intend to contract for positions that we cannot offset with actual production. 
Natural Gas Gathering Agreements
 Virtually all natural gas produced is gathered through one or more pipeline systems before sale or delivery to a purchaser or an interstate pipeline. A gathering fee can be charged for each gathering activity that is utilized and by each separate gatherer providing the service. Fees will vary depending on the distance the gas travels and whether additional services such as compression, blending, or treating are provided. 
 Marble Falls production in Texas is gathered/processed by a variety of companies depending on the location of the production. As in the case of Mississippi Lime production, either a fee is charged for the gathering activity alone, or a gatherer/processor may provide a combination of services to include processing, fractionation and/or compression. In some instances, the market to which the gas is sold will deduct the third-party gathering fees from the proceeds payable and pay the third-party gatherers directly. 
 Mississippi Lime production is currently gathered and processed by SemGas and plant products including gas and NGL’s are sold to SemGas. SemGas returns 95 Percent of Proceeds of the revenues it receives to us from the sale of gas and NGL’s. The remaining 5% and a $0.3276 MMBtu gathering fee are paid to SemGas for all services provided. 
 Availability of Energy Field Services
 We contract for drilling rigs and purchase goods and services necessary for the drilling and completion of wells from a number of drillers and suppliers, none of which supplies a significant portion of our annual needs. Over the past year, we and other oil and natural gas companies have experienced a significant reduction in drilling and operating costs. We cannot predict the duration or stability of the current level of supply and demand for drilling rigs and other goods and services required for our operations with any certainty due to numerous factors affecting the energy industry, including the supply and demand for natural gas and oil. 
Competition
 The oil and natural gas industry is highly competitive. We encounter strong competition from independent oil and gas companies, MLPs and from major oil and gas companies in acquiring properties, contracting for drilling equipment and arranging for the services of trained personnel. Many of these competitors have financial and technical resources and staffs substantially larger than ours. As a result, our competitors may be able to pay more for desirable leases, or to evaluate, bid for and purchase a greater number of properties or prospects than our financial or other resources will permit. 
 Competition is strong for attractive oil and natural gas properties and there can be no assurances that we will be able to compete satisfactorily when attempting to make acquisitions. In general, sellers of producing properties are influenced primarily by the price offered for the property, although a seller also may be influenced by the financial ability of the purchaser to satisfy post-closing indemnifications, plugging and abandoning operations and similar factors. 
 13


We also may be affected by competition for drilling rigs, human resources and the availability of related oilfield services and equipment. In the past, the oil and natural gas industry has experienced shortages of drilling rigs, equipment, pipe and personnel, which have delayed development drilling and other exploitation activities and have caused significant price increases. We are unable to predict when, or if, such shortages may occur or how they would affect our development and exploitation program. 
 
Environmental Matters and Regulation
 Our operations relating to drilling and waste disposal are subject to stringent and complex laws and regulations pertaining to health, safety and the environment. As operators within the complex natural gas and oil industry, we must comply with laws and regulations at the federal, state and local levels. These laws and regulations can restrict or affect our business activities in many ways, such as by:

• | restricting the way waste disposal is handled;
--+-----------------------------------------------


• | limiting or prohibiting drilling, construction and operating activities in sensitive areas such as wetlands, coastal regions, non-attainment areas, tribal lands or areas inhabited by threatened or endangered species;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | requiring the acquisition of various permits before the commencement of drilling;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | requiring the installation of expensive pollution control equipment and water treatment facilities;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | restricting the types, quantities and concentration of various substances that can be released into the environment in connection with siting, drilling, completion, production, and plugging activities;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | requiring remedial measures to reduce, mitigate and/or respond to releases of pollutants or hazardous substances from existing and former operations, such as pit closure and plugging of abandoned wells;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | enjoining some or all of the operations of facilities deemed in non-compliance with permits issued pursuant to such environmental laws and regulations;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | imposing substantial liabilities for pollution resulting from operations; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | requiring preparation of a Resource Management Plan, an Environmental Assessment, and/or an Environmental Impact Statement with respect to operations affecting federal lands or leases.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of administrative, civil or criminal penalties, the imposition of remedial requirements, and the issuance of orders enjoining future operations. Certain environmental statutes impose strict, joint and several liability for costs required to clean up and restore sites where pollutants or wastes have been disposed or otherwise released. Neighboring landowners and other third parties can file claims for personal injury or property damage allegedly caused by noise and/or the release of pollutants or wastes into the environment. These laws, rules and regulations may also restrict the rate of natural gas and oil production below the rate that would otherwise be possible. The regulatory burden on the natural gas and oil industry increases the cost of doing business in the industry and consequently affects profitability. Additionally, Congress and federal and state agencies frequently enact new, and revise existing, environmental laws and regulations, and any new laws or changes to existing laws that result in more stringent and costly waste handling, disposal and clean-up requirements for the natural gas and oil industry could have a significant impact on our operating costs.
 While we believe that compliance with existing federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations has not had a material adverse effect on our operations, there can be no assurance that compliance with future federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations not have material adverse effects on our business, financial position or results of operations. The trend in environmental regulation is to place more restrictions and limitations on activities that may affect the environment. As a result, there can be no assurance as to the amount or timing of future expenditures for environmental compliance or remediation, and actual future expenditures may be different from the amounts we currently anticipate. Moreover, we cannot assure future events, such as changes in existing laws, the promulgation of new laws, or the development or discovery of new facts or conditions will not cause us to incur significant costs.
 Environmental laws and regulations that could have a material impact on our operations include the following:
 National Environmental Policy Act. Natural gas and oil exploration and production activities on federal lands are subject to the National Environmental Policy Act, or “NEPA.” NEPA requires federal agencies, including the Department of Interior, to evaluate major federal agency actions having the potential to significantly affect the environment. In the course of 
 14


such evaluations, an agency will typically require an Environmental Assessment to assess the potential direct, indirect and cumulative impacts of a proposed project and, if necessary, will prepare a more detailed Environmental Impact Statement that will be made available for public review and comment. All of our proposed exploration and production activities on federal lands, if any, require governmental permits, many of which are subject to the requirements of NEPA. This process has the potential to delay the development of natural gas and oil projects.
 Hydraulic Fracturing.  In recent years, federal, state, and local scrutiny of hydraulic fracturing has increased.  Regulation of the practice remains largely the province of state governments, except for a few federal initiatives proposing disclosure of hydraulic fracturing chemicals, establishing effluent limitations produced water must meet before being discharged to a publicly owned treatment plant, and imposing conditions fracturing operations on federal lands.  This last initiative, under the Bureau of Land Management’s jurisdiction, has been hotly contested and remains unsettled, a federal district court in California invalidating the Trump Administration’s initial efforts to rescind the rule but the Administration proceeding with its plans to rescind.  In December 2016, EPA released the final report of its study of the impacts of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water in the U.S., finding that the hydraulic fracturing water cycle can impact drinking water resources under some circumstances.  Those circumstances included where (1) there are water withdrawals for hydraulic fracturing in times or areas of low water availability, (2) hydraulic fracturing fluids and chemicals or produced water are spilled, (3) hydraulic fracturing fluids are injected into wells with inadequate mechanical integrity, and (4) hydraulic fracturing wastewater is stored or disposed in unlined pits.  While we do not currently expect new federal regulations to be adopted as a result of these findings, if they were, they could increase our cost to operate.
 Common elements of state regulations governing hydraulic fracturing may include, but not be limited to, the following: requirement that logs and pressure test results are included in disclosures to state authorities; disclosure of hydraulic fracturing fluids and chemicals, potentially subject to trade secret/confidential proprietary information protections, and the ratios of same used in operations; specific disposal regimens for hydraulic fracturing fluids; replacement/remediation of contaminated water assets; minimum depth of hydraulic fracturing; and measures aimed at reducing or preventing induced seimiscity, including putting certain areas off limits for hydraulic fracturing.  
 Oil Spills.  The Oil Pollution Act of 1990, as amended (“OPA”), contains numerous requirements relating to the prevention of and response to oil spills into waters of the United States. The OPA subjects owners of facilities to strict, joint and several liability for all containment and cleanup costs and certain other damages arising from a spill, including, but not limited to, the costs of responding to a release of oil to surface waters. While we believe that compliance with OPA has not had a material adverse effect on our operations, future inadvertent noncompliance could result in varying civil and criminal penalties and liabilities.
 Water Discharges. The Federal Water Pollution Control Act, also known as the Clean Water Act, the federal regulations that implement the Clean Water Act, and analogous state laws and regulations impose a number of different types of requirements on our operations.  First, these laws and regulations impose restrictions and strict controls on the discharge of pollutants, including produced waters and other natural gas and oil wastes, into navigable waters of the United States. The discharge of pollutants into regulated waters is prohibited, except in accordance with the terms of a permit issued by the EPA or the relevant state. These permits may require pretreatment of produced waters before discharge. Compliance with such permits and requirements may be costly. Second, the Clean Water Act also prohibits the discharge of dredge and fill material in regulated waters, including wetlands, unless authorized by a permit issued by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.  The precise definition of waters and wetland subject to the dredge-and-fill permit requirement has been enormously complicated and is subject to recurrent litigation and rulemaking.  A broader definition could result in more water and wetlands being subject to protection creating the possibility of additional permitting requirements for some of our existing or future facilities.  Third, the Clean Water Act also requires specified facilities to maintain and implement spill prevention, control and countermeasure plans and to take measures to minimize the risks of petroleum spills.   Federal and state regulatory agencies can impose administrative, civil and criminal penalties for failure to obtain or non-compliance with discharge permits or other requirements of the federal Clean Water Act and analogous state laws and regulations. While we believe that compliance with the Clean Water Act has not had a material adverse effect on our operations, future inadvertent noncompliance could result in varying civil and criminal penalties and liabilities.
 Air Emissions. Our operations are subject to the federal Clean Air Act, as amended, the federal regulations that implement the Clean Air Act, and comparable state laws and regulations. These laws and regulations regulate emissions of air pollutants from various industrial sources, including drilling sites, processing plants, certain storage vessels and compressor stations, and also impose various monitoring and reporting requirements. These laws and regulations also apply to entities that use natural gas as fuel, and may increase the costs of customer compliance to the point where demand for natural gas is affected.  Clean Air Act rules impose additional emissions control requirements and practices on some of our 
 15


operations. Some of our new facilities may be required to obtain permits before work can begin, and existing facilities may be required to incur capital costs in order to comply with new or revised requirements. These regulations may increase the costs of compliance for some facilities. Our failure to comply with these requirements could subject us to monetary penalties, injunctions, conditions or restrictions on operations, and potentially criminal enforcement actions. 
 States are also proposing increasingly stringent requirements for air pollution control and permitting for well sites and compressor stations. For example, in January 2016, the Governor of Pennsylvania announced a comprehensive new regulatory strategy for reducing methane emissions from new and existing oil and natural gas operations, including well sites, compressor stations, and pipelines. Implementation of this strategy will result in significant changes to the air permitting and pollution control standards that apply to the oil and gas industry in Pennsylvania.  It may also influence air programs in other oil and gas-producing states.  In addition, West Virginia issued a sequence of general permits for natural gas production facilities at the well site over recent years.  Industry has expressed its concerns regarding the restrictiveness of versions of general permit, the most recent iteration of which is designated General Permit 70-D.
 While we believe that compliance with existing with the requirements of the Clean Air Act and comparable state laws and regulations has not had a material adverse effect on our operations, we will likely be required to incur certain capital expenditures in the future for air pollution control equipment to comply with applicable regulations and to obtain and maintain operating permits and approvals for air emissions.  We do not expect future requirements to be any more burdensome to us than other similarly situated companies.
 Greenhouse Gas Regulation and Climate Change. To date, legislative and regulatory initiatives relating to greenhouse gas emissions have not had a material impact on our business.  During the prior Administration, several Clean Air Act regulations were adopted to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and a couple foundational finding were upheld by the courts.  During his first year in office, President Trump took steps to rescind and reconsider nearly all of the prior Administration’s initiatives to reduce the nation’s emissions of greenhouse gases.  Some of the foundations, however, appear unyielding.  It would be a significant departure from the principle of stare decisis for the Supreme Court to reverse its decision in Massachusetts v. EPA, 549 U.S. 497 (2007) holding that greenhouse gases are “air pollutants” covered by the Clean Air Act.  Similarly, reversing EPA’s final determination that greenhouse gases “endanger” public health and welfare, 74 Fed. Reg. 66,496 (Dec. 15, 2009), upheld in Coalition for Responsible Regulation, Inc. v. EPA, 684 F.3d 102 (D.C. Cir. 2012), would seem to require development of new scientific evidence that runs counter to general discoveries since that determination.  
 On March 28, 2017, President Trump issued an Executive Order on Promoting Energy Independence and Economic Growth explaining how his Administration would withdraw, rescind, revisit, or revise virtually every element the Obama Administration’s program for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Under the Executive Order, some actions had immediate effect.  Other actions, including those most directly affecting our operations and the overall consumption of fossil fuels, will be the subject of potentially lengthy notice-and-comment rule-making.  With respect to rules more directly applicable to the types of operations we conduct, federal agencies have begun the rule-making as directed by the Executive Order.  Initial efforts to revise or rescind 2015 methane emissions standards for new or modified wells were invalidated by the courts but corrective rule-making initiated.  As described in connection with the foregoing discussion of federal regulation of hydraulic fracturing operations, a similar pattern of court rejection of initial efforts followed by rehabilitative rule-making has occurred. With respect to rules of greater applicability affecting overall consumption of fossil fuels, federal agencies have also initiated rule-making to give effect to the Executive Order.  The most sweeping action was an advanced notice of proposed rule-making seeking comment on whether a replacement for the 2015 Clean Power Plan – the rule aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions from existing power plants by one-third (compared to 2005 levels) – was needed.  
 While we generally foresee a less stringent approach to the regulation of greenhouse gases, undoing the prior Administration’s greenhouse gas emissions regulations will necessarily involve lengthy notice-and-comment rulemaking and the resulting decisions may then be subject to litigation by those opposed to rescinding the prior Administration’s regulations.  It could be several years before the precise regulatory framework is known.  Opponents of the rescissions, including states and environmental groups, may then decide to sue large sources of greenhouse gas emissions for the alleged nuisance created by such emissions.  In 2011, the Supreme Court held that federal common law nuisance claims were displaced by the EPA’s authority to regulate greenhouse gas emissions from large sources of emissions. If the Administration fails to pursue regulation of emissions from such sources or takes the position that it has no authority to do regulate their emissions, then it is possible that a court would find common law nuisance claims are no longer displaced.    
 Although further regulation of greenhouse gas emissions from our operations may stall at the federal level, it is possible that, in the absence of federal regulation, states may pursue additional regulation of our operations, including restrictions on new and existing wells and fracturing operations, as many states already have done.

Waste Handling. The Solid Waste Disposal Act, including RCRA, and comparable state statutes regulate the generation, transportation, treatment, storage, disposal and cleanup of “hazardous wastes” and the disposal of non-hazardous wastes. With authority granted by federal EPA, individual states administer some or all of the provisions of RCRA, sometimes in conjunction with their own more stringent requirements. Drilling fluids, produced waters, and most of the other wastes associated with the exploration, development and production of crude oil and natural gas constitute “solid wastes,” which are regulated under the less stringent non-hazardous waste provisions, but there is no guarantee that the EPA or individual states will not adopt more stringent requirements for the handling of non-hazardous wastes or categorize some non-hazardous wastes as hazardous in the future. Moreover, ordinary industrial wastes such as paint wastes, waste solvents, laboratory wastes, and waste compressor oils may be regulated as “solid waste.” The transportation of natural gas in pipelines may also generate some “hazardous wastes” that are subject to RCRA or comparable state law requirements.  While we believe that compliance with the requirements of RCRA and related state and local laws and regulations has not had a material adverse effect on our operations, future inadvertent noncompliance could result in varying civil and criminal penalties and liabilities. More stringent regulation of natural gas and oil exploration and production wastes could increase the costs to manage and dispose of such wastes.
 CERCLA. The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (“CERCLA”), also known as the “Superfund” law, imposes joint and several liability, without regard to fault or legality of conduct, on persons who are considered under the statute to be responsible for the release of a “hazardous substance” (but excluding petroleum) into the environment. These persons include the owner or operator of the site where the release occurred and companies that disposed or arranged for the disposal of the hazardous substance at the site. Under CERCLA, such persons may be liable for the costs of cleaning up the hazardous substances that have been released into the environment, for damages to natural resources, and for the costs of certain health studies. In addition, it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the hazardous substances released into the environment.  Our operations are, in many cases, conducted at properties that have been used for natural gas and oil exploitation and production for many years. Although we believe that we utilized operating and waste disposal practices that were standard in the industry at the time, hazardous substances may have been released on or under the properties owned or leased by us or on or under other locations, including off-site locations, where such substances have been taken for disposal.  While we are not presently aware the need for us to respond to releases of hazardous substances that would impose costs that would be material to our financial condition, there can be no assurance that no such incidents will occur in the future.
 OSHA and Chemical Reporting Regulations. We are subject to the requirements of the federal Occupational Safety and Health Act, or “OSHA,” and comparable state statutes.  On March 25, 2016, OSHA published its final Occupational Exposure to Respirable Crystalline Silica final rule, which imposes specific requirements to protect workers engaged in hydraulic fracturing.  81 Fed. Reg. 16,285.  The requirements of that final rule as it applies to hydraulic fracturing become effective June 23, 2018, except for the engineering controls component of the final rule, which has a compliance date of June 23, 2021.  We expect implementation of the rule to result in significant costs.  The OSHA hazard communication standard, the EPA community right-to-know regulations under Title III of CERCLA, and similar state statutes require that we organize and/or disclose information about hazardous materials used or produced in our operations.  If the sectors to which community-right-to-know or similar chemical inventory reporting are expanded, our regulatory burden could increase.  While we believe that compliance with these applicable requirements and with other OSHA and comparable requirements has not had a material adverse effect on our operations, future inadvertent noncompliance could result in varying civil and criminal penalties and liabilities.
 Hydrogen Sulfide. Exposure to gas containing high levels of hydrogen sulfide, referred to as sour gas, is harmful to humans and can result in death. We conduct our natural gas extraction activities in certain formations where hydrogen sulfide may be, or is known to be, present. We employ numerous safety precautions at our operations to ensure the safety of our employees. There are various federal and state environmental and safety requirements for handling sour gas, and we are in substantial compliance with all such requirements.
 Drilling and Production. State laws regulate the size and shape of drilling and spacing units or proration units governing the pooling of natural gas and oil properties. Some states allow forced pooling or integration of tracts to facilitate exploitation while other states rely on voluntary pooling of lands and leases. In some instances, forced pooling or unitization may be implemented by third parties and may reduce our interest in the unitized properties. In addition, state conservation laws establish maximum rates of production from natural gas and oil wells, generally prohibit the venting or flaring of natural gas, and impose requirements regarding the ratability of production. These laws and regulations may limit the amount of natural gas and oil we can produce from our or its wells or limit the number of wells or the locations at which we can drill. Moreover, each state generally imposes a production or severance tax or impact fee with respect to the production and sale of oil, natural gas and NGLs within its jurisdiction.
 17


State Regulation and Taxation of Drilling. The various states regulate the drilling for, and the production, gathering and sale of, natural gas, including imposing severance taxes and requirements for obtaining drilling permits. For example, Pennsylvania has imposed an impact fee on wells drilled into an unconventional formation, which includes the Marcellus Shale. The impact fee, which changes from year to year, is based on the average annual price of natural gas as determined by the NYMEX price, as reported by the Wall Street Journal for the last trading day of each calendar month. For example, based upon natural gas prices for 2015, the impact fee for qualifying unconventional horizontal wells spudded during 2015 was $45,300 per well, while the impact fee for unconventional vertical wells was $9,100 per well. The payment structure for the impact fee makes the fee due the year after an unconventional well is spudded, and the fee will continue for 15 years for an unconventional horizontal well and 10 years for an unconventional vertical well. States also regulate the method of developing new fields, the spacing and operation of wells and the prevention of waste of natural gas resources.
 States may regulate rates of production and may establish maximum limits on daily production allowable from natural gas wells based on market demand or resource conservation, or both. States do not regulate wellhead prices or engage in other similar direct economic regulation, but there can be no assurance that they will not do so in the future. The effect of these regulations may be to limit the amounts of natural gas that may be produced from our wells, the type of wells that may be drilled in the future in proximity to existing wells and to limit the number of wells or locations from which we can drill. Texas imposes a 7.5% tax on the market value of natural gas sold, 4.6% on the market value of condensate and oil produced and an oil field clean up regulatory fee of $0.000667 per Mcf of gas produced,  a regulatory tax of $.001875 and the oil field clean-up fee of $.00625 per barrel of crude. New Mexico imposes, among other taxes, a severance tax of up to 3.75% of the value of oil and gas produced, a conservation tax of up to 0.24% of the oil and gas sold, and a school emergency tax of up to 3.15% for oil and 4% for gas. Alabama imposes a production tax of up to 2% on oil or gas and a privilege tax of up to 8% on oil or gas. Oklahoma imposes a gross production tax of 7% per Bbl of oil, up to 7% per Mcf of natural gas and a petroleum excise tax of .095% on the gross production of oil and gas.
 The petroleum industry is also subject to compliance with various other federal, state and local regulations and laws. Some of those laws relate to occupational safety, resource conservation and equal employment opportunity. We do not believe that compliance with these laws will have a material adverse effect upon our unitholders.
 Other Regulation of the Natural Gas and Oil Industry. The natural gas and oil industry is extensively regulated by federal, state and local authorities. Legislation affecting the natural gas and oil industry is under constant review for amendment or expansion, frequently increasing the regulatory burden on the industry. Also, numerous departments and agencies, both federal and state, are authorized by statute to issue rules and regulations binding on the natural gas and oil industry and its individual members, some of which carry substantial penalties for failure to comply. Although the regulatory burden on the natural gas and oil industry increases our cost of doing business and, consequently, affects our profitability, these burdens generally do not affect us any differently or to any greater or lesser extent than they affect other companies in their industries with similar types, quantities and locations of production.
 Legislation continues to be introduced in Congress and development of regulations continues in the Department of Homeland Security and other agencies concerning the security of industrial facilities, including natural gas and oil facilities. Our operations may be subject to such laws and regulations. Presently, it is not possible to accurately estimate the potential costs to comply with any such facility security laws or regulations, but such expenditures could be substantial.
