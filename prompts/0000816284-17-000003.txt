ITEM 1.    BUSINESS
Celgene Corporation, together with its subsidiaries (collectively “we,” “our,”  “us,” “Celgene” or the “Company”), is an integrated global biopharmaceutical company engaged primarily in the discovery, development and commercialization of innovative therapies for the treatment of cancer and inflammatory diseases through next-generation solutions in protein homeostasis, immuno-oncology, epigenetics, immunology and neuro-inflammation. Celgene Corporation was incorporated in the State of Delaware in 1986.
Our primary commercial stage products include REVLIMID®, POMALYST®/IMNOVID®, OTEZLA®, ABRAXANE®, VIDAZA®, azacitidine for injection (generic version of VIDAZA®) and THALOMID® (sold as THALOMID® or Thalidomide Celgene® outside of the U.S.). In addition, we earn revenue from other product sales and licensing arrangements.
We continue to invest substantially in research and development in support of multiple ongoing proprietary clinical development programs which support our existing products and pipeline of new drug candidates. Our clinical trial activity includes trials across the disease areas of hematology, solid tumors, and inflammation and immunology. REVLIMID® is in several phase III trials covering a range of hematological malignancies that include multiple myeloma, lymphomas and myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). In solid tumors, ABRAXANE® is currently in various stages of investigation for breast, pancreatic and non-small cell lung cancers. In inflammation and immunology, OTEZLA® is being evaluated in phase III trials for Behçet's disease, ankylosing spondylitis, psoriatic arthritis and plaque psoriasis. We also have a growing number of potential products in phase III trials across multiple diseases. In the inflammation and immunology therapeutic area, we have phase III trials underway for ozanimod in relapsing multiple sclerosis (RMS) and ulcerative colitis (UC) and for GED-0301 (mongersen) in Crohn’s disease. In hematology, phase III trials are underway for CC-486 and luspatercept in MDS, for CC-486 and AG-221 (enasidenib) in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and for luspatercept in beta-thalassemia. In the fourth quarter of 2016, we submitted a new drug application (NDA) for enasidenib for the treatment of patients with relapsed or refractory AML with isocitrate dehydrogenase-2 (IDH2) mutation.
Beyond our phase III programs, we have access to a growing early-to-mid-stage pipeline of novel potential therapies to address significant unmet medical needs that consists of new drug candidates and cell therapies developed in-house, licensed from other companies or able to be optioned from collaboration partners. We believe that continued use of our primary commercial stage products, participation in research and development collaboration arrangements, depth of our product pipeline, potential regulatory approvals of new products and new indications for existing products will provide the catalysts for future growth.

VIDAZA® (azacitidine for injection): VIDAZA® is a pyrimidine nucleoside analog that has been shown to reverse the effects of DNA hypermethylation and promote subsequent gene re-expression. VIDAZA® is a Category 1 recommended treatment for patients with intermediate-2 and high-risk MDS, according to the National Comprehensive Cancer Network. The U.S. regulatory exclusivity for VIDAZA® expired in May 2011. After the launch of a generic version of VIDAZA® in the United States by a competitor in September 2013, we experienced a significant reduction in our U.S. sales of VIDAZA®. In 2013, we contracted with Sandoz AG (Sandoz) to sell a generic version of VIDAZA® in the United States, which we supply, and we recognize net product sales from our sales to Sandoz. Regulatory exclusivity for VIDAZA® is expected to continue in Europe through 2019. VIDAZA® is approved in the United States and many international markets for the following uses:

REVLIMID®, POMALYST® and THALOMID® are distributed in the United States primarily through contracted pharmacies under the REVLIMID® Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS), POMALYST REMS® and THALOMID REMS® programs, respectively. These are proprietary risk-management distribution programs tailored specifically to provide for the safe and appropriate distribution and use of REVLIMID®, POMALYST® and THALOMID®. Internationally, REVLIMID®, THALOMID®/Thalidomide Celgene® and IMNOVID® are distributed under mandatory risk-management distribution programs tailored to meet local authorities’ specifications to provide for the product’s safe and appropriate distribution and use. These programs may vary by country and, depending upon the country and the design of the risk-management program, the product may be sold through hospitals or retail pharmacies. VIDAZA®, ABRAXANE®, and OTEZLA® are distributed through the more 
4

traditional pharmaceutical industry supply chain and are not subject to the same risk-management distribution programs as REVLIMID®, POMALYST®/IMNOVID® and THALOMID®/Thalidomide Celgene®.
PRECLINICAL AND CLINICAL-STAGE PIPELINE
Our preclinical and clinical-stage pipeline of new drug candidates and cell therapies is highlighted by multiple classes of both small molecule and biologic therapeutic agents designed to selectively regulate disease-associated genes and proteins. These product candidates are at various stages of preclinical and clinical development.
Immune-Inflammatory Diseases:  OTEZLA® (apremilast) a novel PDE4 inhibitor, is being studied in clinical trials in ankylosing spondylitis, Behçet's disease, atopic dermatitis, and ulcerative colitis, and is approved in psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis. Differentiated oral therapies are advancing through mid- to late-stage trials in inflammatory diseases, including GED-0301, a potential first-in-class smad7 anti-sense treatment, with a phase III program in Crohn’s Disease (CD) recruiting subjects, and a phase II trial in UC fully enrolled. In addition, ozanimod is a potential best-in-class S1P receptor modulator, with a phase III trial fully enrolled in RMS, a phase III trial in UC underway, and a phase II trial in CD fully enrolled. Other potential oral therapies include, CC-220 for systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), CC-90001 for Fibrosis and ABX-1431 for multiple sclerosis spasticity. In addition, a phase I trial in healthy volunteers is in progress for CC-90006, an injectable PD-1 agonist antibody for autoimmune disorders. 
Other Myeloid Diseases: We have collaborated with Acceleron Pharma, Inc. (Acceleron) to develop luspatercept (ACE-536). 
We are evaluating luspatercept for the treatment of patients with beta-thalassemia and MDS in phase III trials.
Epigenetics: The current insights into molecular regulation of genetic information (Epigenetics) have the potential to transform human diseases. We currently market two epigenetic modifiers, VIDAZA® and ISTODAX®. We have two phase III trials of CC-486 (oral 5-azacitidine) currently enrolling to evaluate its efficacy in the treatment of MDS and AML and two on-going phase II trials of CC-486 in solid tumors. We acquired the IDH2 inhibitor enasidenib from Agios Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Agios) and have submitted a NDA to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for relapsed/refractory AML with IDH2 mutations. We are currently evaluating enasidenib in combination with VIDAZA® in newly diagnosed AML with IDH2 mutations. We are also evaluating AG-881 (IDH1 and IDH2 inhibitor) in glioma with IDH mutations, in collaboration with Agios. Additionally, a phase I trial of LSD1 inhibitor (CC-90011) is underway in Non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) and solid tumors.
Protein Homeostasis:  CC-122 (Cereblon Modulator, or CELMoD®) and CC-220 represent novel compounds that are in phase I and phase II clinical trials, both as single agents and in combination, for hematological and solid tumor cancers and inflammation and immunology diseases. They have been differentiated from previous compounds (such as thalidomide, lenalidomide and pomalidomide) and have been developed based on our scientific understanding of Cereblon-mediated protein homeostasis. CC-90009 is a unique cereblon targeted molecule, currently in phase I, whose activity is related to the depletion of a novel substrate and which has been identified active in AML models.
Immuno-Oncology: The strategic collaboration with Astra Zeneca/Medimmune evaluating durvalumab, an anti-PDL-1 antibody, in multiple hematological cancers in combination with REVLIMID®, POMALYST®, VIDAZA® and CC-486 is underway with phase III enabling data expected in 2017. JCAR17, the CD19 CAR-T program under collaboration with Juno Therapeutics, Inc. (Juno), has been granted Breakthrough Therapy designation by the FDA and has been given access to the Priority Medicines scheme by the EMA CHMP. Interim data for JCAR17 shows high complete response rates in NHL, with manageable safety profiles. A pivotal program in NHL will be initiated in 2017. BCMA is emerging as a compelling target in multiple myeloma (MM) and in this regard, we have invested in some critical assets. The bluebird bb2121 BCMA CAR-T early phase I data has shown impressive efficacy with a good safety profile. With the acquisition of EngMab AG (EngMab) in 2016, we also will develop a BCMA targeted T cell engager program in MM with an Investigational New Drug (IND) expected by end of 2017. Our anti-CD47 antibody targeting macrophage activity, CC-90002, is currently in phase I trials, being evaluated for the treatment of multiple cancers, including NHL and AML. Three additional programs from our collaboration partners Lycera Corp. (Lycera) (RORg agonist), Jounce Therapeutics, Inc. (Jounce) (anti-ICOS-agonist) and OncoMed Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (OncoMed) (anti-TIGIT antibody) are progressing into clinical testing in multiple solid tumor indications.
PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT
We devote significant resources to research and development programs in an effort to discover and develop potential future product candidates. Research and development expenses amounted to $4.470 billion in 2016, $3.697 billion in 2015, and $2.431 billion in 2014. The product candidates in our pipeline are at various stages of preclinical and clinical development. The path to regulatory approval ordinarily includes three phases of clinical trials in which we collect data to support an application to regulatory authorities to allow us to market a product for treatment of a specified disease. There are many difficulties and uncertainties 
5

inherent in research and development of new products, resulting in a high rate of failure. To bring a drug from the discovery phase to regulatory approval, and ultimately to market, takes many years and significant cost. Failure can occur at any point in the process, including after the product is approved, based on post-marketing events or developments. New product candidates that appear promising in development may fail to reach the market or may have only limited commercial success because of efficacy or safety concerns, inability to obtain necessary regulatory approvals, limited scope of approved uses, reimbursement challenges, difficulty or excessive costs of manufacture, alternative therapies or infringement of the patents or intellectual property rights of others. Uncertainties in the U.S. FDA approval process and the approval processes in other countries can result in delays in product launches and lost market opportunities. Consequently, it is very difficult to predict which products will ultimately be submitted for approval, which will obtain approval and which will be commercially viable and generate profits. Successful results in preclinical or clinical studies may not be an accurate predictor of the ultimate safety or effectiveness of a drug or product candidate.
Phase I Clinical Trials
Phase I clinical trials begin when regulatory agencies allow initiation of clinical investigation of a new drug or product candidate and usually involve up to 80 healthy volunteers or subjects. These trials study a drug's safety profile, and may include a preliminary determination of a drug or product candidate's safe dosage range. The phase I clinical trial also determines how a drug is absorbed, distributed, metabolized and excreted by the body, and therefore the potential duration of its action. Phase I clinical trials generally take from one to three years to complete.
Phase II Clinical Trials
Phase II clinical trials are conducted on a limited number of subjects with the targeted disease. An initial evaluation of the drug's effectiveness on subjects is performed and additional information on the drug's safety and dosage range is obtained. Phase II clinical trials normally include up to several hundred subjects and may take as many as two to three years to complete.
Phase III Clinical Trials
Phase III clinical trials are typically controlled multi-center trials that involve a larger target patient population that normally consists of several hundred to several thousand subjects to ensure that study results are statistically significant. During phase III clinical trials, physicians monitor subjects to determine efficacy and to gather further information on safety. These trials are generally global in nature and are designed to generate the clinical data necessary to submit an application for marketing approval to regulatory agencies. Phase III clinical trial testing varies by disease state, but can often last from two to seven years.
Regulatory Review
If a product candidate successfully completes clinical trials and trial data is submitted to governmental regulators, such as the FDA in the United States or the European Commission (EC) in the European Union, the time to final marketing approval can vary from six months (for a U.S. filing that is designated for priority review by the FDA) to several years, depending on a number of variables, such as the disease state, the strength and complexity of the data presented, the novelty of the target or compound, risk-management approval and whether multiple rounds of review are required for the regulatory agency to evaluate the submission. There is no guarantee that a potential treatment will receive marketing approval, or that decisions on marketing approvals or treatment indications will be consistent across geographic areas.

PATENTS AND PROPRIETARY TECHNOLOGY
We consider intellectual property protection to be critical to our operations. For many of our products, in addition to compound (e.g., drug substance) and composition (e.g., drug product) patents, we hold polymorph, formulation, methods of treatment or use, delivery mechanism and methods of manufacture patents, as well as manufacturing trade secrets, that may extend exclusivity beyond the expiration of the compound patent or composition patent.
Key patent expirations and exclusivities:
The following table shows the expected expiration dates in the United States and Europe of the last-to-expire period of exclusivity (primary patent or regulatory approval) related to our primary marketed drug products. In some instances, there are later-expiring patents relating to particular forms or compositions, methods of manufacturing, or use of the drug in the treatment of particular diseases or conditions. However, such additional patents may not protect our drug products from generic competition after the expiration of the primary patent.

1 | The patents covering these drugs include patents listed in the U.S. Orange Book. The date provided reflects the last-to-expire key patent as listed in the U.S. Orange Book, which may not be the last date on which all relevant patents (e.g., polymorph and manufacturing patents) expire.


2 | In December 2015, we announced the settlement of litigations with Natco Pharma Ltd. and its partners and affiliates, relating to certain patents for REVLIMID®. As part of the settlement, we agreed to provide Natco with a volume-limited license to sell generic lenalidomide in the U.S. commencing in March 2022, which is expected to be a mid-single-digit percentage of the total lenalidomide capsules dispensed in the U.S. during the first year and is expected to increase gradually each twelve months until March 2025, and is not expected to exceed one-third of the total lenalidomide capsules dispensed in the U.S. in the final year of the volume-limited license. Natco’s ability to market generic lenalidomide in the U.S. will be contingent on its obtaining approval of an Abbreviated New Drug Application.

8 | Application for Patent Term Extension pending, receipt of which would extend exclusivity through 2028.

The term of individual patents and patent applications will depend upon the legal term of the patents in the countries in which they are obtained. In the United States, the patent term is 20 years from the date of filing of the patent application although term extensions are available. We may obtain patents for certain products many years before marketing approval is obtained for those products. Because of the limited life of patents, which ordinarily commences prior to the commercial sale of the related product, the commercial value of the patent may be limited. However, we may be able to obtain patent term extensions upon marketing approval. For example, SPCs on some of our products have been granted in a number of European countries, compensating in part for delays in obtaining marketing approval. Also, under the Hatch-Waxman Act, the term of a patent that covers an FDA-approved drug may also be eligible for patent term extension (for up to five years, but not beyond a total of 14 years from the date of product approval) as compensation for patent term lost during the FDA regulatory review process. When possible, depending upon the length of clinical trials and other factors involved in the filing of a NDA with the FDA, we expect to apply for patent term extensions for patents covering our drug products and their use in treating various diseases.
In most cases, our drugs are also covered in foreign countries by patents and patent applications that correspond to certain of those listed in the U.S. Orange Book. For example, patents related to the active pharmaceutical ingredient, uses and pharmaceutical compositions for most of our drugs have been granted in Europe. Although certain of the patents granted by the regulatory authorities of the European Union may expire at specific dates, patents granted in certain European countries, such as Spain, France, Italy, Germany and the United Kingdom, will extend beyond such European Union patent expiration date due to the SPCs granted in these countries for many of our drugs. The table above may also reflect patents in Europe that relate to certain polymorphic forms of the active pharmaceutical ingredient of our drugs.
Patent term extensions have been granted in other markets for certain of our patents related to REVLIMID®. Patent term extensions for certain of our patents related to lenalidomide have been granted in Europe, Australia, Korea, Japan and Russia. Further, patent term extensions for certain of our patents related to ABRAXANE® have been secured and/or are actively being sought in Europe, Australia, Japan, Russia and Korea. We are also considering alternative exclusivity strategies, mostly through international treaties, in a variety of countries throughout Latin America.
The existence of issued patents does not guarantee our right to practice the patented technology or commercialize the patented product. Third parties may have or obtain rights to patents which could be used to prevent or attempt to prevent us from commercializing the patented product candidates. Patents relating to pharmaceutical, biopharmaceutical and biotechnology products, compounds and processes, such as those that cover our existing compounds, products and processes and those that we will likely file in the future, do not always provide complete or adequate protection. Future litigation or re-examination proceedings (including oppositions and invalidity proceedings such as interparty reviews) regarding the enforcement or validity of our existing patents or any future patents could invalidate such patents or substantially reduce their protection.
Our patents are subject to challenge by generic drug companies and others for a variety of reasons. For more information regarding challenges to certain of our patents, see Item 1A. "Risk Factors” and Note 18 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

As of December 31, 2016, we owned or had exclusively licensed 730 issued U.S. patents and 593 additional pending U.S. patent applications. We have a policy to seek broad global patent protection for our inventions and have foreign patent rights corresponding to most of our U.S. patents.
Trade secret strategies and intellectual property rights in our brand names, logos and trademarks are also important to our business. We maintain both registered and common law trademarks. Common law trademark protection typically continues where and for as long as the mark is used. Registered trademarks continue in each country for as long as the trademark is registered.
GOVERNMENTAL REGULATION
General:  Regulation by governmental authorities in the United States and other countries is a significant factor in the manufacture and marketing of pharmaceuticals and in our ongoing research and development activities. Our therapeutic products require regulatory approval by governmental agencies. Human therapeutic products are subject to rigorous preclinical testing and clinical trials and other pre-marketing and post-marketing approval requirements of the FDA and regulatory authorities in other countries. In the United States, various federal and, in some cases, state statutes and regulations also govern, or impact the manufacturing, testing for safety and effectiveness, labeling, storage, record-keeping and marketing of, such products. The lengthy process of seeking required approvals and the continuing need for compliance with applicable statutes and regulations, require the expenditure of substantial resources. Regulatory approval, if and when obtained, may be limited in scope, which may significantly limit the uses for which a product may be promoted. Further, approved drugs, as well as their manufacturers, are subject to ongoing post-marketing review, inspection and discovery of previously unknown problems with such products or the manufacturing or quality control procedures used in their production, which may result in restrictions on their manufacture, sale or use or in their withdrawal from the market. Any failure or delay by us, our suppliers of manufactured drug product, collaborators or licensees, in obtaining regulatory approvals could adversely affect the marketing of our products and our ability to receive product revenue, license revenue or profit sharing payments. For more information, see Item 1A. “Risk Factors.”
Clinical Development:  Before a product may be administered to human subjects, it must undergo preclinical testing. Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluation of a product candidate's chemistry and biological activities and animal studies to assess potential safety and efficacy. The results of these studies must be submitted to the FDA as part of an IND application which must be reviewed by the FDA primarily for safety considerations before clinical trials in humans can begin.
Typically, clinical trials in humans involve a three-phase process as previously described under “- Product Development.”
In some cases, further studies beyond the three-phase clinical trial process described above are required as a condition for an NDA or biologics license application (BLA) approval. The FDA requires monitoring of all aspects of clinical trials and reports of all adverse events must be made to the FDA. The FDA may also require the conduct of pediatric studies for the drug and indication either before or after submission of an NDA.
FDA Review and Approval:  The results of the preclinical testing and clinical trials are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA or BLA for evaluation to determine if there is substantial evidence that the product is sufficiently safe and effective to warrant approval. In responding to an NDA or BLA, the FDA may grant marketing approval, deny approval, or request additional information, including data from new clinical trials. Modifications to an approved drug or biologic, including new indication or changes to labeling or manufacturing processes or facilities, may require the submission and approval of a supplemental NDA or BLA before modifications can be implemented, which may require that we develop additional data or conduct additional preclinical and clinical trials.
Expedited Programs for Serious Conditions:  The FDA has developed four distinct approaches to make new drugs available as rapidly as possible in cases where there is no available treatment or there are advantages over existing treatments.
The FDA may grant “accelerated approval” to products that have been studied for their safety and effectiveness in treating serious or life-threatening illnesses and that provide meaningful therapeutic benefit to patients over existing treatments. For accelerated approval, the product must have an effect on a surrogate endpoint or an intermediate clinical endpoint that is considered reasonably likely to predict the clinical benefit of a drug, such as an effect on irreversible morbidity and mortality. When approval is based on surrogate endpoints or clinical endpoints other than survival or morbidity, the sponsor will be required to conduct additional post-approval clinical studies to verify and describe clinical benefit. These studies are known as "confirmatory trials." Approval of a drug may be withdrawn or the labeled indication of the drug changed if these trials fail to verify clinical benefit or do not demonstrate sufficient clinical benefit to justify the risks associated with the drug.
11

The FDA may grant “fast track” status to products that treat serious diseases or conditions and demonstrate the potential to address an unmet medical need. Fast track is a process designed to facilitate the development and expedite the review of such products by providing, among other things, more frequent meetings with the FDA to discuss the product's development plan, more frequent written correspondence from the FDA about trial design, eligibility for accelerated approval if relevant criteria are met, and rolling review, which allows submission of individually completed sections of an NDA or BLA for FDA review before the entire submission is completed. Fast track status does not ensure that a product will be developed more quickly or receive FDA approval.
“Breakthrough Therapy” designation is a process designed to expedite the development and review of drugs that are intended to treat a serious condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over available therapy on a clinically significant endpoint. For drugs and biologics that have been designated as Breakthrough Therapies, robust FDA-sponsor interaction and communication can help to identify the most efficient and expeditious path for clinical development while minimizing the number of patients placed in ineffective control regimens.
The FDA may grant “priority review” status to products that, if approved, would provide significant improvement in the safety or effectiveness of the treatment, diagnosis, or prevention of serious conditions. Priority review is intended to reduce the time it takes for the FDA to review an NDA or BLA, with the goal to take action on the application within six months, compared to ten months for a standard review.
Orphan Drug Act: Under the United States Orphan Drug Act, a sponsor may request that the FDA designate a drug intended to treat a “rare disease or condition” as an “orphan drug.” A “rare disease or condition” is one which affects less than 200,000 people in the United States, or which affects more than 200,000 people, but for which the cost of developing and making available the product is not expected to be recovered from sales of the product in the United States. Upon the approval of the first NDA or BLA for a drug designated as an orphan drug for a specified indication, the sponsor of that NDA or BLA is entitled to seven years of exclusive marketing rights in the United States unless the sponsor cannot assure the availability of sufficient quantities to meet the needs of persons with the disease. However, orphan drug status is particular to the approved indication and does not prevent another company from seeking approval of an off-patent drug that has other labeled indications that are not under orphan or other exclusivities. Orphan drugs may also be eligible for federal income tax credits for costs associated with the drugs' development. In order to increase the development and marketing of drugs for rare disorders, regulatory bodies outside the United States have enacted regulations similar to the Orphan Drug Act.
Review and Approval Outside of the United States:  Approval procedures must be undertaken in virtually every other country comprising the market for our products. The approval procedure and the time required for approval vary from country to country and may involve additional testing. In certain countries such as the EU countries, Switzerland, Canada and Australia, regulatory requirements and approval processes are similar to those in the United States, where approval decisions by regulators are based on the regulators’ review of the results of clinical trials performed for specific indications. Other countries may have a less comprehensive review process in terms of data requirements and may rely on prior marketing approval from a foreign regulatory authority in other countries such as the United States or the EU.
Manufacturing Quality Control:  Among the conditions for NDA or BLA approval is the requirement that the prospective manufacturer’s quality control and manufacturing procedures continually conform with the FDA’s current Good Manufacturing Practice (cGMP) regulations (which are regulations established by the FDA governing the manufacture, processing, packing, storage and testing of drugs and biologics intended for human use). In complying with cGMP, manufacturers must devote substantial time, money and effort in the areas of production, quality control and quality assurance to maintain compliance. Material changes in manufacturing equipment, location or process, may result in additional regulatory review and approval. The FDA, the EC and other regulatory agencies conduct periodic visits to inspect equipment, facilities, and processes following the initial approval of a product. If a manufacturing facility is not in substantial compliance with the applicable regulations and requirements imposed when the product was approved, regulatory enforcement action may be taken, which may include a warning letter or an injunction against shipment of products from the facility and/or recall of products previously shipped.
Post-approval Review and Enforcement:  Regulatory authorities closely review and regulate the marketing and promotion of drug and biologic products. In most countries, regulatory approval is granted for a specified indication and is required before marketing or promoting a product for that indication. Regulatory authorities may take enforcement action against a company for promoting unapproved uses of a product (off-label promotion) or for other violations of advertising and labeling laws and regulations.
When an NDA or BLA is approved, the NDA or BLA holder must, among other things, (a) employ a system for obtaining reports of adverse events and side effects associated with the drug and make appropriate submissions to the FDA and (b) timely advise the FDA if any approved product fails to adhere to specifications established by the NDA or BLA. If the FDA concludes that a drug previously shown to be effective can be safely used only if distribution or use is restricted, the FDA will require post-marketing restrictions as necessary to assure safe use. The sponsor may be required to establish systems to assure use of the 
12

product under safe conditions. The FDA may require the drug sponsor to implement programs similar to our REMS programs to ensure that benefits of a drug outweigh risks and that safety protocols are adhered to.
In addition, a sponsor of a drug product has an ongoing obligation to update product labels with new information and to report to regulatory authorities concerning assessment of serious risks associated with the drug. Following assessment of these reports, regulatory authorities can require product label updates to reflect new safety data or warnings. If the FDA or other regulatory authorities become aware of new safety information, they can also require us to conduct studies or clinical trials to assess the potential for a serious risk. The FDA and other regulatory authorities can also impose marketing restrictions, including the suspension of marketing or complete withdrawal of a product from the market.
The FDA may issue publicly available warning letters and non-compliance letters, which may require corrective actions, including modification of advertising or other corrective communications to consumers or healthcare professionals. 
Failure to comply with applicable FDA or other regulatory agency requirements can result in enforcement actions, such as license revocation or suspension; orders for retention, recall, seizure or destruction of product; cessation of manufacturing; injunctions; inspection warrants; search warrants; civil penalties, including fines based on disgorgement; restitution; and criminal prosecution.
Other Regulations: We are also subject to various federal and state laws, as well as foreign laws, pertaining to healthcare “fraud and abuse,” including anti-kickback laws and false claims laws. Anti-kickback laws make it illegal to solicit, offer, receive or pay any remuneration in exchange for or to induce the referral of business, including the purchase or prescription of a particular drug that is reimbursed by a state or federal program. False claims laws generally prohibit knowingly and willingly presenting, or causing to be presented for payment to third-party payers (including Medicare and Medicaid) any claims for reimbursed drugs or services that are false or fraudulent, claims for items or services not provided as claimed or claims for medically unnecessary items or services. Our activities related to the sale and marketing of our products may be subject to scrutiny under these laws. Violations of fraud and abuse laws may be punishable by criminal and/or civil sanctions, including fines and civil monetary penalties, as well as the possibility of exclusion from federal healthcare programs (including Medicare and Medicaid).
We are also subject to regulation under the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the Toxic Substances Control Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act and other federal, state and local laws, rules and regulations. Our research and development activities may involve the controlled use of hazardous materials, chemicals, biological materials and various radioactive compounds. We believe our procedures comply with the standards prescribed by federal, state or local laws, rules and regulations; however, the risk of injury or accidental contamination cannot be completely eliminated. 
Additionally, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) prohibits U.S. corporations and their representatives from offering, promising, authorizing or making payments or providing anything of value to any foreign government official, government staff member, political party or political candidate, with corrupt intent for the purpose of obtaining or retaining an improper business advantage. The scope of the FCPA includes interactions with certain healthcare professionals in many countries. Other countries have enacted similar anti-corruption laws and regulations to which our activities are subject.
COMPETITION
Our current products and products under development face competition from other innovative drugs and, in some cases, generic drugs. The relative speed with which we develop new products, complete clinical trials, obtain regulatory approvals, receive pricing and reimbursement approvals, and finalize manufacturing and distribution arrangements, and market our products are critical factors in gaining a competitive advantage. Competition among approved products depends, among other things, on product efficacy, safety, convenience, reliability, availability, price, third-party reimbursement, sales and promotional activities, product liability issues and patent and non-patent exclusivity. For additional information, see Item 1A. "Risk Factors.”
SIGNIFICANT ALLIANCES
We have entered into a variety of alliances in the ordinary course of our business. Although we do not consider any individual alliance to be material, a brief description of certain of the more notable alliances are identified in Note 17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
13

MANUFACTURING
We own and operate a manufacturing facility in Zofingen, Switzerland which produces the active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) for REVLIMID® and THALOMID® and have contracted with third-party contract manufacturers to provide backup API manufacturing services for these products. Manufacturing services for REVLIMID® and THALOMID®, which consist of formulation, encapsulation, packaging, warehousing and distribution, are performed at our drug product manufacturing facility in Boudry, Switzerland. We have contracted with a number of third-party drug product manufacturing service providers and packaging service providers to provide backup manufacturing and packaging services. All of our facilities are approved by the regulatory authorities for the geographies that they serve and we require that our contract manufacturers and other third-party service providers are similarly approved.
The API for ABRAXANE® is generally available from two sources in quantities adequate to meet market demands. Manufacturing services for ABRAXANE® are performed at our manufacturing facility in Arizona, U.S.A. and by a third party contract manufacturing facility.
The API for POMALYST®/IMNOVID® is supplied from two sources with primary manufacturing services being performed at our Boudry, Switzerland manufacturing facility. We have contracted with a number of third-party drug product manufacturing service providers and packaging service providers to provide backup manufacturing and packaging services for this product.
The API for VIDAZA® and azacitidine for injection (generic version of VIDAZA®) is supplied by two suppliers. Manufacturing and packaging services are provided by a number of third-party service providers.
The API for OTEZLA® is supplied by two suppliers with primary API production being performed at our Zofingen, Switzerland facility. Manufacturing services are performed at our Boudry, Switzerland facility and at a contract manufacturing site. Packaging services are provided by a number of third-party service providers.
The API for ISTODAX® and manufacturing services are supplied by a single-source. Packaging services are provided by a number of third-party service providers.
We have established, or are in the process of establishing, primary and back up suppliers and/or manufacturing sites for late phase development programs, enasidenib, ozanimod, and GED-0301. Luspatercept is currently manufactured at contract manufacturing sites.
INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS
We have significant operations outside the United States conducted both through our subsidiaries and through distributors. For a geographic breakdown of total revenues see Note 19 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and for further discussion of our total revenues by geographic area see Item 7. "Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Results of Operations."
Our international headquarters and a drug product manufacturing facility which performs formulation, encapsulation, packaging, warehousing and distribution are located in Boudry, Switzerland.
Our international operations are subject to risks associated with operating on an international basis, including currency fluctuations, price and exchange controls and other restrictive governmental actions. Our international operations are also subject to government-imposed constraints, including laws on pricing, reimbursement and patient access to our products. Depending on the direction of change relative to the U.S. dollar, foreign currency values can increase or decrease the reported dollar value of our net assets and results of operations. While we cannot predict with certainty future changes in foreign exchange rates or the effect they will have, we attempt to mitigate their impact through operational means and by using foreign currency derivative instruments. For more information, see Item 7A. "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk."
SALES AND COMMERCIALIZATION
We promote our brands globally through our hematology, oncology, and inflammation and immunology commercial organizations which support our currently marketed brands and prepare for the launches of new products, as well as new indications for existing products. For OTEZLA®, we also provide information about the appropriate use of our products to consumers in the U.S. through direct-to-consumer print and television advertising. We have a team of dedicated market access professionals to help physicians, patients and payers understand the value our products deliver. Given our goal to ensure that patients who might benefit from our therapies have the opportunity to do so and given the complex reimbursement environment in the United States, we offer the 
14

services of Celgene Patient Support® and Otezla SupportPlus® to serve as dedicated, central points of contact for patients and healthcare professionals who use or prescribe our products. Celgene Patient Support® and Otezla SupportPlus® are free services that help patients and healthcare professionals navigate the challenges of reimbursement by providing information regarding insurance coverage, prior authorization requirements, appeals processes and financial assistance programs.
In most countries, we promote our products through our own sales organizations. In some countries, particularly in Latin America, we partner with third-party distributors. Generally, we distribute our products through commonly used channels in local markets. However, REVLIMID®, POMALYST®/IMNOVID® and THALOMID®/Thalidomide Celgene® are distributed under mandatory risk-management distribution programs (such as REMS) tailored to meet local authorities' specifications to provide for their safe and appropriate distribution and use.
EMPLOYEES
As of December 31, 2016, we had 7,132 full-time employees, of whom 2,570 were engaged primarily in research and development activities, 2,459 were engaged primarily in sales and commercialization activities, 654 were engaged primarily in manufacturing, and the remaining 1,449 were engaged primarily in management and general and administrative activities. The number of full-time employees in our international operations has grown from 2,869 at the end of 2015 to 3,039 at the end of 2016. We also employ a number of part-time employees and maintain consulting arrangements with a number of researchers at various universities and other research institutions around the world.
SEASONALITY
Our worldwide product sales do not reflect any significant degree of seasonality in end-user demand. Several other factors, including government rebates, distributor buying patterns and government tender timing impact the dollar value of product sales recorded in any particular quarter. In the United States, manufacturers of pharmaceutical products are responsible for 50 percent of the patient’s cost of branded prescription drugs related to the Medicare Part D Coverage Gap. We fulfill this obligation by providing rebates to the government, resulting in a reduction in the dollar value of U.S. net product sales in the quarter in which the rebates are provided. Historically, these rebates are higher during the first quarter primarily due to the larger volume of patient deductibles at the beginning of a calendar year. In addition, in the U.S., the timing of net product sales may be affected by fluctuations in wholesaler inventory levels. Outside of the U.S., the timing of governmental tenders for product may also impact net product sales in a particular quarter.
