Our Business
 
We are an apparel and lifestyle brand company that is currently focused on innerwear products for women and men. Under our flagship brand name and registered trademark “Naked®”, we design, manufacture and sell men’s and women’s underwear, intimate apparel, loungewear and sleepwear through retail partners and direct to consumer through our online retail store www.wearnaked.com. We have a growing retail footprint for our innerwear products in premium department and specialty stores and internet retailers in North America, including accounts such as Nordstrom Dropship, Dillard’s, Bloomingdale’s, Amazon.com, Chico’s, SaksFifthAvenue.com, and others.
 
The Naked brand was founded on one basic desire: to create a new standard for how products worn close to the skin fit, feel and function. Our core brand philosophy for Naked is “the freedom to be you” and we endeavor to provide products that help people feel confident, attractive and empowered while being as comfortable as wearing nothing at all. The Naked brand was founded in Vancouver, Canada in 2010, as a men’s underwear manufacturer. In 2014 we relocated our headquarters to New York City, expanded our men’s collections and developed women’s intimate apparel, sleepwear and loungewear collections. Our first women’s sleep and loungewear collections became available for retail sale online at www.wearnaked.com in September 2015 and at retail locations and other online retailers in February 2016. Also, in February 2016, we launched our women’s intimate apparel products. In the future, we intend to expand the Naked brand through existing channels and through licensing partnerships into other apparel and product categories that exemplify the mission of our brand, such as athleisure apparel, swimwear, sportswear, hosiery, bedding and home products and others.
 
Our expansion into the women’s sleepwear and intimate apparel in fiscal 2017 is a key part of our growth strategy given that these market segments represent $17.8 billion, or over 77% of the overall innerwear market according to data from the NPD Group. Daywear products that address consumer demand for versatile “athleisure” apparel have been the fastest growing segment of the women’s market. Our ability to attract women customers for the Naked brand is also very important to our effort to penetrate the men’s $4.3 billion U.S. innerwear market since a number of consumer research reports show that women purchase as much as 50% of men’s underwear for their husbands, boyfriends or sons.
 
Our products currently target men and women who are fashion and performance conscious, care about innovation and contemporary design, and desire comfort, quality and fit in their innerwear and apparel. We aim to provide an affordable luxury product for the successful and aspirational customer that enjoys the qualities of a premium garment at a price they feel delivers value. With growing awareness of our brand among these consumers and a broadening array of products, we expect to continue to expand our retail distribution through department stores, boutiques, online retail channels, hotels, spas, and other retailing channels over the next two years and beyond. We plan to also grow our direct to consumer business primarily through our online retail store, www.wearnaked.com, through which we will continue to commercially introduce new products as well as feature certain products, collections and styles exclusively.
 
Potential Business Combination with Bendon Limited 
 
On May 25, 2017, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Reorganization (as amended, the “Merger Agreement”), by and among Bendon Limited, a New Zealand limited company (“Bendon”), Bendon Group Holdings Limited, an Australia limited company (“Holdco”), Naked Merger Sub Inc., a Nevada corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Holdco (“Merger Sub”), and, solely for the purposes of Sections 2.28 and 5.18(b) of the Merger Agreement, Bendon Investments Ltd., a New Zealand company and the owner of a majority of the outstanding shares of Bendon (the “Principal Shareholder”), pursuant to which Merger Sub will be merged with and into Naked (the “Merger”) with Naked as the surviving corporation. The Merger Agreement was amended as of July 26, 2017, February 21, 2018, March 19, 2018 and April 23, 2018.

The Merger Agreement provides for Bendon and Naked to enter a business combination transaction by means of which (i) Bendon and Holdco will undertake a reorganization (the “Reorganization” and together with the Merger, the “Transactions”) pursuant to which all of the shareholders of Bendon will exchange all the outstanding ordinary shares of Bendon (the “Bendon Ordinary Shares”) for ordinary shares of Holdco (“Holdco Ordinary Shares”), and (ii) immediately thereafter, Merger Sub will merge with and into Naked, with Naked surviving as a wholly owned subsidiary of Holdco and the Naked stockholders receiving Holdco Ordinary Shares.
 
In the Reorganization, the shareholders of Bendon will exchange all the outstanding Bendon Ordinary Shares for 22,680,527 Holdco Ordinary Shares, subject to adjustment based on Naked’s Net Assets and Bendon’s Net Debt as of the closing date of the Transactions. Using Naked’s Net Assets and Bendon’s Net Debt as of February 28, 2018 and assuming Bendon has refinanced certain of its indebtedness and has completed certain capital raising transactions, we estimate that the shareholders of Bendon will receive approximately 22,680,527 Holdco Ordinary Shares in the Reorganization. See the section entitled “The Merger Proposal — Structure of the Transactions” for more information, including descriptions of the definition of “Net Assets” and “Net Debt.”
 
In the Merger, each outstanding share of common stock of Naked shall be cancelled and shall be automatically converted into the right to receive 0.2 Holdco Ordinary Shares (the “Per Share Consideration”), with the shares issued to the Naked stockholders representing in the aggregate approximately nine percent of the Holdco Ordinary Shares outstanding immediately after completion of the Transactions. Naked’s outstanding options and warrants to purchase shares of its common.
 
The completion of the Merger is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of certain customary conditions, including, among others: (i) the accuracy of the other party’s representations and warranties; (ii) performance in all material respects by the other party of its obligations under the Merger Agreement; (iii) the listing of Holdco Ordinary Shares on the Nasdaq Capital Market or the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”), subject to official notice of issuance; (iv) the declaration of effectiveness by the SEC of the registration statement on Form F-4 filed by Holdco in connection with the transactions (the “Registration Statement”); (v) Naked stockholder’s approving the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby at a meeting called for such purposes (the “Stockholder Meeting”); and (vi) other conditions as further described in the Merger Agreement. The Registration Statement was declared effective by the SEC on April 26, 2018 and includes a definitive proxy statement of Naked and a prospectus of Holdco.
 
The Merger Agreement also contains specified termination rights, including the right to terminate the Merger Agreement (i) by mutual agreement of the parties to terminate; (ii) by either party if (1) the Merger has not been consummated by if the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement are not consummated on or before the Outside Date (which is June 1, 2018), subject to certain conditions as set forth below , (2) any law or order permanently prohibits consummation of the Merger, or (3) Naked stockholder approval is not obtained by the Outside Date; (iii) by either party if the other party has breached or failed to perform in any material respect any of its representations and warranties or covenants under the Merger Agreement such that a closing condition is not satisfied (subject to notice and cure and other customary exceptions); and (iv) by Naked if (1) Bendon substantially changes its business as conducted as of the date of the Merger Agreement, or (2) Naked accepts a Superior Proposal (as defined in the Merger Agreement). However, the right to terminate due to the Outside Date passing will not be available to any party whose material breach of their obligations under the Merger Agreement resulted in the failure of the Merger to occur on or before the Outside Date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, on or before May 22, 2018, Bendon will provide written notice to Naked of any known material breach by Naked of its obligations under the Merger Agreement which could reasonably be expected to result in the failure of the Merger to occur on or before the Outside Date. Naked will have no more than ten days to cure any such breach from the date of such notice and the Outside Date will be extended by the number of days (although not more than ten days in each instance) used by Naked to cure such breach, which date shall be the new Outside Date. In any event, under no circumstances will the Outside Date be extended beyond June 11, 2018.
 
Following the Merger, all Naked common stock will be de-listed from the Nasdaq Capital Market and de-registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”).

Principal Products


Historically, we were strictly a men’s innerwear manufacturer and retailer and our men’s collections represented substantially all of our revenues until the third quarter of fiscal 2016. Our Fall 2015 women’s sleep and loungewear collection became available for retail sale online at www.wearnaked.com in September 2015 and at retail locations and other online retailers in February 2016. Also, in February 2016, we launched our women’s intimate apparel products online and at select retailers. Since then, our women’s collections have seen strong growth and represented approximately 68.6% of our revenues for fiscal 2018.
Men’s Collections 
 
We currently offer a variety of innerwear products for men including boxer briefs, trunks, briefs, undershirts, t-shirts, lounge pants, lounge shorts and robes. Our three primary men’s collections are: Luxury, Active and Essential. Our men’s Luxury collection utilizes MicroModal fabric, which is a lightweight, highly soft fabric that has breathable moisture-wicking qualities and made using a carbon-neutral, eco-friendly process. Our Active collection is based on a high-performance Microfiber fabric, a nylon-based textile that is smooth and resilient while providing moisture-wicking properties. We have been producing our full line of men’s underwear using these fabrics since the inception of our business. Our Essential collection is made of Cotton Stretch fabric for a light, comfortable everyday fit. Underwear and undershirts in this collection are sold in 2-packs to access a broader customer base.
 
We also offer men’s products in other fabrics including Microfiber with X-Static® Silver, French Terry, Modal Cotton and Tencel. All of the fabrics we use are readily available in many countries. Additionally, we produce boxer briefs and V-neck t-shirts with microfiber using X-Static® Silver, a high-performance fabric, which helps regulate body temperature and provides anti-odor and antimicrobial protection. X-Static® Silver fabric contains 99.9% pure silver woven into the garment’s nylon threads, which naturally deters odor-causing bacteria, wicks away moisture, is anti-chaffing and naturally cooling.
 
During fiscal 2017, we expanded our Essentials collection to include loungewear in Peruvian Pima Cotton, a superior cotton that is prized for its softness and breathability. We also introduced a new product called the Naked Shield™ which incorporates special fabric featuring Circuitex technology that provides wireless shielding and antimicrobial/anti-odor properties.
 
Women’s Collections
 
Our women’s loungewear and sleepwear collections are based on two of the same fabrics used in our collections for men: Luxury MicroModal and Essential Cotton Stretch. Our three primary women’s collections are: Luxury, Everyday, and Essential. These women’s collections include a range of products such as boyshorts, hipsters, lounge pants, camisoles, tank tops, pajamas, chemises and sleepshirts. We also make French terry robes, Alpaca throws, as well as Double Gauze woven cotton sleepwear. True to our brand mission, we believe these designs deliver superior fit, feel and function with timeless looks and at premium affordable prices that make them appealing to a broad consumer market.

Our Everyday collection consists of three core groups of daily essentials including wire-free bralettes and thong, modern brief and hipster style panties meant for everyday use for a range of different occasions. Everyday Naked, is constructed from Peruvian Pima cotton stretch fabric that is designed to be ultra-light, soft and breathable. Naked Luxury intimates, is made from soft MicroModal fabric with 360-degree stretch that is designed to naturally wick away moisture and be cool to the touch. We have designed our intimate apparel collection according to our mission to deliver the highest standard of fit, feel, function, and look for the modern active woman.
 
Our Essential collection consists of pajamas, sleepshirts, robes, loungewear, yoga wear and chemises made from Peruvian Pima Cotton for everyday comfort and style.
 
Distribution
 
We sell our products through wholesale relationships and through direct to consumer channels. The wholesale channel is currently our largest channel and consists of department stores as well as boutique apparel stores and undergarment stores. Our two largest distribution partners are Nordstrom, which carries our products in its online store Nordstrom.com, and Bloomingdales, which carries our product at select stores in the U.S. We also sell our products through Dillard’s, Soma.com, SaksFifthAvenue.com and a growing number of boutiques and specialty stores. We are targeting additional key retail store partners in the U.S. in 2018 for our men’s and women’s products. In addition to selling in key department stores in North America, Naked also sells through online stores such as Amazon.com, barenecessities.com, hackberry.com, hisroom.com and freshpair.com.
 
We also sell all of our products direct-to-consumer through our internet retail store, www.wearnaked.com. Our internet retail store is optimized for use on all online platforms and provides our customers with a premium online shopping experience and access to our entire product line. Our direct-to-consumer channel has become an increasingly significant part of our business and we expect it will continue to do so as our brand awareness increases in North America and internationally. We believe that the availability of online sales is convenient for our customers and enhances the image of our brand, making our brand and products more accessible in more markets than in brick and mortar stores alone. We plan to commercially introduce new products at www.wearnaked.com as well as feature certain products, collections, and styles exclusively.
 
Production
 
We utilize manufacturing partners outside of the United States to produce our products. Currently, our primary production is in China although we have limited production in India, Peru, Bangladesh, and Thailand and may expand into other territories in 2018.
 
We believe we have developed good relationships with a number of our vendors and we seek to ensure that they share our commitment to quality and ethics. We do not have any long-term agreements requiring us to use any manufacturer. Our primary production partner during fiscal 2018 has been TMS Fashion, a wholly owned subsidiary of LuenThai Holdings Limited, a Hong Kong Stock Exchange-listed company. We began working with TMS and LuenThai in 2014 in an effort to streamline and scale up our production capabilities by leveraging a large, established manufacturing resource. We believe this partnership allows us access to “best-in-class” fabrics, materials and manufacturing techniques while reducing our need for fixed overhead. Further, until August 2017, we sublet our principal office location in New York City from Tellas, Inc., another wholly-owned subsidiary of LuenThai operating in the U.S. We have additional manufacturing relationships for our women’s intimate apparel collections and expect to work with additional manufacturers as we expand our product offering.
 
Sources and Availability of Raw Materials
 
Raw materials, which include fabric and accessories, are sourced from all over the world, including Italy, Turkey, China, Peru, India and Bangladesh. We believe these fabrics and raw materials are readily available from multiple sources. Currently, we work closely with TMS Fashion and LuenThai, who are responsible for all of the sourcing of our raw materials for our men’s and women’s collections. We have additional sourcing relationships for our women’s intimate apparel collections and we expect to work with additional sourcing partners as we expand our product offering.

Key Customers
 
In fiscal 2018, sales were concentrated with Bloomingdales, Nordstrom.com, and Dillards which accounted for 8.9%, 11%, and 8.2% respectively of our net sales. During fiscal 2017, Nordstrom accounted for 12.4%, Bloomingdales accounted for 13.7%, and Dillards accounted for 3.3% of our net sales. The decline in percentage of sales to Nordstrom and Bloomingdales during fiscal 2018 is largely due to an increase in sales across all channels leading to a decrease in sales concentrations to key customers. Nordstrom.com, Bloomingdales, and Dillard’s are currently of key importance to our business and our results of operations, which would be materially adversely affected if these relationships ceased to exist or are significantly reduced. These customers do not have ongoing purchase commitments with us nor do any of our other customers. Therefore, we cannot guarantee that the volume of sales will remain consistent going forward. We typically enter into agreements with department store and larger retail customers which cover the material terms and conditions of purchase orders such as shipping terms, pricing policies, payment terms and cancellation policies. We are targeting additional department store and retail customers to become additional key accounts of our business in fiscal 2019 and beyond.
Marketing
 
Our marketing strategy is primarily focused on digital and social media marketing aimed at increasing brand awareness and helping drive sales growth cost-efficiently. We have engaged consultants, where necessary, to provide marketing advisory and execution services to our company, including assistance with brand management, public relations, celebrity alignment, strategic retail placement, manufacturing strategy, and strategic and creative development and assistance. We intend to continue to grow our investment in marketing and brand awareness-building activities, including internet and media marketing to consumers and retailers, attendance at apparel trade shows and exploration of other strategic marketing opportunities.
Competition
 
Men’s and women’s innerwear is a very competitive market with many high-profile undergarment manufacturers such as, Calvin Klein, Polo Ralph Lauren, 2(x)ist, Hugo Boss, Tommy John, Saxx Giorgio Armani, Tommy Hilfiger, Michael Kors, DKNY, Natori, Free People, Hanky Panky, Commando, Cosabella, MeUndies, Bread&Boxers, Frigo and others. We believe there are currently over 100 potential competitors in our market sector for men’s and women’s undergarments, lounge and sleepwear, and intimate apparel. The market includes increasing competition from established companies who are expanding their production and marketing of undergarments, as well as frequent new entrants. We are in direct competition with such companies. Competition is principally on the basis of brand image and recognition, as well as product quality, innovation, style, distribution and price. We believe that we have the potential to perform well against competition as a result of the quality, fit and performance of our products, our brand and brand strategy and positioning, our planned marketing and consumer engagement initiatives, and through brand endorsement and strategic collaboration agreements. The products we have introduced to market and the products we plan to introduce are targeted at a premium consumer value point, which means retailing a high-quality product at a competitive price to comparable products, which we believe gives us the opportunity to penetrate the market successfully.
 
We believe our competitive advantages include promoting that our products are as comfortable as wearing nothing at all, which leverages our brand name, and retailing high quality products at a competitive price with superior fit, feel, function and look. We also believe our brand name and brand mission and philosophy will be an important competitive differentiator as we expand our marketing and brand awareness initiatives. However, many of our competitors have significant competitive advantages, including longer operating histories, larger and broader customer bases, more established relationships with a broader set of suppliers, greater brand recognition and greater financial, research and development, marketing, distribution and other resources than we do. Our competitors may be able to achieve and maintain brand awareness and market share more quickly and effectively than we can.

Seasonality of Business
 
The apparel industry is generally subject to seasonality of buying which can affect revenue and cash flows. For men, there are generally two distinct buying seasons in the apparel industry: Fall/Winter season, which occurs in the third to fourth quarters of our fiscal year and Spring/Summer season, which occurs in the first to second quarters of our fiscal year, with some potential shipments at the last quarter. The women’s apparel buying markets are more frequent than men’s, although we may elect to focus only on two main buying markets as we do for men’s products in order to optimize design and production cycles. In fiscal 2018, the largest revenues were reported in our second and fourth fiscal quarter, arising from seasonal products and sales, as well as due to $441,453 in sales recorded for the fourth quarter relating to the consignment agreement with Bendon, dated October 4, 2017. As a result of growth and changes to our business with the introduction of new product lines during the fiscal year, the natural seasonality of our business had a reduced effect. Furthermore, with limited operating history it is difficult to anticipate the effects of seasonality moving forward. Thus, historical quarterly operating trends may not be indicative of future performance because of new product launches and continued early stage sales growth.
Intellectual Property
 
The “Naked” trademark is a critical component of the value of our business and we rely on the strength of our brand to differentiate ourselves in the marketing and sale of our products. To protect the Naked brand, we have secured trademark registrations in the United States, the European Union and Canada. We also own applications and registrations in the United States, Canada and other jurisdictions for additional Naked-related trademarks. We take steps to enforce and police our Naked trademark and expect to continue to incur expenses for enforcement-related work and for the filing of trademark and other types of intellectual property applications in the U.S. and key international markets in fiscal 2019.
Employees
 
We currently employ six full-time employees, of which five are employed in the United States and one is employed in Canada. None of our employees are currently covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We have had no labor-related work stoppages and we believe our relations with our employees are excellent.
Corporate Information
 
We were incorporated in the State of Nevada on May 17, 2005 under the name of Search By Headlines.com Corp. Immediately prior to the transaction with Naked Inc. described below, we were a public reporting “shell company,” as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act.
 
On July 30, 2012, we completed a reverse acquisition of Naked Inc., whereby we acquired all of the issued and outstanding common shares of Naked Inc. in exchange for the issuance of 337,500 shares of common stock in the capital of our company to the Naked Inc. stockholders on a pro-rata basis, representing 50% of the capital stock of our company at the time. As a result of this reverse acquisition transaction, Naked Inc. became a wholly-owned subsidiary of our company and our business became the manufacture and sale of direct and wholesale men’s innerwear and intimate apparel products in Canada and the United States to consumers and retailers.
 
Effective August 29, 2012, we changed our name from “Search By Headlines.com Corp.” to “Naked Brand Group Inc.” This change in our corporate name was effectuated by merging a wholly owned subsidiary of our company, which was formed solely to effect the name change, with and into our company.
 
Naked Inc., our wholly owned subsidiary, was originally incorporated under the federal laws of Canada on May 21, 2009 as “In Search of Solutions Inc.” Naked changed its corporate name to “Naked Boxer Brief Clothing Inc.” on May 17, 2010 and to “Naked Inc.” on February 20, 2013. Naked Inc. continued from the federal jurisdiction of Canada to the jurisdiction of the State of Nevada on July 27, 2012. As part of the continuation, all classes of shares of Naked, including Class C, D, E and F common shares, were converted into one class of common stock of the continuing corporation.
 
Our principal executive offices are located at 180 Madison Avenue, Suite 505, New York, New York, USA 10016. Our telephone number is (646) 653-7710.
