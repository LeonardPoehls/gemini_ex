Item 1.   Business 
General Corporate History
 
ATI Modular Technology Corp. (“ATI Modular,” “we,” “us,” or the “Company”) are an operating company engaged in the development and the exporting of modular energy efficient technology and processes that allow government and private enterprises in China to use US-based methods for creating modular spaces, facilities, and properties. We are in the business of all aspects of modular construction, including but not limited to, (a) the furtherance of modular construction technology, education and development in developed and undeveloped countries, (b) acquisition and/or installation of construction equipment, materials, furnishings, adware, insulation, flooring, roofing, wiring, plumbing, heating and air conditioning, and landscaping, and (c) other businesses directly or tangentially related to these lines of services, including assisting businesses and entrepreneurs in securing naming, licensing or promotional rights, driving internet and media traffic, increasing visibility of product and name recognition, and other services. As with any business plan that is aspirational in nature, there is no assurance we will be able to accomplish all of our objectives or that we will be able to meet our financing needs to accomplish our objectives. We believe that we are a “shell company,” as defined under Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act. Our CIK number is 0001697426, and we have selected December 31 as our fiscal year.

In China, the modular construction industry is new and in its very early stages. Though we expect other competitors to come forth, at this time, there are only three other competitors, and those competitors are based in China. None of the competitors are from the United States. We believe that it is recognized that United States modular technology is more advanced than our Chinese counterparts, and the technology is recognized as the gold standard. The construction industry in China, as a whole, has a mandate to immediately start developing modular technology with cities and provinces developing modular construction plans and targets to construct modular in both the public as well as private sectors. Most communities have milestones and are creating official policies on modular construction with the actual percentage of production mandated by particular target dates.
 
We have been sought out by three separate governments in China to assist their communities in developing their modular industry based upon United States’ technology. We have experience in the construction sector in China and the United States, and thus we believe we have the leverage in assembling experts in the modular industry to assist in delivery of goods, services, equipment, technology, and know-how all under the moniker of “Made in the USA.”
 
We are currently evaluating a physical location for our operations in China along with a manufacturing facility. Our principal executive offices are located at 4700 Homewood Court, Suite 100 in Raleigh, North Carolina. We are registered as a foreign business entity in the State of North Carolina. We lease the office space from Yilaime Corporation, a Nevada corporation doing business in North Carolina, and a related party to the Company.
 
The Company was incorporated on January 2, 1969 as United Gold & Silver Co. (“UGS”). On February 17, 1971, UGS merged with Lucky Irish Silver, Inc., a Montana corporation, and Deep Creek Mines, Inc., a Washington corporation, in which the surviving entity’s name remained USG. On November 29, 1999, USG merged with Auto America, Inc., (“Auto America”), a Delaware corporation, through the filing of Articles of Merger resulting in the surviving entity changing its name from USG to Auto America. From 2002 to 2007, the State of Washington automatically filed numerous Certificates of Administrative Dissolutions for Auto America for failure to file annual reports. On May 14, 2007, Auto America filed its final Application of Reinstatement resulting in restoring the Company to good standing. Also, on May 14, 2007, Auto America filed Amended Articles of Incorporation changing its name to Charter Equities, Inc. (“Charter Equities”). Charter Equities converted to an Arizona corporation on January 23, 2008. Shortly thereafter, the Company converted to Nevada corporation and changed its name to Global Recycle Energy, Inc. We amended our articles of incorporation on June 27, 2016, changing our name to ATI Modular Technology Corp.
 
Mr. Alton Perkins (“Mr. Perkins”) is the control person of Yilaime Corporation, AmericaTowne, Inc. (“AmericaTowne,” or “ATI”), and AXP Holding Corporation. At this time, the purpose of the Company is to service the construction and related technology needs of the Company, and AmericaTowne under AmericaTowne’s agreements with the Shexian County Investment Promotion Bureau in developing an AmericaTowne community in the Hanwang mountains in Shexian, China. The Company also intends on supporting these services in other AmericaTowne ventures at the invitation of the Xiamen Longyan City Chamber of Commerce, Xiamen/Longyan China and the Xiamen City Growth Planning Agency in developing an AmericaTowne Community and an International School in Longyan County China.
 
The related export services rendered to the Company in the implementation of its business plan cannot be provided by AmericaTowne or through the AmericaTowne relationship. In order to avoid conflicts of interest, Mr. Perkins is of the opinion that there must be a separate and distinct agreement between, in this case, the Company and AXP Holding Corporation. Furthermore, although other similar IC-DISC entities exist, the Company is able to obtain better terms and conditions from AXP Holding Corporation in light of Mr. Perkins’ control of AXP Holding Corporation.
 
AmericaTowne’s Board of Directors determined that operating and controlling a separate but related entity focused on the development and the exporting of modular energy efficient technology and processes for government and private enterprises in China would be more prudent from a risk mitigation and operational standpoint than providing these services under the AmericaTowne business plan. Furthermore, the intent of the Company is to expand its services and relationships to other similar endeavors in projects not related to AmericaTowne, thus the need to maintain and operate a separate entity.

Business Developments in Fiscal Year 2017
 
The Company had disclosed that the Jiangnan Cooperation Agreement was not a definitive agreement. On December 28, 2016, the parties entered into the American ATI Modular Technology Company Project Investment Agreement (the “Investment Agreement”), which supersedes the Investment and Cooperation Agreement with the Jiangnan Industry Zone in Anhui Province dated September 8, 2016 disclosed in the Company’s Form 10-12g Registration Statement.
 
Under the Investment Agreement, the Administrative Committee of Jiangnan Industrial Concentration Zone of Anhui Province (hereinafter, “Jiangnan”) and the Company have agreed to the construction of the Company’s green, modular building and related technology under the project name “Modular Plant Production Base.” By or before February 27, 2017, the Company will rent buildings, factories and rental houses from Jiangnan, or its related-party - Jiangnan Construction & Development Co., Ltd. (“Jiangnan Construction”), with a total acreage of approximately 244,776 square meters (approximately 2,634,747 square feet) for purposes of advancing the Company’s modular construction, technology and research, and with a chosen location within this area for the Company’s global company offices; however, the Company will retain its offices in the United States, as identified above. In the event the Company does not occupy the rented facilities in one-year, Jiangnan may place other tenants in the buildings for unrelated projects. The rental rate is as follows per square meter, per month: (a) 9 Chinese Yuan (approximately $1.29 USD) for single-storied factory buildings, (b) 7 Chinese Yuan (approximately $1.01 USD) for multi-storied factory buildings, (c) 6 Chinese Yuan (approximately $.86 USD) for two-storied buildings, (d) 5 Chinese Yuan (approximately $.75 USD) for three-storied buildings and public rental, and (e) 10 Chinese Yuan (approximately $1.38 USD) for commercial housing. The first twenty-seven months is rent free.
 
The initial deposit of 330,000 Chinese Yuan (approximately $48,000 USD) is due to Jiangnan Construction by January 11, 2016. This amount may be applied to the Company’s rental obligations. The Company has agreed to further capitalize the operation with 396,000,000 Chinese Yuan (approximately $57,000,000 USD) with 79,200,000 Chinese Yuan (approximately $11,000,000 USD) by December 31, 2017.
 
The capitalization under the Investment Agreement is, in part, the Company’s responsibility. However, the Company and Jiangnan have agreed to certain provisions to mitigate against financing risks, including, but not limited to: (a) access upon request by the Company to local bank loans in the Anhui Province and United States Exim Bank, (b) equity fund insertion up to $3,000,000 USD, and (c) contribution by Jiangnan up to $2,900,000 upon meeting conditions in the Investment Agreement.
 
The Company’s majority and controlling shareholder, AmericaTowne, has no financial obligations under the Investment Agreement. However, AmericaTowne’s director, officer and control person by virtue of his beneficial ownership of more than 51% of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock is Alton Perkins. Mr. Perkins is also the beneficial owner of the controlling interest in the Company by virtue of his ownership in AmericaTowne, and he is the Company’s sole director and officer. As a result, Mr. Perkins might elect to vote AmericaTowne’s shares, or exercise his rights as the sole member of the Board of Directors of AmericaTowne, to loan funds from AmericaTowne to the Company to satisfy the capital requirements under the Investment Agreement. If this occurred, the loaned funds would become a related-party debt to the Company. There are no current plans or intentions by Mr. Perkins to facilitate such a loan.
 
The Investment Agreement sets forth certain benefits, subsidies and incentives offered by the Chinese government, subject to the Company reaching certain benchmarks and employing a specific numbers of employees from the region. In addition, Jiangnan has agreed to certain financial contributions to the Company if it meets certain listing standards in China, and has agreed to exercise best efforts in pursuing private equity contributions for the benefit of the Company in China. The Investment Agreement contains events of default, and the respective rights and duties of the parties in the event of default. There is risk that investment by the Company may be made under the Investment Agreement, and as a result of an uncured default, the Company could lose its investment and opportunities in the region. Chinese law governs any disputes under the Investment Agreement, and the parties have agreed to jurisdiction of any dispute in Jiangnan’s region. As a result, the Company might have logistical problems in litigating any such dispute.

Merger with AmericaTowne, Inc.
 
On June 23, 2017, AmericaTowne voted its shares in favor of adopting the Agreement and Plan of Merger (“Plan of Merger”) between the Company and AmericaTowne. Pursuant to the Plan of Merger, AmericaTowne would merge into the Company, with the Company being the “Surviving Entity” and AmericaTowne being the “Merging Entity.” As a result, the Surviving Entity will be named AmericaTowne Holdings, Inc., a Nevada corporation. The Surviving Entity will carry on the business activities of both the Company and AmericaTowne.
 
The Plan of Merger calls for the Company to implement a 50-to-1 reverse stock split and change its name to AmericaTowne Holdings, Inc. The Plan of Merger is subject to review and approval by the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (“FINRA”).
 
In furtherance of the Plan of Merger, the Company filed its Information Statement on Schedule 14C and its Registration Statement on Form S-4 outlining the merger and the related corporate actions. The Company’s primary focus in 2017 has been finalizing its Registration Statement on Form 10 and effectuating the Plan of Merger. The Plan of Merger and related corporate actions are discussed in detail below.
 
Name Change to AmericaTowne Holdings, Inc.
 
Pursuant to Article II, Section 8 of the Bylaws of the Company, the Company’s majority shareholder AmericaTowne approved the recommendation of the Board of Directors to change the Company’s name from ATI Modular Technology Corp. to “AmericaTowne Holdings, Inc.” The name changes was recommended as it relates to the Plan of Merger. It is the intent of the Company, once the Plan of Merger below is implemented, to continue forward under the name AmericaTowne Holdings, Inc. The Company’s name change will be effective twenty (20) days after the Company’s Information Sheet on Schedule 14C is mailed to shareholders. The Information Sheet is still pending SEC review. 
 
Reasons for the Name Change
 
Changing the Company’s name was recommended for purposes of facilitating the Plan of Merger. In order to meet the conditions precedent to effectuating the Plan of Merger, the Company had to execute the Certificate of Amendment to its Articles of Incorporation to change the name of the Company to AmericaTowne Holdings, Inc. The Plan of Merger is attached to this Information Statement. It is a legal document and shareholders are urged to read the document in its entirety.
 
The purpose of the Name Change is to provide the Company with a new, more accurate name once the Company merges with AmericaTowne. The Company will no longer be focused solely on modular technology. Rather, being the “Surviving Entity” in the Plan of Merger, the Company will assume the various business enterprises in which AmericaTowne is presently involved and plans on expanding into new markets as well. Changing the Company’s name to AmericaTowne Holdings, Inc., allows for the Company to accurately reflect the Company’s new business plan and the combination of two, previously related entities.
 
-7-




Effect of the Amendments
 
Simply put, the Company’s name will be changed from ATI Modular Technology Corp. to AmericaTowne Holdings, Inc. The Company believes the name “AmericaTowne Holdings, Inc.” will project to customers, investors, and target markets that the Company has expanded its market to include both modular technology and the business endeavors of AmericaTowne. The term “Holdings” also suggests that the Company now oversees a variety of different activities, which more accurately reflects the new business plan of the Company.
 
The Reverse Stock Split 
 
ATI approved the recommendation of the Board of Directors to effectuate a fifty-to-one (50-to-1) reverse stock split, meaning that every fifty (50) Common Stock shares issued and outstanding, which are held by stockholders will be combined, reconfigured, and reissued as a single share of Common Stock at par value of $0.0001 without any affirmative action on behalf of the stockholders. Any fractional shares will be rounded up to the nearest whole share. These actions are outlined in the aforementioned Consent of Shareholders in Lieu of Meeting dated June 23, 2017 and the Board of Directors’ Resolution dated the same day.
 
Reason for the Stock Split
 
AmericaTowne believes that the Stock Split will increase shareholder value and allow for a more competitive market once the Plan of Merger, discussed below, is effectuated. By reducing the number of issued and outstanding Common Stock shares of the Company, AmericaTowne hopes to drastically increase the value of each individual share.
 
Effect of the Stock Split
 
The Stock Split will result in a significant decrease in the number of issued and outstanding Common Stock shares. Those shareholders with fewer than fifty shares will receive one (1) share as a result of the Stock Split, and any individual with a fractional share remaining will have that fraction rounded up. By way of example, if a shareholder holds seventy-five (75) shares of Common Stock prior to the Stock Split, after the Certificate of Change is filed, the shareholder will hold a total of two (2) shares.
 
The Stock Split may increase the value of each shareholder’s shares. The Company hopes that the Stock Split will increase trading interest in the Company’s stock as a result of the higher valuation, though the higher prices and smaller market may have the reverse effect.
 
The Plan of Merger
 
The Plan of Merger was executed in June 29, 2017 and the First Amendment to the Agreement and Plan of Merger was signed on July 14, 2017 (collectively referred to as the “Plan of Merger”).
 
The Plan of Merger outlines the merger between the Company and AmericaTowne. AmericaTowne is defined as the “Merging Entity” while the Company is defined as the “Surviving Entity.” Pursuant to the merger, ATI will merge into the Company to increase operational efficiency and to increase shareholder value. Additionally, shareholders of AmericaTowne will have their shares exchanged on a pro rata basis with the Company’s shares. The Company, being traded over-the-counter, provides former shareholders of AmericaTowne with a resource to sell or transfer their shares.
 
There are several conditions that must be met prior to closing the Plan of Merger. These include (1) changing the Company’s name from ATI Modular Technology Corp., to AmericaTowne Holdings, Inc., (2) the completion of the Company’s 50-to-1 reverse stock split, as described herein, and (3) AmericaTowne’s completion of its 1-to-4 stock split. Additionally, effectiveness of this transaction is dependent upon the registration of the Company’s shares to be used in this transaction, which have been filed in a Registration Statement on Form S-4 with the SEC. After these conditions are met, and the Registration Statement on Form S-4 is approved, the Company will issue to AmericaTowne shares of the Company’s restricted common stock equal to the total amount of AmericaTowne common stock shares issued and outstanding. The Company’s issuance will then be used by AmericaTowne to effectuate a 1-for-1 exchange with all AmericaTowne shareholders. Thus, after the Plan of Merger closes, each AmericaTowne shareholder will hold shares of the Company’s common stock equal to the shareholder’s prior AmericaTowne holdings.

The Surviving Entity will be named AmericaTowne Holdings, Inc., and will assume the contracts and liabilities of the Company and AmericaTowne. The Surviving Entity will, if necessary, develop separate committees to address commitments or business of AmericaTowne and the Company. It is estimated that this Plan of Merger will be deemed effective 20 days after the Company’s Information Statement is distributed to shareholders of the Company.
 
Reasons for the Plan of Merger
 
ATI has an interest in registering its shares with a national market, such as the OTC Markets Group. In researching the most cost-effective ways to move forward with registration, it became apparent that merging into ATI Modular, the Company’s subsidiary, which is already trading over-the-counter, would provide two benefits to the Company’s shareholders.
 
First, by merging operations, the Company and AmericaTowne will benefit from a decrease in operational costs. Presently, both entities have reporting obligations under the Securities Exchange Act, resulting in duplicative reporting. By merging the entities, the Company and AmericaTowne eliminate the duplicative work, resulting in decreased administrative and professional costs. Though not guaranteed, the Plan of Merger would ideally allow for the Surviving Entity to be more profitable, have less overhead, increasing shareholder value.
 
Second, the Plan of Merger allows for AmericaTowne’s issued and outstanding shares to be exchanged with the shares of ATI Modular and traded on OTCPink under the symbol “ATMO.” This may provide AmericaTowne investors with greater liquidity and allow shareholders to enter a marketplace where they more easily transfer their shares, subject to all applicable federal and state regulations.
 
Effect of the Plan of Merger
 
The Plan of Merger will result in AmericaTowne merging into the Company. The Company will amend its Articles of Incorporation to change its name to AmericaTowne Holdings, Inc., as detailed above. Additionally, the Company will absorb ATI’s shareholders, allowing for a larger shareholder base. The Surviving Entity will assume the obligations and assets of AmericaTowne. Shareholders of AmericaTowne will have their shares exchanged on a pro rata basis. Thus, once the Plan of Merger is complete, the remaining entity—AmericaTowne Holdings, Inc.—will be trading on the OTCPink using the symbol “ATMO.”
 
Employees
 
The Company currently has two full-time employees.

As an emerging growth company we are exempt from Section 404(b) of Sarbanes Oxley. Section 404(a) requires Issuers to publish information in their annual reports concerning the scope and adequacy of the internal control structure and procedures for financial reporting. This statement shall also assess the effectiveness of such internal controls and procedures. Section 404(b) requires that the registered accounting firm shall, in the same report, attest to and report on the assessment on the effectiveness of the internal control structure and procedures for financial reporting.
 
As an emerging growth company we are also exempt from Section 14A (a) and (b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 which require the shareholder approval of executive compensation and golden parachutes.
