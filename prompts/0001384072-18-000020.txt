ITEM 1.  BUSINESS
Overview
We are an independent exploration and production company focused on the production and development of oil and natural gas properties in the United States. Through our operating subsidiaries, as of December 31, 2017, we own properties and oil and natural gas reserves primarily located in nine operating basins:

• | the Green River Basin in Wyoming;


• | the Piceance Basin in Colorado;


• | the Permian Basin in West Texas and New Mexico;


• | the Arkoma Basin in Arkansas and Oklahoma;


• | the Gulf Coast Basin in Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama;


• | the Big Horn Basin in Wyoming and Montana;


• | the Anadarko Basin in Oklahoma and North Texas;


• | the Wind River Basin in Wyoming; and


• | the Powder River Basin in Wyoming.

The Predecessor was formed in October 2006 as a Delaware limited liability company named Vanguard Natural Resources, LLC and completed its initial public offering in October 2007. On August 1, 2017, we emerged from bankruptcy and reorganized as a Delaware corporation named Vanguard Natural Resources, Inc. See “Emergence from Voluntary Reorganization under Chapter 11 Proceedings” included under Part I, Item 1 of this Annual Report for additional information. 
Following the completion of the financial restructuring on August 1, 2017 (Notes 1 and 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report), the Company had 20.1 million shares of its common stock outstanding. The Company’s shares of common stock and two series of warrants are traded and quoted on the OTCQX market (which is operated by OTC Markets Group, Inc.) under the symbols VNRR, VNRRW and VNRWW, respectively. 
Recent Developments
Management Changes
On January 15, 2018, the Company announced a number of changes to its management team. On that date, Scott W. Smith, the President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company, stepped down as President and Chief Executive Officer and from his position on the board of directors of the Company (the “Board”), effective immediately. The Company promoted R. Scott Sloan to President and Chief Executive Officer, effective January 17, 2018. In addition, the Company appointed Ryan Midgett as the Chief Financial Officer and Patty Avila-Eady as the Chief Accounting Officer of the Company. Britt Pence, the Company’s Executive Vice President of Operations, has also agreed to step down, effective on or before June 29, 2018 or such other time as mutually agreed with the Company.
Asset Divestiture Update
In 2018, the Company has launched marketing processes to initiate and explore the divestment of certain of its assets in Wind River (Wyoming) and its deep-rights leasehold acreage in Ward County, Texas. The Wind River properties consist of producing properties and leasehold rights in Fremont and Natrona Counties, Wyoming with current production of approximately 7,000 Mcf equivalent per day (84% gas). The Ward County properties consist of producing properties and certain deep-rights leasehold acreage in Ward County, Texas, with current production of approximately 300 Bbl equivalent per day (73% oil). Additionally, the Company is exploring and marketing additional asset divestitures, including a substantial

portion of its Gulf Coast assets as well as certain properties located in the Green River Basin excluding properties in the Pinedale field.
Emergence from Voluntary Reorganization under Chapter 11 Proceedings
On February 1, 2017, the Predecessor and certain subsidiaries (such subsidiaries, together with the Predecessor, the “Debtors”) filed voluntary petitions for relief (collectively, the “Bankruptcy Petitions” and, the cases commenced thereby, the “Chapter 11 Cases”) under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code (“Chapter 11”) in the Bankruptcy Court. The Chapter 11 Cases were administered under the caption “In re Vanguard Natural Resources, LLC, et al.”
Prior to the filing of the Bankruptcy Petitions, on February 1, 2017, we entered into a restructuring support agreement (the “Initial RSA”). The Debtors entered into the Initial RSA with: (i) certain holders of the 7.875% Senior Notes due 2020 (the “Senior Notes due 2020”), constituting at the time of signing approximately 52% of such holders (the “Consenting 2020 Noteholders”); (ii) certain holders of the 8.375% Senior Notes due 2019 (the “Senior Notes due 2019,” and together with the Senior Notes due 2020, the “Senior Notes”), constituting at the time of signing approximately 10% of such holders (the “Consenting 2019 Noteholders” and, together with the Consenting 2020 Noteholders, the “Consenting Senior Noteholders”); and (iii) certain holders of the 7.0% Senior Secured Second Lien Notes due 2023 (the “Old Second Lien Notes” or “Senior Notes due 2023”), constituting at the time of signing approximately 92% of such holders (the “Consenting Second Lien Noteholders”). 
On June 6, 2017, certain lenders under the Predecessor’s Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, dated as of September 30, 2011 (as amended from time to time, the “Predecessor Credit Facility”), among them, Citibank, N.A., as administrative agent and Issuing Bank, (such lenders, the “Consenting RBL Lenders” and, together with the Consenting Senior Noteholders and Consenting Second Lien Noteholders, the “Restructuring Support Parties”), became parties to the amended Restructuring Support Agreement dated as of May 23, 2017.
On July 18, 2017, the Bankruptcy Court entered the Order Confirming Debtors’ Modified Second Amended Joint Plan of Reorganization Under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code (the “Confirmation Order”), which approved and confirmed the Debtors’ Modified Second Amended Joint Plan of Reorganization Under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code (the “Final Plan”). The Final Plan provided for the reorganization of the Debtors as a going concern and significantly reduced the long-term debt and annual interest payments of the Successor. During the pendency of the Chapter 11 Cases, we operated our business as debtors-in-possession in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Bankruptcy Code and orders of the Bankruptcy Court.
The Debtors satisfied all conditions precedent under the Final Plan and emerged from bankruptcy on August 1, 2017. The Successor reorganized as a Delaware corporation named Vanguard Natural Resources, Inc. on the Effective Date. Pursuant to the Final Plan, each of the Predecessor’s equity securities outstanding immediately before the Effective Date (including any unvested restricted units held by employees or officers of the Debtor, or options and warrants to purchase such securities) have been cancelled and are of no further force or effect as of the Effective Date. Under the Final Plan, the Debtors’ new organizational documents became effective on the Effective Date. The Successor’s new organizational documents authorize the Successor to issue new equity, certain of which was issued to holders of allowed claims pursuant to the Final Plan on the Effective Date. In addition, on the Effective Date, the Successor entered into a registration rights agreement with certain equity holders.
Plan of Reorganization
Upon emergence, pursuant to the terms of the Final Plan, the following significant transactions occurred:

• | The Predecessor transferred all of its membership interests in VNG, a Kentucky limited liability company and the Predecessor’s wholly owned first-tier subsidiary, to the Successor (formerly known as VNR Finance Corp.). VNG directly or indirectly owned all of the other subsidiaries of the Predecessor. As a result of the foregoing and certain other transactions, the Successor is no longer a subsidiary of the Predecessor and now owns all of the former subsidiaries of the Predecessor;


• | VNG, as borrower, entered into that certain Fourth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement dated as of August 1, 2017 (the “Successor Credit Facility”), by and among VNG as borrower, Citibank, N.A. as administrative agent (the “Administrative Agent”) and Issuing Bank, and the lenders party thereto (the “Lenders”). Pursuant to the Successor Credit Facility, the lenders party thereto agreed to provide VNG with an $850.0 million exit senior secured reserve-based revolving credit facility (the “Revolving Loan”). The initial borrowing base available under the Successor Credit Facility as of the Effective Date was $850.0 million and the aggregate principal amount of Revolving Loans

3

outstanding under the Successor Credit Facility as of the Effective Date was $730.0 million. The Successor Credit Facility also includes an additional $125.0 million senior secured term loan (the “Term Loan”). The holders of claims under the Predecessor Credit Facility received a recovery, consisting of a cash pay down and their pro rata share of the Successor Credit Facility. The next borrowing base redetermination is scheduled for August of 2018; 

• | The Successor issued approximately $80.7 million aggregate principal amount of new 9.0% Senior Secured Second Lien Notes due 2024 (the “New Notes” or “Senior Notes due 2024”) to certain eligible holders of their outstanding Old Second Lien Notes in full satisfaction of their claim of approximately $80.7 million related to the Old Second Lien Notes held by such holders;


• | The Predecessor’s Senior Notes were cancelled and the holders of the Senior Notes received their pro rata share of 97.0% (subject to dilution by the other transactions referred to in this section) of the Common Stock, in full and final satisfaction of their claims;


• | The Predecessor completed a rights offering backstopped by certain holders of our Senior Notes (the “Backstop Parties”) which generated $275.0 million of gross proceeds. The rights offering resulted in subscriptions for 18.1 million shares of Successor common stock, representing approximately 89.92% of outstanding shares of Common Stock, to holders of claims arising under the Senior Notes and to the Backstop Parties;


• | The Successor entered into a Registration Rights Agreement (the “Registration Rights Agreement”) with certain recipients of shares of its Common Stock distributed on the Effective Date that were parties to the Amended and Restated Backstop Commitment Agreement (including the Backstop Parties and certain of their affiliates and related funds), in accordance with the terms set forth in the Final Plan (collectively, the “Registration Rights Holders”). Pursuant to the Registration Rights Agreement, we agreed to, among other things, file a registration statement with the SEC within 90 days of the Effective Date covering the offer and resale of “Registrable Securities” (as defined in the Registration Rights Agreement). We filed the registration statement on October 30, 2017;


• | Additional shares of Common Stock, representing 10% of outstanding shares of Common Stock on a fully diluted basis, were authorized for issuance under the Vanguard Natural Resources, Inc. 2017 Management Incentive Plan (the “MIP”);


• | All outstanding Preferred Units (defined below) issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Date were cancelled and the holders thereof received their pro rata shares of (i) 3% (subject to dilution by the other transactions referred to in this section) of outstanding shares of Common Stock and (ii) Preferred Unit Warrants (as defined below), in full and final satisfaction of their interests; 


• | All common equity of the Predecessor issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Date was cancelled and the holders of the common equity received Common Unit Warrants (as defined below), in full and final satisfaction of their interests;


• | The Successor entered into a warrant agreement (the “Warrant Agreement”) with American Stock Transfer & Trust Company, LLC, as warrant agent, pursuant to which the Successor issued (i) to electing holders of the Predecessor’s (A) 7.875% Series A Cumulative Redeemable Perpetual Preferred Units (“Series A Preferred Units”), (B) 7.625% Series B Cumulative Redeemable Perpetual Preferred Units (“Series B Preferred Units”), and (C) 7.75% Series C Cumulative Redeemable Perpetual Preferred Units (“Series C Preferred Units” and, together with the Series A Preferred Units and Series B Preferred Units, the “Preferred Units”), three and a half year warrants (the “Preferred Unit Warrants”), which will be exercisable to purchase up to 621,649 shares of the Common Stock as of the Effective Date; and (ii) to electing holders of the Predecessor’s common units representing limited liability company interests, three and a half year warrants (the “Common Unit Warrants” and, together with the Preferred Unit Warrants, the “Warrants”) which will be exercisable to purchase up to 640,876 shares of the Common Stock as of the Effective Date. The expiration date of the Warrants will be February 1, 2021. The strike price for the Preferred Unit Warrants is $44.25, and the strike price for the Common Unit Warrants is $61.45; 


• | By operation of the Final Plan and the Confirmation Order, the terms of the Predecessor’s board of directors expired as of the Effective Date. A new board was established for the Successor Company;


• | Certain other priority or convenience class claims were paid in full in cash, reinstated or otherwise treated in a manner acceptable to the creditor claimholders; and

4


• | The Successor issued 20.1 million shares of common stock, $0.001 par value (“Common Stock”).

Each of the foregoing percentages of equity in the Successor were as of August 1, 2017 and are subject to dilution from the exercise of the Warrants described above, the MIP discussed further in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 11, “Stockholders’ Equity (Members’ Deficit),” and other future issuances of equity interests.
Listing on the OTCQX Market 
As a result of cancellation of the Predecessor’s units on the Effective Date, the units ceased to trade on the OTC Markets Group Inc.’s Pink marketplace. In September 2017, the Successor’s common stock started trading on the OTCQX market under the symbol “VNRR.”
Accounting Policies
Upon emergence from bankruptcy, we had multiple changes to our accounting policies:

• | We applied fresh-start accounting in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 852, which resulted in our becoming a new entity for financial reporting purposes. Upon adoption of fresh-start accounting, our assets and liabilities were recorded at their fair values as of our emergence from the Chapter 11 Cases on August 1, 2017. The fair values of our assets and liabilities differ materially from the recorded values of our assets and liabilities as reflected in our Predecessor’s historical consolidated balance sheets;


• | We changed our method of accounting for natural gas and oil properties from the full cost method of accounting to the successful efforts method of accounting;


• | We adopted the new standard for revenue recognition under Accounting Standards Codification 606 (“ASC 606”) upon emergence. The new guidance requires us to recognize revenue upon transfer of goods or services to a customer at an amount that reflects the expected consideration to be received in exchange for those goods or services; and


• | We changed from a pass-through entity for tax purposes to a C-corporation and, accordingly, a taxable entity.

Fresh-Start Accounting 
In accordance with ASC 852, Reorganizations, the Successor Company was required to apply fresh-start accounting upon its emergence from bankruptcy. The Successor Company evaluated transaction activity between July 31, 2017 and the Effective Date and concluded that an accounting convenience date of July 31, 2017 (the “Convenience Date”) was appropriate for the adoption of fresh-start accounting which resulted in the Successor Company becoming a new entity for financial reporting purposes as of the Convenience Date.
We adopted fresh-start accounting in accordance with the provisions set forth in ASC 852 as (i) the fair value of the Successor Company’s total assets or the Reorganization Value of our assets immediately prior to the date of confirmation was less than the post-petition liabilities and allowed claims and (ii) the holders of our existing voting shares of the Predecessor entity received less than 50% of the voting shares of the emerging entity. Refer to “Plan of Reorganization” above for the terms of our reorganization under the Final Plan. Adopting fresh-start accounting results in a new financial reporting entity with no beginning or ending retained earnings or deficit balances as of the fresh-start reporting date. Upon the adoption of fresh-start accounting, our assets and liabilities were recorded at their fair values as of the fresh-start reporting date. Our adoption of fresh-start accounting may materially affect our results of operations following the fresh-start reporting date, as we have a new basis in our assets and liabilities. As a result of the adoption of fresh-start reporting and the effects of the implementation of the Final Plan, our consolidated financial statements subsequent to July 31, 2017 are not comparable to our consolidated financial statements prior to July 31, 2017, as such, “black-line” financial statements are presented to distinguish between the Predecessor and Successor companies. 
Proved Reserves
Our total estimated proved reserves at December 31, 2017 were 1,821.5 Bcfe, of which approximately 13% were oil reserves, 75% were natural gas reserves and 12% were NGLs reserves. Of these total estimated proved reserves, approximately 67% were classified as proved developed.  At December 31, 2017, estimated future cash inflows from estimated future production of proved reserves were computed in accordance with SEC (as defined under “Oil, Gas and NGLs Data - Estimated Proved Reserves) rules using the average oil, natural gas and NGLs price based upon the 12-month unweighted 
5

average of first-day-of-the-month price of $51.22 per barrel of crude oil, $2.99 per MMBtu for natural gas, and $19.24 per barrel of NGLs, as described under “Oil, Gas and NGLs Data - Estimated Proved Reserves.”
At December 31, 2017, we owned working interests in 11,287 gross (3,902 net) productive wells. Our operated wells accounted for approximately 43% of our total estimated proved reserves at December 31, 2017. Our average net daily production was 374,063 Mcfe/day for the year ended December 31, 2017 and was 362,011 Mcfe/day for the fourth quarter of 2017. Our average proved reserves-to-production ratio, or average reserve life, is approximately thirteen years based on our total proved reserves as of December 31, 2017 and our fourth quarter 2017 annualized production. 
Business Strategies
The Company is currently focused on adding value by efficiently operating our producing assets and, in certain areas, applying modern drilling and completion technologies in order to fully assess and realize potential development upside. Our primary business objective is to increase shareholder value by growing reserves, production and cash flow in a capital efficient manner by executing the following business strategies:

• | Manage our portfolio of assets actively, including divesting certain non-core assets to focus on the development of our core inventory of undeveloped locations, specifically in the Pinedale and Mamm Creek fields, located in the Green River Basin and the Piceance Basin, respectively, and Arkoma Woodford;


• | Continue to efficiently operate several of our long-lived, low decline oil and gas fields for production and cash flow;


• | Pursue a capital structure which affords financial flexibility; and


• | Use hedging strategies to reduce the volatility in our revenues resulting from changes in oil, natural gas and NGLs prices.

Properties

As of December 31, 2017, through certain of our subsidiaries, we own interests in oil and natural gas properties located in nine operating basins. The following table presents the production for the year ended December 31, 2017 and the estimated proved developed reserves for each operating area:

(b) | Present Value of Future Net Reserves (“PV-10”) is the present value of estimated future net revenues to be generated from the production of proved reserves, calculated net of estimated production costs and future development costs, using prices based on the 12-month unweighted average of first-day-of-the-month price, the “12-month average price”), and without giving effect to non-property related expenses such as selling, general and administrative expenses and debt service, future income tax expense or to depreciation, depletion, amortization, and accretion and discounted using an annual discount rate of 10%. PV-10 is not a measure of financial or operating performance under GAAP, nor should it be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows. We believe the PV-10 Value is a useful supplemental disclosure to the Standardized Measure because the PV-10 Value is a widely used measure within the industry and is commonly used by analysts, banks and credit rating agencies to evaluate the value of proved reserves on a comparative basis across companies or specific properties without regard to the owner's income tax position. We use the PV-10 Value for comparison against our debt balances, to evaluate properties that are bought and sold and to assess the potential return on investment from our oil and natural gas properties. For our presentation of the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows, please see “Supplemental Oil and Natural Gas Information” in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report. 

The following is a description of our properties by operating basin: 
Green River Basin Properties
Our Green River Basin properties are primarily comprised of assets in the Pinedale and Jonah fields of southwestern Wyoming. Production in these fields is dominated by natural gas and NGLs from tight sands formations. The Pinedale field lies at depths anywhere between 11,000 to 14,000 feet with similar depths in the adjacent Jonah field. Additionally, we have Green River Basin properties located in the Hay Reservoir, Great Divide, Siberia Ridge, Wamsutter, Echo Springs and Standard Draw fields in southwestern Wyoming. These gas/condensate fields produce from stacked cretaceous aged tight sandstones within the Lewis and Almond/Mesaverde intervals between 8,000 and 12,000 feet deep. Our properties located in south central Wyoming in the Sierra Madre field produce predominately oil from fractured cretaceous aged Niobrara limestone (between 5,000 and 6,000 feet) and conventional Shannon sandstone (between 3,500 and 4,000 feet). As of December 31, 2017, our Green River Basin properties consisted of 126,420 gross (35,170 net) leasehold acres. During 2017, the Green River Basin properties produced approximately 43,754 MMcfe of which 88% was natural gas. At December 31, 2017, the properties had total proved reserves of approximately 750,083 MMcfe or 41% of our total estimated proved reserves at year end, of which 47% were proved developed and 87% were natural gas.
Piceance Basin Properties
The Piceance Basin is located in northwestern Colorado. Our Piceance Basin properties, which we operate, are located in the Gibson Gulch. The Gibson Gulch area is a basin-centered gas play along the north end of the Divide Creek anticline near the eastern limits of the Piceance Basin’s productive Mesaverde (Williams Fork) trend at depths of approximately 6,000 to 8,000 feet. As of December 31, 2017, our Piceance Basin properties consisted of 25,320 gross (17,355 net) leasehold acres. During 2017, our properties in the Piceance Basin produced approximately 27,544 MMcfe, of which 66% was natural gas. At December 31, 2017, the Piceance Basin properties accounted for approximately 292,424 MMcfe or 16% of our total estimated proved reserves at year end, of which 94% were proved developed and 66% were natural gas.
Permian Basin Properties
The Permian Basin is one of the largest and most prolific oil and natural gas producing basins in the United States extending over West Texas and southeast New Mexico. The Permian Basin is characterized by oil and natural gas fields with long production histories and multiple producing formations. Our Permian Basin properties are located in several counties which extend from Eddy County, New Mexico to Ellis County, Texas and encompass hundreds of fields with multiple producing intervals. The majority of our producing wells in the Permian Basin are mature oil wells that also produce high-Btu casinghead gas with significant NGLs content. These properties primarily produce at depths ranging from 2,000 feet to 12,000 feet. As of December 31, 2017, our Permian Basin properties consisted of 339,888 gross (232,704 net) leasehold acres. These acreage totals include a reduction of approximately 4,467 gross (2,778 net) acres made during 2017. This adjustment is related to deep rights underlying certain leasehold acreage in Eddy and Lea Counties in New Mexico included in acreage totals within our Supplemental Emergence Presentation dated November 9, 2017, made available on our website. Upon further examination of title and related records, it was discovered that the deep rights related to such 4,467 gross (2,778 net) acres were held by a third party, with our interest therein being limited to an overriding royalty interest. During 2017, our Permian Basin operations produced approximately 16,849 MMcfe, of which 65% was oil, condensate and NGLs. At December 31, 2017, these properties 
7

accounted for approximately 144,095 MMcfe or 8% of our total estimated proved reserves at year end, of which 99% were proved developed and 64% were oil, condensate and NGLs. 
Arkoma Basin Properties
Our Arkoma Basin properties include properties in the Woodford Shale and Jackfork formations, located in eastern Oklahoma, the Fayetteville Shale, located in Arkansas, and royalty interests and non-operated working interest in both states. As of December 31, 2017, our Arkoma Basin properties consisted of 389,023 gross (179,381 net) leasehold acres. During 2017, the Arkoma Basin properties produced approximately 16,309 MMcfe, of which 93% was natural gas. At December 31, 2017, the properties had total proved reserves of approximately 337,571 MMcfe or 19% of our total estimated proved reserves at year end, of which 55% were proved developed and 96% were natural gas.
Gulf Coast Basin Properties
Our Gulf Coast Basin properties include properties in the onshore Gulf Coast area, North Louisiana, Alabama, East Texas, South Texas and Mississippi.
Production from our North Louisiana properties comes from the East Haynesville and Cotton Valley fields. These properties include multiple productive zones including Cotton Valley, James Lime, Pettet, Haynesville, Smackover and Hosston. East Haynesville is located in Claiborne Parish, Louisiana and lies at a depth of approximately 9,000 to 11,000 feet. The Cotton Valley field is located in Webster Parish, Louisiana and produces from an average depth of 11,000 feet. 
Our Alabaman properties include the Big Escambia Creek, Flomaton and Fanny Church fields located in Escambia County, Alabama. These fields produce from either the Smackover or Norphlet formations at depths ranging from approximately 15,000 to 16,000 feet. The Fanny Church field is located two miles east of Big Escambia Creek. The Flomaton field is adjacent to and partially underlies the Big Escambia Creek field and produces from the Norphlet formation at depths from approximately 15,000 to 16,000 feet. The Smackover and Norphlet reservoirs are sour gas condensate reservoirs which produce gas and fluids containing a high percentage of hydrogen sulfide and carbon dioxide. These impurities are extracted at the Company-operated Big Escambia Creek Treating facility and the effluent gas is further processed for the removal of natural gas liquids in the Big Escambia Creek Gas Processing facility. The operation of the wells and the facility is closely connected, and we are the largest owner and operator of the combined assets. In addition to selling condensate, natural gas, and NGLs, we also market elemental sulfur.
Our South Texas properties primarily are located in Hidalgo, LaSalle, Live Oak and Webb Counties. Most of the production is high Btu gas that is produced from the Olmos and Escondido sand formations from a depth averaging 7,500 feet. 
Our East Texas producing properties include the Fairway (James Lime Unit) field in Henderson and Anderson counties, and produces from an average depth of 10,000 feet. The Silsbee field is in Hardin County, Texas. Most of the Silsbee production is oil produced from the Yegua formation.
We operate the majority of our Mississippi properties which are located in the Mississippi Salt Basin. Most of our production comes from the Parker Creek field in Jones County, Mississippi. Our production is mainly oil that produces from the Hosston Formation from a depth ranging from approximately 13,000 feet to 15,000 feet. Our other Mississippi properties are located in Covington, Jasper, Clarke, Leflore, Jefferson Davis, Wayne and Walthall Counties.
As of December 31, 2017, our Gulf Coast Basin properties consisted of 161,554 gross (69,746 net) leasehold acres. During 2017, the Gulf Coast Basin properties produced approximately 12,057 MMcfe, of which 56% were oil, condensate and NGLs. At December 31, 2017, these properties accounted for approximately 133,731 MMcfe or 7% of our total estimated proved reserves at year end, of which 78% were proved developed and 50% were natural gas. 
Big Horn Basin Properties
The Big Horn Basin is a prolific basin which is characterized by oil and natural gas fields with long production histories and multiple producing formations.
Our Elk Basin field is located in Park County, Wyoming and Carbon County, Montana. We operate all of our properties in the Elk Basin area, which includes the Embar-Tensleep, Madison and Frontier formations as discussed below.
8

Embar-Tensleep Formation. Production in the Embar-Tensleep formation is being enhanced through a tertiary recovery technique involving effluent gas, or flue gas, from a natural gas processing facility located in the Elk Basin field. From 1949 to 1974, flue gas was injected into the Embar-Tensleep formation to increase pressure and improve production of resident hydrocarbons. Currently, we still use flue gas injection to maintain and improve production within this formation and have recently initiated a fresh water injection pilot on top of the structure. Our wells in the Embar-Tensleep formation of the Elk Basin field are drilled to a depth of 5,100 to 6,600 feet.

Madison Formation.  We continue to operate an active water injection program which is used to enhance production in the Madison formation. The wells in the Madison formation of the Elk Basin field are drilled to a depth of 4,400 to 7,000 feet.
Frontier Formation.  The Frontier formation is being produced through primary recovery techniques. The wells in the Frontier formation of the Elk Basin field are typically drilled to a depth of 1,400 to 2,700 feet.
We operate and own a 62% interest in the Elk Basin natural gas processing plant near Powell, Wyoming, which was first placed into operation in the 1940s. ExxonMobil Corporation (“Exxon”) owns a 34% interest in the Elk Basin natural gas processing plant, and other parties own the remaining 4% interest. This plant is a refrigeration natural gas processing plant that receives natural gas supplies through a natural gas gathering system from Elk Basin fields.
We also operate and own the Wildhorse pipeline system, which is an approximately 12-mile natural gas gathering system that transports approximately 1.0 MMcf/day of low-sulfur natural gas from the South Elk Basin fields to the Elk Basin natural gas processing plant.
Our Big Horn Basin properties are comprised of assets in Wyoming and the Elk Basin field in south central Montana. We own working interests ranging from 25% to 100% in our Big Horn Basin properties, which consisted of 24,512 gross (15,632 net) leasehold acres as of December 31, 2017. During 2017, our properties in the Big Horn Basin produced approximately 5,446 MMcfe, of which 86% was oil. At December 31, 2017, the Big Horn Basin properties accounted for approximately 83,348 MMcfe or 5% of our total estimated proved reserves at year end, of which 99% were proved developed and 96% were oil, condensate and NGLs.
Anadarko Basin Properties
The Anadarko Basin consists of operated and non-operated properties in the Verden field, and other fields located in the Anadarko Basin of western Oklahoma and the Texas Panhandle. Within the Anadarko Basin, our assets can generally be characterized by stratigraphic plays with multiple, stacked pay zones and more complex geology than our other operating areas. Properties in the Anadarko Basin include mature fields with long production histories.
As of December 31, 2017, our Anadarko Basin properties consisted of 99,884 gross (26,752 net) leasehold acres. During 2017, the Anadarko Basin properties produced approximately 2,874 MMcfe, of which 64% was natural gas. At December 31, 2017, these properties accounted for approximately 36,300 MMcfe or 2% of our total estimated proved reserves at year end, of which 99% were proved developed and 66% were natural gas. 
Wind River Basin Properties
The Wind River Basin is located in central Wyoming. Our activities are concentrated primarily in the eastern Wind River Basin, along the greater Waltman Arch. Our natural gas production in this basin is gathered through our own gathering systems and delivered to markets through pipelines owned by Tallgrass Interstate Gas Transmission and Colorado Interstate Gas (“CIG”). As of December 31, 2017, our Wind River Basin properties consisted of 87,531 gross (62,465 net) leasehold acres. During 2017, our Wind River Basin properties produced approximately 2,970 MMcfe, of which 86% was natural gas. At December 31, 2017, the properties had total proved reserves of approximately 25,976 MMcfe or 1% of our total estimated proved reserves, of which 100% were proved developed and 88% were natural gas.
Powder River Basin Properties
The Powder River Basin is primarily located in northeastern Wyoming. Our development operations are conducted in our coalbed methane (“CBM”) fields. CBM wells are drilled to 1,500 feet on average, targeting the Big George Coals, typically producing water in a process called dewatering. This process lowers reservoir pressure, allowing the gas to desorb from the coal and flow to the well bore. As the reservoir pressure declines, the wells begin producing methane gas at an increasing rate. As the wells mature, the production peaks, stabilizes and then begins declining. The average life of a CBM well can range from five to eleven years depending on the coal seam. Our natural gas production in this basin is gathered through gathering and 
9

pipeline systems owned by Powder River Midstream, Fort Union Gas Gathering, LLC and Thunder Creek Gas Services, LLC. As of December 31, 2017, our Powder River Basin properties consisted of 114,287 gross (66,866 net) leasehold acres. During 2017, the properties produced approximately 6,302 MMcfe, which was 100% natural gas. At December 31, 2017, the properties had total proved reserves of approximately 18,015 MMcfe or 1% of our total estimated proved reserves at year end, of which 75% were proved developed and 100% were natural gas.
Oil, Natural Gas and NGLs Prices
We analyze the prices we realize from sales of our oil, natural gas, and NGL production and the impact on those prices of differences in market-based index prices and the effects of our derivative activities. We market our oil and natural gas production to a variety of purchasers based on regional pricing. Our natural gas production is primarily sold under market sensitive contracts which are typically priced at a differential to the New York Mercantile Exchange (“NYMEX”) price or the published natural gas index price for the producing area due to the natural gas quality and the proximity to major consuming markets. The West Texas Intermediate Cushing, (“WTI”) price of crude oil is a widely used benchmark in the pricing of domestic and imported oil in the United States. The relative value of crude oil is mainly determined by its quality and location. In the case of WTI pricing, the crude oil is light and sweet, meaning that it has a higher specific gravity (lightness) measured in degrees of API (“American Petroleum Institute”) gravity and low sulfur content, and is priced for delivery at Cushing, Oklahoma. In general, higher quality crude oils (lighter and sweeter) with fewer transportation requirements result in higher realized pricing for producers. 
Certain of our natural gas marketing contracts determine the price that we are paid based on the value of the dry gas sold plus a portion of the value of NGLs extracted.  Since title of the natural gas sold under these contracts passes at the outlet of the processing plant, we report residue volumes of natural gas in Mcf as production. 
The average realized prices described below include deductions for gathering, transportation and processing fees; however, these prices do not include the impact of our hedges.
Production in the Green River Basin is predominantly natural gas and is processed for the recovery of NGLs. The processed natural gas in the Pinedale field is subject to a processing agreement with Western Gas Resources in their Granger Plant facility where we take our residue natural gas in-kind for sales and NGLs are taken in-kind and sold pursuant to a liquids purchase agreement. During 2017, we were able to renegotiate this processing agreement, lowering our fees significantly. We market our Green River Basin residue natural gas into the Rockies market through the use of multiple pipeline connections. During 2017, we received the average NYMEX price less $0.80 per Mcf of natural gas in the Green River Basin. Through our renegotiated processing agreement in the Pinedale field, we are given the opportunity to work directly with the plant to decide whether or not it is best to reject or recover ethane (C2). As of December 31, 2017, we expect to continue ethane rejection in Pinedale through 2018.
Production in the Piceance Basin is predominantly natural gas and is processed for the recovery of NGLs. The processed gas is subject to a processing agreement with Enterprise Gas Processing LLC, in their Meeker Plant facility. We market our natural gas production into the Rockies market at the Northwest Rockies index pricing. During 2017, we received the average NYMEX price less $0.95 per Mcf of natural gas in the Piceance Basin.
In the Permian Basin, most of our natural gas production is casinghead natural gas produced in conjunction with our oil production. Casinghead gas typically has a high Btu content and requires processing prior to sale to third parties. We have a number of processing agreements in place with gatherers/processors of our casinghead natural gas, and we share in the revenues associated with the sale of NGLs resulting from such processing, depending on the terms of the various agreements. For the year ended December 31, 2017, we received the average NYMEX price less $0.94 per Mcf of natural gas in the Permian Basin. Our oil production is sold under month-to-month sales contracts with purchasers that take delivery of the oil volumes at the tank batteries adjacent to the producing wells. We sell oil production from our operated Permian Basin properties at the wellhead to third party gathering and marketing companies. During 2017, we received the average NYMEX price less $4.05 per barrel of crude oil in the Permian Basin.
Our Arkoma Basin production in the southeastern Oklahoma Woodford Shale consists predominately of natural gas with a mix of high Btu processed natural gas and unprocessed lean natural gas. The natural gas production is gathered by multiple third party entities with the processed natural gas ultimately delivered to the Targa Resources, Inc. natural gas processing complex. The processed natural gas is subject to a processing agreement with Targa Resources, Inc., where we take our residue natural gas in-kind for sales, and NGLs are sold pursuant to the terms of the processing agreement. We are contractually provided the ability to make an election to recover or reject ethane (C2) in order to maximize product economics. During 2017, we elected to reject ethane, and expect to continue ethane rejection through 2018. The lean natural gas is primarily delivered 
10

directly to market. The natural gas was marketed at an Enable East index. For the year ended December 31, 2017, we received the average NYMEX price less $1.07 per Mcf of natural gas.
In the Gulf Coast Basin, our natural gas production has a high Btu content and requires processing prior to sale to third parties. Our proportionate share of the natural gas volumes are sold at the tailgate of the processing plant at the Houston Ship Channel and Waha Gas index pricing which typically results in a discount to NYMEX prices. For the year ended December 31, 2017, we received the average NYMEX price less $0.64 per Mcf of natural gas.
The marketing of heavy sour crude oil production from our Big Horn Basin properties is done through our Clearfork pipeline, which transports the crude oil to local and other refiners through connections with other pipelines.  Our Big Horn Basin sweet crude oil production is transported from the field by a third-party trucking company that delivers the crude oil to a centralized facility connected to a common carrier pipeline with delivery points accessible to local refiners in the Salt Lake City, Utah and Guernsey, Wyoming market centers. During 2017, we received the average NYMEX price less $7.99 per barrel of crude oil in the Big Horn Basin. 
 In the Williston Basin, we produced a combination of sweet and legacy sour oil. This oil is both connected to oil pipelines as well as trucked out for sales and there is minimal natural gas associated with this production. During 2017, we received the average NYMEX price less $7.18 per barrel of crude oil in the Williston Basin. On December 21, 2017, we divested substantially all of our Williston assets with an effective date of August 1, 2017.
Our Anadarko Basin production in Oklahoma consists predominately of natural gas with a mix of high Btu processed natural gas and unprocessed lean natural gas. The natural gas production is gathered by multiple third party entities. The lean natural gas is gathered by Enable Gathering & Processing LLC and sold to market at Enable Oklahoma Intrastate Transmission LLC’s West pool at the Panhandle, TX-Okla. index pricing. The high Btu gas is sold at the wellhead to various third party entities. The majority is sold to Oneok Field Services Company LLC and DCP Midstream LP under gas purchase contracts subject to percent of proceeds pricing for all products. During 2017, we received the average NYMEX price less $1.49 per Mcf of natural gas in the Anadarko Basin. 
Our Wind River Basin properties are predominantly natural gas plays with approximately two-thirds of the production being processed at natural gas plants for the extraction of NGLs at our election. Our residue natural gas is sold into the Rockies market at the CIG index price while the NGLs are sold to a third-party natural gas processor pursuant to a processing agreement. 
Our Powder River natural gas production is classified as CBM gas and, as it is a very dry gas, is sold directly into the market upon being handled with conventional separation, treating, and transportation. In 2017, we were able to renegotiate our current gathering agreement to allow for lower rates, effective December 1, 2017. The CBM gas is sold into the Rockies market at the CIG index price as well. During 2017, we received the average NYMEX price less $0.82 per Mcf of natural gas in the Wind River Basin while we received the average NYMEX price less $1.96 per Mcf of natural gas in the Powder River Basin.

(1) | PV-10 is the present value of estimated future net revenues to be generated from the production of proved reserves, calculated net of estimated production costs and future development costs, using prices based on the 12-month unweighted average of first-day-of-the-month price, the “12-month average price”, and without giving effect to non-property related expenses such as selling, general and administrative expenses and debt service, future income tax expense or to depreciation, depletion, amortization, and accretion and discounted using an annual discount rate of 10%. PV-10 is not a measure of financial or operating performance under GAAP, nor should it be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows. For our presentation of the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows, please see “Supplemental Oil and Natural Gas Information” in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report. 

The data in the above tables represent estimates only. Oil, natural gas and NGLs reservoir engineering is inherently a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of oil, natural gas and NGLs that cannot be measured in an exact manner, and the accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data and of engineering and geological interpretation and judgment. The quantities of oil, natural gas and NGLs that are ultimately recovered, production and operating costs, the amount and timing of future development expenditures and future sales prices may differ from those assumed in these estimates. Please read “Item 1A. Risk Factors.”

Our internal reservoir engineers’ estimates of future net revenues from our properties, and the PV-10 and standardized measure thereof, were determined to be economically producible under existing economic conditions using the unweighted arithmetic average first day of the month prices for the 12-month period ended December 31, 2017 for each product.
Future prices received for production and costs may vary, perhaps significantly, from the prices and costs assumed for purposes of these estimates. The PV-10 and standardized measure disclosed in this Annual Report should not be construed as the current market value of the reserves. The 10% discount factor used to calculate present value, which is required by Financial Accounting Standards Board’s (“FASB”) ASC, is not necessarily the most appropriate discount rate. The present value, no matter what discount rate is used, is materially affected by assumptions as to the timing of future production, which may prove to be inaccurate.
Proved Undeveloped Reserves 
 During 2017, our proved undeveloped reserves increased by approximately 596.2 Bcfe primarily due to additions of
undeveloped reserves which were classified as contingent resources as of December 31, 2016, due to uncertainty regarding the availability of capital that would be required to develop the PUD reserves prior to the filing of and emergence from bankruptcy. 
 The PV-10 Value of our proved undeveloped reserves was $140.0 million at December 31, 2017.
We expect to spend approximately 68% of our planned five year future development costs within the next three years as reflected in our reserve report. We did not report any proved undeveloped reserves at December 31, 2016. Consequently, we did not have any proved undeveloped reserves to convert to proved developed reserves during 2017.
 Our development plan for drilling proved undeveloped wells includes the drilling of 197 net wells before the end of 2022 at an estimated cost of $524.8 million. This development plan calls for the drilling and completion of 59 net wells during 2018, 41 net wells during 2019, 43 net wells during 2020, 34 net wells during 2021 and 20 net wells during 2022. The expected plan of development of our total proved undeveloped reserves at December 31, 2017, over the next five years is as follows:

 | Percent of Proved Undeveloped Reserves Expected to be Converted 
2018 | 25% 
2019 | 22% 
2020 | 21% 
2021 | 19% 
2022 | 13% 
Total | 100% 

At December 31, 2017, none of our proved undeveloped properties are scheduled to be drilled on a date more than five years from the date the reserves were initially booked as proved undeveloped. Additionally, none of our proved undeveloped reserves at December 31, 2017 have remained undeveloped for more than five years, as all proved undeveloped reserves are considered 2017 additions.
Our development plan discussed above for drilling proved undeveloped wells represents management’s final investment decision to drill these proved undeveloped reserves at the time the applicable proved undeveloped reserves are booked. However, the timing of such drilling is subject to change based on a number of factors, many of which are unpredictable and beyond our control, such as (i) changes in commodity prices, (ii) anticipated cash flows and projected rate of return, (iii) access to capital, (iv) new opportunities with better returns on investment that were not known at the time of the reserve report, (v) asset acquisitions and/or sales and (vi) actions or inactions of other co-owners or industry operators. As such, the relative proportion of total proved undeveloped reserves that we develop may not necessarily be uniform from year to year, but could vary by year based upon the foregoing factors. We attempt to maximize the rate of return on capital deployed, which requires that we continually review all investment options available. As a result, at times we may delay or remove the drilling of certain projects, including scheduled proved undeveloped reserves development, in favor of projects with a more attractive rate of return, leading us to deviate from our original development plan.
Substantially all of our developed and undeveloped leasehold acreage is held by production, which means that as long as our wells on the acreage continue to produce, we will continue to hold the leases. The leases in which we hold an interest that are not held by production are not material to us since these leases have no proved undeveloped reserves assigned. 
14

Reserve Estimation Process
Estimates of proved reserves at December 31, 2017 disclosed in this Annual Report, including proved reserve volumes, PV-10 and the standardized measure of future net cash flows, were based on studies performed by our internal reservoir engineers in accordance with guidelines established by the SEC. Our reserve estimation process is a collaborative effort coordinated by our reservoir engineers in compliance with our internal controls for such process. Reserve information as well as models used to estimate such reserves are stored on secured databases. Non-technical inputs used in reserve estimation models, including crude oil, natural gas and NGLs prices, production costs, future capital expenditures and our net ownership percentages are obtained from other departments within the Company. Our internal reservoir engineers perform review procedures with respect to such non-technical inputs. Reserve variances are discussed among the internal reservoir engineers and the Executive Vice President of Operations.
We use technologies to establish proved reserves that have been demonstrated to provide consistent results capable of repetition. The technologies and economic data being used in the estimation of our proved reserves include, but are not limited to, production data, well test data, geologic maps, electrical logs and radioactivity logs. The estimated reserves of wells with sufficient production history are estimated using appropriate decline curves. Estimated reserves of producing wells with limited production history and for undeveloped locations are estimated using performance data from analogous wells in the area. These wells are considered analogous based on production performance from the same formation and with similar completion techniques.
Our reservoir engineering group is directly responsible for our reserve evaluation process and consists of eight professionals, four of whom hold, at a minimum, bachelor’s degrees in engineering. Within our Company, our Reservoir Engineering Manager is the technical person primarily responsible for overseeing the preparation of the reserve estimates. Our Reservoir Engineering Manager has over 30 years of experience and graduated from the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee with a Master of Science Degree in Geology/Geophysics.

The technical persons responsible for preparing the reserve estimates presented herein meet the requirements regarding qualifications, independence, objectivity and confidentiality set forth in the Standards Pertaining to the Estimating and Auditing of Oil and Gas Reserves Information promulgated by the Society of Petroleum Engineers.
Independent Audit of Reserves
We engage independent petroleum engineers to audit our reserve estimates. Our internal policies and procedures require the independent engineers to prepare their own estimates of proved reserves for properties comprising at least 80% of our year-end proved reserves. Our board of directors requires that the independent petroleum engineers’ estimate of reserve quantities for the properties audited by the independent petroleum engineers are within 10% of our internal estimate. Once completed, our internally prepared year-end reserve estimates are presented to senior management, including the President and Chief Executive Officer, the Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, and the Executive Vice President of Operations, for approval.
For the year ended December 31, 2017, we engaged Miller and Lents, an independent petroleum engineering firm, to perform reserve audit services. The opinion by Miller and Lents for the year ended December 31, 2017 covered producing areas containing 100% of our proved reserves on a net-equivalent-barrel-of-oil basis. Miller and Lents’ opinion indicates that the estimates of proved reserves related to our oil and natural gas properties prepared by our internal reservoir engineers and reviewed by Miller and Lents, when compared in total on a net-gas-equivalent basis, do not differ materially from the estimates prepared by Miller and Lents. Such estimates by Miller and Lents in the aggregate were within our 10% variation tolerance when compared to those prepared by our reservoir engineering group. The report prepared by Miller and Lents was developed utilizing geological and engineering data we provided. The report of Miller and Lents dated January 31, 2018, which contains further discussion of the reserve estimates and evaluations prepared by Miller and Lents, as well as the qualifications of Miller and Lents’ technical person primarily responsible for overseeing such estimates and evaluations, is attached as Exhibit 99.1 to this Annual Report and incorporated herein by reference. 
Within Miller and Lents, the lead technical person primarily responsible for overseeing the audit of our reserves is Ms. Leslie A. Fallon. Ms. Fallon is a Senior Vice President with Miller and Lents and has over 30 years of experience in oil and gas reservoir studies and reserves evaluations. She graduated from the University of Texas at Austin in 1983 with a Bachelor of Science Degree in Mechanical Engineering and is a licensed Professional Engineer in the State of Texas. Ms. Fallon meets or exceeds the education, training and experience requirements set forth in the Standards Pertaining to the Estimating and Auditing of Oil and Gas Reserves Information promulgated by the Society of Petroleum Engineers and is proficient in applying industry standard practices to engineering and geoscience evaluations as well as applying SEC and other industry reserves definitions and guidelines.
15

During 2017, we paid fees of approximately $0.4 million to independent petroleum engineers for all reserve and economic evaluations.
Production and Price History
The following table sets forth information regarding net production of oil, natural gas and NGLs and certain price and cost information for each of the periods indicated.

Drilling Activity
The following is a description of the Company’s drilling and completion activities during the year ended December 31, 2017.
In the Green River Basin, we participated in the drilling of 170 gross wells (24.2 net) and the completion of 137 gross wells (19.7 net) in Sublette County in southwestern Wyoming. These wells are directionally drilled from pads but are vertical through the 5,000 feet pay section. The average well depth is approximately 14,000 feet and is typically completed with 14 to 20 frac 
17

stages. In addition, we drilled and completed one operated vertical well with 100% working interest in Carbon County, Wyoming. The well was drilled to a vertical depth of approximately 4,000 feet. 
In the Permian Basin, we participated in the drilling and completion of two gross vertical wells (0.07 net) in Gaines County, Texas. We also participated in the drilling of five gross (0.06 net) horizontal wells in Eddy County, New Mexico. The vertical wells were drilled to average depths of approximately 7,000 feet to 8,000 feet. The horizontal wells were drilled to vertical depths of 7,000 to 9,000 feet and extended with horizontal lateral lengths of approximately 7,000 to 10,000 feet.
In the Gulf Coast Basin, we drilled six (5.3 net) operated wells and completed four (3.7 net) operated wells in the East Haynesville field in Claiborne County, Louisiana. Three of these wells are directionally drilled from pads but are vertical through the 500 to 1,000 feet pay section. The average well depth is approximately 10,000 feet and is typically completed with 2 to 3 frac stages. 
In the Piceance Basin, we drilled five gross (4.98 net) operated wells working interest in Garfield County, Colorado. These wells are directionally drilled from pads but are vertical through the 2,500 feet pay section. The average well depth is approximately 8,000 feet and is typically completed with 8 frac stages. 
In the Big Horn Basin, we participated in the drilling and completion of four gross (1 net) wells in Park County, Wyoming. These wells are directionally drilled from pads but are vertical through the 400 feet pay section. The average well depth is approximately 6,500 feet and is typically completed with 2 frac stages. We also drilled one gross (0.60 net) operated well working interest in Carbon County, Montana. 
In the Arkoma Basin, we participated in the drilling and completion of three gross (0.07 net) wells in Logan and Cleburne Counties in Arkansas. We also participated in the drilling of seven (0.9 net) horizontal wells in Coal and Pittsburg counties in Oklahoma. These wells were drilled to vertical depths of 7,000 to 10,000 feet and extended with horizontal lateral lengths of approximately 5,000 to 10,000 feet. 
In the Anadarko Basin, we participated in the drilling of six gross (0.06 net) horizontal wells and the completion of four gross (0.06 net) horizontal wells in several counties in Oklahoma. These wells were drilled to vertical depths of 8,000 to 13,000 feet and extended with horizontal lateral lengths of approximately 5,000 to 7,000 feet. 
The Board approved an initial capital expenditures budget for 2018 of $160.0 million compared to the $109.9 million we spent in 2017. Our initial 2018 capital expenditures budget includes approximately $135.0 million of drilling and completion capital, or 85% of the total capital budget. More than 97% of the drilling and completion capital is focused on the core growth assets of the Green River, Piceance and Arkoma Basins. We expect to spend between $90.0 million to $95.0 million or approximately 69% of the drilling capital budget in the Green River Basin at the Pinedale field where we will participate as a non-operated partner in the drilling and completion of vertical and horizontal natural gas wells.  Additionally, we expect to spend between $20.0 million to $26.0 million or approximately 15% of the drilling capital budget in the Piceance Basin, at the Mamm Creek field where we will operate a one rig program drilling and completing vertical gas wells. We also expect to spend approximately 13% of our budgeted drilling capital in the Arkoma Basin in Oklahoma where we will be participating as a non-operated partner with Newfield and BP in a one rig program drilling and completing horizontal Woodford wells. The remaining drilling and completion capital will be spent on additional drilling, completion and production uplift projects in the Permian, Big Horn, and Powder River Basins. The Company intends to release a revised 2018 capital expenditures budget and other guidance with the release of its first quarter results that will include, among other items, the impact of reduced rig counts with increased horizontal development spending in the Pinedale field.
The following table sets forth information with respect to wells completed during the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015. Our drilling activity during these periods has consisted entirely of drilling development wells. We have not drilled any exploratory wells during these periods. The information should not be considered indicative of future performance, nor should it be assumed that there is necessarily any correlation between the number of productive wells drilled, quantities of reserves found or economic value. Productive wells are those that produce commercial quantities of oil, natural gas, and NGLs regardless of whether they produce a reasonable rate of return.

Operations

Principal Customers
For the seven months ended July 31, 2017 (Predecessor), sales of oil, natural gas and NGLs to ConocoPhillips, Mieco Inc., Plains Marketing, L.P., Exxon Mobil and XTO Energy accounted for approximately 13%, 11%, 7%, 6% and 3%, respectively, of our oil, natural gas and NGLs revenues and for the five months ended December 31, 2017 (Successor), sales of oil, natural gas and NGLs to ConocoPhillips, Mieco Inc., Plains Marketing, L.P., Exxon Mobil, and Energy Midstream accounted for approximately 14%, 12%, 7%, 7%,and 3%, respectively, of our oil, natural gas and NGLs revenues. Our top five purchasers during the seven months ended July 31, 2017 and the five months ended December 31, 2017 therefore accounted for 40% and 43%, respectively, of our total revenues. To the extent these and other customers reduce the volumes of oil, natural gas and NGLs that they purchase from us and they are not replaced in a timely manner with a new customer, our revenues and cash flows from operations could decline. However, if we were to lose a customer, we believe a substitute purchaser could be identified in a timely manner and upon similar terms and conditions.
Delivery Commitments and Marketing Arrangements
Our oil and natural gas production is principally sold to marketers, processors, refiners, and other purchasers that have access to nearby pipeline, processing and gathering facilities. In areas where there is no practical access to pipelines, oil is trucked to central storage facilities where it is aggregated and sold to various markets and downstream purchasers. Our production sales agreements generally contain customary terms and conditions for the oil and natural gas industry, provide for sales based on prevailing market prices in the area, and generally are month-to-month or have terms of one year or less. 
We generally sell our natural gas production from our operated properties on the spot market or under market-sensitive, short-term agreements with credit-worthy purchasers, including independent marketing companies, gas processing companies, and other purchasers who have the ability to pay the highest price for the natural gas production and move the natural gas under the most efficient and effective transportation agreements. Because all of our natural gas production from our operated properties is sold under market-priced agreements, we are positioned to take advantage of future increases in natural gas prices but we are also subject to any future price declines. We do market our own natural gas on some of our non-operated properties. 
The marketing of heavy sour crude oil production from our Big Horn Basin properties is done through our Clearfork pipeline, which transports the crude oil to local and other refiners through connections to other export pipelines. Our Big Horn Basin sweet crude oil production is transported from the field by a third party trucking company that delivers the crude oil to a centralized facility connected to a common carrier pipeline with delivery points accessible to local refiners in the Salt Lake City, Utah and Guernsey, Wyoming market centers. We sell oil production from our operated Permian Basin properties at the wellhead to third-party gathering and marketing companies.
Our natural gas is transported through our own and third-party gathering systems and pipelines, and we incur processing, gathering and transportation expenses to move our natural gas from the wellhead to a specified delivery point. These expenses vary based on the volume and distance shipped, and the fee charged by the third-party gatherer, processor or transporter. Capacity on these gathering systems and pipelines is occasionally limited and at times unavailable because of repairs or improvements, or as a result of priority transportation agreements with other gas shippers. While our ability to market our natural gas has been only infrequently limited or delayed, if transportation space is restricted or is unavailable, our cash flow from the affected properties could be adversely affected. In certain instances, we may enter into firm transportation agreements to provide for pipeline capacity to flow and sell a portion of our gas volumes. Currently, a majority of our existing firm transportation agreements were assumed in connection with acquisitions of oil and natural gas properties. These agreements 
19

have term delivery commitments of fixed and determinable quantities of natural gas. Please see “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Commitments and Contractual Obligations” for additional information regarding our long-term firm transportation contracts.
The following table sets forth information about material long-term firm transportation contracts for pipeline capacity, which typically require a demand charge. We source the gas to meet these commitments from our producing properties. We have certain commitments that we assumed as part of our acquisitions of oil and gas properties where the production from the acquired properties and the production of joint interest owners that we market were not adequate to meet the commitments resulting in us paying the set demand charge relating to the maximum daily quantity outlined in the contract. During the year ending December 31, 2018, our firm transportation contracts obligate us to deliver 30,000 MMBtu of natural gas per day. 

Type of Arrangement | Pipeline System /Location | Deliverable Market | Gross Deliveries (MMBtu/d) | Term 
Firm Transport | WIC Medicine Bow | Rocky Mountains | 25,000 | 01/18 – 06/20
Firm Transport | Cheyenne Plains | Midcontinent | 5,000 | 01/18 – 05/18

Price Risk Management Activities
We routinely enter into derivative transactions in the form of hedging arrangements to reduce the impact of oil, natural gas and NGLs price volatility on our cash flow from operations. Currently, we primarily use fixed-price swaps and other hedge option contracts to hedge oil and natural gas prices. By removing the price volatility from a significant portion of our oil and natural gas production, we are able to mitigate for a period of time, but not eliminate, the potential effects of fluctuation in oil and natural gas prices on our cash flow from operations. For a description of our derivative positions, please read “Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.”
Competition

The oil and natural gas industry is highly competitive. We encounter strong competition from other independent operators and from major oil companies in acquiring properties, leasing acreage, contracting for drilling equipment and securing trained personnel. Many of these competitors have financial and technical resources and staff substantially larger than ours or a different business model. As a result, our competitors may be able to pay more for desirable leases, or to evaluate, bid for, purchase, or develop a greater number of properties or prospects than our financial, technical or personnel resources will permit.

We are also affected by competition for drilling rigs and the availability of related equipment. In the past, the oil and natural gas industry has experienced shortages of drilling rigs, equipment, pipe and personnel, which has delayed development drilling and has caused significant price increases. We are unable to predict when, or if, such shortages may occur or how they would affect our development program.

Competition is also strong for attractive oil and natural gas producing properties, undeveloped leases and drilling rights, and we cannot assure stockholders that we will be able to compete satisfactorily when attempting to make future acquisitions.

Title to Properties
As is customary in the oil and natural gas industry, we initially conduct only a cursory review of the title to our properties on which we do not have proved reserves. Prior to the commencement of drilling operations on those properties, however, we conduct a thorough title examination and perform curative work with respect to significant defects. To the extent title opinions or other investigations reflect title defects on those properties, we are typically responsible for curing any title defects at our expense. We will not commence drilling operations on a property until we have cured any material title defects on such property. Prior to completing an acquisition of producing oil and natural gas leases, we perform title reviews on the most significant leases and, depending on the materiality of properties, we may obtain a title opinion or review previously obtained title opinions. As a result, we have obtained title opinions on a significant portion of our oil and natural gas properties and believe that we have satisfactory title to our producing properties in accordance with standards generally accepted in the oil and natural gas industry. Although title to these properties is subject to encumbrances in some cases, such as customary interests generally retained in connection with acquisition of real property, customary royalty interests, contract terms and restrictions, liens under operating agreements, liens related to environmental liabilities associated with historical operations, liens for taxes not yet payable and other burdens, restrictions and minor encumbrances customary in the oil and natural gas industry, we believe that none of these liens, restrictions, easements, burdens and encumbrances will materially detract from the value of 
20

these properties or from our interest in these properties, or will materially interfere with our use of these properties in the operation of our business.
Natural Gas Gathering
We own and operate a network of natural gas gathering systems in the Gulf Coast Basin, Piceance Basin, Big Horn Basin, and the Potato Hills Pipeline. These systems gather and transport our natural gas and a small amount of third-party natural gas to larger gathering systems and intrastate, interstate and local distribution pipelines. Our network of natural gas gathering systems permits us to transport production from our wells with fewer interruptions and also minimizes any delays associated with a gathering company extending its lines to our wells. Our ownership and control of these lines enables us to:

• | realize faster connection of newly drilled wells to the existing system;


• | control pipeline operating pressures and capacity to maximize production;


• | control compression costs and fuel use;


• | maintain system integrity;


• | control the monthly nominations on the receiving pipelines to prevent imbalances and penalties; and


• | track sales volumes and receipts closely to assure all production values are realized.

Seasonal Nature of Business
Seasonal weather conditions, severe weather events, and lease stipulations can limit our drilling and producing activities and other operations in some of our operating areas. These seasonal anomalies can pose challenges for meeting our well drilling objectives and increase competition for equipment, supplies and personnel, which could lead to shortages and increased costs or delay our operations. Generally, but not always, oil is typically in higher demand in the late summer due to the summer driving season, which results in increased gasoline and diesel usage and natural gas is in higher demand in the winter for heating. Seasonal anomalies such as hot summers or mild winters, which are unpredictable, sometimes impact this fluctuation. In addition, certain natural gas consumers utilize natural gas storage facilities and purchase some of their anticipated winter requirements during the summer. This can also lessen seasonal demand fluctuations.
Environmental and Occupational Health and Safety Matters
General.   Our business involving the acquisition and development of oil and natural gas properties is subject to extensive and stringent federal, state and local laws and regulations governing the discharge of materials into the environment, environmental protection, and the health and safety of employees. Our operations are subject to the same environmental, health and safety laws and regulations as other similarly situated companies in the oil and natural gas industry. These laws and regulations may:

• | require the acquisition of permits before commencing drilling or other regulated activities;


• | require the installation of expensive pollution control equipment and performance of costly remedial measures to mitigate or prevent pollution from historical and ongoing operations, such as pit closure and plugging of abandoned wells;


• | restrict the types, quantities and concentration of various substances that can be released into the environment in connection with drilling and production activities;


• | limit or prohibit drilling activities on lands lying within wilderness, wetlands and other protected areas;


• | impose specific health and safety criteria addressing worker protection;


• | impose substantial liabilities for pollution resulting from operations; and


• | require preparation of a Resource Management Plan, an Environmental Assessment, and/or an Environmental Impact Statement for operations affecting federal lands or leases.

Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of sanctions, including administrative, civil and criminal penalties, imposition of removal or remedial obligations, and the issuance of orders enjoining some or all of our operations deemed in non-compliance. Moreover, these laws and regulations may restrict our ability to produce oil, natural gas and NGLs by, among other things, limiting production from our wells, limiting the number of wells we are allowed to drill or limiting the locations at which we may conduct our drilling operations. The regulatory burden on the oil and natural gas 
21

industry increases the cost of doing business in the industry and consequently affects profitability. Additionally, changes in environmental laws and regulations occur frequently, and any changes that result in more stringent and costly well drilling, construction, completion and water management activities, or waste handling, disposal and clean-up requirements for the oil and natural gas industry could have a significant impact on our operating costs. We believe that operation of our wells is in substantial compliance with all current applicable environmental laws and regulations and that our continued compliance with existing requirements will not have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. However, we cannot provide any assurance that we will not incur substantial costs in the future related to revised or additional environmental regulations that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. For the year ended December 31, 2017, we did not incur any material capital expenditures for performance of remediation or installation of pollution control equipment at any of our facilities; however, we did incur capital expenditures in the ordinary course of business to comply with pollution control requirements. As of the date of this Annual Report, we are not aware of any environmental issues or claims that will require material capital expenditures during 2018 or that will otherwise have a material adverse impact on our financial position or results of operations.

The following is a summary of the more significant existing environmental and occupational health and safety laws to which our business operations are subject and for which compliance may have a material adverse impact on our operations as well as the oil and natural gas exploration and production industry in general.

Waste Handling.  The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, as amended, or “RCRA,” and comparable state laws, regulate the generation, transportation, treatment, storage, disposal and cleanup of “hazardous wastes” as well as the disposal of non-hazardous wastes. Under the auspices of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, or the “EPA,” individual states administer some or all of the federal provisions of RCRA, sometimes in conjunction with their own, more stringent state requirements. Drilling fluids, produced waters, and many other wastes associated with the exploitation, development, and production of crude oil, natural gas, or geothermal energy are currently regulated under RCRA’s less stringent non-hazardous waste provisions. However, by amendment of existing RCRA laws and regulations, it is possible that certain oil and natural gas exploration and production wastes now classified as non-hazardous could be classified as hazardous wastes in the future. Any such change could increase our costs to manage and dispose of such generated wastes, which cost increase could be significant. In the course of our operations, we generate some amounts of ordinary industrial wastes, such as paint wastes, waste solvents and waste oils that may be regulated as RCRA hazardous wastes.

 Hazardous Substance Releases.   The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, as amended, also known as “CERCLA,” or “Superfund,” and analogous state laws, impose joint and several liability, without regard to fault or legality of conduct, on certain classes of persons who are considered to be responsible for the release of a “hazardous substance” into the environment. These persons include the owner or operator of the site where the release occurred and companies that transported or disposed or arranged for the transportation or disposal of the hazardous substance found at the site. Under CERCLA, such persons may be liable for the costs of cleaning up the hazardous substances that have been released into the environment, for damages to natural resources and for the costs of certain health studies. In addition, it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the hazardous substances released into the environment. While materials are generated in the course of operation of our wells that may be regulated as hazardous substances, we have not received any pending notifications that we may be potentially responsible for cleanup costs under CERCLA.

We currently own, lease, or have a non-operating interest in numerous properties that have been used for oil and natural gas production for many years. Although we believe that operating and waste disposal practices used on these properties in the past were standard in the industry at the time, hazardous substances, wastes, or petroleum hydrocarbons may have been released on or under the properties owned or leased by us, or on or under other locations, including off-site locations, where these substances, wastes and hydrocarbons have been taken for treatment or disposal. In addition, some of these properties have been operated by third parties or by previous owners or operators whose treatment and disposal of hazardous substances, wastes, or hydrocarbons was not under our control. These properties and the substances disposed or released on them may be subject to CERCLA, RCRA and analogous state laws. Under such laws, we could be required to remove previously disposed substances and wastes, remediate contaminated property, or perform remedial plugging or pit closure operations to prevent future contamination.
As of December 31, 2017, we have recorded $4.2 million for future remedial costs and abandonment liability for decommissioning the Big Escambia Creek, Elk Basin, and Fairway natural gas processing plants.

• | Our Elk Basin assets include a natural gas processing plant. Previous environmental investigations identified historical soil and groundwater contamination by hydrocarbons and the presence of asbestos-containing material at the site. Although the environmental investigations did not identify an immediate need for remediation of the suspected

22

historical hydrocarbon contamination or abatement of the asbestos, the extent of the hydrocarbon contamination is not known and, therefore, the potential liability for remediating this contamination may be significant. In the event we cease operating the gas plant, the cost of decommissioning it and addressing the previously identified environmental conditions and other conditions, such as waste disposal, could be significant. We do not anticipate ceasing operations at the Elk Basin natural gas processing plant in the near future nor a need to commence remedial activities at this time. However, a regulatory agency could require us to investigate and remediate any hydrocarbon contamination even while the gas plant remains in operation. 

• | In addition, we own and operate the Fairway natural gas processing plant in the Gulf Coast Basin, for which we have reserved abandonment costs.


• | We continue to operate a groundwater remediation project at our Big Escambia Creek gas plant. This release occurred when a prior owner operated the Big Escambia Creek gas plant. We operate our pump and treat system to treat groundwater under the supervision of the Alabama Department of Environmental Management. We conducted repairs on the existing system in 2017 to help reduce the downtimes and increase rates of water volume treated. 

Our estimates of the future remediation cost are subject to change, and the actual cost of these items could vary significantly from the above estimates. Due to the significant uncertainty associated with the known environmental liabilities at the gas plants, our estimate of the future abandonment liability includes a reserve.
Pipeline Safety.  The Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (“PHMSA”) regulates safety of oil and natural gas pipelines, including, with some specific exceptions, oil and natural gas gathering lines. From time to time, PHMSA, state agencies, the courts, or Congress may make determinations that affect PHMSA’s regulations or their applicability to the Company’s pipelines. These determinations may affect the costs the Company incurs in complying with applicable safety regulations.
Water Discharges.  The Federal Water Pollution Control Act, as amended, or “Clean Water Act,” and analogous state laws impose restrictions and strict controls on the discharge of pollutants, including produced waters and other oil and natural gas wastes, into state waters as well as waters of the United States. The discharge of pollutants into regulated waters is prohibited, except in accordance with the terms of a permit issued by U.S. EPA or the relevant state with delegated authority. The Clean Water Act also prohibits the discharge of dredge and fill material in regulated waters, including wetlands, unless authorized by an appropriately issued permit. Spill prevention, control and countermeasure, or “SPCC,” requirements of federal laws require appropriate containment berms and similar structures to help prevent the contamination of navigable waters by an oil spill or release. If an oil spill or release were to occur as a result of our operations, we expect that it would be contained and remediated in accordance with our SPCC plan together with the assistance of trained first responders and any oil spill response contractor that we may have engaged to address such spills and releases. The Clean Water Act and analogous state laws can impose substantial administrative, civil and criminal penalties for non-compliance including spills and other non-authorized discharges.
Fluids associated with oil and natural gas production, consisting primarily of salt water, are disposed by injection in below ground disposal wells. These disposal wells are regulated pursuant to the Underground Injection Control, or UIC, program established under the federal Safe Drinking Water Act, or SDWA, and analogous state laws. The UIC program requires permits from U.S. EPA or an analogous state agency for the construction and operation of disposal wells, establishes minimum standards for disposal well operations, and restricts the types and quantities of fluids that may be disposed. While we believe that our disposal well operations substantially comply with requirements under the UIC program, a change in disposal well regulations or the inability to obtain permits for new disposal wells in the future may affect our ability to dispose of salt water and ultimately increase the cost of our operations. For example, there exists a growing concern that the injection of saltwater and other fluids into below ground disposal wells triggers seismic activity in certain areas, including Texas, where we operate. In response to these concerns, in October 2014, the Texas Railroad Commission, or TRC, published a final rule governing permitting or re-permitting of disposal wells that would require, among other things, the submission of information on seismic events occurring within a specified radius of the disposal well location, as well as logs, geologic cross sections and structure maps relating to the disposal area in question. If the permittee or an applicant of a disposal well permit fails to demonstrate that the injected fluids are confined to the disposal zone or if scientific data indicates such a disposal well is likely to be or determined to be contributing to seismic activity, then the TRC may deny, modify, suspend or terminate the permit application or existing operating permit for that well. These new seismic permitting requirements applicable to disposal wells impose more stringent permitting requirements and likely to result in added costs to comply or, perhaps, may require alternative methods of disposing of salt water and other fluids, which could delay production schedules and also result in increased costs.
The Oil Pollution Act of 1990, as amended, or “OPA,” amends the Clean Water Act and sets minimum standards for prevention, containment and cleanup of oil spills. OPA applies to vessels, offshore facilities, and onshore facilities, including 
23

exploration and production facilities that are the site of a release of oil into waters of the United States. Under OPA, responsible parties, including owners and operators of onshore facilities, may be held strictly liable for oil cleanup costs and natural resource damages as well as a variety of public and private damages that may result from oil spills. We believe we are in substantial compliance with the Clean Water Act, OPA and analogous state laws.
Hydraulic Fracturing.  Hydraulic fracturing is an important and common practice that is used to stimulate production of natural gas and/or oil from dense subsurface rock formations. The hydraulic fracturing process involves the injection of water, sand, and chemicals under pressure into targeted subsurface formations to fracture the surrounding rock and stimulate production. We commonly use hydraulic fracturing as part of our operations. 
While hydraulic fracturing is typically regulated by state oil and natural gas commissions, and other similar state agencies, increased federal interest has arisen in recent years. From time to time Congress has considered adopting legislation to provide for federal regulation of hydraulic fracturing and to require disclosure of the chemicals used in the hydraulic fracturing process. Federal agencies have asserted regulatory authority over certain aspects of the process. For example, U.S. EPA has taken several steps to federalize regulation of hydraulic fracturing. It issued Clean Air Act rules governing performance standards, including standards for the capture of air emissions released during hydraulic fracturing, the effective date of which has recently been delayed. In June 2016, U.S. EPA issued final rules establishing effluent limit guidelines that wastewater from shale gas extraction operations must meet before discharging to a treatment plant. U.S. EPA also considered a rule under its Toxic Substances Control Act authority requiring reporting of the chemical substances and mixtures used in hydraulic fracturing, though U.S. EPA has not followed through on its initial consideration of such a rule. As a final example of federalization of regulation of hydraulic fracturing, on March 26, 2015, BLM issued a rule requiring chemical disclosure and other mandates for hydraulic fracturing on federal lands, which BLM has since proposed rescinding.
Some states in which the Company operates, including Montana, Texas and Wyoming, have adopted, and other states are considering adopting, legal requirements that could impose more stringent permitting, public disclosure, or well construction requirements on hydraulic fracturing activities. States could elect to prohibit hydraulic fracturing altogether, as the State of New York announced in December 2014 with regard to fracturing activities in New York. Also, local government may seek to adopt ordinances within their jurisdictions regulating the time, place and manner of drilling activities in general or hydraulic fracturing activities in particular. We believe that we follow applicable standard industry practices and legal requirements for groundwater protection in our hydraulic fracturing activities. Nonetheless, if new or more stringent federal, state, or local legal restrictions relating to the hydraulic fracturing process are adopted in areas where we operate, we could incur potentially significant added costs to comply with such requirements, experience delays or curtailment in the pursuit of exploration, development, or production activities, and perhaps even be precluded from drilling wells.

To our knowledge, there have been no citations, suits, or contamination of potable drinking water arising from our fracturing operations. We do not have insurance policies in effect that are intended to provide coverage for losses solely related to hydraulic fracturing operations; however, we believe our general liability and excess liability and control of well insurance policies would cover third-party claims related to hydraulic fracturing operations and associated legal expenses in accordance with, and subject to, the terms of such policies.
Air Emissions.   The Clean Air Act, as amended, and comparable state laws restrict the emission of air pollutants from sources through air emissions permitting programs and also impose various monitoring and reporting requirements. These laws and their implementing regulations may require us to obtain pre-approval for the construction or modification of certain projects or facilities expected to result in the emission of new or increased existing air pollutants, obtain and strictly comply with air permit requirements containing various emissions and operational limitations, or utilize specific equipment or technologies to control emissions of certain pollutants. The need to obtain permits has the potential to delay the development of oil and natural gas projects. To date, we believe that no significant difficulties have been encountered in obtaining air permits. Oil and natural gas exploration and production facilities may be required to incur certain capital expenditures in the future for air control equipment in connection with obtaining and maintaining operating permits and approvals for emissions of pollutants. For example, in October 2015, U.S. EPA issued a final rule that strengthened the National Ambient Air Quality Standard, or “NAAQS,” for ozone from 75 parts per billion, or “ppb,” to 70 ppb for both the 8-hour primary and secondary standards. On November 7, 2017, U.S. EPA began releasing its revision of attainment and non-attainment air quality control regions based on the new ozone standard. If regions reclassified as non-attainment under the lower ozone standard begin implementing new, more stringent regulations, those regulations could apply to our or our customers’ operations. Compliance with this or other new regulations could, among other things, require installation of new emission controls on some of our equipment, result in longer permitting timelines, and significantly increase our capital expenditures and operating costs, which could adversely impact our business.
24

Activities on Federal Lands.  Oil and natural gas exploitation and production activities on federal lands are subject to the National Environmental Policy Act, as amended, or “NEPA.” NEPA requires federal agencies, including the Department of Interior, to evaluate major agency actions having the potential to significantly impact the environment. In the course of such evaluations, an agency will typically prepare an Environmental Assessment to assess the potential direct, indirect and cumulative impacts of a proposed project and, if necessary, will prepare a more detailed Environmental Impact Statement that may be made available for public review and comment. Our current production activities, as well as proposed development plans, on federal lands require governmental permits or similar authorizations that are subject to the requirements of NEPA. This process has the potential to delay, limit or increase the cost of developing oil and natural gas projects. Authorizations under NEPA are also subject to protest, appeal or litigation, any or all of which may delay or halt projects.
Climate Change.  In response to findings made by U.S. EPA that emissions of carbon dioxide, methane, and other greenhouse gases, or “GHGs,” present an endangerment to public health and the environment because emissions of such gasses are contributing to the warming of the earth’s atmosphere and other climatic changes, U.S. EPA has adopted regulations under existing provisions of the Clean Air Act that establish Title V operation and Prevention of Significant Deterioration, or “PSD,” construction permitting reviews for GHG emissions from certain large stationary sources that already are potential major sources of certain principal, or criteria, pollutant emissions. Facilities required to obtain PSD permits for their GHG emissions also will be required to meet “best available control technology” standards, which typically will be established by the states. These U.S. EPA rulemakings could adversely affect our operations and restrict or delay our ability to obtain air permits for new or modified facilities. In addition, U.S. EPA has adopted rules requiring the monitoring and reporting of GHG emissions from certain sources including, among others, onshore and offshore oil and natural gas production facilities in the United States on an annual basis, which include certain of our operations. We are conducting monitoring of GHG emissions from our operations in accordance with the GHG emissions reporting rule and we believe that our monitoring and reporting activities are in substantial compliance with applicable reporting obligations.
While from time to time Congress has considered legislation to reduce emissions of GHGs, there has not been significant activity in the form of adopted legislation to reduce GHG emissions at the federal level in recent years. In the absence of such federal climate legislation, a number of state and regional efforts have emerged that are aimed at tracking and/or reducing GHG emissions by means of cap and trade programs that typically require major sources of GHG emissions to acquire and surrender emission allowances in return for emitting those GHGs. The adoption of any legislation or regulations that requires reporting of GHGs or otherwise restricts emissions of GHGs from our equipment and operations could require us to incur costs to reduce emissions of GHGs associated with our operations or could adversely affect demand for the oil and natural gas that we produce. For example, on June 3, 2016, U.S. EPA published a Methane Rule aimed at reducing methane emissions from the oil and gas sector by up to 45 percent from 2012 levels by 2025. The Methane Rule requires oil and gas companies to find and repair leaks, capture gas from completion of fracked wells, limit emissions from new and modified pneumatic pumps, limit emissions from several types of equipment used at gas transmission compressor stations, including compressors and pneumatic controllers, and requires “green completions” to capture natural gas from most new fractured wells. On June 16, 2017, U.S. EPA proposed to delay the Methane Rule’s effectiveness for two years from the final rule’s publication. 
Finally, it should be noted that some scientists have concluded that increasing concentrations of GHGs in the earth’s atmosphere may produce climate changes that have significant physical effects, such as increased frequency and severity of storms, floods and other climatic events; if any such effects were to occur, they could have an adverse effect on our operations. 
Endangered Species Act Considerations.  Various federal and state statutes prohibit certain actions that adversely affect endangered and their habitats, migratory birds, wetlands and natural resources. These statutes include the Endangered Species Act (“ESA”), the Migratory Bird Treaty Act, and the Clean Water Act. Moreover, as a result of a settlement approved by the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia in September 2011, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, or “FWS,” is required to make a determination on listing of numerous species as endangered or threatened under the ESA through the agency’s 2018 fiscal year.  
If endangered species are located in areas of the underlying properties where we wish to conduct seismic surveys, development activities or abandonment operations, such work could be prohibited or delayed or expensive mitigation may be required. If we were to cause harm to species or damages to wetlands, habitat or natural resources as a result of our operations, government entities or, at times, private parties could seek to prevent oil and gas exploration or development activities or seek damages for harm to species, habitat or natural resources resulting from drilling or construction or releases of oil, wastes, hazardous substances or other regulated materials, and, in some cases, the government could seek criminal penalties. The designation of previously unprotected species as threatened or endangered in areas where underlying property operations are conducted could cause us to incur increased costs arising from species protection measures or could result in limitations on our exploration and production activities that could have an adverse impact on our ability to develop and produce reserves. 
25

While some of our facilities or leased acreage may be located in areas that are designated as habitat for endangered or threatened species, we believe our operations are in substantial compliance with the ESA. For example, on March 27, 2014, the FWS announced the listing of the lesser prairie chicken, whose habitat is over a five-state region, including Texas, New Mexico, Colorado and Oklahoma, where we conduct operations, as a threatened species under the ESA. The FWS also announced a final rule that will limit regulatory impacts on landowners and businesses from the listing if those landowners and businesses have entered into certain range-wide conservation planning agreements, such as those developed by the Western Association of Fish and Wildlife Agencies, or WAFWA, pursuant to which such parties agreed to take steps to protect the lesser prairie chicken’s habitat and to pay a mitigation fee if its actions harm the lesser prairie chicken’s habitat. We have been a party to a Conservation Easement governing nearly 50,000 of affected acreage pursuant to which we agree to adopt certain adaptive management principles and pay an acreage-based mitigation assessment. Calendar year 2017 is the final year during which we expect to pay such assessment.
Occupational Safety and Health.  We are subject to the requirements of the federal Occupational Safety and Health Act, as amended, or “OSHA,” and comparable state statutes, whose purpose is to protect the health and safety of workers. In addition, the OSHA hazard communication standard, U.S. EPA community right-to-know regulations under the Title III of CERCLA and similar state statutes require that we maintain and/or disclose information about hazardous materials used or produced in our operations and that this information be provided to employees, state and local governmental authorities and citizens. We believe that we are in substantial compliance with all applicable laws and regulations relating to worker health and safety.

Other Regulation of the Oil and Natural Gas Industry
The oil and natural gas industry is extensively regulated by numerous federal, state and local authorities. Legislation affecting the oil and natural gas industry is under constant review for amendment or expansion, frequently increasing the regulatory burden. Also, numerous departments and agencies, both federal and state, are authorized by statute to issue rules, orders and regulations binding on the oil and natural gas industry and its individual members, some of which carry substantial penalties for failure to comply. For example, on July 1, 2014, the North Dakota Industrial Commission adopted Order No. 24665, or the “July 2014 Order,” pursuant to which the agency adopted legally enforceable “gas capture percentage goals” targeting the capture of 74% of natural gas produced in the State by October 1, 2014, 77% percent of such gas by January 1, 2015, 85% of such gas by January 1, 2016 and 90% of such gas by October 1, 2020. The July 2014 Order establishes an enforcement mechanism for policy recommendations that were previously adopted by the North Dakota Industrial Commission in March 2014. Those recommendations required all exploration and production operators applying for new drilling permits in the state after June 1, 2014 to develop Gas Capture Plans that provide measures for reducing the amount of natural gas flared by those operators so as to be consistent with the agency’s now-implemented gas capture percentage goals. In particular, the July 2014 Order provides that after an initial 90-day period, wells must meet or exceed the North Dakota Industrial Commission’s gas capture percentage goals on a per-well, per-field, county, or statewide basis. Failure to comply with the gas capture percentage goals will result in an operator having to restrict its production to 200 barrels of oil per day if at least 60% of the monthly volume of associated natural gas produced from the well is captured, or 100 barrels of oil per day if less than 60% of such monthly volume of natural gas is captured. While we believe that we were in compliance with these requirements as of December 31, 2017 and expect to remain in compliance in the future, there is no assurance that we will be able to remain in compliance in the future or that such future compliance will not have a material adverse effect on our business and operational results. Although the regulatory burden on the oil and natural gas industry increases our cost of doing business and, consequently, affects our profitability, these burdens generally do not affect us any differently or to any greater or lesser extent than they affect other companies in the industry with similar types, quantities and locations of production.

Drilling and Production.   Our operations are subject to various types of regulation at the federal, state and local levels. These types of regulation include requiring permits for the drilling of wells, drilling bonds and reports concerning operations. Most states, and some counties and municipalities, in which we operate also regulate one or more of the following:


• | the location of wells;


• | the method of drilling and casing wells;


• | the surface use and restoration of properties upon which wells are drilled;


• | the plugging and abandoning of wells; and


• | notice to surface owners and other third parties.

26

State laws regulate the size and shape of drilling and spacing units or proration units governing the pooling of oil and natural gas properties. Some states allow forced pooling or integration of tracts to facilitate exploitation while other states rely on voluntary pooling of lands and leases. In some instances, forced pooling or unitization may be implemented by third parties and may reduce our interest in the unitized properties. In addition, state conservation laws establish maximum rates of production from oil and natural gas wells, generally prohibit the venting or flaring of natural gas and impose requirements regarding the ratability of production. These laws and regulations may limit the amount of oil, natural gas and NGLs we can produce from our wells or limit the number of wells or the locations at which we can drill. Moreover, each state generally imposes a production or severance tax with respect to the production and sale of oil, natural gas and NGLs within its jurisdiction.

Regulation of Transportation and Sales.   The availability, terms and cost of transportation significantly affect sales of oil, natural gas and NGLs. The interstate transportation of natural gas is subject to federal regulation primarily by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, or “FERC,” under the Natural Gas Act of 1938, or “NGA.”  FERC regulates interstate natural gas pipeline transportation rates and service conditions, which may affect the marketing and sales of natural gas.  FERC requires interstate pipelines to offer available firm transportation capacity on an open-access, non-discriminatory basis to all natural gas shippers.  FERC frequently reviews and modifies its regulations regarding the transportation of natural gas with the stated goal of fostering competition within all phases of the natural gas industry.  State laws and regulations generally govern the gathering and intrastate transportation of natural gas. Natural gas gathering systems in the states in which we operate are generally required to offer services on a non-discriminatory basis and are subject to state ratable take and common purchaser statutes.  Ratable take statutes generally require gatherers to take, without undue discrimination, natural gas production that may be tendered to the gatherer for handling.  Similarly, common purchaser statutes generally require gatherers to purchase without discrimination in favor of one producer over another producer or one source of supply over another source of supply.
The ability to transport oil and NGLs is generally dependent on pipelines whose rates, terms and conditions of service are subject to FERC jurisdiction under the Interstate Commerce Act, or subject to regulation by the particular state in which such transportation takes place.  Laws and regulation applicable to pipeline transportation of oil largely require pipelines to charge just and reasonable rates published in agency-approved tariffs and require pipelines to provide non-discriminatory access and terms and conditions of service. The justness and reasonableness of interstate oil and natural gas liquid pipeline rates can be challenged at FERC through a protest or a complaint and, if such a protest or complaint results in a lower rate than that on file, pipeline shippers may be eligible to receive refunds or, in the case of a complaining shipper, reparations for the two-year period prior to the filing of the complaint. Certain regulations imposed by FERC, by the United States Department of Transportation and by other regulatory authorities on pipeline transporters in recent years could result in an increase in the cost of pipeline transportation service.  We do not believe, however, that these regulations affect us any differently than other producers.
Under the Energy Policy Act of 2005, or “EPAct 2005,” Congress made it unlawful for any entity, as defined in the EPAct 2005, including otherwise non-jurisdictional producers such as us, to use any deceptive or manipulative device or contrivance in connection with the purchase or sale of natural gas or the purchase or sale of transportation services regulated by the FERC that violates the FERC’s rules. FERC’s rules implementing EPAct 2005 make it unlawful for any entity, directly or indirectly, to use or employ any device, scheme or artifice to defraud; to make any untrue statement of material fact or omit to make any such statement necessary to make the statements made not misleading; or to engage in any act or practice that operates as a fraud or deceit upon any person in connection with the purchase or sale of natural gas subject to the jurisdiction of the FERC, or the purchase or sale of transportation services subject to the jurisdiction of the FERC. EPAct 2005 also gives the FERC authority to impose civil penalties for violations of the NGA and the Natural Gas Policy Act up to $1,000,000 per day per violation. Pursuant to authority granted to FERC by EPAct 2005, FERC has also put in place additional regulations intended to prevent market manipulation and to promote price transparency.  For example, FERC has imposed new rules discussed below requiring wholesale purchasers and sellers of natural gas to report to FERC certain aggregated volume and other purchase and sales data for the previous calendar year. While EPAct 2005 reflects a significant expansion of the FERC’s enforcement authority, we do not anticipate that we will be affected by EPAct 2005 any differently than energy industry participants.
In 2007, FERC issued a final rule on the annual natural gas transaction reporting requirements, as amended by subsequent orders on rehearing (“Order 704”). Under Order 704, wholesale buyers and sellers of more than 2.2 million MMBtu of physical natural gas in the previous calendar year, including interstate and intrastate natural gas pipelines, natural gas gatherers, natural gas processors and natural gas marketers are now required to report on Form No. 552, on May 1 of each year, aggregate volumes of natural gas purchased or sold at wholesale in the prior calendar year to the extent such transactions utilize, contribute to, or may contribute to the formation of price indices. It is the responsibility of the reporting entity to determine which individual transactions should be reported based on the guidance of Order 704. Pursuant to Order 704, we may be required to annually report to FERC, starting May 1 of each year, information regarding natural gas purchase and sale transactions depending on the volume of natural gas transacted during the prior calendar year. In recent years, FERC has also issued rules prohibiting anticompetitive behavior by multiple affiliates of the same entity in the natural gas capacity release 
27

market, issued a policy statement providing natural gas pipelines a cost-recovery mechanism to recoup capital expenditures made to modernize pipeline infrastructure, and issued a rule adopting reforms to its scheduling rules to improve coordination between the natural gas and electric markets.
On August 6, 2009, the Federal Trade Commission, or “FTC,” issued a Final Rule prohibiting manipulative and deceptive conduct in the wholesale petroleum markets. The Final Rule applies to transactions in crude oil, gasoline, and petroleum distillates. The FTC promulgated the Final Rule pursuant to Section 811 of the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007, or “EISA,” which makes it unlawful for anyone, in connection with the wholesale purchase or sale of crude oil, gasoline or petroleum distillates, to use any “manipulative or deceptive device or contrivance, in contravention of such rules and regulations as the Federal Trade Commission may prescribe.” The Final Rule prohibits any person, directly or indirectly, in connection with the purchase or sale of crude oil, gasoline or petroleum distillates at wholesale, from: (a) knowingly engaging in any act, practice, or course of business – including making any untrue statement of material fact that operates or would operate as a fraud or deceit upon any person; or (b) intentionally failing to state a material fact that under the circumstances renders a statement made by such person misleading, provided that such omission distorts or is likely to distort market conditions for any such product.
Additional proposals and proceedings that might affect the natural gas industry are pending before Congress, FERC and the courts. We cannot predict the ultimate impact of these or the above regulatory changes to our natural gas operations. We do not believe that we would be affected by any such FERC action materially differently than other natural gas companies with whom we compete.
The price at which we buy and sell natural gas is currently not subject to federal rate regulation and, for the most part, is not subject to state regulation. Sales of condensate and NGLs are not currently regulated and are made at market prices. However, with regard to our physical purchases and sales of these energy commodities, and any related hedging activities that we undertake, we are required to observe anti-market manipulation laws and related regulations enforced by FERC and/or the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, or “CFTC.” Should we violate the anti-market manipulation laws and regulations, we could also be subject to related third-party damage claims by, among others, market participants, sellers, royalty owners and taxing authorities. 
Although natural gas and oil prices are currently unregulated, Congress historically has been active in the area of natural gas regulation. We cannot predict whether new legislation to regulate natural gas might be proposed, what proposals, if any, might actually be enacted by Congress or the various state legislatures, and what effect, if any, the proposals might have on the operations of the underlying properties.
State Regulation.  The various states regulate the drilling for, and the production, gathering and sale of, oil, natural gas and NGLs, including imposing severance and other production-related taxes and requirements for obtaining drilling permits. Reduced rates or credits may apply to certain types of wells and production methods. 
States also regulate the method of developing new fields, the spacing and operation of wells and the prevention of waste of natural gas resources. States may regulate rates of production and may establish maximum daily production allowables from oil and natural gas wells based on market demand or resource conservation, or both. States do not currently regulate wellhead prices or engage in other similar direct economic regulation, but there can be no assurance that they will not do so in the future. The effect of these regulations may be to limit the amounts of oil, natural gas and NGLs that may be produced from our wells, to increase our cost of production, to limit the number of wells or locations we can drill and to limit the availability of pipeline capacity to bring our products to market.
In addition to production taxes, Texas, Oklahoma and Montana each impose ad valorem taxes on oil and natural gas properties and production equipment. Wyoming, Colorado and New Mexico impose an ad valorem tax on the gross value of oil and natural gas production in lieu of an ad valorem tax on the underlying oil and natural gas properties. Wyoming also imposes an ad valorem tax on production equipment.
The petroleum industry participants are also subject to compliance with various other federal, state and local regulations and laws. Some of these regulations and those laws relate to occupational safety, resource conservation and equal employment opportunity. We do not believe that compliance with these regulations and laws will have a material adverse effect upon the unitholders.
Federal, State or Native American Leases.  Our operations on federal, state, or Native American oil and natural gas leases are subject to numerous restrictions, including nondiscrimination statutes. Such operations must be conducted pursuant to certain on-site security regulations and other permits and authorizations issued by the BLM and other agencies. 
28

Operating Hazards and Insurance
The oil and natural gas business involves a variety of operating risks, including fires, explosions, blowouts, environmental hazards and other potential events that can adversely affect our ability to conduct operations and cause us to incur substantial losses. Such losses could reduce or eliminate the funds available for exploration, exploitation or leasehold acquisitions or result in loss of properties.
In accordance with industry practice, we maintain insurance against some, but not all, potential risks and losses. VNR carries business interruption insurance for the Big Escambia Creek, Flomaton, Fairway James, Elk Basin and XTO Cotton Valley processing facilities. VNR also carries contingent business interruption coverage to protect against upstream shut-ins of our Pinedale, Piceance, Permian, Haynesville, and Wind River productions. We insure any cumulative value of owned property over a certain threshold, and carry control of well and pollution coverage for all VNR wells (including new drills and workovers), and re-drill coverage for those that are economically viable. We may not obtain insurance for certain risks if we believe the cost of available insurance is excessive relative to the risks presented. In addition, pollution and environmental risks generally are not fully insurable at a reasonable cost.  If a significant accident or other event occurs that is not fully covered by insurance, it could adversely affect us.
Employees
As of March 16, 2018, we had 348 full-time employees. We also contract for the services of independent consultants involved in land, regulatory, tax, accounting, financial and other disciplines as needed. None of our employees are represented by labor unions or covered by collective bargaining agreements. We believe that our relations with our employees are satisfactory.
