ITEM 1  BUSINESS 
General 
 CU Bancorp, headquartered in Downtown Los Angeles, California, is a bank holding company registered under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended, and is also a bank holding company within the meaning of Section 1280 of the California Financial Code. Our principal business is to serve as the holding company for our bank subsidiary, California United Bank, which we refer to as CUB or the Bank. When we say we, our or the Company, we mean the Company on a consolidated basis with the Bank. When we refer to CU Bancorp or the holding company, we are referring to the parent company on a stand-alone basis. The shares of CU Bancorp are listed on the NASDAQ Capital Market under the trading symbol CUNB. 
 CU Bancorp was incorporated as a California corporation on November 16, 2011, and became the holding company for California United Bank on July 31, 2012 by acquiring all the voting stock of California United Bank. The creation of the bank holding company for the Bank was approved by the shareholders of the Bank on July 23, 2012. 
 California United Bank was incorporated on September 30, 2004, under the laws of the State of California and commenced operations on May 23, 2005. The Bank is authorized to engage in the general commercial banking business and its deposits are insured by the FDIC up to the applicable limits of the law. CUB is a California state-chartered banking corporation and is not a member of the Federal Reserve System. 
 At year-end 2016, the Company had consolidated total assets of $3.0 billion, total loan balances of $2.0 billion, and total deposits of $2.6 billion. Additional information regarding our business, as well as regarding our acquisitions, is included in the information set forth in Item 7, Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A) and Note 2, Business Combinations, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, and is incorporated herein by reference.

The Company makes these reports available on its website on the same day they appear on the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) website. 
 Banking Business 
 CU Bancorps principal business is to serve as the holding company for the Bank and for any other banking or banking related subsidiaries which the Company may establish in the future. We have not engaged in any other material activities to date. 
 The Bank is a full-service commercial bank offering a broad range of banking products and services designed for small and medium-sized businesses, non-profit organizations, business owners and entrepreneurs, and the professional community, including attorneys, certified public accountants, financial advisors and healthcare providers and investors.

Recent Developments 
 On September 23, 2016, the Bank entered into a Stipulation to the Issuance of a Consent Order with its bank regulatory agencies, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and the California Department of Business Oversight (CDBO), consenting to the issuance of a consent order (the Consent Order) relating to weaknesses in the Banks Bank Secrecy Act and Anti-Money Laundering (collectively BSA) compliance program. In consenting to the issuance of the Consent Order, the Bank did not admit or deny any charges of unsafe or unsound banking practices related to the BSA compliance program. 
 Under the terms of the Consent Order the Bank and/or its Board of Directors is required to take certain actions which include, but are not limited to: 
 

 | Increasing Board supervision of the BSA compliance program;
--+------------------------------------------------------------


 | Notification to the regulatory agencies prior to appointment of a new BSA Officer or the executive to whom the BSA Officer reports;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Formulation of a written action plan describing the actions to be taken to correct BSA/AML related deficiencies, a revised, written BSA/AML compliance program and review and enhancement of the Banks BSA risk assessment;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Performance of a review of BSA staffing needs;
--+-----------------------------------------------


 | Enhancement of internal controls to ensure full compliance with the BSA;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Establishment of an independent testing program for compliance with the BSA rules and regulations; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Obtaining regulatory agency consent for expansionary activities such as new branches, offices, delivery channels, products and services.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The Consent Order resulted in additional BSA compliance expenses for the Bank and the Company (See Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  Non-Interest Expense). It may also have the effect of limiting or delaying the Banks and the Companys ability to obtain regulatory approval for certain expansionary activities, should the Company wish to undertake these activities. The Consent Order does not otherwise impact the Banks business activities outside of BSA and does not require the Bank to pay any civil money penalty or require additional capital. 
 The Consent Order will remain in effect and be enforceable until it is modified, terminated, suspended or set aside by the FDIC and the CBDO. Management and the Board have expressed their full intention to comply with all parts of the Consent Order at the earliest possible date. 
 In July 2016, Robert Sjogren joined the Bank and Company as an Executive Vice President and its Chief Risk Officer, a newly created executive management position. As Chief Risk Officer, Mr. Sjogren is responsible for overseeing the Companys risk management function and regulatory compliance, including relationships with key regulators. Mr. Sjogren was previously the Chief Operating Officer of Pacific Mercantile Bancorp and was its General Counsel prior to that. 
 Strategy 
 Our strategic objective is to be the premier community-based commercial bank in Southern California, with emphasis on the Greater Los Angeles/Orange/Ventura/San Bernardino and Riverside metropolitan and suburban business areas. The Banks value proposition is to provide a premier business banking experience through relationship banking, depth of expertise, resources and products. Our objective is to serve most segments of the business community and industries within our market area. We compete actively for deposits, and emphasize solicitation of core deposits, particularly noninterest-bearing deposits. In managing the top line of our business, we focus on making quality loans and gathering low-cost deposits to maximize our net interest margin and to support growth of a strong and stable loan portfolio. 
 
6 
 
We maintain a strong community bank philosophy of focusing on and understanding the individualized banking needs of the businesses, professionals, entrepreneurs and other of our core constituents. We believe this focus allows us to be more responsive to our customers needs and provide a high level of personal service, which differentiates us from larger competitors. We combine this with experienced, in-market relationship banking officers who provide the full suite of available products to customers. These individuals and the Companys marketing outreach are supplemented by the various Advisory Director Boards which are established in strategic regions of our market and which provide us with knowledge of the business environment in individual communities and access to local business leaders. We have also established a Director Emeritus Board to retain the expertise and marked acumen of former members of our Board of Directors and the Boards of Premier Commercial Bank and 1st Enterprise. We are also active in charities and non-profit organizations in our market, with a philosophy which emphasizes outstanding corporate citizenship. 
 We generate our revenue primarily from the interest received on the various loan products and investment securities and fees from providing deposit services and making loans. In sales of the guaranteed portion of SBA loans, we typically receive gains on sale which is also non-interest income. The Bank relies on a foundation of locally generated and relationship-based deposits to fund loans. Our Bank has a relatively low cost of funds compared to its peers due to a high percentage of noninterest-bearing and low cost deposits to total deposits. Other than as discussed herein with regard to ICS deposits, we do not currently utilize brokered deposits. Our operations, similar to other financial institutions with operations predominately focused in Southern California, are significantly influenced by economic conditions in Southern California, including the strength of the commercial real estate market, the fiscal and regulatory policies of the federal and state governments and the regulatory authorities that govern financial institutions. See Supervision and Regulation below. 
 We expect to continue to grow our business by building on our business strategy and increasing market share in our key Southern California markets. We believe the demographics and growth characteristics within the communities we serve provide us with significant long-term opportunities for internal or organic growth as well as significant franchise enhancement opportunities to leverage our core competencies when appropriate and achievable. 
 Products Offered
The Bank offers a full array of competitively priced commercial and personal loan and deposit products, as well as other services delivered directly or through strategic alliances with other service providers. The products offered are aimed at both business and individual customers in our target market. 
Loan Products 
 We offer a diversified mix of business loans encompassing the following loan products: (i) commercial real estate loans; (ii) commercial and industrial loans; (iii) construction loans; and (iv) SBA loans. We also offer home equity lines of credit HELOCS to accommodate the needs of business owners and individual clients, as well as personal loans (both secured and unsecured) for that customer segment, and business credit cards to assist businesses with their short term working capital needs. We encourage relationship banking, and often obtain a substantial portion of each borrowers banking business, including deposit accounts. Other than as set forth below, the Bank does not currently engage in consumer mortgage lending. 
 Commercial and Multi-Family Real Estate Loans. We originate and underwrite commercial property and multi-family loans principally within our service area. Typically, these loans are held in our loan portfolio and collateralized by the underlying property. The property financed must be supported by current independent third party appraisals at the date of origination (which are reviewed by other independent third parties) and other relevant information. 
 
7 
 
Commercial and Industrial Loans. These loans comprise a significant portion of our loan portfolio and are made to businesses located in the Southern California region and surrounding communities. These loans are directly underwritten by us. These loans are made to finance operations, to provide working capital, or for specific purposes such as to finance the purchase of assets, equipment or inventory. Our commercial and industrial loans may be secured (other than by real estate) or unsecured. They may take the form of single payment, installment, equipment financing loans (secured by the underlying equipment) or lines of credit. These are generally based on the financial strength and integrity of the borrower and guarantor(s) and generally (with some exceptions) are collateralized by short term assets such as accounts receivable, inventory, equipment, real estate or a borrowers other business assets. Commercial term loans are typically made to finance the acquisition of fixed assets, refinance short-term debt originally used to purchase fixed assets, or, in rare cases, to finance the purchase of businesses. 
 Construction, Miniperm Loans, Land Development and Other Land Loans. We originate and underwrite interim land and construction loans as well as miniperm loans, collateralized by first or junior deeds of trust on specific commercial properties which are principally in our primary market areas. Land loans are primarily for entitlements and infrastructure. We originate construction, renovation and conversion loans to businesses on commercial, residential and income producing properties. Our construction loans are generally limited to experienced developers who are known to our management. We impose a limit on the loan to value ratio on all real estate lending. The project financed must be supported by current independent third party appraisals (which are reviewed by other independent third parties), environmental reviews where appropriate and other relevant information. We review each loan request and renewal individually. 
 SBA Loans. SBA loans are made through programs designed by the federal government to assist the small business community in obtaining financing from financial institutions that are given government guarantees as an incentive to make the loans. The Bank has been designated as an SBA Preferred Lender. Our SBA loans fall into three categories, loans originated under the SBAs 7a Program (7a Loans), loans originated under the SBAs 504 Program (504 Loans) and SBA Express Loans. SBA 7a Loans are commercial business loans generally made for the purpose of purchasing real estate to be occupied by the business owner, providing working capital, and/or purchasing equipment or inventory. SBA 504 Loans are collateralized by commercial real estate and are generally made to business owners for the purpose of purchasing or improving real estate for their use and for equipment used in their business. 
 SBA lending is subject to federal legislation that can affect the availability and funding of the program. From time to time, this dependence on legislative funding causes limitations and uncertainties with regard to the continued funding of such programs, which could potentially have an adverse financial impact on our business. 
 Home Equity Lines of Credit HELOCS. We offer home equity lines of credit HELOCS, which are revolving lines of credit collateralized by senior or junior deeds of trust on residential real properties, the applicants for which are generally our individual clientele and the principals and executives of our business customers. 
 Personal Loans. We offer personal loans. Generally, these are unsecured, but they may be secured by collateral, including deposit accounts or marketable securities. The Bank does not currently originate first trust deed home mortgage loans or home improvement loans. 
 Business Credit Cards. We originate and underwrite business credit cards to assist businesses with meeting short term working capital needs. Our program allows business clients to provide credit cards to their employees to be used exclusively for business use purposes. The Bank does not currently underwrite consumer credit cards but does participate in an Associate Cardholder Program to provide credit cards to consumers.

Deposit Products 
 As a full-service commercial bank, we focus deposit generation on relationship accounts, encompassing non-interest bearing demand, interest bearing demand, and money market. In order to facilitate generation of non-interest bearing demand deposits, we require, depending on the circumstances and the type of relationship, our borrowers to maintain deposit balances with us as a typical condition of granting loans. We also offer certificates of deposit and savings accounts. We service our attorney clients by offering Interest on Lawyers Trust Accounts, IOLTA in accordance with the requirements of the California State Bar. We market deposits by offering the convenience of third party couriers or, in appropriate cases armored vehicles, which contract with our customers, as well as a remote deposit capture product that allows deposits to be made via computer at the customers business location. We also offer customers e-statements that allows customers to receive statements electronically, which is more convenient and secure than receiving paper statements, in addition to reducing paper and being environmentally-friendly. 
 For customers requiring full FDIC insurance on certificates of deposit in excess of $250,000, we offer the ICS program, which is a product offered by Promontory Interfinancial Network, LLC and allows the Bank to accept non-interest bearing deposits in excess of the FDIC maximum from a depositor and place the deposits through the ICS network into other member banks in increments of less than the FDIC insured maximum in order to provide the depositor full FDIC insurance coverage. The Company does not have any CDARS® reciprocal deposits on its consolidated balance sheet because all of these deposits matured in 2016.These reciprocal ICS deposits are classified as brokered deposits in regulatory reports and are currently the only brokered deposits utilized by the Bank; the Bank considers these deposits to be core in nature. 
Investment Products 
 We compete with other larger and multi-state institutions for deposits. We have traditionally offered sophisticated business customers requiring either higher yields or more security investment sweeps into multiple types of money market funds provided by Dreyfus Corporation, a wholly owned subsidiary of Bank of New York Mellon Corporation. All of the funds invest in short-term securities and seek high current income, the preservation of capital and the maintenance of liquidity and each fund favors stability over growth. As a condition to access these products, we require the customer to maintain a certain level of demand deposits. Furthermore, we have also entered into repurchase agreements with sophisticated business customers, many of whom act as fiduciaries and require additional security above FDIC deposit insurance. These are essentially borrowings by the Bank, secured by U.S. Government and Agency securities from its investment portfolio. These are disclosed on the Banks financial statements as Securities Sold under Agreements to Repurchase. We also offer a repo sweep product whereby the deposits of qualifying customers are swept into repurchase agreements on a daily basis. 
 Through a third party arrangement with a registered representative of National Planning Corporation, member FINRA/SIPC we offer customers, upon request, the ability to purchase mutual funds, securities, annuities and limited types of insurance. The Bank considers this an ancillary product to its commercial banking activities. 
 Electronic Banking 
 While personalized, service-oriented banking is the cornerstone of our business plan, we use technology and the Internet as a secondary means for servicing customers, to compete with larger banks and to provide a convenient platform for customers to review and transact business. We offer sophisticated electronic or internet banking opportunities that permit commercial customers to conduct much of their banking business remotely from their business premises. However, our customers will always have the opportunity to personally discuss specific banking needs with knowledgeable bank officers and staff who are directly accessible in the branches and offices as well as by telephone and email. 
 
9 
 
The Bank offers multiple electronic banking options to its customers. It does not allow the origination of deposit accounts through online banking, nor does it accept loan applications through its online services. All of the Banks electronic banking services allow customers to review transactions and statements, review images of paid items, transfer funds between accounts at the Bank, place stop orders, pay bills and export to various business and personal software applications. CUB Online Commercial Banking also allows customers to initiate domestic wire transfers and ACH transactions, with the added security and functionality of assigning discrete access and levels of security to different employees of the client and division of functions to allow separation of duties, such as input and release. 
 Additionally, we offer Payee Positive Pay, an antifraud service that allows businesses to review all issued checks daily and provides them with the ability to pay or reject any item. ACH Positive Pay is also offered to allow customers to review non-matching ACH transactions efficiently on a daily basis. 
 We also offer our internet banking customers an additional third party product designed to assist in mitigating fraud risk to both the customer and the Bank in internet banking and other internet activities conducted by the customer, at no cost to the customer. 
 The Bank has its own home page address on the World Wide Web as an additional means of expanding our market and providing banking services through the Internet. Members of the public can also communicate with us through the website. Our website address is: www.californiaunitedbank.com or www.cunb.com. 
 Other Services 
 In addition to providing a full complement of lending and deposit products and related services, we provide our customers with many additional services, either directly or through other providers, including, but not limited to, commercial and stand-by letters of credit, domestic and international wire transfers, on site Automated Teller Machines (ATMs) and Visa® Debit Cards and ATM cards. We also provide bank-by-mail services, courier services, armored transport, lock box, cash vault, cash management services, telephone banking, night depositories, commercial credit cards and international services (some of these through arrangements with third parties). Our customers may utilize ATMs other than California United Banks ATMs; we reimburse our customers for charges for utilization of other banks ATMs up to a maximum of $20 per month. 
Competition 
 The banking business in California, and in our market area, is highly competitive with respect to both loans and deposits and is dominated by a relatively small number of major financial institutions with many offices operating over a wide geographic area, including institutions based outside of California. The increasingly competitive environment faced by banks is a result primarily of changes in laws and regulations, changes in technology and product delivery systems, and the accelerating pace of consolidation among financial services providers. We also compete for loans and deposits with other commercial banks, as well as with finance companies, credit unions, securities and brokerage companies, money market funds and other non-financial institutions. Larger financial institutions offer certain services (such as trust services or wealth management) that we do not offer directly (but some of which we offer indirectly through correspondent institutions or other relationships). These institutions also have the ability to finance extensive advertising campaigns, and have the ability to allocate investment assets to regions of highest yield and demand. By virtue of their greater total capitalization, such institutions also have substantially higher lending limits1 than we have. Customers may also move deposits into the equity and bond markets which also compete with us as an investment alternative. 

1 | Legal lending limits to each customer are limited to a percentage of a banks shareholders equity, allowance for loan losses, and capital notes and debentures; the exact percentage depends upon the nature of the loan transaction.

Our ability to compete is based primarily on the basis of relationship, customer service and responsiveness to customer needs. Our preferred lender status with the Small Business Administration allows us to approve SBA loans faster than many of our competitors. We distinguish ourselves with the availability and accessibility of our senior management to customers and prospects. In addition, our knowledge of our markets and industries assists us in locating, recruiting and retaining customers. Our ability to compete also depends on our ability to continue to attract and retain our senior management and experienced relationship managers. 
 Employees 
 As of December 31, 2016, we had 291 full-time employees. Our employees are not represented by any union or other collective bargaining agreement.

Supervision and Regulation 
 General 
 CU Bancorp and the Bank are subject to significant regulation and restrictions by federal and state laws and regulatory agencies. This regulation is intended primarily for the protection of depositors and the deposit insurance fund, and secondarily for the stability of the U.S. banking system. It is not intended for the benefit of shareholders of financial institutions. The following discussion of statutes and regulations is a summary and does not purport to be complete nor does it address all applicable statutes and regulations. This discussion is also qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text and to the implementation and enforcement of the statutes and regulations referred to in this discussion. 
 Our profitability, like most financial institutions, is primarily dependent on interest rate differentials (spreads). In general, the difference between the interest rates paid by the Bank on interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits and other borrowings, and the interest rates received by the Bank on interest-earning assets, such as loans extended to customers and securities held in the investment portfolio, will comprise the major portion of our earnings. These rates are highly sensitive to many factors that are beyond our control, such as inflation, recession and unemployment, and the impact which future changes in domestic and foreign economic conditions might have on us cannot be predicted. 
 Our business is also influenced by the monetary and fiscal policies of the federal government and the policies of regulatory agencies, particularly the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the Federal Reserve). The Federal Reserve implements national monetary policies through its open-market operations in U.S. Government securities by adjusting the required level of reserves for depository institutions subject to its reserve requirements, and by varying the target federal funds and discount rates applicable to borrowings by depository institutions. The monetary policies of the Federal Reserve in these areas influence the growth of loans, investments, and deposits and also affect interest earned on interest-earning assets and paid on interest-bearing liabilities. The nature and impact of any future changes in monetary and fiscal policies on us cannot be predicted. 
 Initiatives may be proposed or introduced before Congress, the California Legislature, and other government bodies in the future that may further alter the structure, regulation, and competitive relationship among financial institutions and may subject us to increased supervision and disclosure, compliance costs and reporting requirements. In addition, the various bank regulatory agencies often adopt new rules and regulations and policies to implement and enforce existing legislation. 
 It cannot be predicted whether, or in what form, any such legislation or regulatory changes in policy may be enacted or the extent to which the business of the Bank would be affected thereby. In addition, the outcome of examinations, any litigation, or any investigations initiated by state or federal authorities may result in necessary changes in our operations and increased compliance costs. 
 Legislation and Regulatory Developments 
 Dodd Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act 
 The federal banking agencies continue to implement the remaining requirements in the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act) as well as promulgating other regulations and guidelines intended to assure the financial strength and safety and soundness of banks and the stability of the U.S. banking system. Following on the implementation in 2014 and effectiveness in 2015 of new capital rules (the New Capital Rules) and the so called Volcker Rule restrictions on certain proprietary trading and investment activities, developments in 2016 which may impact the Bank included the implementation of an additional capital conservation buffer of 0.625% in 2016 for minimum risk-weighted asset ratios under the New Capital Rules.  See Capital Adequacy Requirements and Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  Capital Resources. 
 
12 
 
On February 3, 2017, President Donald Trump issued an executive order designed to reduce the perceived regulatory burdens of the Dodd-Frank Act. The executive order proclaims that the policy of President Trumps administration will be to regulate the United States financial system in a manner consistent with a number of principles of regulation. President Trumps order directs the Secretary of the Treasury to consult with the heads of the member agencies of the Financial Stability Oversight Council on the extent to which existing laws, treaties, regulations, guidance, reporting and recordkeeping requirements, and other government policies promote his administrations regulatory principles and to identify what actions have been taken, and are currently being taken, to promote and support these principles.
 In light of President Trumps executive order, the Company cannot predict which provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act will be repealed, put into effect, delayed or enforced under the current Administration and, therefore, cannot predict the effect, if any, that the Dodd-Frank Act will have on the Companys future operations and financial condition.
 Capital Adequacy Requirements 
 Bank holding companies and banks are subject to similar regulatory capital requirements administered by state and federal banking agencies. The basic capital rule changes in the New Capital Rules adopted by the federal bank regulatory agencies were fully effective on January 1, 2015, but many elements are being phased in over multiple future years. The risk-based capital guidelines for bank holding companies and, additionally for banks, prompt corrective action regulations (See Prompt Corrective Action Provisions), require capital ratios that vary based on the perceived degree of risk associated with a banking organizations operations for both transactions reported on the balance sheet as assets, such as loans, and those recorded as off-balance sheet items, such as commitments, letters of credit and recourse agreements. The risk-based capital ratio is determined by classifying assets and certain off-balance sheet financial instruments into weighted categories, with higher levels of capital being required for those categories perceived as representing greater risks and dividing its qualifying capital by its total risk-adjusted assets and off-balance sheet items. Capital amounts and classifications are also subject to qualitative judgments by regulators about components, risk weighting, and other factors. To the extent that the new rules are not fully phased in, the prior capital rules continue to apply. 
 The New Capital Rules revised the previous risk-based and leverage capital requirements for banking organizations to meet requirements of the Dodd-Frank Act and to implement the international Basel Committee on Banking Supervision Basel III agreements. Many of the requirements in the New Capital Rules and other regulations and rules are applicable only to larger or internationally active institutions and not to all banking organizations, including institutions currently with less than $10 billion or assets, which includes the Company and the Bank. 
 Under the risk-based capital guidelines in place prior to the effectiveness of the New Capital Rules, which trace back to the 1988 Basel I accord, there were three fundamental capital ratios: a total risk-based capital ratio, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio and a Tier 1 leverage ratio. To be deemed well capitalized a bank must have a total risk-based capital ratio, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio, a leverage ratio and a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of at least ten percent, eight percent, five percent and six and a half percent, respectively. 
 The following table sets forth the regulatory capital guidelines and the actual capitalization levels for the Company and the Bank as of December 31, 2016: 
 

 | Well-Capitalized | | | Basel IIIMinimum withBuffer | | CU Bancorp | California United Bank | 
 | (greater than or equal to) | | | | | 
Total Risk-Based Capital Ratio | | 10.0 | % | | 8.625 | % | 11.44 | % | 11.04 | %
Tier 1 Risk-Based Capital Ratio | | 8.0 | % | | 6.625 | % | 10.68 | % | 10.28 | %
Leverage Ratio | | 5.0 | % | | NA | | 9.72 | % | 9.35 | %
Common Equity Tier 1 Capital Ratio | | 6.5 | % | | 5.125 | % | 9.61 | % | 10.28 | %

Pursuant to federal regulations, banks must maintain capital levels commensurate with the level of risk to which they are exposed, including the volume and severity of problem loans. Federal regulators may, however, set higher capital requirements when a banks particular circumstances warrant and have required many banks and bank holding companies subject to enforcement actions to maintain capital ratios in excess of the minimum ratios otherwise required to be deemed well capitalized, in which case institutions may no longer be deemed well capitalized and may therefore be subject to restrictions on taking brokered deposits. As of December 31, 2016, both the Banks and the Companys leverage capital ratios exceeded regulatory minimums. 
 The following are the New Capital Rules which became applicable to the Company and the Bank beginning January 1, 2015: 
 

 | an increase in the minimum Tier 1 capital ratio from 4.00% to 6.00% of risk-weighted assets;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | a new category and a required 4.50% of risk-weighted assets ratio is established for common equity Tier 1 as a subset of Tier 1 capital limited to common equity;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 | an additional capital conservation buffer of 2.5% of risk weighted assets above the regulatory minimum capital ratios is being phased in until 2019 beginning at 0.625% of risk-weighted assets for 2016, 1.25% of risk-weighted assets for 2017, and 1.875% of risk-weighted assets for 2018, and must be met to avoid limitations on the ability of the Bank to pay dividends, repurchase shares or pay discretionary bonuses.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Including the capital conservation buffer of 2.5%, the New Capital Rules would result in the following minimum ratios to be considered well capitalized when fully phased in: (i) a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 8.5%, (ii) a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 7.0%, (iii) a total risk-based capital ratio of 10.5%, and (iv) a leverage ratio of 5.0%. At December 31, 2016, the respective capital ratios of the Company and the Bank exceeded the minimum percentage requirements to be deemed well-capitalized for regulatory purposes  See Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  Capital Resources. 
 While the New Capital Rules sets higher regulatory capital standards for the Company and the Bank, bank regulators may also continue their past policies of expecting banks to maintain additional capital beyond the new minimum requirements. The need to maintain more and higher quality capital, and greater liquidity going forward than historically has been required, and generally increased regulatory scrutiny with respect to capital levels, could limit the Companys business activities, including lending, and its ability to expand, either organically or through acquisitions. It could also result in the Company being required to take steps to increase its regulatory capital that may be dilutive to shareholders or limit its ability to pay dividends or otherwise return capital to shareholders, or sell or refrain from acquiring assets, the capital requirements for which are not justified by the assets underlying risks. Moreover, U.S. federal banking agencies have been taking into account expectations regarding the ability of banks to meet these new requirements, including under stressed conditions, in approving actions that represent uses of capital, such as dividend increases, share repurchases and acquisitions. 
 See Managements Discussion and Analysis  Capital Resources.

Management believes that as of December 31, 2016, the Company and the Bank would meet all requirements under the New Capital Rules applicable to them on a fully phased-in basis if such requirements were currently in effect. 
 Under Dodd Frank, trust preferred securities and cumulative perpetual preferred stock are excluded from Tier 1 capital, unless such securities were issued prior to May 19, 2010 by a bank holding company with less than $15 billion in assets. CU Bancorp assumed approximately $12.4 million of junior subordinated debt securities issued to various business trust subsidiaries of Premier Commercial Bancorp and funded through the issuance of approximately $12.0 million of floating rate capital trust preferred securities. These junior subordinated debt securities were issued prior to May 19, 2010. Because CU Bancorp has less than $15 billion in assets, the trust preferred securities that CU Bancorp assumed from Premier Commercial Bancorp will continue to be included in Tier 1 capital, subject to a limit of 25% of Tier 1 capital elements. 
 The 16,400 shares of 1st Enterprise Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series D that were converted into the right to receive 16,400 shares of the Companys Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series A in the merger of 1st Enterprise Bank with and into the Bank will continue to constitute Tier 1 capital, because non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock remained classified as Tier 1 capital following the enactment of Dodd Frank. 
 Other Recent Regulatory Developments 
 In 2016, the federal banking agencies adopted other rules and released various regulatory guidance, including, but not limited to: 
 

(i) | the release by the Interagency Federal Financial Institutions Examinations Council (FFIEC) of a revised Information Security booklet, which is one of the eleven booklets which make up the FFIEC Information Technology Examination Handbook (IT Handbook). The revised Information Security booklet provides guidance to examiners and addresses factors necessary to assess the level of security risks to a financial institutions information systems..
----+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(ii) | the release by the FFIEC of final revisions to the Uniform Interagency Consumer Compliance Rating System to reflect the regulatory, supervisory, technological, and market changes that occurred in the years since the system was established. The revisions are designed to more fully align the rating system with the FFIEC agencies current risk-based, tailored examination approaches.
-----+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(iii) | the effectiveness in October 2016 of a new Protections for Prepaid Account Customers rule promulgated by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) requiring financial institutions to limit consumers losses when funds are stolen or cards are lost, to investigate and resolve errors, and to give customers free and easy access to account information. The CFPB also finalized new Know Before You Owe disclosures for prepaid accounts to give consumers clear, upfront information about fees and other key details. The Bank does not offer prepaid cards.
------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(iv.) | The CFPB and other regulatory agencies have issued final rules changing the reporting requirements for lenders under the HMDA. The new rules expand the range of transactions subject to these requirements to include most securitized residential mortgage loans and credit lines. The rules also increase the overall amount of data required to be collected and submitted, including additional data points about the applicable loans and expanded data about the borrowers. The Bank will be required to begin collecting the expanded data on January 1, 2018.

Securities Registration and Listing 
 CU Bancorps common stock is registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act). As such, CU Bancorp is subject to the information, proxy solicitation, insider trading, corporate governance, and other disclosure requirements and 
 
15 
 
 restrictions of the Exchange Act, as well as the Securities Act of 1933 (the Securities Act), both administered by the SEC. We are required to file annual, quarterly and other current reports with the SEC. The SEC maintains an internet site, http://www.sec.gov, at which all forms accessed electronically may be accessed. Our SEC filings are also available on our website at www.cubancorp.com. 
 Our securities are listed on the NASDAQ Capital Market and trade under the symbol CUNB. As a company listed on the NASDAQ Capital Market, CU Bancorp is subject to NASDAQ standards for listed companies. CU Bancorp is also subject to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act (FDICIA), provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act, and other federal and state laws and regulations which address, among other issues, requirements for executive certification of financial presentations, corporate governance requirements for board, audit and compensation committees and their members, as well as disclosure of controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting, auditing and accounting, executive compensation, and enhanced and timely disclosure of corporate information. NASDAQ has also adopted corporate governance rules, which are intended to allow shareholders and investors to more easily and efficiently monitor the performance of companies and their directors. 
 Corporate Governance and the JOBS Act 
 Pursuant to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, publicly-held companies such as the Company have significant requirements, particularly in the area of external audits, financial reporting and disclosure, conflicts of interest, and corporate governance. The Dodd-Frank Act has added new corporate governance and executive compensation requirements, including mandated resolutions for public company proxy statements such as an advisory vote on executive compensation (more frequently referred to as say-on-pay votes) or executive compensation payable in connection with a merger (more frequently referred to as say-on-golden parachute votes) and new stock exchange listing standards. 
 However, CU Bancorp is an emerging growth company, as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act), as modified by the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 ( the JOBS Act) and as a result, CU Bancorp is not yet subject to all of these regulations. CU Bancorp also will not be subject to certain requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, including the additional level of review of its internal control over financial reporting as may occur when outside auditors attest as to its internal control over financial reporting. The Bank is subject to an additional level of review of its internal controls over financial reporting under FDICIA. 
 Further, an emerging growth company may elect to delay adoption of new or revised accounting pronouncements applicable to public companies until such pronouncements are made applicable to private companies, but must make such election when the company is first required to file a registration statement. Such an election is irrevocable during the period a company is an emerging growth company. At inception, CU Bancorp elected to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period to comply with new or amended accounting pronouncements in the same manner as a private company, although prior to 2013 there were no such accounting pronouncements. During 2013, however, the Company opted-in to compliance with new or amended accounting pronouncements in the same fashion as other public companies. As a result, for the year ended December 31, 2016, the Companys financial statements are comparable to companies which complied with such new or revised accounting standards when originally effective. 
 CU Bancorp may remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of: (i) the last day of the fiscal year in which it has total annual gross revenues of $1.0 billion or more; (ii) the last day of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the date of the first sale of common equity securities pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933, which is fiscal year 2017; (iii) the date on which CU Bancorp has, during the previous three-year period, issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt; or (iv) the date on which CU Bancorp is deemed to be a large accelerated filer under Securities and Exchange Commission regulations (generally, at least $700 million of voting and non-voting equity held by non-affiliates).

Dividends 
 It is the Federal Reserves policy that bank holding companies should generally pay dividends on common stock only out of income available over the past year, and only if prospective earnings retention is consistent with the organizations expected future needs and financial condition. It is also the Federal Reserves policy that bank holding companies should not maintain dividend levels that undermine their ability to be a source of strength to its banking subsidiaries. The Federal Reserve has also discouraged payment ratios that are at maximum allowable levels unless both asset quality and capital are very strong. 
 The terms of our Subordinated Debentures also limit our ability to pay dividends on our common stock. If we are not current in our payment of dividends in our payment of interest on our Subordinated Debentures, we may not pay dividends on our common stock. 
 Quarterly dividends are paid to the U.S. Department of the Treasury pursuant to the terms of the CU Bancorp Preferred Stock. The payment of preferred dividends does not require approval from the Federal Reserve and other regulatory agencies. 
 California law additionally limits the Companys ability to pay dividends. A corporation may make a distribution/dividend from retained earnings to the extent that the retained earnings exceed (a) the amount of the distribution plus (b) the amount, if any, of dividends in arrears on shares with preferential dividend rights. Alternatively, a corporation may make a distribution/dividend, if, immediately after the distribution, the value of its assets equals or exceeds the sum of (a) its total liabilities plus (b) the liquidation preference of any shares which have a preference upon dissolution over the rights of shareholders receiving the distribution/dividend. 
 The Bank is a legal entity that is separate and distinct from its holding company. The Company is dependent on the performance of the Bank for funds which may be received as dividends from the Bank for use in the operation of the Company and the ability of the Company to pay dividends to shareholders. Subject to the regulatory restrictions which currently further restrict the ability of the Bank to declare and pay dividends, future cash dividends by the Bank will depend upon managements assessment of future capital requirements, contractual restrictions, and other factors. When effective, the new minimum capital rule may restrict dividends by the Bank, if the additional capital conservation buffer is not achieved. 
 The powers of the board of directors of the Bank to declare a cash dividend to the Company is subject to California law, which restricts the amount available for cash dividends to the lesser of a banks retained earnings or net income for its last three fiscal years (less any distributions to shareholders made during such period). Where the above test is not met, cash dividends may still be paid, with the prior approval of the DBO in an amount not exceeding the greatest of (1) retained earnings of the bank; (2) the net income of the bank for its last fiscal year; or (3) the net income of the bank for its current fiscal year. 
 Bank Holding Company Regulation 
 As a bank holding company, CU Bancorp is registered with and subject to regulation and periodic examination by the Federal Reserve under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended, or the BHCA. We are also required to file with the Federal Reserve periodic reports of our operations and such additional information regarding the Company and its subsidiaries as the Federal Reserve may require. CU Bancorp is also a bank holding company within the meaning of Section 1280 of the California Financial Code and is subject to examination by, and may be required to file reports with, the DBO. 
 Federal Reserve policy historically has required bank holding companies to act as a source of financial strength to their bank subsidiaries and to commit capital and financial resources to support those subsidiaries in circumstances where it might not otherwise do so. Dodd-Frank codified this policy as a statutory requirement. Under this requirement, CU Bancorp is expected to commit resources to support the Bank, including at times 
 
17 
 
 when we may not be in a financial position to do so. Similarly, under the cross-guarantee provisions of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, the FDIC can hold any FDIC-insured depository institution liable for any loss suffered or anticipated by the FDIC in connection with (i) the default of a commonly controlled FDIC-insured depository institution or (ii) any assistance provided by the FDIC to such a commonly controlled institution. 
 Pursuant to the BHCA, we are required to obtain the prior approval of the Federal Reserve before we acquire all or substantially all of the assets of any bank or ownership or control of voting shares of any bank if, after giving effect to such acquisition, we would own or control, directly or indirectly, more than 5 percent of such bank. In connection with such transactions, the Federal Reserve is required to consider certain competitive, management, financial, anti-money laundering compliance and other impacts. 
 Under the BHCA, we may not engage in any business other than managing or controlling banks or furnishing services to our subsidiaries that the Federal Reserve deems to be so closely related to banking as to be a proper incident thereto. We are also prohibited, with certain exceptions, from acquiring direct or indirect ownership or control of more than 5 percent of the voting shares of any company unless the company is engaged in banking activities or the Federal Reserve determines that the activity is so closely related to banking as to be a proper incident to banking. The Federal Reserves approval must be obtained before the shares of any such company can be acquired and, in certain cases, before any approved company can open new offices. 
 The BHCA and regulations of the Federal Reserve also impose certain constraints on the redemption or purchase by a bank holding company of its own shares of stock. 
 Banking subsidiaries of bank holding companies are also subject to certain restrictions imposed by federal and state law in dealing with their holding companies and other affiliates, specifically under Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act and Federal Reserve Regulation W (and similar state statutes). Subject to certain exceptions set forth in the Federal Reserve Act, a bank can make a loan or extend credit to an affiliate, purchase or invest in the securities of an affiliate, purchase assets from an affiliate, accept securities of an affiliate as collateral for a loan or extension of credit to any person or company, issue a guarantee or accept letters of credit on behalf of an affiliate only if the aggregate amount of the above transactions of such subsidiary does not exceed 10 percent of such subsidiarys capital stock and surplus on an individual basis or 20 percent of such subsidiarys capital stock and surplus on an aggregate basis. Such transactions must be on terms and conditions that are consistent with safe and sound banking practices and on terms no less favorable than those available from unaffiliated persons. A bank holding company banking subsidiary may not purchase a low-quality asset, as that term is defined in the Federal Reserve Act, from an affiliate. Such restrictions also prevent a holding company and its other affiliates from borrowing from a banking subsidiary of the holding company unless the loans are secured by collateral. Dodd-Frank significantly expands the coverage and scope of the limitations on affiliate transactions within a banking organization. 
 The Federal Reserve has cease and desist powers over parent bank holding companies and non-banking subsidiaries where the action of a parent bank holding company or its non-financial institutions represent an unsafe or unsound practice or violation of law. The Federal Reserve has the authority to regulate debt obligations, other than commercial paper, issued by bank holding companies by imposing interest ceilings and reserve requirements on such debt obligations. 
 In addition to these explicit limitations, the federal regulatory agencies have general authority to prohibit a banking subsidiary or bank holding company from engaging in an unsafe or unsound banking practice. Depending upon the circumstances, the agencies could take the position that paying a dividend would constitute an unsafe or unsound banking practice. 
 Subject to certain exceptions, the Bank Holding Company Act and the Change in Bank Control Act, together with the applicable regulations, require Federal Reserve approval (or, depending on the circumstances, no notice of disapproval) prior to any person or company acquiring control of a bank or bank holding company. 
 
18 
 
As a bank holding company, we are required to obtain prior approval from the Federal Reserve before (i) acquiring all or substantially all of the assets of a bank or bank holding company, (ii) acquiring direct or indirect ownership or control of more than 5% of the outstanding voting stock of any bank or bank holding company (unless we own a majority of such banks voting shares), or (iii) merging or consolidating with any other bank or bank holding company. In determining whether to approve a proposed bank acquisition, federal bank regulators will consider, among other factors, the effect of the acquisition on competition, the public benefits expected to be received from the acquisition, the projected capital ratios and levels on a post-acquisition basis, and the acquiring institutions record of addressing the credit needs of the communities it serves, including the needs of low and moderate income neighborhoods, consistent with the safe and sound operation of the bank, under the CRA. In its most recent examination of its CRA activities the Bank maintained its Outstanding rating. 
 Stock Redemptions and Repurchases 
 It is an essential principle of safety and soundness that a banking organizations redemption and repurchases of regulatory capital instruments, including common stock, from investors be consistent with the organizations current and prospective capital needs. In assessing such needs, the board of directors and management of a bank holding company should consider the Dividend Factors discussed previously under Dividends. The risk-based capital rules directs bank holding companies to consult with the Federal Reserve before redeeming any equity or other capital instrument included in Tier 1 or Tier 2 capital prior to stated maturity, if such redemption could have a material effect on the level or composition of the organizations capital base. Bank holding companies experiencing financial weaknesses, or that are at significant risk of developing financial weaknesses, must consult with the appropriate Federal Reserve supervisory staff before redeeming or repurchasing common stock or other regulatory capital instruments for cash or other valuable consideration. Similarly, any bank holding company considering expansion, either through acquisitions or through new activities, also generally must consult with the appropriate Federal Reserve supervisory staff before redeeming or repurchasing common stock or other regulatory capital instruments for cash or other valuable consideration. In evaluating the appropriateness of a bank holding companys proposed redemption or repurchase of capital instruments, the Federal Reserve will consider the potential losses that the holding company may suffer from the prospective need to increase reserves and write down assets from continued asset deterioration and the holding companys ability to raise additional common stock and other Tier 1 capital to replace capital instruments that are redeemed or repurchased. A bank holding company must inform the Federal Reserve of a redemption or repurchase of common stock or perpetual preferred stock for cash or other value resulting in a net reduction of the bank holding companys outstanding amount of common stock or perpetual preferred stock below the amount of such capital instrument outstanding at the beginning of the quarter in which the redemption or repurchase occurs. In addition, a bank holding company must advise the Federal Reserve sufficiently in advance of such redemptions and repurchases to provide reasonable opportunity for supervisory review and possible objection should the Federal Reserve determine a transaction raises safety and soundness concerns. 
 Regulation Y requires that a bank holding company that is not well capitalized or well managed, or that is subject to any unresolved supervisory issues, provide prior notice to the Federal Reserve for any repurchase or redemption of its equity securities for cash or other value that would reduce by 10% or more the holding companys consolidated net worth aggregated over the preceding 12-month period. 
Annual Reporting; Examinations 
 The holding company is required to file an annual report with the Federal Reserve, and such additional information as the Federal Reserve may require. The Federal Reserve may examine a bank holding company and any of its subsidiaries, and charge the company for the cost of such an examination. 
 
19 
 
Imposition of Liability for Undercapitalized Subsidiaries 
 FDICIA requires bank regulators to take prompt corrective action to resolve problems associated with insured depository institutions. In the event an institution becomes undercapitalized, it must submit a capital restoration plan. The capital restoration plan will not be accepted by the regulators unless each company having control of the undercapitalized institution guarantees the subsidiarys compliance with the capital restoration plan until it becomes adequately capitalized. For purposes of this statute, the holding company has control of the Bank. Under FDICIA, the aggregate liability of all companies controlling a particular institution is limited to the lesser of five percent of the depository institutions total assets at the time it became undercapitalized or the amount necessary to bring the institution into compliance with applicable capital standards. FDICIA grants greater powers to bank regulators in situations where an institution becomes significantly or critically undercapitalized or fails to submit a capital restoration plan. For example, a bank holding company controlling such an institution can be required to obtain prior Federal Reserve approval of proposed distributions, or might be required to consent to a merger or to divest the troubled institution or other affiliates. 
State Law Restrictions 
 As a California corporation, the holding company is subject to certain limitations and restrictions under applicable California corporate law. For example, state law restrictions in California include limitations and restrictions relating to indemnification of directors, distributions and dividends to shareholders (discussed above), transactions involving directors, officers or interested shareholders, maintenance of books, records, and minutes, and observance of certain corporate formalities. 
Bank Regulation 
 The Bank, as a California state-chartered bank, is subject to primary supervision and examination by the DBO, as well as the FDIC. Under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (FDI Act) and the California Financial Code, California state chartered commercial banks may generally engage in any activity permissible for national banks. Therefore, the Bank may form subsidiaries to engage in the many so-called closely related to banking or nonbanking activities commonly conducted by national banks in operating subsidiaries or subsidiaries of bank holding companies. Further, pursuant to amendments enacted by the GLB Act, California banks may conduct certain financial activities in a subsidiary to the same extent as may a national bank, provided the bank is and remains well-capitalized, well-managed and in satisfactory compliance with the CRA, which requires banks to help meet the credit needs of the communities in which they operate. The Bank currently has no financial subsidiaries. 
 Specific federal and state laws and regulations which are applicable to banks regulate, among other things, the scope of their business, their investments, their reserves against deposits, the timing of the availability of deposited funds, the nature and amount of and collateral for certain loans, borrowings, capital requirements, certain check-clearing activities, branching, and mergers and acquisitions. 
 California banks are also subject to various federal statutes and regulations including Federal Reserve Regulation O, Federal Reserve Act Sections 23A and 23B and Regulation W and similar state statutes, which restrict or limit loans or extensions of credit to insiders, including officers, directors and principal shareholders, and loans or extension of credit by banks to affiliates or purchases of assets from affiliates, including parent bank holding companies, except pursuant to certain exceptions and terms and conditions at least as favorable to those prevailing for comparable transactions with unaffiliated parties. 
 The Bank is a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) of San Francisco. Among other benefits, each FHLB serves as a reserve or central bank for its members within its assigned region and makes available loans or advances to its members. Each FHLB is financed primarily from the sale of consolidated obligations of the FHLB system. As an FHLB member, the Bank is required to own a certain amount of capital stock in the FHLB. At December 31, 2016, the Bank was in compliance with the FHLBs stock ownership requirement and our investment in FHLB capital stock totaled $9.1 million. 
 
20 
 
In addition to the foregoing, the following summary identifies some of the more significant laws, regulations, and policies that affect our operations; it is not intended to be a complete listing or description of all laws and regulations that apply to us and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the applicable laws and regulations. 
 Supervision and Enforcement Authority 
 The federal and California regulatory structure gives the bank regulatory agencies extensive discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities and examination policies, including policies with respect to the classification of assets and the establishment of adequate loan loss reserves for regulatory purposes. The regulatory agencies have adopted guidelines to assist in identifying and addressing potential safety and soundness concerns before an institutions capital becomes impaired. The guidelines establish operational and managerial standards generally relating to: (1) internal controls, information systems, and internal audit systems; (2) loan documentation; (3) credit underwriting; (4) interest-rate exposure; (5) asset growth and asset quality; and (6) compensation, fees and benefits. Further, the regulatory agencies have adopted safety and soundness guidelines for asset quality and for evaluating and monitoring earnings to ensure that earnings are sufficient for the maintenance of adequate capital and reserves. If, as a result of an examination, the DBO or the FDIC should determine that the financial condition, capital resources, asset quality, earnings prospects, management, liquidity, or other aspects of the Banks operations are unsatisfactory or that the Bank or its management is violating or has violated any law or regulation, the DBO and the FDIC, and separately the FDIC, as insurer of the Banks deposits, have residual authority to: 

 | Require affirmative action to correct any conditions resulting from any violation or practice;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Direct an increase in capital and the maintenance of higher specific minimum capital ratios, which may preclude the Bank from being deemed well-capitalized and restrict its ability to accept certain brokered deposits;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Restrict the Banks growth geographically, by products and services, or by mergers and acquisitions;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Enter into informal or formal enforcement orders, including memoranda of understanding, written agreements and consent or cease and desist orders or prompt corrective action orders to take corrective action and cease unsafe and unsound practices;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Require prior approval of senior executive officer or director changes; remove officers and directors and assess civil monetary penalties; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Terminate FDIC insurance, revoke the charter and/or take possession of and close and liquidate the Bank or appoint the FDIC as receiver.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Prompt Corrective Action Authority 
 The Federal Deposit Insurance Act requires the federal bank regulatory agencies to take prompt corrective action with respect to a depository institution if that institution does not meet certain capital adequacy standards, including requiring the prompt submission of an acceptable capital restoration plan. Depending on the banks capital ratios, the agencies regulations define five categories in which an insured depository institution will be placed: well-capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized, and critically undercapitalized. At each successive lower capital category, an insured bank is subject to more restrictions, including restrictions on the banks activities, operational practices or the ability to pay dividends or executive bonuses. Based upon its capital levels, a bank that is classified as well-capitalized, adequately capitalized, or undercapitalized may be treated as though it were in the next lower capital category if the appropriate federal banking agency, after notice and opportunity for hearing, determines that an unsafe or unsound condition, or an unsafe or unsound practice, warrants such treatment. 
 
21 
 
The prompt corrective action standards were also changed as the New Capital Rules ratios became effective. Under the new standards, in order to be considered well-capitalized, the bank will be required to meet the new common equity Tier 1 ratio of 6.5%, an increased Tier 1 ratio of 8% (increased from 6%), a total capital ratio of 10% (unchanged) and a leverage ratio of 5% (unchanged). 
 The federal banking agencies also may require banks and bank holding companies subject to enforcement actions to maintain capital ratios in excess of the minimum ratios otherwise required to be deemed well-capitalized, in which case institutions may no longer be deemed to be well-capitalized and may therefore be subject to certain restrictions such as taking brokered deposits. 
 The prompt corrective action standards were changed when the new capital rule ratios become effective as discussed under Legislation and Regulatory Developments. 
 Brokered Deposit Restrictions 
 Well-capitalized institutions are not subject to limitations on brokered deposits, while an adequately capitalized institution is able to accept, renew or roll over brokered deposits only with a waiver from the FDIC and subject to certain restrictions on the yield paid on such deposits. Undercapitalized institutions are generally not permitted to accept, renew, or roll over brokered deposits. CUB is eligible to accept brokered deposits but, except with regard to ICS products, does not utilize brokered deposits at this time and has no current intention of doing so in the near term. 
Loans to One Borrower 
 With certain limited exceptions, the maximum amount that a California bank may lend to any borrower at any one time (including the obligations to the bank of certain related entities of the borrower) may not exceed 25 percent (and unsecured loans may not exceed 15 percent) of the banks shareholders equity, allowance for loan loss, and any capital notes and debentures of the bank. The Bank by policy has lower house limits that it generally will not exceed without the approval of the Chief Credit Officer and the Chief Executive Officer or the President and in limited circumstances (absence of approving officers) by the Chairman of the Board of Directors Loan Committee and the Chief Credit Officer or by the Chairman of the Board of Directors Loan Committee and the CEO or the President. 
 Extensions of Credit to Insiders and Transactions with Affiliates 
 The Federal Reserve Act and Federal Reserve Regulation O place limitations and conditions on loans or extensions of credit to a bank or bank holding companys executive officers, directors and principal shareholders (i.e., in most cases, those persons who own, control or have power to vote more than 10 percent of any class of voting securities); any company controlled by any such executive officer, director or shareholder; or any political or campaign committee controlled by such executive officer, director or principal shareholder. 
 Such loans and leases must comply with loan-to-one-borrower limits; require prior full board approval when aggregate extensions of credit to the person exceed specified amounts; must be made on substantially the same terms (including interest rates and collateral) and follow credit-underwriting procedures no less stringent than those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with non-insiders; must not involve more than the normal risk of repayment or present other unfavorable features; and in the aggregate must not exceed the banks unimpaired capital and unimpaired surplus. The California Financial Code and DBO regulations adopt and apply Regulation O to the Bank and provide additional limitations on loans to affiliates. 
 
22 
 
Affiliate Transactions 
 The Bank also is subject to certain restrictions imposed by Federal Reserve Act Sections 23A and 23B, as amended by Dodd-Frank, and Federal Reserve Regulation W on any extensions of credit by the Bank to, or the issuance of a guarantee or letter of credit on behalf of, any affiliates or insiders, the purchase of, or investments in, stock or other securities thereof, the taking of such securities as collateral for loans, and the purchase of assets of any affiliates or insiders. 
 Additional restrictions on transactions with affiliates may be imposed on the Bank under the FDI Acts prompt corrective action regulations and the supervisory authority of the federal and state banking agencies. 
 Deposit Insurance 
 The FDIC is an independent federal agency that insures deposits, up to prescribed statutory limits, of federally insured banks and savings institutions and safeguards the safety and soundness of the banking and savings industries. The FDIC insures our customer deposits through the Deposit Insurance Fund (the DIF) up to prescribed limits for each depositor. Pursuant to Dodd-Frank, the maximum deposit insurance amount has been permanently increased to $250,000 per depositor. As required by Dodd-Frank, the FDIC adopted a DIF restoration plan which became effective on January 1, 2011. Among other things, the plan: (1) raises the minimum designated reserve ratio, which the FDIC is required to set each year, to 1.35 percent and removes the upper limit on the designated reserve ratio and consequently on the size of the fund; (2) requires that the fund reserve ratio reach 1.35 percent by 2020; (3) eliminates the requirement that the FDIC provide dividends from the fund when the reserve ratio is between 1.35 percent and 1.5 percent; and (4) continues the FDICs authority to declare dividends when the reserve ratio at the end of a calendar year is at least 1.5 percent. The FDIC has set a long-term goal of getting its reserve ratio up to 2% of insured deposits by 2027. 
 In 2016 our FDIC insurance assessment was $1.5 million. The FDIC may terminate a depository institutions deposit insurance upon a finding that the institutions financial condition is unsafe or unsound or that the institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices that pose a risk to the DIF or that may prejudice the interest of the banks depositors. The termination of deposit insurance for a bank would also result in the revocation of the banks charter by the DBO. 
 Depositor Preference 
 The Federal Deposit Insurance Act provides that, in the event of the liquidation or other resolution of an insured depository institution, the claims of depositors of the institutions, including the claims of the FDIC as subrogee of insured depositors, and certain claims for administrative expenses of the FDIC as a receiver, will have priority over other general unsecured claims against the institution. If an insured depository institution fails, insured and uninsured depositors, along with the FDIC, will have priority in payment ahead of unsecured non-deposit creditors, with respect to any extensions of credit they have made to such insured depository institution. 
 Anti-Money Laundering and OFAC Regulation 
 A major focus of governmental policy on financial institutions in recent years has been aimed at combating money laundering and terrorist financing. The Bank Secrecy Act of 1970 (BSA) and subsequent laws and regulations require the Bank to take steps to prevent the use of the Bank or its systems from facilitating the flow of illegal or illicit money and to file suspicious activity reports. 
 An institution such as the Bank must provide anti-money laundering (AML) training to employees, designate an AML compliance officer and annually audit the AML program to assess its effectiveness. The federal regulatory agencies continue to issue regulations and new guidance with respect to the application and 
 
23 
 
 requirements of BSA and AML. The United States has imposed economic sanctions that affect transactions with designated foreign countries, nationals and others. Based on their administration by Treasurys Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), these are typically known as the OFAC rules. Failure of a financial institution to maintain and implement adequate BSA, AML and OFAC programs, or to comply with all of the relevant laws or regulations, could have serious legal and reputational consequences for the institution. 
 As discussed previously in Recent Events in 2016 the Bank entered into a Consent Order with the FDIC and the DBO requiring the Bank to take corrective actions and enhancements to address certain deficiencies within the BSA/AML compliance program. No criminal activity has been identified as a result of such deficiencies, and no financial penalty was levied. The Bank has already taken significant steps toward the improvement of its BSA/AML program including additional investment in employees, continued emphasis on education, training and the importance of compliance by all employees and the hiring of a highly experienced BSA/AML professional and a Chief Risk Officer to oversee these efforts. Management and the Board have expressed their full intention to comply with all parts of the Consent Order at the earliest possible date. The Bank expects risks in this area to continually evolve and regulatory expectations to escalate. 
 Community Reinvestment Act 
 Under the CRA, the Bank has a continuing and affirmative obligation consistent with safe and sound banking practices to help meet the credit needs of its entire community, including low and moderate income neighborhoods. CRA does not establish specific lending requirements or programs for financial institutions nor does it limit an institutions discretion to develop the types of products and services that it believes are best suited to its particular community, consistent with CRA. CRA generally requires the federal banking agencies to evaluate the record of a financial institution in meeting the credit needs of its local communities and to take that record into account in its evaluation of certain applications by such institution, such as applications for charters, branches and other deposit facilities, relocations, mergers, consolidations and acquisitions or engage in certain activities pursuant to the GLB Act. The Bank currently falls under the large bank category for CRA purposes. An unsatisfactory rating may be the basis for denying an application. Based on its most recent examination report in 2016, the Bank maintained an overall CRA rating of Outstanding, the highest rating possible. 
Consumer Compliance and Fair Lending Laws 
 The Bank is subject to a number of federal and state laws designed to protect borrowers and promote lending to various sectors of the economy and population. These laws include the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001, the Bank Secrecy Act, the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (effective 2013), the CRA, the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, as amended by the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Truth in Lending Act, the Fair Housing Act, the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, the National Flood Insurance Act, various state law counterparts, and the Consumer Financial Protection Act of 2010, which constitutes part of Dodd-Frank and is discussed in further detail below. The enforcement of Fair Lending laws has been an increasing area of focus for regulators. Fair Lending laws related to extensions of credit are included in The Equal Credit Opportunity Act and the Fair Housing Act, which prohibit discrimination in residential real estate and credit transactions based on race, color, national origin, sex, marital status, familial status, religion, age, physical ability, the fact that all or part of the applicants income derives from a public assistance program or the fact that the applicant has exercised any right under the Consumer Credit Protection Act. 
 In addition, federal law and certain state laws (including California) currently contain client privacy protection provisions. These provisions limit the ability of banks and other financial institutions to disclose non-public information about consumers to affiliated companies and non-affiliated third parties.

Dodd-Frank provided for the creation of the CFPB as an independent entity within the Federal Reserve with broad rulemaking, supervisory and enforcement authority over consumer financial products and services, including deposit products, residential mortgages, home-equity loans and credit cards. The bureaus functions include investigating consumer complaints, conducting market research, rulemaking, supervising and examining bank consumer transactions, and enforcing rules related to consumer financial products and services. CFPB regulations and guidance apply to all financial institutions and banks with $10 billion or more in assets are subject to examination by the CFPB. Banks with less than $10 billion in assets, including the Bank, will continue to be examined for compliance by their primary federal banking agency. 
 Customer Information Security 
 The Federal Reserve and other bank regulatory agencies have adopted guidelines for safeguarding confidential, personal customer information. These guidelines require each financial institution, under the supervision and ongoing oversight of its board of directors or an appropriate committee thereof, to create, implement and maintain a comprehensive written information security program designed to ensure the security and confidentiality of customer information, protect against any anticipated threats or hazard to the security or integrity of such information and protect against unauthorized access to or use of such information that could result in substantial harm or inconvenience to any customer. We have adopted a customer information security program designed to comply with such requirements. 
Privacy 
 The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 and the California Financial Information Privacy Act require financial institutions to implement policies and procedures regarding the disclosure of nonpublic personal information about consumers to non-affiliated third parties. In general, the statutes require explanations to consumers on policies and procedures regarding the disclosure of such nonpublic personal information and, except as otherwise required by law, prohibit disclosing such information except as provided in the Banks policies and procedures. CUB has implemented privacy policies addressing these restrictions which are distributed regularly to all existing and new customers of the Bank.
