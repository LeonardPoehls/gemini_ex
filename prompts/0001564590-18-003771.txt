 Chapter 11 Proceedings

Voluntary Reorganization Under Chapter 11
 On April 29, 2016 (the “Petition Date”), the Company and its subsidiaries (collectively, “the Debtors”) filed voluntary petitions under chapter 11 of title 11 of the United States Code in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Texas (the “Bankruptcy Court”).  Our chapter 11 cases were jointly administered under the caption In re Ultra Petroleum Corp., et al, (Case No. 16-32202 (MI).  On March 14, 2017, the Bankruptcy Court confirmed our Debtors’ Second Amended Joint Chapter 11 Plan of Reorganization (the “Plan”), and on April 12, 2017 (the “Effective Date”), we emerged from bankruptcy.  For further description of these matters, see Note 1 in this Form 10-K in our Consolidated Financial Statements.
Oil and Gas Properties Overview —
 Principal Operating Areas
 Ultra’s operations in southwest Wyoming have historically focused on developing its long-life natural gas reserves in a tight gas sand trend located in the Green River Basin. The Company targets sands of the upper Cretaceous Lance Pool in the Pinedale and Jonah fields. The Lance Pool, as administered by the Wyoming Oil and Gas Conservation Commission (“WOGCC”), includes sands of the Lance formation at depths between approximately 8,000 and 12,000 feet and the Mesaverde formation at depths between approximately 12,000 and 14,000 feet. As of December 31, 2017, Ultra owned interests in approximately 112,000 gross (77,000 net) acres in Wyoming covering approximately 190 square miles.
 The Company’s operations in the Uinta Basin in Utah have focused on developing its oil-producing properties and undeveloped acreage covering approximately 8,000 net acres. The primary geologic target is the Eocene aged Green River formation found between subsurface depths of approximately 4,000 and 7,500 feet.
 The Company had operations in north-central Pennsylvania with a focus on developing its natural gas reserves in the Marcellus Shale.  During the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company divested certain non-core properties in the Pennsylvania Devonian aged Marcellus Shale (the “Pennsylvania Asset Sale”), which consisted of net production of approximately 30 million cubic feet per day, for net cash proceeds of approximately $115.0 million, subject to post-close purchase adjustments.
 Mission and Strategy
 Ultra’s mission is to profitably grow an upstream oil and gas company for the long-term benefit of its shareholders.  Ultra’s strategy to achieve this goal includes building a portfolio of high return investment opportunities, maintaining a disciplined approach to capital investment, maximizing earnings and cash flows by controlling costs, utilizing advancements in drilling technologies to maximize results, and maintaining financial flexibility.
 6

High Return Portfolio.  Ultra seeks to maintain a portfolio of properties that provide long-term, profitable growth through development in areas that support sustainable, lower-risk, repeatable, high-return drilling projects.  The Company continually evaluates opportunities for the acquisition, exploration, and development of additional oil and natural gas properties that afford risk-adjusted returns in excess of or equal to its current set of investment alternatives. 
 Disciplined Capital Investment.  The Company’s business strategy includes proactive and regular review of its portfolio of investment opportunities with a focus on investments that produce positive returns in order to optimize return to its shareholders.  The Company seeks to develop the resource from existing, self-funding assets over the next twenty years, while spending within cash flows in order to maximize profitability.  
 Focus on Maximizing Value.  Ultra strives to maintain one of the lowest cost structures in the industry in terms of both adding and producing oil and natural gas reserves.    The Company continues to focus on improving its drilling and production results using advanced technologies and detailed technical analysis of its properties, while maintaining its low cost structure, adhering to industry best practices, maintaining strict safety and environmental standards, and recruiting and retaining top talent within the Company.    
 Financial Strength and Flexibility.   Preserving financial flexibility and a strong balance sheet are also key components of Ultra’s business philosophy.  At December 31, 2017, the Company had cash on hand of $16.6 million and outstanding debt of $2.2 billion.  At December 31, 2017, the Company had $425.0 million of available borrowing under its revolving credit facility.  The Company’s average debt maturity is 5.8 years and the Company’s weighted average cost of debt is approximately 6%.  Further, the Company seeks to improve its cash flow visibility by hedging up to 50% of its forecasted volumes on an annual basis in order to manage commodity price risks and provide cash flow predictability.  
Exploration and Production
 Green River Basin, Wyoming
 During 2017, the Company participated in the drilling of 210 wells in Wyoming and continued to improve its drilling and completion efficiency on its operated wells. The Company’s operated vertical well costs declined from an annual average of $3.8 million per well during 2014 to $3.0 million per well average during 2017. The reduction in costs is attributable to drilling efficiencies and service cost reductions. The Company operates 89% of its production in the Pinedale field.
 During 2018, the Company plans, based on the availability of capital, to continue developing its position in the Pinedale field, and will continue to target tight gas sands of the Lance Pool. All of the Company’s drilling activity is conducted utilizing its extensive geological and geophysical data set. This data set is used to map the productive intervals, to refine areas of drilling focus, to identify areas for future extension of the Lance fairway with horizontal wells and to identify deeper objectives that may warrant drilling.
 Utah
 During 2017, the Company did not drill any wells on the Uinta Basin properties. The Company continued to expand its waterflood program resulting in incremental recovery in the first two pilot projects. At December 31, 2017, the company had 9 wells drilled but not completed in inventory. Ultra is the sole operator of the properties with a 100% working interest. At the end of 2017, approximately 88% of the Company’s gross acreage holdings in Utah were held by production.
 During 2018, the Company will consider strategic alternatives in Utah, including the possible divestiture of its assets.
 Pennsylvania
 During 2017, the Company did not drill any wells on its Pennsylvania properties and sold the properties during the quarter ended December 31, 2017.  
 Marketing and Pricing
 Overview
 During the year ended December 31, 2017, Ultra derived its revenues from the sale of its natural gas and associated condensate produced from wells operated by the Company in the Green River Basin in southwest Wyoming, from the sale of natural gas produced from wells operated by others in the Appalachian Basin in Pennsylvania, and from the sale of crude oil and natural gas from wells operated by the Company in the Uinta Basin of Utah.  During the quarter ended December 31, 2017, the Company divested its natural gas reserves in the north-central Pennsylvania area of the Appalachian Basin.  During 2017, 94% of the Company’s production and 84% of its revenues were attributable to natural gas, with the balance attributable to associated condensate and crude oil.
 The Company’s natural gas revenues are determined by prevailing natural gas market prices in the Rocky Mountain region of the United States, specifically, southwest Wyoming, and prior to the Pennsylvania Asset Sale, were also determined by natural gas market prices in the Eastern region of the United States. The Company’s oil revenues are determined by prevailing oil and condensate prices in the Rocky Mountain region of the United States.

Natural Gas Marketing
 Ultra currently sells all of its natural gas production to a diverse group of third-party, non-affiliated entities in a portfolio of transactions of various durations and prices (daily, monthly and longer term). The Company’s customer base includes a significant number of customers situated in the various regions of the United States. The sale of the Company’s natural gas is “as produced”. As such, the Company does not maintain any significant inventories or imbalances of natural gas.
 Midstream services.    For its natural gas production in Wyoming, the Company has entered into various gathering and processing agreements with several midstream service providers that gather, compress and process natural gas owned or controlled by the Company from its producing wells in the Pinedale Anticline and Jonah fields. Under these agreements, the midstream service providers continue to expand their facilities’ capacities in southwest Wyoming to accommodate growing volumes from wells in which the Company owns an interest. The Company believes that the capacity of the midstream infrastructure related to its production will continue to be adequate to allow it to sell essentially all of its available natural gas production.
 Basis differentials.    The market price for natural gas is influenced by a number of regional and national factors which are beyond the Company’s ability to control. These factors include, among others, weather, natural gas supplies, imports from Canada, natural gas demand, inventory levels in natural gas storage fields, and natural gas pipeline capacity to export gas from the basins where the Company’s production is located. See Item 1A — Risk Factors for more information about risks to our financial condition and business results associated with basis differentials.
 The Rocky Mountain region is a net exporter of natural gas because local natural gas production exceeds local demand, especially during non-winter months. As a result, natural gas production in southwest Wyoming has from time to time sold at a discount relative to other U.S. natural gas production sources or market areas. These regional pricing differentials, or discounts, are typically referred to as “basis” or “basis differentials” and are reflective, to some extent, of i.) the costs associated with transporting the Company’s gas to markets in other regions or states, and ii.) the availability of pipeline capacity to move the Company’s gas to market.
 The Inside FERC First of Month Index for Northwest Pipeline — Rocky Mountains (“NwRox”) is the price that is reflective of the Company’s gas sold in the Opal, Wyoming area and the Inside FERC First of Month Index for Dominion Transmission Inc. — Appalachia is the price that was reflective of the Company’s gas sold in Pennsylvania.
 From 1990 to 2009, the average annual basis for NwRox averaged 23.7% below Henry Hub. After the Rockies Express and Ruby pipelines began flowing, the average annual basis for NwRox averaged 5.6% below Henry Hub from 2012 through 2016. The additional capacity of these two pipelines has had a significant positive impact on the value that the Company receives for its natural gas production in southwest Wyoming. In recent months, however, NwRox basis has weakened from levels realized in 2012 through 2016 mainly due to weakening fundamentals in the Company’s core delivery area, California, and increasing flows from regions that produce significant quantities of oil and are connected by gas pipelines to the California market. In 2017, NwRox basis averaged an 11.9% discount to Henry Hub.
 The table below provides a historical perspective on average annual basis differentials for Wyoming natural gas (NwRox) and Northeast (Appalachia). The basis differential is expressed as a percentage of the Henry Hub price as reported by Platt’s M2M (Mark to Market) Report and Bloomberg on December 31, 2017.
 
 
 | 2014 | | | 2015 | | 2016 | 2017 | 
---------------------------------------+------+----+---+------+----+------+------+--
NW Pipeline Corp. — Rocky Mountains | | 96 | % | | 93 | % | 91 | % | 88 | %
Dominion Transmission Inc — Appalachia | | 74 | % | | 54 | % | 56 | % | 72 | %

Oil Marketing
 Wyoming.    The Company markets its Wyoming condensate to various purchasers, which are primarily refiners in the Salt Lake City, Utah area. The Company’s condensate realized pricing is typically based on New York Mercantile Exchange crude futures daily settlement prices, less a negotiated location/transportation discount or differential. All of the Company’s condensate sales are denominated in U.S. dollars per barrel and are paid for on a monthly basis. The Company routinely maintains only operating inventories of condensate production and sells its product on an “as produced” basis. A portion of the Company’s condensate sales are entered into by its operating partners in the Pinedale field.
 Utah.    The Company’s properties in the Uinta Basin produce what is typically referred to as Black Wax Crude which is considered a medium grade of crude oil. This oil is marketed through short-term or long-term contracts with refiners in the Salt Lake City, Utah area. The price for the Company’s crude oil production is typically based off of NYMEX pricing for West Texas Intermediate Crude Oil or from a posting for Black Wax Crude in the Uinta Basin, less a negotiated location/transportation discount or differential.
 8

Derivatives
 The Company, from time to time and in the regular course of its business, enters into hedges for volumes equivalent to a portion of expected future production volumes, primarily through the use of financial swaps with creditworthy financial counterparties (See Note 12), or through the use of fixed price, forward sales of physical product. The Company plans to enter into additional hedge positions in much the same manner as it has done previously. See Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.
 The Company’s hedging policy limits the volumes hedged to not more than 50% of its forecasted production without Board approval. During 2017 and 2015, the quantities that the Company hedged for the twelve-month period represented 40% and 62%, respectively, of the Company’s forecasted production for such periods.  During 2016, the Company did not have any open hedge positions.  Where the Company hedged more than 50% of its forecasted production, Ultra’s board approved hedges of greater than 50% of the Company’s forecasted production for each respective period. (See Note 7 for additional information).
 Significant Counterparties
 A significant counterparty is defined as one that individually accounts for 10% or more of the Company’s total revenues during the year. In 2017, the Company had no single counterparty that represented 10% or more of the Company’s total revenues.
 The Company maintains credit policies intended to mitigate the risk of uncollectible accounts receivable related to the sale of natural gas and condensate as well as commodity derivatives. A more complete description of the Company’s credit policies is described in Note 12. The Company did not have any outstanding, uncollectible accounts for its natural gas and oil sales at December 31, 2017.
 Regulatory Matters
 The Company’s oil and gas operations are subject to a number of regulations. Governing agencies may include one or more of the following levels: Federal, Regional, State, County, Municipality, Tribal or other public entities. In general, the purposes of these regulations are to prevent waste of oil and natural gas resources, protect the rights of surface and mineral owners, regulate interstate transportation of oil and gas, and to govern environmental quality. Common forms of regulations may include:

• | Notification to stakeholders of proposed and ongoing operations;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------


• | Nondiscrimination statutes;
--+----------------------------


• | Royalty and related valuation requirements;
--+--------------------------------------------


• | On-site security and bonding requirements;
--+-------------------------------------------


• | Location and density of drilling;
--+----------------------------------


• | Method of drilling, completing and operating wells;
--+----------------------------------------------------


• | Measurement and reporting of oil and gas;
--+------------------------------------------


• | Rates, terms and conditions applicable to the interstate transportation of oil and gas;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Production, severance and ad valorem taxes;
--+--------------------------------------------


• | Management of produced water and waste; and
--+--------------------------------------------


• | Surface use, reclamation and plugging and abandonment of wells.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------

 A significant portion of the Company’s operations are located on federal lands in the Pinedale and Jonah Fields of Sublette County, Wyoming. The development activities in these fields are subject to the regulation of the U.S. Bureau of Land Management (“BLM”) which is responsible for governing their surface and mineral rights and regulating certain development activities in these fields. As required under the National Environmental Policy Act (“NEPA”), an Environmental Impact Statement (“EIS”) was prepared to quantify and address potential impacts of natural gas development in both the Pinedale and Jonah fields. In March 2006, the BLM issued its Record of Decision (“ROD”) which provides broad authorization for the development activities currently occurring in the Jonah Area. In September 2008, the BLM issued its ROD that currently governs the development activities in the Pinedale Area. In addition to the overarching authorizations provided by the Jonah and Pinedale RODs, BLM issues site-specific authorizations such as rights of way and permits to drill on an ongoing basis.
 The Pinedale ROD includes some significant components to ensure the orderly and responsible development of natural gas concurrent to minimizing the environmental impact. Some of these components include:
  
• | Year-round operations on multi-wells pads;
--+-------------------------------------------


• | Liquid gathering systems to reduce truck traffic and minimize impacts to air quality and wildlife;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Monitoring of key wildlife species and mitigation of monitored impacts;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Advanced emission reductions including best practices such as controlled drill rigs;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Spatial progression of development to address specific surface and wildlife issues;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

• | Annual meeting and long-range planning requirements to allow for socioeconomic predictability;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Adaptive Management to consider current and changing conditions and facilitate common-sense solutions; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Suspension of flank acreage until core acreage is developed and returned to a functioning habitat.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 While the majority of the Company’s operations in Wyoming are covered by the Pinedale ROD, provisions of the Jonah ROD similarly ensure responsible and orderly development of the Jonah field while minimizing the environmental impact:
  
• | Annual reporting and long-range planning requirements to allow for planned mitigation and socioeconomic predictability;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Emission reduction report to ensure air quality goals are met;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------


• | Annual water well monitoring reports; and
--+------------------------------------------


• | Flareless-completion technology to reduce noise, visual impacts and air emissions.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The State of Wyoming maintains governance over some of the more traditional state-regulated matters such as individual well drilling permits, spacing and pooling, wellbore construction, as well as its own regulations on safety and environmental matters. The Wyoming Oil and Gas Conservation Commission (“WOGCC”) has authorized drilling density up to 1 well per 5 acres in the Pinedale field and up to 1 well per 10 acres in the Jonah field.
 Regulations are well documented and the Company believes that it is substantially in compliance with current applicable laws and regulations and that continued compliance with existing requirements will not have a material adverse impact on the Company. However, changes to certain existing regulations are beyond the control of the Company and could introduce uncertainty and additional costs. Please see Section 1A: Risk Factors for additional information.
 Mineral Leasing Act
 The Mineral Leasing Act of 1920 (“Mineral Act”) prohibits ownership of any direct or indirect interest in federal onshore oil and gas leases by a foreign citizen or a foreign corporation except through stock ownership in a corporation formed under the laws of the United States or of any U.S. State or territory, and only if the laws, customs, or regulations of their country of origin or domicile do not deny similar or like privileges to citizens or corporations of the United States. If these restrictions are violated, the oil and gas lease can be canceled in a proceeding instituted by the United States Attorney General. The Company qualifies as a corporation formed under the laws of the United States or of any U.S. State or territory. Although the regulations promulgated and administered by the BLM pursuant to the Mineral Act provide for agency designations of non-reciprocal countries, there are presently no such designations in effect. The Company owns interests in numerous federal onshore oil and gas leases. It is possible that holders of the Company’s equity interests may be citizens of foreign countries that are determined to be non-reciprocal countries under the Mineral Act. In such event, the federal onshore oil and gas leases held by the Company could be subject to cancellation based on such determination.
Environmental and Occupational Safety and Health Matters
 Surface Damage Acts
 Several states, including Wyoming, and some tribal nations have enacted surface damage statutes. These laws are designed to compensate for damages caused by oil and gas development operations. Most surface damage statutes contain entry and negotiation requirements to facilitate contact between the operator and surface owners. Most also contain binding requirements for payments by the operator in connection with development operations. Costs and delays associated with surface damage statutes could impair operational effectiveness and increase development costs.
Environmental Regulations
 General.    The Company’s exploration, drilling and production activities from wells and oil and natural gas facilities, including the operation and construction of pipelines, plants and other facilities for transporting, processing, treating or storing oil, natural gas and other products are subject to numerous stringent federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to environmental quality, including those relating to oil spills and pollution control. These laws and regulations govern environmental cleanup standards, require permits for air, water, underground injection, solid and hazardous waste disposal and set environmental compliance criteria. In addition, state and local laws and regulations set forth specific standards for drilling wells, the maintenance of bonding requirements in order to drill or operate wells, the spacing and location of wells, the method of drilling and casing wells, the surface use and restoration of properties upon which wells are drilled, the plugging and abandoning of wells, and the prevention and cleanup of pollutants and other matters. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) has identified environmental compliance by the energy extraction sector as one of its enforcement initiatives for fiscal years 2017-2019 and as a general matter, the oil and gas exploration and production industry has been and continues to be the subject of increasing scrutiny and regulation by environmental authorities.
 10

Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of administrative, civil and criminal fines and penalties and the imposition of injunctive relief. Accidental releases or spills may occur in the course of our operations, and we cannot be sure that we will not incur significant costs and liabilities as a result of such releases or spills, including any third-party claims for damage to property, natural resources or persons. However, it is anticipated that, absent the occurrence of an extraordinary event, compliance with these laws and regulations will not have a material effect upon the Company’s operations, capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position.
 Solid and Hazardous Waste.    The Company has previously owned or leased and currently owns or leases, numerous properties that have been used for the exploration and production of oil and natural gas for many years. Although the Company utilized standard operating and disposal practices, hydrocarbons or other solid wastes may have been disposed of or released on or under such properties or on or under locations where such wastes have been taken for disposal. In addition, many of these properties are or have been operated by third parties over whom the Company has no control, nor has ever had control as to such entities’ treatment of hydrocarbons or other wastes or the manner in which such substances may have been disposed of or released. State and federal laws applicable to oil and natural gas wastes and properties have gradually become stricter over time. Under current and evolving law, it is possible the Company could be required to remediate property, including ground water, impacted by operations of the Company or by such third-party operators, or impacted by previously disposed wastes including performing remedial plugging operations to prevent future, or mitigate existing contamination.
 Although oil and gas wastes generally are exempt from regulation as hazardous wastes (“Hazardous Wastes”) under the federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (“RCRA”) and some comparable state statutes, it is possible some wastes the Company generates presently are or in the future may be subject to regulation under RCRA and state analogs, even as non-hazardous wastes. The EPA and various state agencies have limited the disposal options for certain wastes, including Hazardous Wastes and there is no guarantee that the EPA or the states will not adopt more stringent requirements in the future. For example, in May 2016, several environmental groups filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia that sought to compel the EPA to review and, if necessary, revise its regulations regarding existing exemptions for exploration and production related wastes. Pursuant to a consent decree entered December 28, 2016 that settled the lawsuit, the EPA committed to propose by March 15, 2019 new regulations for the management of oil and gas wastes under RCRA Subtitle D (which relates to non-hazardous wastes), or sign a determination that a revision of existing rules is unnecessary.  If the EPA proposes new rulemaking, the Consent Decree requires the EPA to take final action on such rules no later than July 15, 2021.  Furthermore, certain wastes generated by the Company’s oil and natural gas operations that are currently exempt from designation as Hazardous Wastes may in the future be designated as Hazardous Wastes under RCRA or other applicable statutes, and therefore be subject to more rigorous and costly operating and disposal requirements.
 In addition, current and future regulations governing the handling and disposal of Naturally Occurring Radioactive Materials (“NORM”) may affect our operations. For example, the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection has asked operators to identify technologically enhanced NORM (“TENORM”) in their processes, such as hydraulic fracturing sand. Local landfills only accept such waste when it meets their TENORM permit standards. As a result, we may have to locate out-of-state landfills to accept TENORM waste, potentially increasing our disposal costs.
 Hydraulic Fracturing.    Many of the Company’s exploration and production operations depend on the use of hydraulic fracturing to enhance production from oil and gas wells. Hydraulic fracturing activities are typically regulated by state oil and gas commissions. The EPA has asserted federal regulatory authority over certain hydraulic-fracturing activities under the federal Safe Drinking Water Act (“SDWA”) involving the use of diesel fuels and published permitting guidance in February 2014 addressing the use of diesel in fracturing operations. Congress has periodically considered legislation to amend the SDWA to remove the exemption from permitting and regulation provided to injection for hydraulic fracturing (except where diesel is a component of the fracturing fluid) and to require the disclosure and reporting of the chemicals used in hydraulic fracturing. This type of federal legislation, if adopted, could lead to additional regulation and permitting requirements that could result in operational delays making it more difficult to perform hydraulic fracturing and increasing our costs of compliance and operating costs.
 In addition, the EPA has issued guidance regarding federal regulatory authority over hydraulic fracturing using diesel under the Safe Drinking Water Act’s Underground Injection Control Program. Further, in December 2016 the EPA released its final report on a wide-ranging study on the effects of hydraulic fracturing resources. While no widespread impacts from hydraulic fracturing were found, the EPA identified a number of activities and factors that may have increased risk for future impacts.  Furthermore, a number of public and private studies are underway regarding the connection, if any, between the disposal of waste water associated with hydraulic fracturing and observed seismicity in the vicinity of such disposal operations. These studies and the EPA’s enforcement initiative for the energy extraction sector could result in additional regulatory scrutiny that could make it difficult to perform hydraulic fracturing and increase our costs of compliance and doing business.
 In addition, some states, including Wyoming, Utah, and Colorado, have adopted, and other states are considering adopting, regulations that require disclosure of the chemicals in the fluids used in hydraulic fracturing or well stimulation operations. Additionally, some states, localities and local regulatory districts have adopted or have considered adopting regulations to limit, and in some case impose a moratorium on hydraulic fracturing or other restrictions on drilling and completion operations, including requirements regarding permitting, casing and cementing of wells; testing of nearby water wells; restrictions on access to, and usage of, water; and restrictions on the type of chemical additives that may be used in hydraulic fracturing operations. For example, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court has limited the state’s ability to limit such ordinances at and strengthened the ability of municipalities to enact local ordinances regulating drilling activities. Although none of 
 11

the Company’s properties are in jurisdictions where the moratoria have been imposed, it is possible the jurisdictions where the Company’s properties are located may adopt such limits or other limits on hydraulic fracturing in the future. The BLM finalized regulations for hydraulic fracturing activities on federal lands in March 2015, though a preliminary injunction was issued in June 2015 prior to implementation. In June 2016, a U.S. District Court judge ruled that the BLM has no authority to regulate hydraulic fracturing. Under a new administration, in December 2017, BLM subsequently rescinded the hydraulic fracturing regulations at issue. Further, the EPA has announced an initiative under the Toxic Substances Control Act to develop regulations governing the disclosure and evaluation of hydraulic fracturing chemicals and is working on regulations for wastewater generated by hydraulic fracturing.
 Superfund.    Under the federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (“CERCLA”), also known as the “Superfund” law, liability, generally, is joint and several for costs of investigation and remediation and for natural resource damages, without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct, on certain classes of persons with respect to the release into the environment of substances designated under CERCLA as hazardous substances (“Hazardous Substances”). These classes of persons, or so-called potentially responsible parties (“PRP”), include current and certain past owners and operators of a facility where there has been a release or threat of release of a Hazardous Substance, persons who disposed of or arranged for the disposal of the Hazardous Substances found at such a facility, and in some cases the parties transporting such Hazardous Substances to the facility at issue. CERCLA also authorizes the EPA and, in some cases, third parties to take actions in response to releases and threats of releases to protect the public health or the environment and to seek to recover from the PRP the costs of such action. Although CERCLA generally exempts “petroleum” from the definition of Hazardous Substance, in the course of its operations, adulterated petroleum products containing other Hazardous Substances have been treated as Hazardous Substances in the past, and the Company has generated and will generate wastes that fall within CERCLA’s definition of Hazardous Substances. The Company may also be an owner or operator of facilities on which Hazardous Substances have been released. The Company may be responsible under CERCLA for all or part of the costs to clean up facilities at which such substances have been released and for natural resource damages, as a past or present owner or operator or as an arranger. Although we have utilized operating and disposal practices that were standard in the industry at the time, hydrocarbons or other wastes may have been disposed of or released on or under the properties owned or leased by us on or under other locations where such wastes have been taken for disposal. In addition, a portion of these properties may have been operated by third parties whose treatment and disposal or release of wastes was not under our control. Many states have comparable laws imposing liability on similar classes of persons for releases, including for releases of materials that may not be included in CERCLA’s definition of Hazardous Substances. To its knowledge, the Company has not been named a PRP under CERCLA (or any comparable state law) nor have any prior owners or operators of its properties been named as PRPs related to their ownership or operation of such property.
 National Environmental Policy Act.    The federal National Environmental Policy Act provides that, for federal actions significantly affecting the quality of the human environment, the federal agency taking such action must prepare an Environmental Assessment (“EA”) or an environmental impact statement (EIS). In the EIS, the agency is required to evaluate alternatives to the proposed action and the environmental impacts of the proposed action and of such alternatives. Actions of the Company, such as drilling on federal lands, to the extent the drilling requires federal approval, may trigger the requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act, including the requirement that an EA or EIS be prepared. The requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act may result in increased costs, significant delays and the imposition of restrictions or obligations on the Company’s activities, including but not limited to the restricting or prohibiting of drilling.
 Oil Pollution Act.    The Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (“OPA”), which amends and augments oil spill provisions of the Clean Water Act (“CWA”), imposes certain duties and liabilities on certain “responsible parties” related to the prevention of oil spills and damages resulting from such spills in or threatening United States waters or adjoining shorelines. A liable “responsible party” includes the owner or operator of a facility, vessel or pipeline that is a source of an oil discharge or that poses the substantial threat of discharge or, in the case of offshore facilities, the lessee or permittee of the area in which a discharging facility is located. OPA assigns liability, which generally is joint and several, without regard to fault, to each liable party for oil removal costs and for a variety of public and private damages. Although defenses and limitations exist to the liability imposed by OPA, they are limited. In the event of an oil discharge or substantial threat of discharge, the Company could be liable for costs and damages.
 Clean Air Act.    The Clean Air Act (“CAA)” regulates emissions of pollutants from stationary and mobile sources and establishes National Ambient Air Quality Standards (“NAAQS”) for pollutants of concern. The CAA directs states to develop state implementation plans to achieve these standards and gives the primary role of enforcing this plans to the states. Federal and state laws generally require new and modified sources of air pollutants to obtain permits prior to commencing construction, which may require, among other things, stringent emission controls. Administrative agencies can bring actions for failure to comply with air pollution regulations or permits and generally enforce compliance through administrative, civil or criminal enforcement actions, which may result in fines, injunctive relief and imprisonment.

The New Source Performance Standards (“NSPS”) and National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (“NESHAPS”) programs under the Clean Air Act (“CAA”) impose specific requirements under both programs for compressors, controllers, dehydrators, storage tanks, natural gas processing plants, completions and certain other equipment. Periodic review and revision of these rules by federal and state agencies may require changes to our operations, including possible installation of new equipment to control emissions. We continuously evaluate the effect of new rules on our business.
 In May 2016, the EPA finalized rules to reduce methane emissions from new, modified or reconstructed sources in the oil and natural gas sector, although the rules are currently the subject of litigation and in June 2017, the EPA proposed a 2-year stay of the rules. In November 2016, the BLM issued final rules to reduce methane emissions from venting, flaring, and leaks during oil and gas operations on public lands, although the present administration published a rule in December 2017 that delays the implementation dates applicable to requirements under these rules. Several states, including Colorado and Pennsylvania, are pursuing similar measures to regulate emissions of methane from new and existing sources within the oil and natural gas source category. Furthermore, in September 2017, Utah proposed regulations implementing a new permit-by-rule system for emissions from new and existing oil and gas sources. In addition, in May 2016, the EPA finalized rules regarding criteria for aggregating multiple small surface sites into a single source for air-quality permitting purposes applicable to the oil and gas industry. This rule could cause small facilities, on an aggregate basis, to be deemed a major source, thereby triggering more stringent air permitting requirements. The EPA has also adopted new rules under the CAA that require the reduction of volatile organic compound emissions from certain fractured and refractured natural gas wells for which well completion operations are conducted and further require that most wells use reduced emission completions, also known as “green completions.” These regulations also establish specific new requirements regarding emissions from production-related wet seal and reciprocating compressors, and from pneumatic controllers and storage vessels. Compliance with these and other air pollution control and permitting requirements has the potential to delay the development of oil and natural gas projects and increase our costs of development, which costs could be significant.
 Clean Water Act.    The Clean Water Act (“CWA”) and analogous state laws restrict the discharge of pollutants, including produced waters and other oil and natural gas wastes, into waters of the United States, a term broadly defined to include, among other things, certain wetlands. Under the Clean Water Act, permits must be obtained for the discharge of pollutants into waters of the United States. The CWA provides for administrative, civil and criminal penalties for unauthorized discharges, both routine and accidental, of pollutants and of oil and hazardous substances. It imposes substantial potential liability for the costs of removal or remediation associated with discharges of oil or hazardous substances. State laws governing discharges to water also provide varying civil, criminal and administrative penalties and impose liabilities in the case of a discharge of petroleum or its derivatives, or other hazardous substances, into state waters. In addition, the EPA has promulgated regulations that may require permits to discharge storm water runoff, including discharges associated with construction activities. The CWA also prohibits the discharge of fill materials to regulated waters including wetlands without a permit. In addition, the EPA and the Army Corps of Engineers (“Corps”) released a rule to revise the definition of “waters of the United States” (“WOTUS”) for all Clean Water Act programs, which went into effect in August 2015. In October 2015, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit stayed the WOTUS rule nationwide pending further action of the court. In response to this decision, the EPA and the Corps resumed nationwide use of the agencies’ prior regulations defining the term “waters of the United States” and in June 2017 formally proposed to rescind the new WOTUS rules and promulgate the regulatory test that existed prior to the effective date of the new WOTUS rules.  Currently, regulations are being implemented as they were prior to the effective date of the new WOTUS rule. The new WOTUS rules, if they were to become effective and no rescinded, could significantly expand federal control of land and water resources across the U.S., triggering substantial additional permitting and regulatory requirements.
 Also, in 2016, the EPA finalized new wastewater pretreatment standards that prohibit onshore unconventional oil and gas extraction facilities from sending wastewater to publicly-owned treatment works, permitting several years until compliance will be enforced. This pending restriction of disposal options for hydraulic fracturing waste and other changes to CWA requirements may result in increased costs.
 Endangered Species Act.    The Endangered Species Act (“ESA”) was established to protect endangered and threatened species. Pursuant to that act, if a species is listed as threatened or endangered, restrictions may be imposed on activities adversely affecting that species’ habitat. Similar protections are offered to migratory birds under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act, and special protections are provided to bald and golden eagles under the Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act. The Company conducts operations on federal and other oil and natural gas leases that have species, such as raptors, that are listed and species, such as sage grouse, that could be listed as threatened or endangered under the ESA.  In the case of sage grouse, in October 2017, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service announced the beginning of a scoping process to solicit public comments on Greater Sage-Grouse land management that could warrant land plan use amendments relating to the sage grouse. On February 11, 2016, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service published a final policy which alters how it identifies critical habitat for endangered and threatened species. A critical habitat designation could result in further material restrictions to federal and private land use and could delay or prohibit land access or development. Moreover, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service continues its six-year effort to make listing decisions and critical habitat designations where necessary for over 250 species, as required under a 2011 settlement approved by the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, and many hundreds of additional anticipated listing decisions have already been identified beyond those recognized in the 2011 settlement. A small portion of the lands operated by the Company in Utah have been designated on behalf of the hookless cactus, but the Company does not expect this designation to interfere with development of the properties. If the Company were to have other portions of its leases designated as critical or suitable habitat for the hookless cactus or any other protected species, it may adversely impact the value of the affected leases.

Climate Change Legislation.    More stringent laws and regulations relating to climate change and greenhouse gases (“GHGs”), including methane and carbon dioxide, may be adopted and could cause the Company to incur material expenses in complying with them. In the absence of comprehensive federal legislation on GHG emission control, the EPA attempted to require the permitting of GHG emissions.  Although the Supreme Court struck down the permitting requirements as applicable to GHG emissions, it upheld the EPA’s authority to control GHG emissions when a permit is required due to emissions of other pollutants. The EPA has established GHG reporting requirements for sources in the petroleum and natural gas industry, requiring those sources to monitor, maintain records on, and annually report their GHG emissions. Ultra has submitted all required annual reports to date. Although the rule does not limit the amount of GHGs that can be emitted, it could require us to incur significant costs to monitor, keep records of, and report GHG emissions associated with our operations.
 The EPA has also adopted regulations that seek to reduce GHG emissions. For example, in August 2015, the EPA issued its final Clean Power Plan rules, which seek to reduce carbon dioxide emissions from power plants by 32 percent from 2005 levels by 2030; however, on February 9, 2016, the U.S. Supreme Court stayed the implementation of the plan while it is being challenged in court and on October 10, 2017, the EPA proposed the repeal of the Clean Power Plan. Furthermore, in May 2016, the EPA finalized rules that establish new controls for emissions of methane from new, modified or reconstructed sources in the oil and natural gas source category, including production, processing, transmission and storage activities. The rule includes first-time standards to address emissions of methane from equipment and processes across the source category, including hydraulically fractured oil and natural gas well completions.  These rules also are the subject of litigation and proposed stays.
 Although the current administration has announced the intention to withdraw, the U.S. is currently a party to the Paris Agreement, which aims to reduce global greenhouse emissions.  In addition to possible federal regulations, a number of states, individually and regionally, also are considering or have implemented GHG regulatory programs. These or other potential federal and state initiatives may result in so-called cap-and-trade programs, under which overall GHG emissions are limited and GHG emissions are then allocated and sold, and possibly other regulatory requirements, that could result in the Company incurring material expenses to comply, e.g., by being required to purchase or to surrender allowances for GHGs resulting from its operations. These regulatory initiatives also could adversely affect the marketability of the oil and natural gas the Company produces.
 Finally, it should be noted that some scientists have concluded that increasing concentrations of GHGs in the Earth’s atmosphere may produce climate changes that have significant physical effects, such as increased frequency and severity of storms, floods and other climatic events. If any such effects were to occur, they could adversely affect or delay demand for the oil or natural gas produced by our customers or otherwise cause us to incur significant costs in preparing for or responding to those effects.
 Worker Safety.    The Occupational Safety and Health Act (“OSHA”) and analogous state laws regulate the protection of the safety and health of workers. The OSHA hazard communication standard requires maintenance of information about hazardous materials used or produced in operations and provision of such information to employees. Other OSHA standards regulate specific worker safety aspects of our operations. Failure to comply with OSHA requirements can lead to the imposition of penalties. In December 2015, the U.S. Departments of Justice and Labor announced a plan to more frequently and effectively prosecute worker health and safety violations, including enhanced penalties.
 The Company believes that it is in substantial compliance with current applicable environmental and occupational health and safety laws and regulations and that continued compliance with existing requirements will not have a material adverse impact on the Company.
 Employees
 As of December 31, 2017, the Company had 166 full-time employees, including officers.
 Competition
 The oil and gas industry is intensely competitive, and we compete with other companies in our industry that have more extensive resources than we do or that may have other competitive advantages or disadvantages.  We compete with other companies in the acquisition of properties, in the search for and development of reserves, in the production and sale of natural gas and crude oil, and for the labor and equipment required to conduct our operations.  Our competitors include major oil and natural gas companies, other independent oil and natural gas companies, and individual producers and operators.
