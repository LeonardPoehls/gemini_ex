ITEM 1. BUSINESS
The Company
 
We are engaged in the onshore and offshore oil and gas business.
 
In March 2014, we entered into a farm out letter agreement with GulfSlope Energy, Inc. (“GulfSlope”) relating to certain prospects GulfSlope bid on at the Central Gulf of Mexico Lease Sale 231, located within 2.2 million acres of 3-D seismic licensed and interpreted by GulfSlope. Under the terms of the farm-out letter agreement, as amended in September 2015, we acquired contractual rights to a 20% working interest in five prospects for $10,000,000. We have agreed to pay our proportionate share of the net rental costs related to the prospects. GulfSlope will be the operator of record and shall have the right to negotiate all future joint operating agreements. GulfSlope conducted extensive seismic work on the prospects focusing on the high potential subsalt play at depths of 15,000’ to 25,000’ prior to acquiring them in the Federal Lease Sale.
 
In May 2016, we entered into a letter of intent with GulfSlope that sets out the terms and conditions of a farm-out arrangement to develop certain shallow-depth oil and gas prospects located on offshore Gulf of Mexico blocks currently leased by GulfSlope. The shallow prospects are located above 5,100 feet vertical depth on the Vermilion Area, South Addition Block 378 (“Canoe Shallow”) and Vermilion Area, South Addition Block 375 (“Selectron Shallow”, and collectively with Canoe Shallow, “Shallow Prospects”). We own a 70.7% working interest in the Shallow Prospects (with a third party owning a 16.8% working interest for which it has paid $400,000 to date and GulfSlope retaining a 12.5% working interest) which we acquired in exchange for (i) cash payments of $400,000, (ii) the payment of annual rental obligations of $63,147, and (iii) the agreement to fund, or cause to be funded, the costs for the drilling of two shallow wells to be commenced no later than December 31, 2017. GulfSlope is currently the Operator of the first two wells. We may farm-down our 70.7% working interests. Consummation of the transactions is subject to further negotiation, the execution and delivery by the parties of mutually acceptable definitive agreements to include a participation agreement and the joint operating agreement, and the satisfaction of certain additional conditions.
 
In January 2017, the Company entered into an asset purchase agreement with Sydson Energy, Inc. (“Sydson Energy”) and Sydson Resources, L.P. (“Sydson Resources” and collectively with Sydson Energy, “Sydson”), where Sydson assigned to us certain onshore oil and gas assets and interests and certain tangible assets and additionally, certain employees and a consultant of Sydson have agree to become employees and a consultant of the Company. Sydson is a private oil and gas company with land operations in Texas and Louisiana that has been in business since 1982. The oil and gas assets include the following:
 

● | In the Bayou Bouillon Field, St. Martin and Iberville Parishes, Louisiana, we acquired a 37.5% working interest in the Sugarberry South Project comprising 420 acres with a net revenue interest of 70%. The property has two existing wells which have tested at over 400 BOPD combined from two (2) productive zones above 2,100’ with an additional shallower zone behind pipe believed to contain approximately 30’ of oil pay and almost 60’ of gas pay. We expect to install production facilities and drill additional development wells in this fault block and to drill up to three exploratory wells in adjacent fault blocks targeted in the same zones. Through the Sydson transaction, we also are a party to letters of intent to acquire up to a 45% working interest in an additional 1,000+ acres in the Bayou Bouillon area based on a proprietary 55 square mile 3-D seismic survey that demonstrates updip potential in existing reservoirs at about 10,000’. The downdip wells in these same reservoirs have produced over 20 MMBO and 21 BCFG from 59 completions. Our partner in the Bayou Bouillon project, and the owner of a 50% working interest in the Bayou Bouillon acreage, is Thyssen Petroleum, USA, a privately held independent oil and gas exploration and production company based in Houston, Texas and Monaco, France.

● | In Texas, we acquired a 50% working interest in the undrilled acreage above 4,500’ in the West Tuleta Field, Bee County, Texas comprised of approximately 1,800 gross acres and 900 net acres with a net revenue interest of approximately 75%. The primary drilling objectives are the Vicksburg and Hockley sands which are structurally high on this acreage to historic downdip production from these sands totaling over 500,000 BO.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | In the adjacent Ray Field, also in Bee County, Texas, we acquired a 50% working interest in the undrilled, acreage on the Walton, Campbell, and Ray leases comprising approximately 75 gross acres with a net revenue interest of approximately 75%. The primary drilling objectives on this acreage are also the Vicksburg and Hockley sands updip to prior production, also above 3,700’.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | In other areas of Southeast Texas, we acquired an interest in a proprietary 85 square mile 3-D seismic survey targeting Lower Wilcox Sands at approximately 10,000’. There are eight currently defined and mapped prospects in which we intend to acquire leases that are apparent on the seismic data and match the geologic setting of three existing Lower Wilcox fields within the boundaries of the survey.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Northwest of that survey, we intend to acquire leases covering approximately 1,000 acres for horizontal projects above 6,000’ in the Austin Chalk and Buda Lime formation. These projects are adjacent to substantial prior production and contain both conventional and unconventional oil targets.

In connection with the asset acquisition, certain officers and employees of Sydson have become officers, a consultant and employees of the Company, including Michael J. Mayell as chief executive officer, James L. Gunderson as manager of land, Robert L. Goldstein as a geological consultant, and Lecia Alexander as controller. Certain other non-executive employees and consultants of Sydson became at-will employees of the Company. John B Connally III joined our board as chairman.
 
Mr. Mayell has over 45 years of experience in the oil and gas business. He began his career with Shell Oil Company in New Orleans, Louisiana in the drilling and production engineering groups responsible for drilling and producing fields both onshore and offshore South Louisiana. Mr. Mayell founded Sydson in 1982 and this entity has been in operation since that time. In 1985, Mr. Mayell co-founded The Meridian Resource Corporation (NYSE) and served as the president and chief operating officer of Meridian for over 20 years. Mr. Mayell received his Bachelor of Science degree in mechanical engineering from Clarkston University.
 
Mr. Connally presently serves as chairman of the Texas Lt. Governor’s Energy Advisory Board. Mr. Connally has significant oil and gas experience, both as a practicing lawyer and as an executive. Mr. Connally was a founding shareholder of Texas South and GulfSlope, and a founding director of Nuevo Energy, Inc, Endeavor International Corp, and Pure Energy Group (where he also served as chief executive officer) and Pure Gas Partners. Mr. Connally was a law partner with Baker Botts, and received both his Bachelor of Arts and JD degrees from the University of Texas.
 
Mr. Gunderson has held land positions in Chevron, Murphy, Cities, Ladd and Meridian. Mr. Gunderson has been with Sydson since 2009. Mr. Gunderson received a BBA degree in petroleum land management from the University of Oklahoma.
 
Mr. Goldstein has served as a consultant to Sydson for over 10 years and has over 40 years of experience in Gulf Coast geology interpretation. Mr. Goldstein has served as a geologist with Amerada Hess, Houston Oil and Minerals and Meridian. Mr. Goldstein received his Bachelor of Arts – Geology degree from Rutgers University and received his Master’s degree in Geology from Florida State University.
 
Mrs. Alexander began her career in accounting with Arthur Anderson before moving into corporate accounting in 1985. She later opened her consulting practice focusing on the healthcare and oil and gas industries and has been Sydson’s lead accountant since 2010. Mrs. Alexander received her Bachelor in Accountancy degree from the University of Mississippi in 1980.
 
In connection with the asset acquisition, the Company acquired a variety of proprietary seismic data, computer equipment, furniture and fixtures and other office equipment.
 
The consideration payable by the Company to Sydson and affiliates was (i) 100 million shares of Company common stock to Michael J. Mayell, (ii) (A) $250,000 through a promissory note due March 5, 2017 and (B) $1,250,000 through the payment by the Company of Sydson’s obligations attributable to retained working interests in the oil and gas prospects conveyed to the Company, to be paid by the Company at the time it pays its associated costs with respect to its ownership interests in such oil and gas prospects, (iii) carried interests to casing point for its working interests on the first well in each of the West Tuleta prospect, Ray Field prospect, one prospect under negotiation, and up to four wells in the Bayou Bouillon prospect to be paid by the Company at the time it pays its associated costs with respect to its ownership interests in such oil and gas prospects (such costs to the Company are estimated to be approximately $968,000, depending upon many factors outside of our control), and (iv) a payment of $500,000 for the seismic data at one prospect under negotiation after completion of the first well in such prospect.

Oil and Gas Industry
 
The oil and gas industry is a complex, multi-disciplinary sector that varies greatly across geographies. As a heavily regulated industry, operating conditions are subject to political regimes and changing legislation. Governments can either induce or deter investment in exploration and production, depending on legal requirements, fiscal and royalty structures and regulation. Beyond political considerations, exploration and production for hydrocarbons is an extremely risky business with multiple failure modes. Exploration and production wells require substantial capital investment and are long-term projects, sometimes exceeding twenty to thirty years. Regardless of the effort spent on an exploration or production prospect, success is difficult to attain. Even though modern equipment, including seismic equipment and advanced software, has helped geologists find producing structures and map reservoirs, they do not guarantee any outcome. Drilling is the only method to ultimately determine whether a prospect will be productive, and even then, many complications can arise during drilling (e.g., those relating to drilling depths, pressure, porosity, weather conditions, and the porosity and permeability of the formation and rock hardness).
 
Typically, there is a significant chance that exploratory wells will result in non-producing holes, leaving investors with the cost of seismic data and a dry well which can total millions of dollars. Even if oil or gas is produced from a particular well, there is always the possibility that treatment, at additional cost, may be required to make production commercially viable. Further, production profiles decline over time. In summary, oil and gas exploration and production is an industry with high risks and high entry barriers, but it is also potentially lucrative.
 
For any given rate of production and volume of hydrocarbons recovered, oil and gas prices determine the commercial feasibility of a project. Certain projects may become feasible with higher prices or, conversely, may falter with lower prices. Volatility in the price of oil, gas and other commodities has increased during the last few years, complicating the assessment of revenue projections. Most governments have enforced strict regulations to uphold high standards of environmental awareness; thus, holding companies to a high degree of responsibility vis-а-vis protecting the environment. Aside from such environmental factors, oil and gas drilling is often conducted near populated areas. For a company to be successful in its drilling endeavors, working relationships with local communities are crucial to promote business strategies and to avoid the repercussions of disputes that might arise over local business operations. At this time (October 31, 2016), the Company does not have any production or proved oil or gas reserves.
 
Governmental Regulation
 
The operator of the oil and gas operations will be subject to various federal, state, and local governmental regulations. Matters subject to regulation include discharge permits for materials used in drilling operations, drilling and abandonment bonds, reports concerning operations, the spacing of wells, pooling of properties, and taxation. From time to time, regulatory agencies have imposed price controls and limitations on production by restricting the rate of flow of oil and gas wells below actual production capacity in order to conserve supplies of oil and gas. The production, handling, storage, transportation, and disposal of oil and gas, by-products thereof, and other substances and materials produced or used in connection with oil and gas operations are also subject to regulation under federal, state, and local laws and regulations relating primarily to the protection of human health and the environment. State and local laws and regulations may affect the prices at which royalty owners are paid for their leases by requiring more stringent disclosure and certification requirements, adjusting interest rates for late payments, raising legal and administrative costs and imposing more costly default contractual terms. The requirements imposed by such laws and regulations are frequently changed and subject to interpretation, and we are unable to predict the ultimate cost of compliance with these requirements or their ultimate effect, if any, on the lessee to pay royalties.
 
Environmental laws provide for, among other things, restrictions and prohibitions on spills, releases, or emissions of various substances produced in association with oil and gas operations. The laws also require that wells and facility sites be operated, maintained, abandoned, and reclaimed to the satisfaction of the applicable regulatory authorities. Compliance with such laws can require significant expenditures and a breach may result in the imposition of fines and penalties, some of which may be material. Environmental legislation is evolving in a manner expected to result in stricter standards and enforcement, larger fines and liability, and potentially increased capital expenditures and operating costs. The discharge of oil or gas or other pollutants into the air, soil, or water may give rise to liabilities to governments and third parties and may require the operator to incur costs to remedy such discharge. In addition, the operator could incur fines, penalties or significant liability for damages, clean-up costs, and penalties in the event of discharges into the environment, environmental damage caused by the operator or previous owners of the property, or non-compliance with environmental laws or regulations. In addition to actions brought by governmental agencies, the operator could face actions brought by private parties or citizens groups. There can be no assurance that the forgoing will not increase the cost of production, development, or exploration activities for the operator or otherwise adversely affect the payment of royalties on the property.
 
Environmental Regulation
 
The operator of our oil and gas interests (we intend to operate many of our prospects) will be subject to numerous federal, state and local laws and regulations governing the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to environmental protection. Applicable U.S. federal environmental laws include, but are not limited to, the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (“CERCLA”), the Clean Water Act (“CWA”) and the Clean Air Act (“CAA”). These laws and regulations govern environmental cleanup standards, require permits for air, water, underground injection, solid and hazardous waste disposal and set environmental compliance criteria. In addition, state and local laws and regulations set forth specific standards for drilling wells, the maintenance of bonding requirements in order to drill or operate wells, the spacing and location of wells, the method of drilling and casing wells, the surface use and restoration of properties upon which wells are drilled, the plugging and abandoning of wells, and the prevention and cleanup of pollutants and other matters. Typically, operators maintain insurance against costs of clean-up operations, but may not be fully insured against all such risks. Additionally, Congress and federal and state agencies frequently revise the environmental laws and regulations, and any changes that result in delay or more stringent and costly permitting, waste handling, disposal and clean-up requirements for the oil and gas industry could have a significant impact on the operator’s costs, resulting in a negative impact on payment of royalties.

The environmental laws and regulations that could have a material impact on the oil and natural gas exploration and production industry, including on the operators of our future oil and gas interests, thereby indirectly impacting our business, including the following:
 
Hazardous Substances and Wastes. CERCLA, also known as the “Superfund law,” imposes liability, without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct, on certain classes of persons that are considered to be responsible for the release of a “hazardous substance” into the environment. These persons include the owner or operator of the disposal site or sites where the release occurred and companies that transported or disposed or arranged for the transport or disposal of the hazardous substances found at the site. Persons who are or were responsible for releases of hazardous substances under CERCLA may be subject to joint and several liabilities for the costs of cleaning up the hazardous substances that have been released into the environment and for damages to natural resources, and it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file corresponding common law claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the hazardous substances released into the environment.
Waste Discharge. The CWA and analogous state laws impose restrictions and strict controls with respect to the discharge of pollutants, including spills and leaks of oil and other substances, into waters of the United States. The discharge of pollutants into regulated waters is prohibited, except in accordance with the terms of a permit issued by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) or an analogous state agency. The CWA and regulations implemented thereunder also prohibit the discharge of dredge and fill material into regulated waters, including jurisdictional wetlands, unless authorized by an appropriately issued permit. Spill prevention, control and countermeasure requirements of federal laws require appropriate containment beams and similar structures to help prevent the contamination of navigable waters by a petroleum hydrocarbon tank spill, rupture or leak. In addition, the CWA and analogous state laws require individual permits or coverage under general permits for discharges of storm water runoff from certain types of facilities. Federal and state regulatory agencies can impose administrative, civil and criminal penalties as well as other enforcement mechanisms for noncompliance with discharge permits or other requirements of the CWA and analogous state laws and regulations.
Air Emissions. The CAA and associated state laws and regulations restrict the emission of air pollutants from many sources, including oil and gas operations. New facilities may be required to obtain permits before construction can begin, and existing facilities may be required to obtain additional permits and incur capital costs in order to remain in compliance. More stringent regulations governing emissions of toxic air pollutants and greenhouse gases (“GHGs”) have been developed by the EPA and may increase the costs of compliance for some facilities.
Oil Pollution Act. The Oil Pollution Act of 1990, as amended (“OPA”) and regulations thereunder impose a variety of requirements on “responsible parties” related to the prevention of oil spills and liability for damages resulting from such spills in United States waters. A “responsible party” includes the owner or operator of an onshore facility, pipeline or vessel, or the lessee or permittee of the area in which an offshore facility is located. OPA assigns liability to each responsible party for oil cleanup costs and a variety of public and private damages. While liability limits apply in some circumstances, a party cannot take advantage of liability limits if the spill was caused by gross negligence or willful misconduct or resulted from violation of a federal safety, construction or operating regulation. If the party fails to report a spill or to cooperate fully in the cleanup, liability limits likewise do not apply. Few defenses exist to the liability imposed by OPA. OPA imposes ongoing requirements on a responsible party, including the preparation of oil spill response plans and proof of financial responsibility to cover environmental cleanup and restoration costs that could be incurred in connection with an oil spill.
National Environmental Policy Act. Oil and natural gas exploration and production activities on federal lands are subject to the National Environmental Policy Act (“NEPA”). NEPA requires federal agencies, including the Department of Interior, to evaluate major agency actions having the potential to significantly impact the environment. The process involves the preparation of either an environmental assessment or environmental impact statement depending on whether the specific circumstances surrounding the proposed federal action will have a significant impact on the human environment. The NEPA process involves public input through comments which can alter the nature of a proposed project either by limiting the scope of the project or requiring resource-specific mitigation. NEPA decisions can be appealed through the court system by process participants. This process may result in delaying the permitting and development of projects, increase the costs of permitting and developing some facilities and could result in certain instances in the cancellation of existing leases.
Worker Safety. The Occupational Safety and Health Act (“OSHA”) and comparable state statutes regulate the protection of the health and safety of workers. The OSHA hazard communication standard requires maintenance of information about hazardous materials used or produced in operations and provision of such information to employees. Other OSHA standards regulate specific worker safety aspects. Failure to comply with OSHA requirements can lead to the imposition of penalties.
Safe Drinking Water Act. The Safe Drinking Water Act and comparable state statutes restrict the disposal, treatment or release of water produced or used during oil and gas development. Subsurface emplacement of fluids (including disposal wells or enhanced oil recovery) is governed by federal or state regulatory authorities that, in some cases, includes the state oil and gas regulatory authority or the state’s environmental authority. These regulations may increase the costs of compliance for some facilities.

Offshore Drilling. In 2011, the U.S. Department of Interior issued new rules designed to improve drilling and workplace safety in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, and various congressional committees began pursuing legislation to regulate drilling activities and increase liability. The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (“BOEM”), BSEE and Office of National Resources Revenue are expected to continue to issue new safety and environmental guidelines or regulations for drilling in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, and other regulatory agencies could potentially issue new safety and environmental guidelines or regulations in other geographic regions, and may take other steps that could increase the costs of exploration and production, reduce the area of operations and result in permitting delays. We are monitoring legislation and regulatory developments; however, it is difficult to predict the ultimate impact of any new guidelines, regulations or legislation. A prolonged suspension of drilling activity or permitting delays in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico and new regulations and increased liability for companies operating in this sector, whether or not caused by a new incident in the region, could adversely affect the business and planned operations of oil and gas companies.
 
Effect of Existing or Probable Governmental Regulations on our Business
 
We are subject to the following regulations of the SEC and applicable securities laws, rules and regulations:
 
Smaller Reporting Company. We are subject to the reporting requirements of Section 13 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), and subject to the disclosure requirements of Regulation S-K of the SEC, as a “smaller reporting company.” That designation relieves us of some of the informational requirements of Regulation S-K applicable to larger companies.
 
Sarbanes/Oxley Act. Except Section 302 and 404, we are also subject to the Sarbanes/Oxley Act of 2002. The Sarbanes/Oxley Act created a strong and independent accounting oversight board to oversee the conduct of auditors of public companies and strengthens auditor independence. It also requires steps to enhance the direct responsibility of senior members of management for financial reporting and for the quality of financial disclosures made by public companies; establishes clear statutory rules to limit, and to expose to public view, possible conflicts of interest affecting securities analysts; creates guidelines for audit committee members’ appointment, compensation and oversight of the work of public companies’ auditors; management’s assessment of our internal controls; prohibits certain insider trading during pension fund blackout periods; requires companies to evaluate internal controls and procedures; and establishes a federal crime of securities fraud, among other provisions. Compliance with the requirements of the Sarbanes/Oxley Act has and will continue to substantially impact our legal and accounting costs.
 
Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012. As a company with less than $1 billion in revenue during our last fiscal year, we qualify as an “emerging growth company” as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or the JOBS Act. As an emerging growth company, we may take advantage of specified reduced disclosure and other requirements that are otherwise applicable generally to public companies. These provisions include:

● | Only two years of audited financial statements in addition to any required unaudited interim financial statements with correspondingly reduced “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” disclosure.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Reduced disclosure about our executive compensation arrangements.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Not having to obtain non-binding advisory votes on executive compensation or golden parachute arrangements.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Exemption from the auditor attestation requirement in the assessment of our internal control over financial reporting.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
We may take advantage of these exemptions for up to five years or such earlier time that we are no longer an emerging growth company. We would cease to be an emerging growth company if we have more than $1 billion in annual revenue, we have more than $700 million in market value of our stock held by non-affiliates, or we issue more than $1 billion of non-convertible debt over a three-year period. We may choose to take advantage of some but not all of these reduced burdens. We have taken advantage of these reduced reporting burdens in this prospectus, and the information that we provide may be different than what you might get from other public companies in which you hold stock.
 
Exchange Act Reporting Requirements. We are subject to the reporting requirements of Section 14 and 16 of the Exchange Act, are required to file annual reports on SEC Form 10-K and quarterly reports on SEC Form 10-Q with the SEC on a regular basis, and will be required to timely disclose certain material events (e.g., changes in corporate control and acquisitions or dispositions of a significant amount of assets other than in the ordinary course of business) in a current report on SEC Form 8-K.
Competition
 
The Company is competing with other oil companies for oil and gas leases and concessions. The oil and gas industry is highly competitive in all of its phases, with competition for favorable producing royalties, overriding royalties, and good oil and gas leases being particularly intense. The Company believes that the exploration program, promised expenditures, geological and geophysical skill, and familiarity with an area of operations are primary competitive factors in the identification, selection, and acquisition of desirable leases. When attempting to purchase interests in such properties, the Company competes with independent operators and major oil companies, many of which companies possess and employ financial resources that allow them to obtain substantially greater technical and personnel resources than ours. Competitors may be able to evaluate and purchase a greater number of mineral rights or royalty interests than our financial or personnel resources permit. Competitors may also be able to pay more for prospects than we are able or willing to pay. If we are unable to compete successfully in these areas in the future, our future growth may be diminished or restricted.

Historical Background
 
The Company was incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on March 15, 2010, as “Inka Productions Corp.” The Company became an SEC reporting company in 2012, when a registration statement for its common stock was declared effective under the Exchange Act. At that time, the Company was engaged in the business of producing and performing traditional Peruvian dances in Peru and the United States. In September 2013, we changed our business to an oil and gas company focused primarily on properties in the Gulf Coast Region.
 
In September 2013, certain shareholders of the Company sold an aggregate of 7,900,000 shares of the Company’s common stock at a price of $0.001 per share to certain accredited investors, which resulted in a change of control and change of management. Following the change of control, in November 2013 the Company amended its certificate of incorporation to: (i) increase the Company’s authorized shares of common stock from 75,000,000 shares to 950,000,000 shares; (ii) authorize the issuance of 50,000,000 shares of blank check preferred stock; (iii) effect a 3-for-1 forward stock split of the Company’s common stock; and (iv) change the name of the Company from “INKA Productions, Corp.” to “Texas South Energy, Inc.”
 
In January 2017, we issued Mr. Mayell 100,000,000 shares of common stock in connection with the Sydson transaction, and Mr. Mayell was appointed president, chief executive officer and a director. Mr. Connally was appointed as chairman of the board and entered into an employment agreement whereby we issued him 65,100,000 shares of common stock. Mr. Askew resigned as an executive officer and as a director and entered into a consulting agreement pursuant to which he was issued 27,000,000 shares of common stock.
