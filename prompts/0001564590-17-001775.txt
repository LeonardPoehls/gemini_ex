ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
 Zynga Inc. (“Zynga” or “we” or the “Company”) is a leading provider of social game services. We develop, market and operate social games as live services played on mobile platforms such as Apple’s iOS operating system and Google’s Android operating system and social networking sites such as Facebook. Generally, all of our games are free to play, and we generate revenue through the in-game sale of virtual goods (“online game revenue”) and advertising services (“advertising revenue”).
 We are a pioneer and innovator of social games and a leader in making “play” a core activity on mobile devices and social networking sites. We believe our leadership position in social games is the result of our significant investment in our people, content, brand, technology and infrastructure. Our leadership position in social games is defined by the following:
  
• | Engaged and Global Community of Players. According to our analytics, in 2016, we had 64 million monthly active users (“MAUs”), of which 82% were mobile MAUs, and 19 million daily active users (“DAUs”), of which 84% were mobile DAUs.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Leading Portfolio of Social Games. We have developed a number of popular social games including games in our Slots, Words With Friends, Zynga Poker and FarmVille franchises.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Scalable Technology and Data. We leverage our technology to increase player engagement, cross-promote our portfolio of games, continually enhance existing games, launch new games and build the Zynga brand. We believe our scale results in network effects that deliver compelling value to our players, and we are committed to making significant investments to grow our community of players, their engagement and monetization over time. We believe that combining data analytics with creative game design enables us to create a superior player experience.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Consistent with our free-to-play business model, a small portion of our players have historically been payers. In 2016, we had approximately 1.1 million monthly unique payers (“MUPs”) (excluding payers of Daily Celebrity Crossword and Vegas Diamond Slots). Because the opportunity for social interactions increases as the number of players increases, we believe that maintaining and growing our overall number of players, including the number of players who may not purchase virtual goods, is important to the success of our business. As a result, we believe that the number of players who choose to purchase virtual goods will continue to constitute a small portion of our overall players.
 Our top three revenue-generating games historically have contributed a significant portion of our revenue, though the games that represent our top three revenue-generating games vary over time. Our top three revenue-generating games accounted for 44%, 53% and 60% of our online game revenue in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. In 2016, our top games were Zynga Poker, Wizard of Oz Slots and Hit It Rich! Slots.
 Our operations are headquartered in San Francisco, California, and we have several operating locations in the U.S. as well as various international office locations in India and Europe. We were originally organized in April 2007 and completed our initial public offering in December 2011. Our Class A common stock is listed on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the symbol “ZNGA.”
 Our Strategy and Core Commitments
 Our mission is to connect the world through games. In pursuit of our mission, we encourage entrepreneurship and intelligent risk-taking to produce great games and breakthrough innovations. Our goal is to create new games that engage mainstream global audiences.
 We encourage innovation, the creation of compelling game experiences and moving with a sense of urgency to capitalize on our opportunities for our success and the benefit of our players. These factors are critical to extending our leadership position as we seek to continue building successful franchises.

Our Social Games
 We design our social games to provide players with shared experiences that surprise and delight them. Our social games leverage the global connectivity and distribution of mobile platforms such as iOS and Android and social networking sites such as Facebook. Our games are free to play, span a number of categories and attract a community of players that is demographically and geographically diverse. We operate our games as live services and update them with fresh content and new features to make them more social, enhance player engagement and improve monetization. We analyze the data generated by our players’ game play and social interactions to guide the creation of new content and features. We use this ongoing feedback loop to keep our games compelling and enhance the player experience.
Our Content
  
• | Make Games Free, Accessible and Fun. We operate our games as live services that are available anytime and anywhere. We design our social games to provide players with easy access to shared experiences that delight, amuse and entertain, and we will continue to update our games on an ongoing basis with fresh content and new features to make them more social and fun for our players.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Sustain and Grow Live Franchises. We will continue to enhance the games that make up our market-leading franchises including Slots, Words With Friends, Zynga Poker and FarmVille. We regularly update our games after launch to encourage social interactions, add new content and features and seek to improve monetization.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Create New Games. We will continue to invest in building new games that we offer, as well as offer our games on multiple platforms so players can access our games on various devices.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Growth on Mobile. We believe there is a large opportunity to extend our brand and games to mobile platforms including iOS and Android. We continued our focus on mobile first games in 2016.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our Franchises
 We currently invest in the following game categories:
  
• | Social Casino. Includes Zynga Poker and our Slots games such as Hit It Rich! Slots, Wizard of Oz Slots, Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory Slots and Black Diamond Casino. Games in this category allow our players to experience the thrill of the win as they compete against friends and family in their favorite casino card and slots games. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Casual. Includes one of our most popular mobile game titles, Words With Friends, along with other casual offerings such as Wizard of Oz: Magic Match. In 2016, we became one of the first game companies to launch on the Apple App Store for iMessage with our Words With Friends iMessage app. Games in this category provide chances for friendly competition and allow our players to quickly connect with friends and family when they start a game and to build and enhance relationships throughout the game experience.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Action Strategy. Includes CSR Racing 2 and Dawn of Titans, which both launched in the second half of 2016. Games in this category emphasize skillful thinking and planning to achieve victory against other players.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Invest Express. Includes FarmVille, FarmVille 2, FarmVille 2: Country Escape and FarmVille: Tropic Escape. Games in this category allow our players to express their personalities by customizing the appearances of their game board.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We also may invest in other strategic categories in the future.
 Our Network
 We believe it is more fun for players to engage in our games with friends and family. Players also progress faster in our games by connecting with friends and other players in our network to instantly get what they need to complete quests, obtain virtual items and enhance their experience. We aspire to leverage our existing and new games to bring the best social playing experiences to our audience. Our network enables users to discover new games, find and connect with new friends, and challenge, cooperate and compete with friends, all of which drive higher user engagement for games on our network.
Our Revenues
 We generate revenue from the following live services:
 3

Virtual Goods and Paid Downloads
 Our primary revenue source is the sale of virtual currency that players use to buy in-game virtual goods. Virtual currency can also be earned for free through game play or by accepting promotional offers from our advertising partners. We also generate revenue when players purchase mobile game downloads.
Advertising and Licensing
 Our advertising services offer creative ways for marketers and advertisers to reach and engage with our players while allowing continued operation of a free-to-play business model. Our advertising offerings include:

• | Branded Virtual Goods and Sponsorships that integrate relevant advertising and messaging within game play;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Engagement Ads and Offers in which players can answer certain questions, watch-to-earn engagements or sign up for third party services to receive virtual currency and in-game bonuses;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Mobile Ads through ad-supported free versions of our mobile games;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Display Ads in our online web games that include banner advertisements; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Licensing our brands.
--+----------------------

 The goal of our engagement-based advertising and branded virtual goods and sponsorships is to enhance the player experience while delivering real value to advertisers.  
 Revenue and Profits
 For a description of our revenue and profits see the consolidated financial statements including Note 13 —“Geographic information” in the notes to the consolidated financial statements, which are incorporated by reference herein.
Marketing and Distribution
 We acquire our players through unpaid channels by cross-promoting new games to our existing audience and through paid advertising channels. We have been able to build a large community of players through the viral and sharing features provided by social networks, the social innovations in our games and the network effects of our games.
 We are committed to connecting with our players. We have fan pages, generally on Facebook, for each of our games to connect with our players, and we leverage various other forms of social media, including Twitter, to communicate with them. We periodically host live and online player events. We also advertise our games within other mobile applications and on social networks such as Facebook via various in-app advertising partners. In 2016 and 2015, we spent $132.5 million and $128.9 million, respectively, on these player acquisition costs.
 Agreements with Facebook, Apple and Google
 Our revenue depends on our continued ability to publish our games on mobile platforms, primarily iOS and Android, and on social networking sites, primarily Facebook. In 2016, we derived 46% of our revenue and 47% of our bookings from Apple, 29% of our revenue and 30% of our bookings from Google and 20% of our revenue and 18% of our bookings from Facebook. In 2016, an increasing number of our players played our games on mobile platforms.
 Our use of mobile platforms and data derived from mobile platforms is governed by the standard terms of service of the mobile platforms, primarily Apple and Google. Our use of the Facebook platform and data derived from Facebook is also governed by Facebook’s standard terms of service except for certain limited addenda. Any of these operators could unilaterally alter their terms of service in a manner that could harm our business. 
 Research and Development
 We believe continued investment in enhancing existing games and developing new games, and in software development tools and code modification, is important to attaining our strategic objectives. Our research and development expenses were $320.3 million, $361.9 million and $396.6 million in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, which included stock-based expense of $84.2 million, $94.5 million and $83.7 million, respectively, related to compensation for research and development personnel.

Technology and Tools
 We have invested extensively in developing our proprietary technology stack, which has the ability to handle sudden bursts of activity for millions of players over a short period of time with high levels of performance and reliability. Our proprietary technology stack includes datacenter and cloud computing management, a shared code base, network and cross-promotional features and proprietary data analytics. Our technology stack also supports the growth of our 2D and 3D game engines across the mobile business in addition to supporting high-level security and anti-fraud infrastructure. We are also investing in machine learning. We believe that investing in technology and tools, including the simulation technologies we acquired with our purchase of NaturalMotion, can create competitive advantages as well as extend our technology leadership. We will continue to innovate and optimize across our technology and tools to deliver cost-effective, high performance and highly available social games.
Intellectual Property
 Our business is significantly based on the creation, acquisition, use and protection of intellectual property. Some of this intellectual property is in the form of software code, patented technology and trade secrets that we use to develop our games and to enable them to run properly on multiple platforms. Other intellectual property we create includes product and feature names and audio-visual elements, including graphics, music, story lines and interface design.
 While most of the intellectual property we use is created by us, we have also acquired rights to proprietary intellectual property. We have also obtained rights to use intellectual property through licenses and service agreements with third parties. These licenses typically limit our use of intellectual property to specific uses and for specific time periods.
 We protect our intellectual property rights by relying on federal, state and common law protections, as well as contractual restrictions. We actively seek patent protection covering our inventions and we acquire patents we believe may be useful or relevant to our business. We control access to our proprietary technology by entering into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our employees and contractors, and confidentiality agreements with third parties. We also actively engage in monitoring and enforcement activities with respect to infringing uses of our trademarks, copyrights and domain names by third parties.
 In addition to these contractual arrangements, we also rely on a combination of trade secret, copyright, trademark, trade dress, domain name and patents to protect our games and other intellectual property. We typically own the copyright to the software code to our content, as well as the trademark for the brand or title under which our games are marketed. We pursue the registration of our domain names, copyrights, trademarks patents, and service marks in the U.S. and, for some, in locations outside the U.S. Our registered trademarks in the U.S. include “Zynga” and the names of our games, among others.
 Circumstances outside our control could pose a threat to our intellectual property rights. For example, effective intellectual property protection may not be available in the U.S. or other countries in which our games are distributed. Also, the efforts we have taken to protect our proprietary rights may not be sufficient or effective. Any significant impairment of our intellectual property rights could harm our business or our ability to compete. Also, protecting our intellectual property rights is costly and time-consuming. Any unauthorized disclosure or use of our intellectual property could make it more expensive to do business, thereby harming our operating results.
 Companies in the Internet, games, social media, technology and other industries may own large numbers of patents, copyrights and trademarks and may frequently request license agreements, threaten litigation or file suit against us based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. From time to time, we have faced, and we expect to face in the future, allegations by third parties, including our competitors and non-practicing entities, that we have infringed their copyrights, trademarks, patents and other intellectual property rights. As we face increasing competition and as our business grows, including into new areas, we will likely face more claims of infringement.
 Competition
 We face significant competition in all aspects of our business. Specifically, we compete for the leisure time, attention and discretionary spending of our players with other social game developers on the basis of a number of factors, including quality of player experience, brand awareness and reputation and access to distribution channels.
 We believe we compete favorably on these factors. However, our industry is evolving rapidly and is becoming increasingly competitive. Other developers of social games could develop more compelling content that competes with our social games and adversely affects our ability to attract and retain players and their entertainment time. These competitors, including companies of which we may not be currently aware, may take advantage of social networks, access to a large user base and their network effects to grow rapidly and virally.

Our competitors include:
  
• | Developers for Mobile and Web Games: We face competition from a number of competitors who develop mobile and web games. These competitors, some of which have significant financial, technical and other resources, greater name recognition and longer operating histories, may create games that appeal to our players. The mobile game sector specifically is characterized by frequent product introductions, rapidly emerging mobile platforms, new technologies and new mobile application storefronts. Some of these competitors include Electronic Arts (EA Mobile), Activision Blizzard (King Digital), Gameloft, Glu Mobile, Kabam, Jam City, Machine Zone, Pocket Gems, Rovio, Supercell, Playtika, DoubleDown and SG Interactive. Because our games are free to play, we compete primarily on the basis of player experience rather than price. We also expect new competitors to enter the market and existing competitors to allocate more resources to develop and market competing games and applications.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Other Game Developers: Our players may also play other games on personal computers and consoles, some of which include social features that compete with our social games and have community functions where game developers can engage with their players. Some of these competitors include Activision Blizzard, Electronic Arts, Riot Games, Sony, Ubisoft, Take-Two Interactive, Nintendo, SEGA and Disney.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Other Forms of Media and Entertainment: We compete more broadly for the leisure time and attention of our players with providers of other forms of Internet and mobile entertainment, including social networking, online casual entertainment and music. To the extent existing or potential players choose to read, watch or listen to online content or streaming video or radio, play interactive video games at home or on their computer or mobile devices rather than play social games, these content services pose a competitive threat.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Government Regulation
 We are subject to various federal, state and international laws and regulations that affect that affect companies conducting business on the Internet and mobile platforms, including those relating to privacy, use and protection of player and employee personal information and data (including the collection of data from minors), the Internet, behavioral tracking, mobile applications, content, advertising and marketing activities (including sweepstakes, contests and giveaways), and anti-corruption. Additional laws in all of these areas are likely to be passed in the future, which could result in significant limitations on or changes to the ways in which we can collect, use, host, store or transmit the personal information and data of our customers or employees, communicate with our players, and deliver products and services, or may significantly increase our compliance costs. As our business expands to include new uses or collection of data that are subject to privacy or security regulations, our compliance requirements and costs will increase and we may be subject to increased regulatory scrutiny.
 Some of our games and features are based upon traditional casino games, such as slots and poker. We have structured and operate these games and features with gambling laws in mind and believe that these games and features do not constitute gambling.
 Seasonality
 In 2016, approximately 26% of our revenue was derived from the “advertising and other” category. Advertising budgets are generally highest during the fourth quarter and decline significantly in the first quarter of the following year, which affects the revenues we derive from advertisements and offers in our games. Additionally, we generally experience increases in game downloads and resulting online games revenues in the fourth quarter and first quarter corresponding to increases in smartphone and tablet purchases during the holiday shopping season.
Employees
 Our future success depends upon the continued service of our key technical and management personnel and upon our ability to continue to attract and retain qualified employees, particularly our senior management team and highly skilled game designers, product managers and engineers. We currently have favorable employee relations, but the competition for technical personnel is intense, and the loss of key employees or the inability to hire such employees when needed could have a material adverse impact on our business and financial condition. As of December 31, 2016, we had 1,681 full-time employees.
Financial Information about Segments and Geographic Areas
 
We have one operating segment with one business activity, developing and monetizing social games.  Financial information about our one segment and geographic areas is incorporated into this section by reference to our consolidated financial statements including Note 13 —“Geographic information” in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.
