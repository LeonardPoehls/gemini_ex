Item 1 | Business.
-------+----------

 
We are a “shell company” as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), because we have no or nominal assets (other than cash) and no or nominal operations.
 
We intend to seek, investigate and, if such investigation warrants, engage in a business combination which may take the form of a “reverse merger” with a private entity whose business presents an opportunity for our stockholders. Our objectives discussed below are extremely general and are not intended to restrict our discretion. This discussion of the proposed business is not meant to be restrictive of our virtually unlimited discretion to search for and enter into potential business opportunities.
 
We have not yet entered into any definitive agreement, nor do we have any binding commitment or understanding to enter into or become engaged in a transaction.
 
We are not restricting our search for business combination candidates to any particular industry and will not restrict our potential candidate target companies to any specific business, industry or geographical location and, thus, may acquire any type of business. Further, we may acquire a venture which is in its preliminary or development stage, one which is already in operation, or in a more mature stage of its corporate existence. Accordingly, business opportunities may be available in many different industries and at various stages of development, all of which will make the task of comparative investigation and analysis of such business opportunities difficult and complex.
 
We believe that there are numerous businesses seeking the perceived benefits of a publicly registered corporation. These benefits are commonly thought to include the following: (i) the ability to use registered securities to acquire assets or businesses; (ii) increased visibility in the marketplace; (iii) ease of borrowing from financial institutions; (iv) improved stock trading efficiency; (v) shareholder liquidity; (vi) greater ease in subsequent capital raising; (vii) compensation of key employees through stock options; (viii) enhanced corporate image; and (ix) a presence in the United States capital market. We have not conducted market research and are not aware of statistical data to support the perceived benefits of a merger or acquisition transaction for the owners of a business opportunity.
 
Target companies interested in a business combination with our company may include the following: (i) a company for whom a primary purpose of becoming public is the use of its securities for the acquisition of other assets or businesses; (ii) a company which is unable to find an underwriter of its securities or is unable to find an underwriter of securities on terms acceptable to it; (iii) a company which desires to become public with less dilution of its common stock than would occur upon an underwriting; (iv) a company which believes that it will be able to obtain investment capital on more favorable terms after it has become public; (v) a foreign company which may wish an initial entry into the United States securities market; or (vi) a company seeking one or more of the other mentioned perceived benefits of becoming a public company.
 
We anticipate seeking out a target business through solicitation. Such solicitation may include personal contacts, newspaper or magazine advertisements, mailings and other distributions to law firms, accounting firms, investment bankers, financial advisors and similar persons, the use of one or more World Wide Web sites and similar methods. No estimate can be made as to the number of persons who will be contacted or solicited. Such persons will have no relationship to our management.
 
The analysis of new business opportunities will be undertaken by or under the supervision of our executive officers and directors, none of whom is a business analyst and it is not anticipated that outside consultants or advisors will be utilized to assist us in the analysis of qualified target companies.
 
A decision to participate in a specific business opportunity will be made based upon our analysis of the quality of the prospective business opportunity’s management and personnel, assets, the anticipated acceptability of products or marketing concepts, the merit of a proposed business plan, and numerous other factors which are difficult, if not impossible, to analyze using any objective criteria. We have unrestricted flexibility in seeking, analyzing and participating in potential business opportunities.

In our efforts to analyze potential acquisition targets, we will consider, among others, the following kinds of factors: (i) potential for growth, indicated by new technology, anticipated market expansion or new products; (ii) competitive position as compared to other firms of similar size and experience within the industry segment as well as within the industry as a whole; (iii) strength and diversity of management, either in place or scheduled for recruitment; (iv) capital requirements and anticipated availability of required funds, to be provided by our company or from operations, through the sale of additional securities, through joint ventures or similar arrangements or from other sources; (v) the cost of participation by our company as compared to the perceived tangible and intangible values and potentials; (vi) the extent to which the business opportunity can be advanced; and (vii) the accessibility of required management expertise, personnel, raw materials, services, professional assistance and other required items.
 
In applying the foregoing criteria, no one of which will be controlling, management will attempt to analyze all factors and circumstances and make a determination based upon reasonable investigative measures and available data. Potentially available business opportunities may occur in many different industries, and at various stages of development, all of which will make the task of comparative investigation and analysis of such business opportunities extremely difficult and complex. Due to our limited capital available for investigation, we may not discover or adequately evaluate adverse facts about the opportunity to be acquired.
 
In implementing a structure for a particular business acquisition, we may become a party to a merger, consolidation, reorganization, joint venture, or licensing agreement with another entity. We also may acquire stock or assets of an existing business. On the consummation of a transaction it is probable that the present management and stockholders of our company will no longer be in control of the company. In addition, our officers and directors, as part of the terms of the acquisition transaction, likely will be required to resign and be replaced by one or more new officers and directors without a vote of our stockholders.
 
It is anticipated that any securities issued in any such reorganization would be issued in reliance upon exemption from registration under applicable federal and state securities laws. In some circumstances, however, as a negotiated element of a transaction, we may agree to register all or a part of such securities immediately after the transaction is consummated or at specified times thereafter. The issuance of substantial additional securities and their potential sale into any trading market which may develop in our securities may have a depressive effect on that market.
 
While the actual terms of a transaction to which we may be a party cannot be predicted, it may be expected that the parties to the business transaction will find it desirable to avoid the creation of a taxable event and thereby structure the acquisition as a “tax-free” reorganization under Sections 351 or 368 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.
 
With respect to any merger or acquisition, negotiations with target company management are expected to focus on the percentage of our company which the target company stockholders would acquire in exchange for all of their shareholdings in the target company. Depending upon, among other things, the target company’s assets and liabilities, our stockholders will in all likelihood hold a substantially lesser percentage ownership interest in our company following any merger or acquisition. The percentage ownership may be subject to significant reduction in the event we acquire a target company with substantial assets. Any merger or acquisition effected by us can be expected to have a significant dilutive effect on the percentage of shares held by our stockholders at such time.
 
We will participate in a business opportunity only after the negotiation and execution of appropriate agreements. Although the terms of such agreements cannot be predicted, generally such agreements will require certain representations and warranties of the parties thereto, will specify certain events of default, will detail the terms of closing and the conditions which must be satisfied by the parties prior to and after such closing, will outline the manner of bearing costs, including costs associated with our attorneys and accountants.
 
We are subject to all of the reporting obligations required by Section 13(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), including the obligation to file audited financial statements of any target business we may acquire as part of our Current Report on Form 8-K to be filed with the SEC upon consummation of a merger or acquisition. If such audited financial statements are not available at closing, or within time parameters necessary to ensure our compliance with the requirements of the Exchange Act, or if the audited financial statements provided do not conform to the representations made by the target company, the closing documents may provide that the proposed transaction will be voidable at the discretion of our present management.

It is anticipated that the investigation of specific business opportunities and the negotiation, drafting and execution of relevant agreements, disclosure documents and other instruments will require substantial management time and attention and substantial costs for accountants, attorneys and others. If a decision is made not to participate in a specific business opportunity, the costs theretofore incurred in the related investigation would not be recoverable. Furthermore, even if an agreement is reached for the participation in a specific business opportunity, the failure to consummate that transaction may result in the loss to the Registrant of the related costs incurred.
 
Many states have enacted statutes, rules and regulations limiting the sale of securities of “blank check” companies in their respective jurisdictions. Management does not intend to undertake any efforts to cause a market to develop in our securities, either debt or equity, until we have successfully concluded a business combination. We intend to comply with the periodic reporting requirements of the Exchange Act for so long as we are subject to those requirements.
 
Competition
 
We will remain an insignificant participant among the firms which engage in the acquisition of business opportunities. There are many established venture capital and financial concerns which have significantly greater financial and personnel resources and technical expertise than us. In view of our limited financial resources and limited management availability, we may be at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors.
Employees
 
We presently have no employees. Vassili Oxenuk our Chief Executive Officer and President, is engaged in outside business activities and anticipates that he will devote to our business a limited time until the acquisition of a successful business opportunity has been identified. We expect no significant changes in the number of our employees other than such changes, if any, incident to a business combination.
Our Principal Office
 
Our principal office is located at 2770 S. Maryland Pkwy, Suite 314, Las Vegas, Nevada 89109. Our telephone number is (702) 731-3535.
 
Change in Control
 
In March 2017, Soledad Bayazit, our then Chief Executive Officer, President, sole director and the owner of 20,701,571 of our shares of common stock, representing approximately 90.28% of our outstanding shares of common stock, sold all 20,701,571 shares of common stock to Vassili Oxenuk, for a purchase price of $300,000, of which $150,000 is payable on the second day following the filing of a Report on Form 8-K with respect to the completion of a reverse acquisition by us. In addition, Ms. Bayazit forgave the payment of the indebtedness to her under our 12% secured promissory note due January 12, 2012 in the principal amount of $1,201,000, together with accrued interest thereon of approximately $672,231, together with advances in the aggregate amount of $154,460.
History
 
American Retail Group, Inc., formerly known as Resource Acquisition Group, Inc. (the “Company”), is a Nevada corporation organized on January 27, 1934.  
 
Effective February 11, 2011 the Company acquired 100% of the stock of American Retail Group, Inc., a Nevada corporation (“ARG”), which at that time owned 100% of the outstanding equity of TOO “SM Market Retail” (“SM Market”), a limited liability company organized under the laws of Kazakhstan (the “2011 Share Exchange”). Pursuant to the share exchange agreement, on February 11, 2011, stockholders of ARG transferred 100% of the outstanding shares of its common stock held by them, in exchange for an aggregate of 20,000,000 newly issued shares of the Company’s common stock. The shares of common stock of the Company acquired by the stockholders of ARG constituted approximately 96.1% of the Company’s issued and outstanding common stock after giving effect to the 2011 Share Exchange.

American Retail Group, Inc. was incorporated in Las Vegas, Nevada on February 16, 2010. Effective March 10, 2010, the Company consummated a share exchange with the owners of SM Market (the “2010 Share Exchange”). As a result of the share exchange, ARG acquired all of the outstanding equity of SM Market in exchange for issuance of 12,000,000 shares of its common stock (the “Shares”).
 
Effective April 1, 2011, ARG merged with and into the Company. In connection with the merger the name of the Company was changed from Resource Acquisition Group, Inc. to American Retail Group, Inc.
 
On July 22, 2011, the Company and the former owners of SM Market entered into a Rescission Agreement whereby the parties agreed to rescind the 2010 Share Exchange and to release each other from any potential claims (the “Rescission”). The parties have determined that it is in their best interest to rescind the 2010 Share Exchange and unwind the transaction. Under the Rescission Agreement, all outstanding equity of SM Market was to be returned to the former owners of SM Market and the Shares were to be returned to the Company. In connection with the rescission of the 2010 Share Exchange, El Investment Corp. agreed to return to the Company for cancellation 11,201,603 shares of common stock held by it. The Rescission was completed on September 2, 2011.
 
As a result of the Rescission, the Company ceased to be engaged in the supermarket business in Kazakhstan and returned to be a shell company as such term is defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”).
 
Our common stock was previously registered under, and we were subject to the reporting requirements of, the Exchange Act until we terminated our registration by filing a Form 15 on April 14, 2016.
