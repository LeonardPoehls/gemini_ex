ITEM 1.    BUSINESS.
Overview
Our business consists primarily of the electric transmission operations of our Regulated Operating Subsidiaries. In 2002, ITC Holdings was incorporated in the State of Michigan for the purpose of acquiring ITCTransmission. ITCTransmission was originally formed in 2001 as a subsidiary of DTE Electric, an electric utility subsidiary of DTE Energy, and was acquired in 2003 by ITC Holdings. METC was originally formed in 2001 as a subsidiary of Consumers Energy, an electric and gas utility subsidiary of CMS Energy Corporation, and was acquired in 2006 by ITC Holdings. ITC Midwest was formed in 2007 by ITC Holdings to acquire the transmission assets of IP&L in December 2007. ITC Great Plains was formed in 2006 by ITC Holdings and became a FERC-jurisdictional entity in 2009. ITC Interconnection was formed in 2014 by ITC Holdings and became a FERC-jurisdictional entity in June 2016 after acquiring certain transmission assets from a merchant generating company and placing a newly constructed transmission line in service. We own and operate high-voltage systems in Michigan’s Lower Peninsula and portions of Iowa, Minnesota, Illinois, Missouri, Kansas and Oklahoma that transmit electricity from generating stations to local distribution facilities connected to our systems.
Our business strategy is to own, operate, maintain and invest in transmission infrastructure in order to enhance system integrity and reliability, reduce transmission constraints and support new generating resources to interconnect to our transmission systems. We also are pursuing development projects not within our existing systems, which are also intended to improve overall grid reliability, reduce transmission constraints and facilitate interconnections of new generating resources, as well as enhance competitive wholesale electricity markets.
As electric transmission utilities regulated by the FERC, our Regulated Operating Subsidiaries earn revenues for the use of their electric transmission systems by our customers, which include investor-owned utilities, municipalities, cooperatives, power marketers and alternative energy suppliers. As independent transmission companies, our Regulated Operating Subsidiaries are subject to rate regulation only by the FERC. The rates charged by our Regulated Operating Subsidiaries are established using cost-based formula rates, as discussed in “Item 7 Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Cost-Based Formula Rates with True-Up Mechanism.”
The Merger
On February 9, 2016, ITC Holdings entered into the Merger Agreement with Fortis, FortisUS and Merger Sub. On April 20, 2016, Fortis reached a definitive agreement with a subsidiary of GIC for GIC to acquire an indirect 19.9% equity interest in ITC Holdings upon completion of the Merger. On October 14, 2016, ITC Holdings and Fortis completed the Merger contemplated by the Merger Agreement. On the same date, the common shares of ITC Holdings were delisted from the NYSE and the common shares of Fortis were listed and began trading on the NYSE. Fortis continues to have its shares listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange. As a result of the Merger, Merger Sub merged with and into ITC Holdings with ITC Holdings continuing as the surviving corporation and becoming a majority owned indirect subsidiary of Fortis. In the Merger, ITC Holdings shareholders received $22.57 in cash and 0.7520 Fortis common shares for each share of common stock of ITC Holdings. For a discussion of various risks relating to the Merger, see “Item 1A Risk Factors — Risks Relating to the Merger.” Refer to Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for further details on the Merger.
Development of Business
We are actively developing transmission infrastructure required to meet reliability needs and energy policy objectives. Our long-term growth plan includes continued investment in current transmission systems, generator interconnections and our ongoing development projects. Refer to “Item 7 Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Capital Investment and Operating Results Trends” for additional details about our long-term capital investments. Refer to the discussion of risks associated with our strategic development opportunities in “Item 1A Risk Factors.”
We expect to invest approximately $2.8 billion from 2017 through 2021 at our Regulated Operating Subsidiaries. Included in this amount are capital expenditures to (1) maintain and replace the current transmission infrastructure, (2) enhance system integrity and reliability and accommodate load growth and (3) develop and build regional transmission infrastructure, including additional transmission facilities that will provide interconnection opportunities for generating facilities.

Development Projects
Through our merchant and international activities, we are actively pursuing projects to upgrade the existing transmission grid and regional transmission facilities, primarily to improve overall grid reliability, reduce transmission constraints, enhance competitive markets and facilitate interconnections of new generating resources, including wind generation and other renewable resources necessary to achieve state and federal policy goals. Additionally, we may pursue other non-traditional transmission investment opportunities not described above.
Segments
We have one reportable segment consisting of our Regulated Operating Subsidiaries. Additionally, we have other subsidiaries focused primarily on business development activities and a holding company whose activities include corporate debt financings and certain other corporate activities. A more detailed discussion of our reportable segment, including financial information about the segment, is included in Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements.
Operations
As transmission-only companies, our Regulated Operating Subsidiaries function as conduits, allowing for power from generators to be transmitted to local distribution systems either entirely through their own systems or in conjunction with neighboring transmission systems. Third parties then transmit power through these local distribution systems to end-use consumers. The transmission of electricity by our Regulated Operating Subsidiaries is a central function to the provision of electricity to residential, commercial and industrial end-use consumers. The operations performed by our Regulated Operating Subsidiaries fall into the following categories:

• | asset planning;


• | engineering, design and construction;


• | maintenance; and


• | real time operations.

Asset Planning
The Asset Planning group uses detailed system models and load forecasts to develop our system expansion capital plans. Expansion capital plans identify projects that would address potential future reliability issues and/or produce economic savings for customers by eliminating constraints. 
The Asset Planning group works closely with MISO and SPP in the development of our system expansion capital plans by performing technical evaluations and detailed studies. As the regional planning authorities, MISO and SPP approve regional system improvement plans, which include projects to be constructed by their members, including our MISO Regulated Operating Subsidiaries and ITC Great Plains.
Engineering, Design and Construction
The Engineering, Design and Construction group is responsible for design, equipment specifications, maintenance plans and project engineering for capital, operation and maintenance work. We work with outside contractors to perform various aspects of our engineering, design and construction, but retain internal technical experts who have experience with respect to the key elements of the transmission system such as substations, lines, equipment and protective relaying systems.
Maintenance
We develop and track preventive maintenance plans to promote safe and reliable systems. By performing preventive maintenance on our assets, we can minimize the need for reactive maintenance, resulting in improved reliability. Our Regulated Operating Subsidiaries contract with Utility Lines Construction Services, Inc. (“ULCS”), which is a division of Asplundh Tree Expert Co., to perform the majority of their maintenance. The agreement with ULCS provides us with access to an experienced and scalable workforce with knowledge of our system at an established rate.

Real Time Operations
System Operations — From our operations facility in Novi, Michigan, transmission system operators continuously monitor the performance of the transmission systems of our Regulated Operating Subsidiaries, using software and communication systems to perform analysis to plan for contingencies and maintain security and reliability following any unplanned events on the system. Transmission system operators are also responsible for the switching and protective tagging function, taking equipment in and out of service to ensure capital construction projects and maintenance programs can be completed safely and reliably. 
Local Balancing Authority Operator — Under the functional control of MISO, ITCTransmission and METC operate their electric transmission systems as a combined Local Balancing Authority (“LBA”) area, known as the Michigan Electric Coordinated Systems (“MECS”). From our operations facility in Novi, Michigan, our employees perform the LBA functions as outlined in MISO’s Balancing Authority Agreement. These functions include actual interchange data administration and verification as well as MECS LBA area emergency procedure implementation and coordination. ITC Midwest and ITC Great Plains are not responsible for LBA functions for their respective assets.
Operating Contracts
Our Regulated Operating Subsidiaries have various operating contracts, including numerous interconnection agreements with generation and transmission providers that address terms and conditions of interconnection. The following significant agreements exist at our Regulated Operating Subsidiaries:
ITCTransmission
DTE Electric operates the electric distribution system to which ITCTransmission’s transmission system connects. A set of three operating contracts sets forth the terms and conditions related to DTE Electric’s and ITCTransmission’s ongoing working relationship. These contracts include the following:
Master Operating Agreement. The Master Operating Agreement (the “MOA”), dated as of February 28, 2003, governs the primary day-to-day operational responsibilities of ITCTransmission and DTE Electric and will remain in effect until terminated by mutual agreement of the parties (subject to any required FERC approvals) unless earlier terminated pursuant to its terms. The MOA identifies the control area coordination services that ITCTransmission is obligated to provide to DTE Electric. The MOA also requires DTE Electric to provide certain generation-based support services to ITCTransmission.
Generator Interconnection and Operation Agreement. DTE Electric and ITCTransmission entered into the Generator Interconnection and Operation Agreement (the “GIOA”), dated as of February 28, 2003, in order to establish, re-establish and maintain the direct electricity interconnection of DTE Electric’s electricity generating assets with ITCTransmission’s transmission system for the purposes of transmitting electric power from and to the electricity generating facilities. Unless otherwise terminated by mutual agreement of the parties (subject to any required FERC approvals), the GIOA will remain in effect until DTE Electric elects to terminate the agreement with respect to a particular unit or until a particular unit ceases commercial operation.
Coordination and Interconnection Agreement. The Coordination and Interconnection Agreement (the “CIA”), dated as of February 28, 2003, governs the rights, obligations and responsibilities of ITCTransmission and DTE Electric regarding, among other things, the operation and interconnection of DTE Electric’s distribution system and ITCTransmission’s transmission system, and the construction of new facilities or modification of existing facilities. Additionally, the CIA allocates costs for operation of supervisory, communications and metering equipment. The CIA will remain in effect until terminated by mutual agreement of the parties (subject to any required FERC approvals).
METC
Consumers Energy operates the electric distribution system to which METC’s transmission system connects. METC is a party to a number of operating contracts with Consumers Energy that govern the operations and maintenance of its transmission system. These contracts include the following:
Amended and Restated Easement Agreement. Under the Amended and Restated Easement Agreement (the “Easement Agreement”), dated as of April 29, 2002 and as further supplemented, Consumers Energy provides METC with an easement to the land, which we refer to as premises, on which a majority of METC’s transmission towers, poles, lines and other transmission facilities used to transmit electricity at voltages of at least 120 kV are located, which we refer to collectively as the facilities. Consumers Energy retained for itself 
7

the rights to, and the value of activities associated with, all other uses of the premises and the facilities covered by the Easement Agreement, such as for distribution of electricity, fiber optics, telecommunications, gas pipelines and agricultural uses. Accordingly, METC is not permitted to use the premises or the facilities covered by the Easement Agreement for any purposes other than to provide electric transmission and related services, to inspect, maintain, repair, replace and remove electric transmission facilities and to alter, improve, relocate and construct additional electric transmission facilities. The easement is further subject to the rights of any third parties that had rights to use or occupy the premises or the facilities prior to April 1, 2001 in a manner not inconsistent with METC’s permitted uses.
METC pays Consumers Energy annual rent of $10 million, in equal quarterly installments, for the easement and related rights under the Easement Agreement. Although METC and Consumers Energy share the use of the premises and the facilities covered by the Easement Agreement, METC pays the entire amount of any rentals, property taxes, inspection fees and other amounts required to be paid to third parties with respect to any use, occupancy, operations or other activities on the premises or the facilities and is generally responsible for the maintenance of the premises and the facilities used for electric transmission at its expense. METC also must maintain commercial general liability insurance protecting METC and Consumers Energy against claims for personal injury, death or property damage occurring on the premises or the facilities and pay for all insurance premiums. METC is also responsible for patrolling the premises and the facilities by air at its expense at least annually and to notify Consumers Energy of any unauthorized uses or encroachments discovered. METC must indemnify Consumers Energy for all liabilities arising from the facilities covered by the Easement Agreement.
METC must notify Consumers Energy before altering, improving, relocating or constructing additional transmission facilities covered by the Easement Agreement. Consumers Energy may respond by notifying METC of reasonable work and design restrictions and precautions that are needed to avoid endangering existing distribution facilities, pipelines or communications lines, in which case METC must comply with these restrictions and precautions. METC has the right at its own expense to require Consumers Energy to remove and relocate these facilities, but Consumers Energy may require payment in advance or the provision of reasonable security for payment by METC prior to removing or relocating these facilities, and Consumers Energy need not commence any relocation work until an alternative right-of-way satisfactory to Consumers Energy is obtained at METC’s expense.
The term of the Easement Agreement runs through December 31, 2050 and is subject to 10 automatic 50-year renewals after that time unless METC provides one year’s notice of its election not to renew the term. Consumers Energy may terminate the Easement Agreement 30 days after giving notice of a failure by METC to pay its quarterly installment if METC does not cure the non-payment within the 30-day notice period. At the end of the term or upon any earlier termination of the Easement Agreement, the easement and related rights terminate and the transmission facilities revert to Consumers Energy.
Amended and Restated Operating Agreement. Under the Amended and Restated Operating Agreement (the “Operating Agreement”), dated as of April 29, 2002, METC agrees to operate its transmission system to provide all transmission customers with safe, efficient, reliable and nondiscriminatory transmission service pursuant to its tariff. Among other things, METC is responsible under the Operating Agreement for maintaining and operating its transmission system, providing Consumers Energy with information and access to its transmission system and related books and records, administering and performing the duties of control area operator (that is, the entity exercising operational control over the transmission system) and, if requested by Consumers Energy, building connection facilities necessary to permit interaction with new distribution facilities built by Consumers Energy. Consumers Energy has corresponding obligations to provide METC with access to its books and records and to build distribution facilities necessary to provide adequate and reliable transmission services to wholesale customers. Consumers Energy must cooperate with METC as METC performs its duties as control area operator, including by providing reactive supply and voltage control from generation sources or other ancillary services and reducing load. The Operating Agreement is effective through 2050 and is subject to 10 automatic 50-year renewals after that time, unless METC provides one year’s notice of its election not to renew.
Amended and Restated Purchase and Sale Agreement for Ancillary Services. The Amended and Restated Purchase and Sale Agreement for Ancillary Services (the “Ancillary Services Agreement”) is dated as of April 29, 2002. Since METC does not own any generating facilities, it must procure ancillary services from third party suppliers, such as Consumers Energy. Currently, under the Ancillary Services Agreement, METC pays 
8

Consumers Energy for providing certain generation based services necessary to support the reliable operation of the bulk power grid, such as voltage support and generation capability and capacity to balance loads and generation. METC is not precluded from procuring these ancillary services from third party suppliers when available. The Ancillary Services Agreement is subject to rolling one-year renewals starting May 1, 2003, unless terminated by either METC or Consumers Energy with six months prior written notice.
Amended and Restated Distribution-Transmission Interconnection Agreement. The Amended and Restated Distribution-Transmission Interconnection Agreement (the “DT Interconnection Agreement”), dated April 1, 2001 and most recently amended and restated effective as of January 1, 2015, provides for the interconnection of Consumers Energy’s distribution system with METC’s transmission system and defines the continuing rights, responsibilities and obligations of the parties with respect to the use of certain of their own and the other party’s properties, assets and facilities. METC agrees to provide Consumers Energy interconnection service at agreed-upon interconnection points, and the parties have mutual responsibility for maintaining voltage and compensating for reactive power losses resulting from their respective services. The DT Interconnection Agreement is effective so long as any interconnection point is connected to METC, unless it is terminated earlier by mutual agreement of METC and Consumers Energy.
Amended and Restated Generator Interconnection Agreement. The Amended and Restated Generator Interconnection Agreement (the “Generator Interconnection Agreement”), dated as of April 29, 2002 and most recently amended effective as of October 1, 2016, specifies the terms and conditions under which Consumers Energy and METC maintain the interconnection of Consumers Energy’s generation resources and METC’s transmission assets. The Generator Interconnection Agreement is effective either until it is replaced by any MISO-required contract, or until mutually agreed by METC and Consumers Energy to terminate, but not later than the date that all listed generators cease commercial operation.
ITC Midwest
IP&L operates the electric distribution system to which ITC Midwest’s transmission system connects. ITC Midwest is a party to a number of operating contracts with IP&L that govern the operations and maintenance of its transmission system. These contracts include the following:
Distribution-Transmission Interconnection Agreement. The Distribution-Transmission Interconnection Agreement (the “DTIA”), dated as of December 17, 2007 and amended and restated effective as of December 1, 2016, governs the rights, responsibilities and obligations of ITC Midwest and IP&L, with respect to the use of certain of their own and the other parties’ property, assets and facilities and the construction of new facilities or modification of existing facilities. Additionally, the DTIA sets forth the terms pursuant to which the equipment and facilities and the interconnection equipment of IP&L will continue to connect ITC Midwest’s facilities through which ITC Midwest provides transmission service under the MISO Open Access Transmission, Energy and Operating Reserve Markets Tariff. The DTIA will remain in effect until terminated by mutual agreement by the parties (subject to any required FERC approvals) or as long as any interconnection point of IP&L is connected to ITC Midwest’s facilities, unless modified by written agreement of the parties.
Large Generator Interconnection Agreement. ITC Midwest, IP&L and MISO entered into the Large Generator Interconnection Agreement (the “LGIA”), dated as of December 20, 2007 and amended as of August 6, 2013, in order to establish, re-establish and maintain the direct electricity interconnection of IP&L’s electricity generating assets with ITC Midwest’s transmission system for the purposes of transmitting electric power from and to the electricity generating facilities. The LGIA will remain in effect until terminated by ITC Midwest or until IP&L elects to terminate the agreement if a particular unit ceases commercial operation for three consecutive years.
Operations Services Agreement For 34.5 kV Transmission Facilities. ITC Midwest and IP&L entered into the Operations Services Agreement for 34.5 kV Transmission Facilities (the “OSA”), effective as of January 1, 2011, under which IP&L performs certain operations functions for ITC Midwest’s 34.5 kV transmission system on behalf of ITC Midwest. The OSA provides that when ITC Midwest upgrades 34.5 kV facilities to higher operating voltages it may notify IP&L of the change and the OSA is no longer applicable to those facilities. The OSA will remain in full force and effect until December 31, 2015 and will extend automatically from year to year thereafter until terminated by either party upon not less than one year prior written notice to the other party.

ITC Great Plains
Amended and Restated Maintenance Agreement. Mid-Kansas Electric Company LLC (“Mid-Kansas”) and ITC Great Plains have entered into a Maintenance Agreement (the “Mid-Kansas Agreement”), dated as of August 24, 2010, and most recently amended effective as of June 1, 2015, pursuant to which Mid-Kansas has agreed to perform various field operations and maintenance services related to certain ITC Great Plains facilities. The Mid-Kansas Agreement has an initial term of 10 years and automatic 10-year renewals unless terminated (1) due to a breach by the non-terminating party following notice and failure to cure, (2) by mutual consent of the parties, or (3) by ITC Great Plains under certain limited circumstances. Services must continue to be provided for at least six months subsequent to the termination date in any case.
Regulatory Environment
Many regulators and public policy makers support the need for further investment in the transmission grid. The growth and changing mix of electricity generation, wholesale power sales and consumption combined with historically inadequate transmission investment have resulted in significant transmission constraints across the United States and increased stress on aging equipment. These problems will continue without increased investment in transmission infrastructure. Transmission system investments can also increase system reliability and reduce the frequency of power outages. Such investments can reduce transmission constraints and improve access to lower cost generation resources, resulting in a lower overall cost of delivered electricity for end-use consumers. After the 2003 blackout that affected sections of the Northeastern and Midwestern United States and Ontario, Canada, the Department of Energy (the “DOE”) established the Office of Electric Transmission and Distribution (now the Office of Electricity Delivery and Energy Reliability), focused on working with reliability experts from the power industry, state governments and their Canadian counterparts to improve grid reliability and increase investment in the country’s electric infrastructure. In addition, the FERC has signaled its desire for substantial new investment in the transmission sector by implementing various financial and other incentives.
The FERC has also issued orders to promote non-discriminatory transmission access for all transmission customers. In the United States, electric transmission assets are predominantly owned, operated and maintained by utilities that also own electricity generation and distribution assets, known as vertically integrated utilities. The FERC has recognized that the vertically-integrated utility model inhibits the provision of non-discriminatory transmission access and, in order to alleviate this potential discrimination, the FERC has mandated that all transmission systems over which it has jurisdiction must be operated in a comparable, non-discriminatory manner such that any seller of electricity affiliated with a transmission owner (“TO”) or operator is not provided with preferential treatment. The FERC has also indicated that independent transmission companies can play a prominent role in furthering its policy goals and has encouraged the legal and functional separation of transmission operations from generation and distribution operations.
The FERC requires compliance with certain reliability standards by transmission owners and may take enforcement actions for violations, including the imposition of substantial fines. NERC is responsible for developing and enforcing these mandatory reliability standards. We continually assess our transmission systems against standards established by NERC, as well as the standards of applicable regional entities under NERC that have been delegated certain authority for the purpose of proposing and enforcing reliability standards. Finally, utility holding companies are subject to FERC regulations related to access to books and records in addition to the requirement of the FERC to review and approve mergers and consolidations involving utility assets and holding companies in certain circumstances.
Federal Regulation
As electric transmission companies, our Regulated Operating Subsidiaries are regulated by the FERC. The FERC is an independent regulatory commission within the DOE that regulates the interstate transmission and certain wholesale sales of natural gas, the transmission of oil and oil products by pipeline and the transmission and wholesale sales of electricity in interstate commerce. The FERC also administers accounting and financial reporting regulations and standards of conduct for the companies it regulates. In 1996, in order to facilitate open access transmission for participants in wholesale power markets, the FERC issued Order No. 888. The open access policy promulgated by the FERC in Order No. 888 was upheld in a United States Supreme Court decision, State of New York vs. FERC, issued on March 4, 2002. To facilitate open access, among other things, FERC Order No. 888 encouraged investor owned utilities to cede operational control over their transmission systems to ISOs, which are not-for-profit entities.
10

As an alternative to ceding operating control of their transmission assets to ISOs, certain investor owned utilities began to promote the formation of for-profit transmission companies, which would assume control of the operation of the grid. In December 1999, the FERC issued Order No. 2000, which strongly encouraged utilities to voluntarily transfer operational control of their transmission systems to RTOs. RTOs, as envisioned in Order No. 2000, would assume many of the functions of an ISO, but the FERC permitted greater flexibility with regard to the organization and structure of RTOs than it had for ISOs. RTOs could accommodate the inclusion of independently owned, for-profit companies that own transmission assets within their operating structure. Independent ownership would facilitate not only the independent operation of the transmission systems, but also the formation of companies with a greater financial interest in maintaining and augmenting the capacity and reliability of those systems. RTOs such as MISO and SPP monitor electric reliability and are responsible for coordinating the operation of the wholesale electric transmission system and ensuring fair, non-discriminatory access to the transmission grid.
FERC Order No. 1000 (“Order 1000”) amends certain existing transmission planning and cost allocation requirements to ensure that FERC-jurisdictional services are provided at just and reasonable rates and on a basis that is just and reasonable and not unduly discriminatory or preferential. With respect to transmission planning, Order 1000: (1) requires that each public utility transmission provider participate in a regional transmission planning process that produces a regional transmission plan; (2) requires that each public utility transmission provider amend its Open Access Transmission Tariff to describe procedures that provide for the consideration of transmission needs driven by public policy requirements in the local and regional transmission planning processes; (3) removes a federal right of first refusal for certain new transmission facilities from FERC-approved tariffs and agreements; and (4) improves coordination between neighboring transmission planning regions for new interregional transmission facilities. MISO and SPP are compliant with the regional and interregional requirements of Order 1000 after making multiple compliance filings at the FERC.
Order 1000 could potentially lead to greater competition for certain future transmission projects, including within our current operating areas. We are currently exploring opportunities resulting from Order 1000 within MISO and SPP as well as other RTOs.
Revenue Requirement Calculations and Cost Sharing for Projects with Regional Benefits
The cost-based formula rates used by our Regulated Operating Subsidiaries include revenue requirement calculations for various types of projects. Network revenues continue to be the largest component of revenues recovered through our formula rates. However, regional cost sharing revenues are growing as a result of projects that have been identified by MISO or SPP as having regional benefits, and therefore eligible for regional cost recovery under their tariffs. Separate calculations of revenue requirement are performed for projects that have been approved for regional cost sharing and impact only which parties ultimately pay for the transmission services related to these projects and do not impact our financial results.
We have projects that are eligible for regional cost sharing under the MISO tariff, such as certain network upgrade projects, and the MVPs, including the four North Central MVPs and the Thumb Loop Project in Michigan. Additionally, certain projects at ITC Great Plains are eligible for recovery through a region-wide charge in the SPP tariff, including two regional cost sharing projects in Kansas. Certain of these projects are described in more detail in “Item 7 Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Recent Developments.”
State Regulation
The regulatory agencies in the states where our Regulated Operating Subsidiaries’ assets are located do not have jurisdiction over our rates or terms and conditions of service. However, they typically have jurisdiction over siting of transmission facilities and related matters as described below. Additionally, we are subject to the regulatory oversight of various state environmental quality departments for compliance with any state environmental standards and regulations.
ITCTransmission, METC and ITC Interconnection
Michigan
The MPSC has jurisdiction over the siting of certain transmission facilities. Additionally, ITCTransmission, METC and ITC Interconnection have the right as independent transmission companies to condemn property in the state of Michigan for the purposes of building or maintaining transmission facilities.
11

ITCTransmission, METC and ITC Interconnection are also subject to the regulatory oversight of the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality, the Michigan Department of Natural Resources and certain local authorities for compliance with all environmental standards and regulations.
ITC Midwest
Iowa
The IUB has the power of supervision over the construction, operation and maintenance of transmission facilities in Iowa by any entity, which includes the power to issue franchises. Iowa law further provides that any entity granted a franchise by the IUB is vested with the power of condemnation in Iowa to the extent the IUB approves and deems necessary for public use. A city has the power, pursuant to Iowa law, to grant a franchise to erect, maintain and operate transmission facilities within the city, which franchise may regulate the conditions required and manner of use of the streets and public grounds of the city and may confer the power to appropriate and condemn private property.
ITC Midwest also is subject to the regulatory oversight of certain state agencies (including the Iowa Department of Natural Resources) and certain local authorities with respect to the issuance of environmental, highway, railroad and similar permits.
Minnesota
The MPUC has jurisdiction over the construction, siting and routing of new transmission lines or upgrades of existing lines through Minnesota’s Certificate of Need and Route Permit Processes. Transmission companies are also required to participate in the State’s Biennial Transmission Planning Process and are subject to the state’s preventative maintenance requirements. Pursuant to Minnesota law, ITC Midwest has the right as an independent transmission company to condemn property in the State of Minnesota for the purpose of building new transmission facilities.
ITC Midwest is also subject to the regulatory oversight of the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency, the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources, the MPUC in conjunction with the Department of Commerce and certain local authorities for compliance with applicable environmental standards and regulations.
Illinois
The ICC exercises jurisdiction over siting of new transmission lines through its requirements for Certificates of Public Convenience and Necessity and Right-Of-Way acquisition that apply to construction of new or upgraded facilities.
ITC Midwest also is subject to the regulatory oversight of the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency, the Illinois Department of Natural Resources, the Illinois Pollution Control Board and certain local authorities for compliance with all environmental standards and regulations.
Missouri
Because ITC Midwest is a “public utility” and an “electrical corporation” under Missouri law, the MOPSC has jurisdiction to determine whether ITC Midwest may operate in such capacity. The MOPSC also exercises jurisdiction with regard to other non-rate matters affecting this Missouri asset such as transmission substation construction, general safety and the transfer of the franchise or property.
ITC Midwest is also subject to the regulatory oversight of the Missouri Department of Natural Resources for compliance with all environmental standards and regulations relating to this transmission line.
Wisconsin
ITC Midwest is a “public utility” and independent transmission owner in Wisconsin. The PSCW in a May 2014 order granted ITC Midwest a certificate of authority to transact public utility business in the state. In a separate May 2014 order, the PSCW also recognized ITC Holdings Corp. as a public utility holding company under Wisconsin statutes.
The PSCW exercises jurisdiction over the siting of new transmission lines through the issuance of certificates of authority and certificates of public convenience and necessity. Upon receipt of such certificates for a transmission project, ITC Midwest has condemnation authority as a foreign transmission provider under Wisconsin law. ITC 
12

Midwest is also subject to the jurisdiction of certain local and state agencies, including the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources, relating to environmental and road permits.
ITC Great Plains
Kansas
ITC Great Plains is a “public utility” in Kansas and an “electric utility” pursuant to state statutes. The KCC issued an order approving the issuance of a limited certificate of convenience to ITC Great Plains for the purposes of building, owning and operating SPP transmission projects in Kansas. In addition to its certificate of authority, the KCC has jurisdiction over the siting of electric transmission lines.
ITC Great Plains is also subject to the regulatory oversight of the Kansas Department of Health and Environment for compliance with all environmental standards and regulations relating to the construction phase of any transmission line.
Oklahoma
ITC Great Plains has approval from the OCC to operate in Oklahoma, pursuant to Oklahoma Statutes as an electric public utility providing only transmission services. The OCC does not exercise jurisdiction over the siting of any transmission lines.
ITC Great Plains may be subject to the regulatory oversight of Oklahoma Department of Environmental Quality for compliance with environmental standards and regulations relating to construction of proposed transmission lines.
Sources of Revenue
See “Item 7 Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Results of Operations — Operating Revenues” for a discussion of our principal sources of revenue.
Seasonality
The cost-based formula rates in effect for our Regulated Operating Subsidiaries, as discussed in “Item 7 Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Cost-Based Formula Rates with True-Up Mechanism,” mitigate the seasonality of net income for our Regulated Operating Subsidiaries. Our Regulated Operating Subsidiaries accrue or defer revenues to the extent that the actual revenue requirement for the reporting period is higher or lower, respectively, than the amounts billed relating to that reporting period. For example, to the extent that amounts billed are less than our revenue requirement for a reporting period, a revenue accrual is recorded for the difference and the difference results in no net income impact.
Operating cash flows are seasonal at our MISO Regulated Operating Subsidiaries, in that cash received for revenues is typically higher in the summer months when peak load is higher.
Principal Customers
Our principal transmission service customers are DTE Electric, Consumers Energy and IP&L, which accounted for approximately 20.7%, 21.7% and 25.5%, respectively, of our consolidated billed revenues for the year ended December 31, 2016. One or more of these customers together have consistently represented a significant percentage of our operating revenue. These percentages of total billed revenues of DTE Electric, Consumers Energy and IP&L include the collection of 2014 revenue accruals and deferrals and exclude any amounts for the 2016 revenue accruals and deferrals that were included in our 2016 operating revenues, but will not be billed to our customers until 2018. Refer to “Item 7 Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Cost-Based Formula Rates with True-Up Mechanism” for a discussion on the difference between billed revenues and operating revenues. Our remaining revenues were generated from providing service to other entities such as alternative electricity suppliers, power marketers and other wholesale customers that provide electricity to end-use consumers and from transaction-based capacity reservations. Nearly all of our revenues are from transmission customers in the United States. Although we may recognize allocated revenues from time to time from Canadian entities reserving transmission over the Ontario or Manitoba interface, these revenues have not been and are not expected to be material to us.
13

Billing
MISO and SPP are responsible for billing and collecting the majority of our transmission service revenues as well as independently administering the transmission tariff in their respective service territory. As the billing agents for our MISO Regulated Operating Subsidiaries and ITC Great Plains, MISO and SPP independently bill DTE Electric, Consumers Energy, IP&L and other customers on a monthly basis and collect fees for the use of our transmission systems. 
See “Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk — Credit Risk” for discussion of our credit policies.
Competition
Each of our MISO Regulated Operating Subsidiaries operates the primary transmission system in its respective service area and has limited competition for certain projects. However, the competitive environment is evolving due to the implementation of Order 1000. See further discussion of Order 1000 above under “Regulatory Environment — Federal Regulation.” For our subsidiaries focused on development opportunities for transmission investment in other service areas, the incumbent utilities or other entities with transmission development initiatives may compete with us by seeking approval to be named the party authorized to build new capital projects that we are also pursuing. Because our Regulated Operating Subsidiaries are currently the only transmission companies that are independent from electricity market participants, we believe that we are best able to develop these projects in a non-discriminatory manner. However, there are no assurances that we will be selected to develop projects other entities are also pursuing.
Employees
As of December 31, 2016, we had 660 employees. We consider our relations with our employees to be good.
Environmental Matters
We are subject to federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations, which impose limitations on the discharge of pollutants into the environment, establish standards for the management, treatment, storage, transportation and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes and hazardous materials, and impose obligations to investigate and remediate contamination in certain circumstances. Liabilities relating to investigation and remediation of contamination, as well as other liabilities concerning hazardous materials or contamination, such as claims for personal injury or property damage, may arise at many locations, including formerly owned or operated properties and sites where wastes have been treated or disposed of, as well as properties currently owned or operated by us. Such liabilities may arise even where the contamination does not result from noncompliance with applicable environmental laws. Under some environmental laws, such liabilities may also be joint and several, meaning that a party can be held responsible for more than its share of the liability involved, or even the entire share. Although environmental requirements generally have become more stringent and compliance with those requirements more expensive, we are not aware of any specific developments that would increase our costs for such compliance in a manner that would be expected to have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position or liquidity.
Our assets and operations also involve the use of materials classified as hazardous, toxic or otherwise dangerous. Many of the properties that we own or operate have been used for many years, and include older facilities and equipment that may be more likely than newer ones to contain or be made from such materials. Some of these properties include aboveground or underground storage tanks and associated piping. Some of them also include large electrical equipment filled with mineral oil, which may contain or previously have contained polychlorinated biphenyls, or PCBs. Our facilities and equipment are often situated on or near property owned by others so that, if they are the source of contamination, others’ property may be affected. For example, aboveground and underground transmission lines sometimes traverse properties that we do not own and transmission assets that we own or operate are sometimes commingled at our transmission stations with distribution assets owned or operated by our transmission customers.
Some properties in which we have an ownership interest or at which we operate are, or are suspected of being, affected by environmental contamination. We are not aware of any pending or threatened claims against us with respect to environmental contamination relating to these properties, or of any investigation or remediation of contamination at these properties, that entail costs likely to materially affect us. Some facilities and properties are located near environmentally sensitive areas such as wetlands.

Claims have been made or threatened against electric utilities for bodily injury, disease or other damages allegedly related to exposure to electromagnetic fields associated with electric transmission and distribution lines. While we do not believe that a causal link between electromagnetic field exposure and injury has been generally established and accepted in the scientific community, the liabilities and costs imposed on our business could be significant if such a relationship is established or accepted. We are not aware of any pending or threatened claims against us for bodily injury, disease or other damages allegedly related to exposure to electromagnetic fields and electric transmission and distribution lines that entail costs likely to have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position or liquidity.
