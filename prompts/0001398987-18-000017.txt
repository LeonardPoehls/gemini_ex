Item 1.    Business. 
Our Company 
We are the leading and most integrated provider of residential real estate services in the U.S. We are the world's largest franchisor of residential real estate brokerages with some of the most recognized brands in the real estate industry, the leading U.S. residential real estate brokerage (based upon transaction volume), one of the largest U.S. and a leading global provider of outsourced employee relocation services and a significant provider of title and settlement services.
The core of our strategy is clear and simple: “We Serve Agents.” This strategy is aimed at growing the base of high-performing independent sales agents at our company owned and franchisee brokerages and providing them with compelling data and technology products and services to make them more productive and their businesses more profitable. 
Our revenue is derived on a fee-for-service basis, and given our breadth of complementary service offerings, we are able to generate fees from multiple aspects of a residential real estate transaction. Our operating platform is supported by our portfolio of industry leading franchise brokerage brands, including Century 21®, Coldwell Banker®, Coldwell Banker Commercial®, ERA®, Sotheby's International Realty® and Better Homes and Gardens® Real Estate. We also own and operate Corcoran®, Citi HabitatsSM and ZipRealty® brands. Our multiple brands and operations allow us to derive revenue from many different segments of the residential real estate market, in many different geographies and at varying price points.
Segment Overview 
We report our operations in four segments, each of which receives fees based upon services performed for our customers: Real Estate Franchise Services ("RFG"), Company Owned Real Estate Brokerage Services ("NRT"), Relocation Services ("Cartus®") and Title and Settlement Services ("TRG").
Real Estate Franchise Services. We are the largest franchisor of residential real estate brokerages in the world through our portfolio of well-known brokerage brands, including Century 21®, Coldwell Banker®, Coldwell Banker Commercial®, ERA®, Sotheby's International Realty® and Better Homes and Gardens® Real Estate. As of December 31, 2017, our real estate franchise systems and proprietary brands had approximately 289,000 independent sales agents worldwide (which included approximately 50,300 company owned brokerage independent sales agents), including approximately 192,000 independent sales agents operating in the U.S. As of December 31, 2017, our real estate franchise systems and proprietary 
5

brands had approximately 14,800 offices (which included approximately 790 company owned brokerage offices) worldwide in 116 countries and territories, including approximately 6,100 brokerage offices in the U.S.
The average tenure among U.S. franchisees is approximately 21.5 years as of December 31, 2017. Our franchisees pay us fees for the right to operate under one of our trademarks and to enjoy the benefits of the systems and business enhancing tools provided by our real estate franchise operations. In addition to highly competitive brands that provide unique offerings to our franchisees, we support our franchisees with dedicated national marketing and servicing programs, technology including the Zap® technology platform, training, education, learning and development to facilitate our franchisees in growing their business and increasing their revenue and profitability. We believe that one of our strengths is the strong relationships that we have with our franchisees, as evidenced by our 98% retention rate as of December 31, 2017. Our retention rate represents the annual franchisee gross commission income for the year ended December 31, 2016 generated by our franchisees that remain in our franchise systems as of December 31, 2017, measured against the annual gross commission income of all franchisees for the year ended December 31, 2016.
Company Owned Real Estate Brokerage Services. We own and operate the leading residential real estate brokerage business (based upon transaction volume) in the U.S. under the Coldwell Banker®, Corcoran®, Sotheby's International Realty®, ZipRealty® and Citi HabitatsSM brand names. We offer full-service residential brokerage services in more than 50 of the 100 largest metropolitan areas of the U.S. NRT, as the broker for a home buyer or seller, derives revenues primarily from gross commission income received at the closing of real estate transactions. NRT also has relationships with developers, primarily in major cities, to provide marketing and brokerage services in new developments. To complement its residential brokerage services, NRT offers home ownership services that include comprehensive single-family residential property management in many of the nation's largest rental markets. In addition, the equity earnings or losses related to our 49.9% ownership of PHH Home Loans LLC ("PHH Home Loans"), our former home mortgage venture with PHH Mortgage Corporation (“PHH”) were included in the financial results of NRT. As discussed below, our mortgage origination joint venture with Guaranteed Rate, which began doing business in August 2017 on a phased-in basis, is included within our Title and Settlement Services segment.
Relocation Services. We are a leading global provider of outsourced employee relocation services. We are one of the largest providers of such services in the U.S. and also operate in key international relocation destinations. We offer a broad range of world-class employee relocation services designed to manage all aspects of an employee's move to facilitate a smooth transition in what otherwise may be a complex and difficult process for the employee and employer. Our relocation services business serves corporations, including 54% of the Fortune 50 companies. We also service affinity organizations such as insurance companies and credit unions that provide our services to their members. In 2017, we assisted in approximately 162,000 corporate and affinity relocations in nearly 150 countries for approximately 800 active clients. As of December 31, 2017, our top 25 relocation clients had an average tenure of approximately 20 years with us. Member brokers 
6

of the Cartus Broker Network, including certain franchisees and NRT, receive referrals from the relocation services, affinity services and from each other in exchange for a referral fee.
Title and Settlement Services. We assist with the closing of real estate transactions by providing full-service title and settlement (i.e., closing and escrow) services to customers, real estate companies, including our company owned real estate brokerage and relocation services businesses, as well as a targeted channel of large financial institution clients. In 2017, TRG was involved in the closing of approximately 188,000 transactions of which approximately 57,000 related to NRT. In addition to our own title and settlement services, we also coordinate a nationwide network of attorneys, title agents and notaries to service financial institution and relocation clients on a national basis. We also serve as an underwriter of title insurance policies in connection with residential and commercial real estate transactions. This segment also includes the Company's share of equity earnings and losses, including start-up costs, for our 49.9% ownership of Guaranteed Rate Affinity, our mortgage origination joint venture with Guaranteed Rate, which began doing business in August 2017 on a phased-in basis. See "Item 7.—Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Recent Developments" and the financial statements, including the notes thereto, included elsewhere in this Annual Report, for further information on our mortgage origination joint venture.
Housing Market and Market Share
U.S. Gross Commission Income. Residential real estate brokerage companies typically realize revenues in the form of a sales commission earned from closed homesale sides (either the "buy" side and/or the "sell" side of a real estate transaction), which we refer to as gross commission income. We believe that the level of gross commission income generated in the U.S. represents a substantial addressable market. We estimate that more than $70 billion in gross commission income was generated by U.S. residential existing homesale transactions involving a broker in 2017. Our company owned brokerages and franchisees earned approximately $13 billion in gross commission income in the same period.
Market Share. As measured in a comparison to the volume of all existing homesale transactions in the U.S. as reported by NAR (regardless of whether an agent or broker was involved in the transaction), we estimate that our market share in 2017 increased modestly year-over-year to approximately 15.9% compared to 15.7% in 2016. Our estimated share of all U.S. existing homesale unit transactions in 2017 remained at approximately 13.5%.
Basis of Calculation
U.S. Gross Commission Income Calculation. We estimate U.S. gross commission income by multiplying NAR’s published existing homesale transaction units, reduced to approximately 88% (to reflect 87% of the total homes that were bought using an agent or broker and 89% of the total homes that were sold using an agent or broker in 2017 according to NAR), by (a) NAR's published average sales price and (b) the average annual broker commission rate published by Real Trends, a provider of residential brokerage industry analysis, of 5.1%.
Market Share Calculation. We measure our market share transaction volume by the ratio of (a) homesale transaction volume (sides times average price) in which we and our franchisees participate to (b) NAR's existing homesale transaction volume (regardless of whether an agent or broker was involved in the transaction)—calculated by doubling the number of existing homesale transactions reported by NAR to account for both the buy and sell sides of a transaction multiplied by NAR's average sales price. Homesale unit transaction market share is calculated similarly but without including average sales price in either the numerator or denominator.

Industry Trends 
Industry definition.  We primarily operate in the U.S. residential real estate industry, which is approximately a $1.8 trillion industry based on 2017 transaction volume (i.e. average homesale price times number of new and existing homesale transactions) and derive substantially all of our revenues from serving the needs of buyers and sellers of existing homes rather than new homes manufactured and sold by homebuilders. Residential real estate brokerage companies typically realize revenues in the form of a commission that is based on a percentage of the price of each home sold. As a result, the real estate industry generally benefits from rising home prices and increasing homesale transactions (and conversely is adversely impacted by falling prices and lower homesale transactions). We believe that existing homesale transactions and the services associated with these transactions, such as mortgage origination, title services and relocation services, represent one of the most attractive segments of the residential real estate industry for the following reasons:

• | the existing homesales segment represents a significantly larger addressable market than new homesales. Of the approximately 6.1 million homesales in the U.S. in 2017, NAR estimates that approximately 5.5 million were existing homesales, representing approximately 90% of the overall sales as measured in units; 


• | existing homesales afford us the opportunity to represent either the buyer or the seller and in some cases both the buyer and the seller; and


• | we are able to generate revenues from ancillary services provided to our customers.

While substantially all homebuyers start their search for a home using the Internet, according to NAR, 87% of home buyers and 89% of home sellers used an agent or broker in 2017. We believe that agents or brokers will continue to be directly involved in most home purchases and sales, primarily because real estate transactions have certain characteristics that benefit from the service and value offered by an agent or broker, including the following:

• | the average homesale transaction size is very high and generally is the largest transaction one does in a lifetime;


• | homesale transactions occur infrequently;


• | there is a compelling need for personal service as home preferences are unique to each buyer;


• | a high level of support is required given the complexity associated with the process, including specific marketing and technology services; and


• | there is a high variance in price, depending on neighborhood, floor plan, architecture, fixtures, and outdoor space.

Cyclical nature of industry.  The U.S. residential real estate industry is cyclical, but has historically shown strong growth over time. Based on information published by NAR, existing homesale units increased at a compound annual growth rate, or CAGR, of 2.0% from 1972 through 2017, with 29 annual increases, versus 16 annual decreases.
During that same period, median existing homesale prices increased at a CAGR of 5.1% (not adjusted for inflation) from 1972 through 2017, a period that included four economic recessions.
8

According to NAR, the existing homesale transaction volume (median homesale price times existing homesale transactions) grew at a CAGR of 7.2% from 1972 through 2017. 
The U.S. residential real estate industry was in a significant and lengthy downturn from the second half of 2005 through 2011. Based upon data published by NAR from 2005 to 2011, the number of annual U.S. existing homesale transactions declined by 40% and the median existing homesale price declined by 24%. Beginning in 2012, the U.S. residential real estate industry began its recovery. Based upon data published by NAR from 2011 to 2017, the number of annual U.S. existing homesale units and the median existing homesale price improved by 29% and 49%, respectively.
Long-term demographics.  We believe that long-term demand for housing and the growth of our industry is primarily driven by affordability, the economic health of the U.S. economy, demographic trends such as population growth, increases in the number of U.S. households, low interest rates, increases in renters that qualify as homebuyers and locally based factors. We believe that the residential real estate market will benefit over the long term from expected positive fundamentals, including the following factors:

• | based on U.S. Census data and NAR, the number of existing homesale transactions in 2017 was similar to the average number of homesale transactions in 2001 and 2002 while the number of U.S. households grew from 108 million in 2001 to 126 million in 2017; and


• | according to the 2017 State of the Nation's Housing Report compiled by the Harvard Joint Center for Housing Studies, household growth is expected to average about 1.36 million annually from 2015–2025 and about 1.15 million annually from 2025–2035. The millennial generation is poised to form millions of new households over the next decade.

Participation in Multiple Aspects of the Residential Real Estate Market
We participate in services associated with many aspects of the residential real estate market. Our four complementary businesses and mortgage joint venture work together, allowing us to generate revenue at various points in a residential real estate transaction, including the purchase or sale of homes, corporate relocation and affinity services, settlement and title services, and franchising of our brands. The businesses each benefit from our deep understanding of the industry, strong relationships with real estate brokers, sales agents and other real estate professionals and expertise across the transactional process. Unlike other industry participants who offer only one or two services, we can offer homeowners, our franchisees and our corporate and affinity clients ready access to numerous associated services that facilitate and simplify the home purchase and sale process. These services provide further revenue opportunities for our owned businesses and those of our franchisees. Specifically, our brokerage offices and those of our franchisees participate in purchases and sales of homes involving relocations of corporate transferees and affinity members using Cartus® relocation services and we offer customers (purchasers and sellers) of both our owned and franchised brokerage businesses convenient title and settlement services. These services produce incremental revenues for our businesses and franchisees. In addition, we participate in the mortgage process through our 49.9% ownership of Guaranteed Rate Affinity, which began doing business in August 2017 on a phased-in basis. PHH Home Loans, our former mortgage origination joint venture, is the in the final stages of winding down. All four of our businesses and our mortgage joint venture can derive revenue from the same real estate transaction.

Real Estate Franchise Services 
Our primary objectives as the largest franchisor of residential real estate brokerages in the world are to retain and expand existing franchises, sell new franchises, and most importantly, provide branding and support to our franchisees. At December 31, 2017, our real estate franchise systems and proprietary brands had approximately 14,800 offices (which included approximately 790 company owned brokerage offices) worldwide in 116 countries and territories in North and South America, Europe, Asia, Africa, the Middle East and Australia, including approximately 6,100 brokerage offices in the U.S.
We derive substantially all of our real estate franchising revenues from royalties and marketing fees received under long-term franchise agreements with our domestic franchisees (typically ten years in duration) and NRT. These royalties are based on a percentage of the franchisees' sales commission earned from closed homesale sides (either the "buy" side and/or the "sell" side of a real estate transaction), which we refer to as gross commission income. Our franchisees pay us royalties, net of volume incentives achieved (other than NRT), for the right to operate under one of our trademarks and to utilize the benefits of the franchise systems. We provide our franchisees with systems and tools that are designed to help our franchisees serve their customers, attract new or retain existing independent sales agents, and support our franchisees with servicing programs, technology including the Zap® technology platform described below and education, as well as branding-related marketing which is funded through contributions by our franchisees and us (including NRT). We operate and maintain an Internet-based reporting system for our domestic franchisees which generally allows them to electronically transmit listing information and other relevant reporting data to us. We also own and operate websites for each of our 
11

brands for the benefit of our franchisees and their independent sales agents, some of which were re-launched in 2016 and 2017 using our proprietary Zap-based technology.
RFG's domestic annual net royalty revenues from franchisees other than our company owned brokerages can be represented by multiplying (1) that year's total number of closed homesale sides in which those franchisees participated by (2) the average sale price of those homesales by (3) the average brokerage commission rate charged by these franchisees by (4) RFG's net contractual royalty rate. The net contractual royalty rate represents the average percentage of our franchisees' commission revenues paid to us as a royalty, net of volume incentives achieved (or for some larger franchisees, flat fee royalties) and net of non-standard incentives granted to franchisees. Non-standard incentives may be used as consideration for attracting new or growing or extending existing franchisee agreements, though most of our franchisees do not receive non-standard incentives, in contrast to volume incentives. The domestic royalty revenue from NRT is calculated by multiplying homesale sides by average sale price by average brokerage commission rate by 6% royalty rate. NRT does not receive volume incentives or non-standard incentives. In addition to domestic royalty revenue, RFG earns revenue from marketing fees, the preferred alliance program, international affiliates and upfront international fees. The following chart illustrates the key drivers for revenue earned by RFG:
We believe one of our strengths is the strong relationships that we have with our franchisees as evidenced by the retention rate of 98% as of December 31, 2017. Our retention rate represents the annual franchisee gross commission income for the year ended December 31, 2016 generated by our franchisees that remain in our franchise systems as of December 31, 2017, measured against the annual gross commission income of all franchisees for the year ended December 31, 2016. On average, our domestic franchisees' tenure with our brands was approximately 21.5 years as of December 31, 2017. During 2017, none of our franchisees (other than NRT) generated more than 1% of our real estate franchise business revenues.
The franchise agreements impose restrictions on the business and operations of the franchisees and require them to comply with the operating and identity standards set forth in each brand's policy and procedures manuals. A franchisee's failure to comply with these restrictions and standards could result in a termination of the franchise agreement. The franchisees generally are not permitted to terminate the franchise agreements prior to their expiration, and in those cases where termination rights do exist, they are very limited (e.g., if the franchisee retires, becomes disabled or dies). Generally, new domestic franchise agreements have a term of ten years and require the franchisees to pay us an initial franchise fee for the franchisee's principal office plus, upon the receipt of any commission income, a royalty fee in most cases equal to 6% of their commission income. Each of our franchise systems (other than Coldwell Banker Commercial®) offers a volume incentive program, whereby each franchisee is eligible to receive a refund of a portion of the royalties paid upon the satisfaction of certain conditions. The volume incentive is calculated for each eligible franchisee as a progressive percentage of each franchisee's annual gross revenue (paid timely) for each calendar year. Under the current form of the franchise agreements, the volume incentive varies for each franchise system, and will generally result in a net royalty rate of 6% to 3% for each individual franchisee. We provide a detailed table to each franchisee that describes the gross revenue thresholds required to achieve a volume incentive and the corresponding incentive amounts. We reserve the right to increase or decrease the percentage and/or dollar amounts in the table on an annual basis, subject to certain limitations. Our company owned brokerage offices do not participate in the volume incentive program.
Each franchise system requires all franchisees and company owned offices to make monthly contributions to marketing funds maintained by each brand. These contributions are used primarily for the development, implementation, production, placement and payment of national and regional advertising, marketing, promotions, public relations and/or other marketing-related activities, such as lead generation, all to promote and further the recognition of each brand and its independent franchisees. In addition to the contributions from franchisees and company owned offices, the Real Estate Franchise Services group is generally required to make contributions to one of the marketing funds and may make discretionary contributions (at its option) to any of the marketing funds.
12

The Company also offers support services to its franchisees, including technology-enabled solutions such as customer relationship management (CRM), lead generation and productivity tools developed by our wholly-owned subsidiary, ZapLabs. 
Under certain circumstances, we extend conversion notes (development advance notes were issued prior to 2009) to eligible franchisees for the purpose of providing an incentive to join the brand, to renew their franchise agreements, or to facilitate their growth opportunities. Growth opportunities include the expansion of franchisees' existing businesses by opening additional offices, through the consolidation of operations of other franchisees, as well as through the acquisition of independent sales agents and offices operated by independent brokerages. Many franchisees use the proceeds from the conversion notes to change signage and marketing materials, upgrade technology and websites, or to assist in acquiring companies or recruiting agents. The notes are not funded until appropriate credit checks and other due diligence matters are completed and the business is opened and operating under one of our brands. Upon satisfaction of certain revenue performance based thresholds, the notes are forgiven ratably over the term of the franchise agreement. If the revenue performance thresholds are not met, franchisees may be required to repay all or a portion of the outstanding notes.
In addition to offices owned and operated by our franchisees, we, through NRT, own and operate approximately 750 offices under the Coldwell Banker®, Coldwell Banker Commercial® and Sotheby's International Realty® brand names. NRT pays intercompany royalty fees and marketing fees to our Real Estate Franchise Services Segment in connection with its operation of these offices. These fees are recognized as income or expense by the applicable segment level and eliminated in the consolidation of our businesses.
In the U.S., we employ a direct franchising model whereby we contract with and provide services directly to independent owner-operators.  Elsewhere, for all brands other than Sotheby's International Realty, we generally employ a master franchise model, whereby we contract with a qualified third party to build a franchise network in the country or region in which franchising rights have been granted. In the case of Sotheby's International Realty, a direct franchising model is generally utilized. Under both the direct and the master franchise model outside of the U.S., we typically enter into long-term franchise agreements (often 25 years in duration) and receive an initial area development fee and ongoing royalties.  Under the master franchise model, the ongoing royalties we receive are generally a percentage of the royalties received by the master franchisor from its franchisees with which it contracts. Under the direct franchise model, a royalty fee is paid to us on transactions conducted by our franchisees in the applicable country or region. 
We also offer third-party service providers an opportunity to market their products to our franchisees and their independent sales agents and customers through our preferred alliance program. To participate in this program, service providers generally agree to provide preferred pricing to our franchisees and/or their customers or independent sales agents and to pay us a combination of an initial licensing or access fee, subsequent marketing fees and/or commissions based upon our franchisees' or independent sales agents' usage of the preferred alliance vendors. 
We own the trademarks Century 21®, Coldwell Banker®, Coldwell Banker Commercial®, ERA® and related trademarks and logos, and such trademarks and logos are material to the businesses that are part of our real estate franchise segment. Our franchisees and our subsidiaries actively use these trademarks, and all of the material trademarks are registered (or have applications pending) with the United States Patent and Trademark Office as well as with corresponding trademark offices in major countries worldwide where these businesses have significant franchised operations.
We have an exclusive license to own, operate and franchise the Sotheby's International Realty® brand to qualified residential real estate brokerage offices and individuals operating in eligible markets pursuant to a license agreement with SPTC Delaware LLC, a subsidiary of Sotheby's ("Sotheby's"). Such license agreement has a 100-year term, which consists of an initial 50-year term ending February 16, 2054 and a 50-year renewal option. We pay a licensing fee to Sotheby's for the use of the Sotheby's International Realty® name equal to 9.5% of the net royalties earned by our Real Estate Franchise Services Segment attributable to franchisees affiliated with the Sotheby's International Realty® brand, including our company owned offices.
In October 2007, we entered into a long-term license agreement to own, operate and franchise the Better Homes and Gardens® Real Estate brand from Meredith. The license agreement between Realogy and Meredith is for a 50-year term, with a renewal option for another 50 years at our option. We pay a licensing fee to Meredith for the use of the Better Homes and Gardens® Real Estate brand name equal to 9.0% of the net royalties earned by our Real Estate Franchise Services Segment attributable to franchisees affiliated with the Better Homes & Gardens Real Estate brand, subject to a minimum annual licensing fee.
13

Each of our brands has a consumer website that offers real estate listings, contacts and services. Century21.com, coldwellbanker.com, coldwellbankercommercial.com, sothebysrealty.com, era.com and bhgrealestate.com are the official websites for the Century 21®, Coldwell Banker®, Coldwell Banker Commercial®, Sotheby's International Realty®, ERA® and Better Homes and Gardens® Real Estate franchise systems, respectively. The contents of these websites are not incorporated by reference herein or otherwise a part of this Annual Report.
Company Owned Real Estate Brokerage Services 
Through our subsidiary, NRT, we own and operate a full-service real estate brokerage business in more than 50 of the 100 largest metropolitan areas in the U.S. Our company owned real estate brokerage business operates under the Coldwell Banker® and Sotheby's International Realty® franchised brands as well as proprietary brands that we own, but do not currently franchise, such as Corcoran®, ZipRealty® and Citi HabitatsSM. As of December 31, 2017, we had approximately 790 company owned brokerage offices, approximately 5,200 employees and approximately 50,300 independent sales agents working with these company owned offices.
Our company owned real estate brokerage business derives revenue primarily from gross commission income received serving as the broker at the closing of real estate transactions. For the year ended December 31, 2017, our average homesale broker commission rate was 2.44% which represents the average commission rate earned on either the "buy" side or the "sell" side of a homesale transaction. Gross commission income is also earned on non-sale transactions such as home rentals. NRT, as a franchisee of RFG, pays a royalty fee of 6% per transaction to RFG from the commission earned on a real estate transaction. The following chart illustrates the key drivers for revenue earned by NRT:
In addition, as a full-service real estate brokerage company, we promote the complementary services of our relocation and title and settlement services businesses. We believe we provide integrated services that enhance the customer experience.
When we assist the seller in a real estate transaction, independent sales agents generally provide the seller with a full-service marketing program, which may include developing a direct marketing plan for the property, assisting the seller in pricing the property and preparing it for sale, listing it on multiple listing services, advertising the property (including on websites), showing the property to prospective buyers, assisting the seller in sale negotiations, and assisting the seller in preparing for closing the transaction. When we assist the buyer in a real estate transaction, independent sales agents generally help the buyer in locating specific properties that meet the buyer's personal and financial specifications, show properties to the buyer, assist the buyer in negotiating (where permissible) and preparing for closing the transaction. In addition, NRT has relationships with developers, primarily in major cities, to provide marketing and brokerage services in new developments.
At December 31, 2017, we operated approximately 90% of our offices under the Coldwell Banker® brand name, approximately 5% of our offices under the Sotheby's International Realty® brand name and 5% of our offices under the Corcoran®, Citi HabitatsSM, ZipRealty® and Climb Real Estate® brand names combined. Our offices are geographically diverse with a strong presence in the east and west coast areas, primarily around large metropolitan areas in the U.S., where home prices are generally higher. We operate our Coldwell Banker® offices in numerous regions throughout the U.S., our Sotheby's International Realty® offices in several regions throughout the U.S, and Corcoran® offices in New York City, the Hamptons (New York), and Palm Beach, Florida.
We intend to grow our business organically and, to a lesser extent, through strategic acquisitions focused primarily on expanding our existing markets. To grow organically, we will focus on working with office managers to attract, retain and effectively coordinate with independent sales agents who can successfully engage and promote transactions from new and existing clients. To complement our residential brokerage services, NRT offers home ownership services that include comprehensive single-family residential property management in many of the nation's largest rental markets.
Following the completion of an acquisition, we tend to consolidate the newly acquired operations with our existing operations. By consolidating operations, we reduce or eliminate duplicative costs, such as advertising, rent and administrative support. By utilizing our existing infrastructure to coordinate with a broader network of independent sales

agents and revenue base, we can enhance the profitability of our operations. We also seek to enhance the profitability of newly acquired operations by strategies that increase the productivity of the newly affiliated independent sales agents. We offer these independent sales agents supplemental tools and marketing information that are often unavailable at smaller firms, such as access to sophisticated information technology and ongoing technical support, increased brand advertising and brand marketing support, relocation referrals, and a wide offering of brokerage-related services.
Our real estate brokerage business has a contract with Cartus under which the brokerage business provides brokerage services to relocating employees of the clients of Cartus. When receiving a referral from Cartus, our brokerage business seeks to assist the relocating employee in completing a homesale or home purchase. Upon completion of a homesale or home purchase, our brokerage business receives a commission on the purchase or sale of the property and is obligated to pay Cartus a portion of such commission as a referral fee. We believe that these fees are comparable to the fees charged by other relocation companies.
Relocation Services 
Through our subsidiary, Cartus, we are a leading global provider of outsourced employee relocation services. We primarily offer corporate clients employee relocation services, such as:

• | homesale assistance, including:


◦ | the valuation, inspection, purchasing and selling of a transferee's home;


◦ | the issuance of home equity advances to transferees permitting them to purchase a new home before selling their current home (these advances are generally guaranteed by the individual's employer);


◦ | certain home management services;


◦ | assistance in locating a new home; and


◦ | closing on the sale of the old home, generally at the instruction of the client;


• | expense processing, relocation policy counseling, relocation-related accounting, including international assignment compensation services, and other consulting services;


• | arranging household goods moving services, approximately 60,000 domestic and international shipments in 2017, and providing support for all aspects of moving a transferee's household goods, including the handling of insurance and claim assistance, invoice auditing and quality control;


• | coordinating visa and immigration support, intercultural and language training, and expatriation/repatriation counseling and destination services; and


• | group move management services providing coordination for moves involving a large number of transferees to or from a specific regional area over a short period of time.

The wide range of our services allows our Cartus clients to outsource their entire relocation programs to us.
In 2017, we assisted in approximately 162,000 corporate and affinity relocations in nearly 150 countries for approximately 800 active clients, including 54% of the Fortune 50 companies as well as affinity organizations. Cartus has operations in the U.S. and internationally in the United Kingdom, Canada, Hong Kong, Singapore, China, India, Brazil, Germany, France, Switzerland and the Netherlands.
Substantially all homesale service transactions for clients are classified as "no risk." Under "no risk" business, the client is responsible for reimbursement of all direct expenses associated with the homesale. Such expenses include, but are not limited to, appraisal, inspection and real estate brokerage commissions. The client also bears the risk of loss on the resale of the transferee's home. Clients are responsible for reimbursement of all other direct costs associated with the relocation including, but not limited to, costs to move household goods, mortgage origination points, temporary living and travel expenses. Generally, we fund the direct expenses associated with the homesale as well as those associated with the relocation on behalf of the client and the client then reimburses us for these costs plus interest charges on the advanced funds. This limits our exposure on "no risk" homesale services to the credit risk of our clients rather than to the potential fluctuations in the real estate market or to the creditworthiness of the individual transferring employee. Historically, due to the credit quality of our clients, we have had minimal losses with respect to these "no risk" homesale services.
The "at risk" business that we conduct is minimal. In "at risk" homesale service transactions, we acquire the home being sold by relocating employees, incur the cost for all direct expenses (acquisition, carrying and selling costs) associated with the homesale and bear any loss on the sale of the home.
15

Substantially all of our contracts with our relocation clients are terminable at any time at the option of the client, are non-exclusive and do not require such client to maintain any level of business with us. If a client ceases or reduces volume under its contract, we will be compensated for all services performed up to the time that volume ceases and reimbursed for all expenses incurred.
There are a number of different revenue streams associated with relocation services. We earn referral commissions primarily from real estate brokers and household goods moving companies that provide services to the transferee. Clients may also pay transactional fees for the services performed. We also earn net interest income which represents interest earned from clients on the funds we advance on behalf of the transferring employee net of costs associated with the securitization obligations used to finance these payments. Cartus measures operating performance based on initiations, which represent the total number of transferees and affinity members we serve, and referrals, which represent the number of referrals from which we earn revenue from real estate brokers.
About 17% of our relocation revenue in 2017 was derived from our affinity services, which provides real estate services, including home buying and selling assistance, as well as mortgage assistance to organizations such as insurance companies and credit unions that have established members who are buying or selling a home. Often these organizations offer our affinity services to their members at no cost and, where permitted, provide their members with a financial incentive for using these services. These member benefits and services help the organizations attract new members and retain current members.
To service the needs of our relocation and affinity clients as well as broker-to-broker referrals, we manage the Cartus Broker Network, which is a network of real estate brokers consisting of our company owned brokerage operations, select franchisees and independent real estate brokers who have been approved to become members. Cartus requires experienced brokers and independent sales agents and obtains background checks on all members of the network. Member brokers of the Cartus Broker Network receive referrals from our relocation services, affinity business and each other in exchange for a referral fee. The Cartus Broker Network is a key contributor to our lead generation strategy, with approximately 97% of the converted leads generated through the network being directed to independent sales agents affiliated with our franchisees and company-owned brokerages in 2017. The Cartus Broker Network closed approximately 78,500 real estate transactions in 2017 related to relocation, affinity, and broker-to-broker activity.
The following chart illustrates the key drivers for revenue generated by Cartus:
Title and Settlement Services 
Our title and settlement services business, TRG, provides full-service title and settlement (i.e., closing and escrow) services to real estate companies and financial institutions. We act in the capacity of a title agent and sell title insurance to property buyers and mortgage lenders. We are licensed as a title agent in 42 states and Washington, D.C., and have physical locations in 25 states and Washington, D.C. We issue title insurance policies on behalf of large national underwriters as well as through our Dallas-based subsidiary, Title Resources Guaranty Company ("Title Resources"). Title Resources is a title insurance underwriter licensed in 31 states and Washington, D.C. We operate mostly in major metropolitan areas. As of December 31, 2017, we had approximately 443 offices, approximately 218 of which are co-located within one of our company owned brokerage offices.
Virtually all lenders require their borrowers to obtain title insurance policies at the time mortgage loans are made on real property. The terms and conditions upon which the real property will be insured are determined in accordance with the standard policies and procedures of the title underwriter. When our title agencies sell title insurance, the title search and examination function is performed by the agent. The title agent and underwriter split the premium. The amount of such premium "split" is determined by agreement between the agency and underwriter, or is promulgated by state law. We derive 
16

revenue through fees charged in real estate transactions for rendering the services described above, fees charged for escrow and closing services, and a percentage of the title premium on each title insurance policy sold. We have entered into underwriting agreements with various underwriters, which state the conditions under which we may issue a title insurance policy on their behalf. For policies issued through our agency operations, assuming no negligence on our part, we are not typically liable for losses under those policies; rather the title insurer is typically liable for such losses. 
Our company owned brokerage operations are the principal source of our title and settlement services business for homesale transactions. Other sources of our title and settlement services homesale business include our real estate franchise business, Cartus and unaffiliated brokerage operations. In addition, in July 2017, TRG completed the formation of a national commercial title services division. For refinance transactions, we generate title and escrow revenues from our mortgage origination joint venture and other financial institutions throughout the mortgage lending industry. Many of our offices have subleased space from, and are co-located within, our company owned brokerage offices. The capture rate of our title and settlement services business from company owned brokerage operations was approximately 39% in 2017.
We coordinate a national network of escrow and closing agents (some of whom are our employees, while others are attorneys in private practice and independent title companies) to provide full-service title and settlement services to a broad-based group that includes lenders, home buyers and sellers, developers and independent real estate sales agents. Our role is generally that of an intermediary managing the completion of all the necessary documentation and services required to complete a real estate transaction.
Our title and settlement services business measures operating performance based on purchase and refinance closing units and the related title premiums and escrow fees earned on such closings. In addition, we measure net title premiums earned for title policies issued by our underwriting operation. 
The following chart illustrates the key drivers for revenue generated by our title and settlement services business:
We intend to grow our title and settlement services business by attracting title and escrow sales agents in existing markets and, to a lesser extent, by completing acquisitions to expand our geographic footprint or complement existing operations. We will also continue to seek to increase our capture rate of title business from our NRT homesale sides. In addition, we expect to continue to grow and diversify our lender channel and our underwriting businesses by expanding and adding clients and increasing our agent base, respectively.
The equity earnings or losses related to Guaranteed Rate Affinity, our mortgage origination joint venture that began doing business on a phased-in basis in August 2017, are included in the financial results of TRG. The equity earnings or losses related to our former mortgage origination joint venture, PHH Home Loans, were included in the financial results of NRT.
Marketing and Technology 
The marketing and technology services and support provided by independent sales agents to their customers are an important element of the value offered by an agent in the home purchase and sale process. Our commitment to continuously develop and improve our marketing and technology products and service is part of our value proposition to our company owned and franchised real estate brokerages, affiliated independent sales agents and their customers as well as to our relocation and title and settlement services segments. Increasingly, these products and services are desired on as an integrated tool, rather than stand-alone products and services. We have expended, and expect to continue to expend, substantial time, capital, and other resources to identify the needs of our company owned brokerages, franchisees, independent sales agents and their customers and to develop marketing, technology and service offerings to meet the needs of our affiliated independent sales agents.
Real Estate Franchise Operations. Each of our franchise brands operates a marketing fund that is funded principally by our franchisees, with some contributions from us. The focus of each marketing fund is to build and maintain brand awareness and preference for the brand and drive leads to our franchisees and their affiliated independent sales agents, 
17

which is accomplished through a variety of media, including but not limited to social media, advertising, direct marketing and internet advertising.
The Zap platform is the foundation of our online marketing technology strategy. Zap is designed to leverage the collective strength of each brand online, and is updated frequently in order to keep up with changing needs of brokers, agents and consumers to continually strengthen our value proposition. Zap currently powers the Better Homes and Gardens Real Estate, Century 21, Coldwell Banker and ERA brand websites. Each of these brands also leverage Zap’s mobile applications for iPhone, iPad and Android. These mobile applications empower independent sales agents to access contact information and behavioral data as well as respond to requests in Zap while outside of the office. Each independent sales agent also has a personally-branded mobile application that they can customize with their own content and use to market themselves.  We believe the Zap technology platform is designed to increase the value proposition to our franchisees, their independent sales agents and their customers by:

• | aiding in lead generation and obtaining additional homesale transactions for our franchisees and their independent sales agents;


• | connecting those agents to a predictive customer relationship management (CRM) tool;


• | enhancing access to listing distributions through mobile applications and websites; and


• | informing them with valuable client insight to help those agents increase their productivity.

Our brand websites contain listing information on a regional and national market basis, independent sales agent information, community profiles, home buying and selling advice, relocation tips and mortgage financing information and unique property and neighborhood insights from local agents. The Zap technology platform is designed to empower affiliated sales agents and brokers to cultivate productive relationships with consumers at all stages of the transaction. The Zap technology platform also is intended to provide consumers with a streamlined yet comprehensive user experience to facilitate the necessary steps for researching homes, communities and independent sales agents.
Each brand manages a comprehensive system of marketing tools, systems and sales information and data that can be accessed through freestanding brand intranet sites to assist independent sales agents in becoming the best marketer of their listings. In addition to the Sotheby's International Realty® brand, a leading luxury brand, our franchisees and our company owned brokerages also participate in luxury marketing programs, such as Century 21 Fine Homes & Estates®, Coldwell Banker Global Luxury, ERA® Distinctive Properties and Distinctive Collection by Better Homes and Gardens® Real Estate.
Advertising is primarily used by the brands to drive consumers to their respective websites and in turn convert leads to the independent sales agents of our franchisees. Significant focus is placed on developing websites for each brand to create value to the real estate consumer. Each brand website focuses on streamlined, easy search processes for listing inventory and rich descriptive details, multiple photos, full motion videos and in some cases virtual reality tours to market the real estate listing. Additionally, each brand website serves as a national distribution point for independent sales agents to market themselves to consumers to enhance the customer experience. We also place significant emphasis on distributing our real estate listings with third-party websites to expand a homebuyer's access to such listings, at times enhancing the presentation of the listings on third-party websites to make the listings more attractive to consumers. Consumers seeking more detailed information about a particular listing on a third-party website are able to click through to a brand website or a company owned brokerage website or telephone the franchisee or company owned brokerage directly.
Company Owned Brokerage Operations. Our company owned brokerages sponsor a wide array of marketing programs, materials and opportunities to complement the sales work of our affiliated independent sales agents and increase brand awareness. The effectiveness and quality of marketing programs play a significant role in attracting and retaining independent sales agents.
NRT's sponsored marketing programs and initiatives primarily focus on attracting potential new home buyers and sellers to NRT's affiliated independent sales agents. These programs and initiatives also complement the awareness of our brands by increasing the local recognition of our agents and local brokerages.
Much of our marketing efforts are geared toward showcasing the inventory of our real estate listings and the affiliated independent sales agents who are the selling agents of these listings. In addition to prominently placing the listing property and related selling agent information on numerous real estate websites, we promote the selling agents and their properties on social media sites and offer tools and systems intended to enhance the home buying and home selling experiences of our 
18

customers. We also offer the independent sales agents broad-based advertising, mailings and other campaigns to generate leads, interest and recognition.
The Internet has become the primary advertising channel in our industry and we have sought to become a leader among full-service residential real estate brokerage firms in the use and application of marketing technology. We place our property listings on hundreds of real estate websites and we operate a variety of our own websites.
NRT also utilizes both proprietary and third-party technology to offer independent sales agents tools that may enhance their productivity and increase their understanding of their local markets and the impact of their marketing efforts. Some of these tools include the HomeBase Transaction Management and InTouch CRM systems, as well as MarketQuest and e-Marketing reporting tools.
Education
Each real estate brand provides learning and development materials and access to continuing education to its franchisees to assist them in building their real estate sales businesses. Each brand's engagement program contains different materials and delivery methods. The marketing materials include a detailed description of the services offered by our franchise systems (which will be available to the independent sales agent). Live instructors at conventions and orientation seminars deliver some engagement modules while other modules can be viewed by brokers anywhere in the world through virtual classrooms over the Internet. Most of the programs and materials are then made available in electronic form to franchisees over the respective system's private intranet site. Many of the materials are customizable to allow franchisees to achieve a personalized look and feel and make modifications to certain content as appropriate for their business and marketplace.
Employees 
At December 31, 2017, we had approximately 11,800 employees, including approximately 840 employees outside of the U.S. None of our employees are represented by a union. We believe that our employee relations are good.
Seasonality
The residential housing market is seasonal, with a higher level of homesale transactions typically occurring in the second and third quarter of each year. As a result, historically, operating results and revenues for all of our businesses have been strongest in the second and third quarters of the calendar year. 
Competition 
Real Estate Brokerage Industry. The residential real estate brokerage industry is highly competitive with low barriers to entry for new participants. Recruitment and retention of independent sales agents and independent sales agent teams are critical to the business and financial results of a brokerage—whether or not they are affiliated with a franchisor. Most of a brokerage's real estate listings are sourced through the sphere of influence of their independent sales agents, notwithstanding the growing influence of internet-generated leads. Competition for independent sales agents in our industry is high and has intensified particularly with respect to more productive independent sales agents.  Competition for independent sales agents is generally subject to numerous factors, including remuneration (such as sales commission percentage and other financial incentives paid to independent sales agents), other expenses borne by independent sales agents, leads or business opportunities generated for the independent sales agent from the brokerage, independent sales agents' perception of the value of the broker's brand affiliation, marketing and advertising efforts by the brokerage or franchisor, the office manager, staff and fellow independent sales agents with whom they collaborate daily, as well as technology, continuing professional education, and other services provided by the brokerage or franchisor. See "Item 7.—Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Key Drivers" for a discussion of the various compensation models being utilized by real estate brokerages to compensate their independent sales agents.
According to NAR, approximately 43% of individual brokers and independent sales agents are affiliated with a franchisor. Competition among the national real estate brokerage brand franchisors to grow their franchise systems is intense. We believe that competition for the sale of franchises in the real estate brokerage industry is based principally upon the perceived value that the franchisor provides to enhance the franchisee's ability to grow its business and improve the recruitment, retention and productivity of its independent sales agents. The value provided by a franchisor encompasses many different aspects including the quality of the brand, tools, technology, marketing and other services, the availability of 
19

financing provided to the franchisees, and the fees the franchisees must pay. Our largest national competitors in this industry include, but are not limited to, three large franchisors: Keller Williams Realty, Inc.; HSF Affiliates LLC (a joint venture controlled by HomeServices of America that operates Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices and Real Living Real Estate); and RE/MAX International, Inc.
Our company owned brokerages compete with national independent real estate brokerages, franchisees of national and regional real estate franchisors, including our own brands and the other national franchisors described in the preceding paragraph, regional independent real estate brokerages and discount and limited service brokerages. We and others within the industry also encounter competition from companies that employ technologies intended to disrupt the traditional brokerage model or eliminate brokers or agents from, or minimize the role they play in, the homesale transaction, such as through the reduction of brokerage commissions. Other non-traditional models that operate outside of the brokerage industry, such as companies that leverage capital to purchase homes directly from sellers, have also been gaining market attention in recent years. Certain of our competitors are also increasingly well-funded, which strengthens their competitive position and ability to offer aggressive compensation arrangements to top-performing sales agents. Moreover, a growing number of companies are competing in non-traditional ways for a portion of the gross commission income generated by homesale transactions. For example, listing aggregators and other web-based real estate service providers not only compete for our company owned brokerage business by establishing relationships with independent sales agents and/or buyers and sellers of homes, they also increasingly charge brokerages and independent sales agents for advertising on their sites.
The ability of our real estate brokerage franchisees and our company owned brokerage businesses to successfully compete is important to our prospects for growth. Their ability to compete may be affected by the recruitment, retention and performance of independent sales agents, the location of offices and target markets, the services provided to independent sales agents, the fees charged to independent sales agents, the number and nature of competing offices in the vicinity, affiliation with a recognized brand name, community reputation, technology and other factors. A franchisee's success may also be affected by national, regional and local economic conditions.
Relocation Business. Competition in our corporate relocation business is based on capabilities, price and quality. We compete primarily with global outsourced and regional relocation services providers in the corporate relocation business. The larger outsourced relocation services providers that we compete with include BGRS, SIRVA, Inc. and Weichert Relocation Resources, Inc. Competition is expected to continue to intensify as an increasingly higher percentage of relocation clients reduce their global relocation benefits and related spend.
Title and Settlement Business. The title and settlement business is highly competitive and fragmented. The number and size of competing companies vary in the different areas in which we conduct business. In certain parts of the country we compete with small title agents and attorneys while in other parts of the country our competition is the larger title underwriters and national vendor management companies. In addition, we compete with the various brands of national competitors including Fidelity National Title Insurance Company, First American Title Insurance Company, Stewart Title Guaranty Company and Old Republic Title Company.
Government Regulation 
Franchise Regulation. In the U.S., the sale of franchises is regulated by various state laws, as well as by the Federal Trade Commission (the "FTC"). The FTC requires that franchisors make extensive disclosure to prospective franchisees but does not require registration. A number of states require registration and/or disclosure in connection with franchise offers and sales. In addition, several states have "franchise relationship laws" or "business opportunity laws" that limit the ability of the franchisor to terminate franchise agreements or to withhold consent to the renewal or transfer of these agreements. The states with relationship or other statutes governing the termination of franchises include Alaska, Arkansas, California, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Nebraska, New Jersey, Rhode Island, Virginia, Washington and Wisconsin. Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands also have statutes governing termination of franchises. Some franchise relationship statutes require a mandated notice period for termination and some require a notice and cure period. In addition, some require that the franchisor demonstrate good cause for termination. These statutes do not have a substantial effect on our operations because our franchise agreements generally comport with the statutory requirements for cause for termination, and they provide notice and cure periods for most defaults. When the franchisee is granted a statutory period longer than permitted under the franchise agreement, we extend our notice and/or cure periods to match the statutory requirements. In some states, case law requires a franchisor to renew a franchise agreement unless a franchisee has given cause for non-renewal. Failure to comply with these laws could result in civil liability to the affected franchisees. While our franchising operations have not been materially adversely affected by such existing regulation, we cannot predict the effect of any future federal or state legislation or regulation. Internationally, many countries have similar laws affecting franchising.
Real Estate Regulation.  RESPA, state real estate brokerage laws and similar laws in countries in which we do business restrict payments which real estate brokers, title agencies, mortgage bankers, mortgage brokers and other settlement service providers may receive or pay in connection with the sales of residences and referral of settlement services (e.g., mortgages, homeowners insurance and title insurance). Such laws may to some extent impose limitations on preferred alliance and other arrangements involving our real estate franchise, real estate brokerage, settlement services and relocation businesses or the business of our mortgage origination joint venture. In addition, with respect to our company owned real estate brokerage, relocation and title and settlement services businesses as well as our mortgage origination joint venture, RESPA and similar state laws require timely disclosure of certain relationships or financial interests with providers of real estate settlement services.
RESPA and related regulations do, however, contain a number of provisions that allow for payments or fee splits between providers, including fee splits between brokers and agents and market-based fees for the provision of actual goods or services.  In addition, RESPA allows for referrals to affiliated entities, including joint ventures, when specific requirements have been met.  We rely on these provisions in conducting our business activities and believe our arrangements comply with RESPA.  RESPA compliance, however, has become a greater challenge in recent years for most industry participants offering settlement services, including mortgage companies, title companies and brokerages, because of changes in the regulatory environment and expansive interpretations of RESPA or similar state statutes by certain courts.
Pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act ("Dodd-Frank"), administration of RESPA has been moved from the Department of Housing and Urban Development ("HUD") to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (the "CFPB"). The CFPB has taken, in the recent past, a much stricter approach toward interpretation of RESPA and related regulations than HUD and has significantly increased the use of enforcement proceedings.  In the face of this changing regulatory landscape, various industry participants, while disagreeing with the CFPB’s narrow interpretation of RESPA, have nevertheless decided to modify or terminate long-standing business arrangements to avoid the risk of protracted and costly litigation defending such arrangements. At present, leadership at the CFPB is in transition, with a new acting director. In the message accompanying the new five-year Strategic Plan published by the CFPB in February 2018, the acting director summarized the changes at the CFPB -- to fulfill its statutory responsibilities, but to go no further. The 
20

Strategic Plan notes that the CFPB will focus on protecting the legal rights of consumers while engaging in rulemaking where appropriate to address unwarranted regulatory burdens. Beyond the CFPB enforcement practices, private RESPA litigation may also be pursued, including an action settled by us, our former joint venture and PHH that is described in Note 13, "Commitments and Contingencies—Litigation", to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report. In addition, permissible activities under state statutes similar to RESPA may be interpreted more narrowly and enforcement proceedings of those statutes by state regulatory authorities may also be aggressively pursued.
Our company owned real estate brokerage business is also subject to numerous federal, state and local laws and regulations that contain general standards for and limitations on the conduct of real estate brokers and sales agents, including those relating to the licensing of brokers and sales agents, fiduciary and agency duties, consumer disclosure obligations, administration of trust funds, collection of commissions, restrictions on information sharing with affiliates, fair housing standards and advertising and consumer disclosures. Under state law, our company owned real estate brokers have certain duties to supervise and are responsible for the conduct of their brokerage businesses. Although real estate sales agents historically have been classified as independent contractors, newer rules and interpretations of state and federal employment laws and regulations, including those governing employee classification and wage and hour regulations, may impact industry practices and our company owned brokerage operations. Real estate licensing laws generally permit brokers to engage sales agents as independent contractors but require that the broker supervise their activities.
Regulation of Title Insurance and Settlement Services. Many states license and regulate title agencies/settlement service providers or certain employees and underwriters through their Departments of Insurance or other regulatory body. In many states, title insurance rates are either promulgated by the state or are required to be filed with each state by the agent or underwriter, and some states promulgate the split of title insurance premiums between the agent and underwriter. States sometimes unilaterally lower the insurance rates relative to loss experience and other relevant factors. States also require title agencies and title underwriters to meet certain minimum financial requirements for net worth and working capital. In addition, the insurance laws and regulations of Texas, the jurisdiction in which our title insurance underwriter subsidiary, Title Resources, is domiciled, generally provide that no person may acquire control, directly or indirectly, of a Texas domiciled insurer, unless the person has provided required information to, and the acquisition is approved or not disapproved by, the Texas Department of Insurance. Generally, any person acquiring beneficial ownership of 10% or more of our voting securities would be presumed to have acquired indirect control of our title insurance underwriter subsidiary unless the Texas Department of Insurance, upon application, determines otherwise. Our insurance underwriter is also subject to a holding company act in its state of domicile, which regulates, among other matters, investment policies and the ability to pay dividends.
Certain states in which we operate have "controlled business" statutes which impose limitations on affiliations between providers of title and settlement services, on the one hand, and real estate brokers, mortgage lenders and other real estate service providers, on the other hand. We are aware of the states imposing such limits and monitor the others to ensure that if they implement such a limit that we will be prepared to comply with any such rule. "Controlled business" typically is defined as sources controlled by, or which control, directly or indirectly, the title insurer or agent. Pursuant to legislation enacted in the State of New York in late 2014 requiring the licensing of title agents, the New York Department of Insurance has issued regulations that provide that title agents with affiliated businesses must make a good faith effort to obtain, and be open for, title insurance business from all sources and not business only from affiliated persons, including actively competing in the marketplace. We are not aware of any other recent or pending controlled business legislation. A company's failure to comply with such statutes could result in the non-renewal of the Company's license to provide title and settlement services. We provide our services not only to our affiliates but also to third-party businesses in the geographic areas in which we operate. Accordingly, we manage our business in a manner to comply with any applicable "controlled business" statutes by ensuring that we generate sufficient business from sources we do not control. We have never been cited for failing to comply with a "controlled business" statute.
Regulation of the Mortgage Industry by the Dodd-Frank Act. Dodd-Frank endows the CFPB with rule making, examination and enforcement authority involving consumer financial products and services, including mortgage finance.  The CFPB has issued a myriad of proposed and final rules which could materially and adversely affect the mortgage and housing industries.  Dodd-Frank establishes new standards and practices for mortgage originators, including determining a prospective borrower's ability to repay its mortgage and restricting the fees that mortgage originators may collect.
Cybersecurity and Data Privacy Regulations. We are required to comply with regulations both in the United States and in other countries where we do business that regulate cybersecurity and related matters. For example, on March 1, 2017, new cybersecurity rules took effect for financial institutions, insurers and certain other companies, including our title and settlement services subsidiary, supervised by the New York Department of Financial Services (the “NYDFS 
21

Cybersecurity Regulation”). The NYDFS Cybersecurity Regulation imposes new regulatory burdens intended to protect the confidentiality, integrity and availability of information systems.
In addition, we are required to comply with increasingly complex and changing data privacy regulations both in the United States and in other countries and territories where we do business that regulate the collection, use and transfer of personal data, including particularly the transfer of personal data between or among countries. These laws and their interpretations continue to develop and may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. In many cases, these laws apply not only to third-party transactions, but also to transfers of information between us and our subsidiaries, including employee information. Many of these foreign data privacy regulations (including the General Data Protection Regulation, which becomes effective in the European Union on May 25, 2018) are more stringent than those in the United States and may result in significantly greater compliance burdens and costs. In addition, non-compliance with these regulations could result in penalties or significant legal liability for our acts and, potentially, for acts of companies that perform services on our behalf.
