Item 1.  Business
Company Overview
Unless the context otherwise requires, “we,” “us,” “our,” “Envision” and the “Company” refer to the business of Envision Healthcare Corporation and its subsidiaries. References herein to “AmSurg” refer to AmSurg Corp. and references herein to “EHH” refer to Envision Healthcare Holdings, Inc., in each case prior to the completion of the Merger (as defined below). 
We are a nationwide provider of healthcare services, offering a highly differentiated array of clinical solutions, including physician-led services and ambulatory services. We empower physicians in aligning with health systems, payors and communities forming high-performing clinical networks. We strive to be the trusted strategic partner for providers, health systems, communities and payors in the common pursuit of the highest quality of care for the patients we serve.
On December 1, 2016, AmSurg and EHH completed the merger and the strategic combination (the Merger) of their respective businesses. While the Merger was a merger of equals of AmSurg and EHH, AmSurg was the accounting acquirer in the Merger; therefore, the historical consolidated financial statements of AmSurg for periods prior to the Merger are considered to be the historical financial statements of the Company. The Company’s consolidated financial statements for 2016 included in this report reflect AmSurg’s consolidated operations for the period from January 1, 2016 to November 30, 2016, and the Company’s consolidated operations for the period from December 1, 2016 to December 31, 2016. On December 2, 2016, shares of the common stock of the Company began trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol “EVHC.” 
The Merger combined two leaders to create a premier healthcare services provider organization offering clinical solutions on a national scale, enabling the Company to create value for health systems, payors, providers and patients. AmSurg has more than 25 years of operating history in the ambulatory surgery business and more than 50 years of operating history in the physician services business, primarily in anesthesia services. EHH has more than 40 years of operating history in the physician services business, primarily in emergency services. We market our services on a stand-alone, multi-service or integrated basis combining two or more services. We believe our physician-centric culture and integrated care model benefits providers and patients by improving the quality of care and reducing the total cost of care.
On February 28, 2017, we announced that we would explore strategic alternatives for our medical transportation business, American Medical Response (AMR). On August 7, 2017, we entered into a definitive agreement to divest AMR to an entity controlled by funds affiliated with Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. L.P. (KKR) for approximately $2.4 billion in cash. As a result, the medical transportation business is no longer a separate reportable segment. The transaction is subject to regulatory approval and customary closing conditions, including clearance under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act. We received a second request from the FTC asking for further information related to the transaction, and the buyer has agreed to certain divestiture remedies to address concerns raised by the FTC. We expect that the transaction will be completed during the first quarter of 2018.
We have aligned our financial results into two reportable segments: physician services and ambulatory services. The physician services segment includes the Company’s hospital-based and non-hospital-based physician services businesses. The ambulatory services segment includes the Company’s ambulatory surgery business, which acquires, develops, owns and operates ambulatory surgery centers (ASCs) and surgical hospitals in partnership with physicians and health systems. For the year ended December 31, 2017, approximately 84% and 16% of our revenues were generated by our physician services segment and ambulatory services segment, respectively. For additional information about our reportable segments, please see "Note 21 - Segment Reporting" to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data in this report.
Recent Developments 
On October 31, 2017, we announced that our Board of Directors (our Board), in consultation with management and financial and legal advisors, had unanimously initiated a full review of a broad range of strategic alternatives to enhance stockholder value. The Board has not set a timetable for completion of its review. There can be no assurance that this review will result in a transaction or other alternatives of any kind, or if such strategic alternative does occur, that it will successfully enhance stockholder value.

Competitive Strengths 
National physician-led healthcare services company offering a broad array of services. The Merger combined two leading, complementary healthcare services companies to form one of the nation’s largest provider organizations, well-positioned to help shape the future of healthcare delivery. Currently, we manage a broad array of clinical network solutions, including physician-led services and ambulatory services. We believe our scale and breadth of services in a fragmented marketplace allows us to be the most trusted and highest quality strategic partner for health systems, healthcare providers, payors, patients and communities in the common pursuit of the highest quality of care for the patients we serve. Additionally, our portfolio of service offerings creates value by delivering integrated physician-centric care to systems, payors and patients, and positions us favorably for growth and long-term leadership as the dynamic healthcare landscape continues to evolve.
Opportunities for accelerated growth. We operate in the physician services and ambulatory services markets, two large and growing segments that are supported by favorable demographic shifts. We have a track record of delivering strong growth through a combination of organic growth, new contract additions and selective acquisitions. Organic growth has historically been supported by consistent underlying market volume trends, stable pricing and a diversified payor mix. Historically, market volumes have been driven primarily by the non-discretionary nature of our services, aging demographics and primary care physician shortages that drive patients to emergency rooms. We believe that our networks of high-quality providers position us to take advantage of these trends, even during periods of slower inpatient utilization growth for certain of our healthcare system customers. 

We have successfully executed on new contract growth by providing a set of differentiated services and delivering integrated, efficient, high-quality care, which has helped us expand our relationships with our existing customers and compete effectively in the bidding process for new contracts. We intend to continue to expand our existing customer relationships and capitalize on greenfield opportunities as we seek to increase our new contract growth, which represents the majority of the anticipated revenue synergies of the Merger. Additionally, we believe we will have opportunities to expand our services to the health systems we currently serve. We also have a strong track record of executing on and integrating select acquisition opportunities. We expect that the fragmented nature of the segments in which we operate, in particular the physician services segment, in addition to the strength of our operating platform, will aid in increasing our near- and long-term acquisition pipelines.
Strong financial profile with attractive cash flow and deleveraging profile. We have historically achieved revenue growth and attractive margins while maintaining a strong balance sheet. We have a diversified business mix across our segments, geographies and clients, as well as significant cash flow, which we expect to deploy opportunistically for acquisitions, thereby driving growth while also reducing leverage ratios.
Focus on clinical excellence. We are focused on achieving the best clinical outcomes for our patients through the application of rigorous recruiting and credentialing standards, the promotion of a physician-led leadership culture and the monitoring of our clinical quality measures. Through extensive clinical and leadership development programs, we train our healthcare professionals to continually enhance their skills and deliver innovative and patient-focused experiences and outcomes. Our healthcare professionals are supported through our specialty-specific networks, which are led by our physician senior leadership. We provide internally developed continuing medical education accredited courses to our healthcare professionals, including instructor-led and on-line education sessions. We have developed and implemented quality measurement systems that track multiple key indicators, which assist our professionals in systematically monitoring, examining and analyzing outcomes and processes. These quality measurement systems are supplemented by our active peer review infrastructure designed to ensure the development and implementation of actionable items that will improve patient outcomes. Our ability to deliver high levels of customer service and patient care is a direct result of this focus, which helps us to differentiate our services, and to attract and retain providers.
Ability to attract and retain high-quality providers. Through our recruiting databases and processes, we are able to identify and target high-quality providers to match the needs of our customers. We believe that our national presence and operating infrastructure enable us to provide attractive opportunities for our providers to enhance their skills through extensive clinical and leadership development programs. We believe that our differentiated recruiting, training and development programs strengthen our customer and provider relationships, enhance our strong contract and clinician retention rates and allow us to efficiently recruit providers to support our robust new contract pipeline across each of our service lines.
Business Strategy
Capitalize on organic growth opportunities. Our scale, scope and long operating history, combined with our value-enhancing initiatives, provide us with competitive advantages to continue to grow our business. We believe that our integrated service offerings, differentiated and data-driven clinical quality processes, scalable technology and sophisticated risk management programs improve the 

2


Item 1. Business - (continued) 

quality and efficiency of care, creating value for health systems, payors and patients. We also believe our physician-led, patient-focused culture and approach to clinical solutions will allow us to continue to successfully recruit and retain clinical professionals.
Grow complementary and integrated service lines. Our continued focus on expanding our existing relationships and integrated service offerings has helped health systems, communities and payors realize economic benefits and clinical value for patients. We plan to expand and integrate the delivery of our differentiated suite of services across our existing customer base. We believe that our ability to expand our existing relationships will be enhanced by our strong reputation, our national footprint, and strong relationships with our health system customers.
Supplement organic growth with strategic acquisitions. The segments in which we compete are highly fragmented, presenting significant opportunities for organic growth and additional acquisitions. We have a successful track record of completing and integrating select acquisitions. This has enhanced our presence in existing markets, facilitated our entry into new geographies and expanded the scope of our services. We will continue to follow a disciplined strategy in exploring future acquisitions by analyzing the strategic rationale, financial impact and organic growth profile of each potential opportunity. From time to time, we perform strategic reviews of our business lines, and may pursue strategic initiatives in the future, including divestitures, acquisitions, spin-offs, split-offs, strategic partnerships or joint ventures.
Enhance operational efficiencies and productivity. We believe there are significant opportunities to continue to build upon our success in improving our productivity and profitability. We continue to focus on initiatives to improve productivity, including more efficient scheduling, continued use of mid-level providers, enhancing our leadership training programs, improving and realigning compensation programs and providing certain shared services across our businesses. We believe that our processes related to managed care contracting, billing, coding, collection and compliance have driven a strong track record of efficient revenue cycle management. We have made significant investments in infrastructure, including management information systems that we believe will continue to enable us to improve clinical results and key client metrics while reducing the cost of providing patient care. We have dedicated teams with business and clinical expertise that are responsible for implementing best practices. Furthermore, in all segments, we will continue to utilize risk mitigation programs for loss prevention and early intervention, including continued use of clinical “fail-safes” and other technology. We believe that our significant investments in scalable technology systems will facilitate additional cost reductions and efficiencies.
Physician Services Segment
We are a leading national provider of multispecialty physician services to our health system clients, including hospitals, ASCs and other healthcare facilities. As of December 31, 2017, we had physician services contracts, primarily in the areas of emergency department and hospitalist services, anesthesiology services, radiology/tele-radiology services and children's services, covering more than 1,800 clinical departments in healthcare facilities in 45 states and the District of Columbia, and over 25,200 employed or affiliated physicians and other healthcare professionals. The market for physician services is fragmented in each of our specialties, and is serviced by national, regional and local providers. For the year ended December 31, 2017, Arizona, California, Florida, New Jersey and Texas accounted for approximately 62% of our physician services segment net revenue.
We, or our affiliated entities, recruit and hire or contract with physicians and other healthcare professionals, who then provide services to patients in the facilities with which we contract. We bill and collect from each patient or the patient’s insurance provider for the medical services performed. We also have agreements with independent physician groups and hospitals to provide management services such as billing and collection, recruiting, risk management and certain other administrative services. 
The following table presents the physician services revenue mix from our primary specialties for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016. Revenue mix for the year ended December 31, 2016 is presented on a pro forma combined basis, assuming the Merger was completed on January 1, 2016.

 | Revenue Mix
 | 2017 | | 2016
Emergency department and hospitalist services | 54 | % | | 55 | %
Anesthesiology services | 28 | | | 27 | 
Radiology services | 8 | | | 5 |

Emergency Department (ED) and Hospitalist Services
We are a leading national provider of emergency medicine services to hospitals, freestanding emergency care facilities, and urgent care facilities in the United States. Emergency departments are an essential access point for medical services and are a primary source of patient admissions to hospitals and other facilities. Consequently, hospitals require efficient and effectively operated emergency departments, often turning to third-party providers with greater experience and resources. We believe that ED utilization trends and cost pressures facing hospitals have resulted in an increased focus by facilities on improving the operating efficiency of their EDs.
We provide inpatient physician services, or hospitalist medicine services, for hospital patients who have no primary care physician or have an attending physician who requests that our hospitalist manage the patient. We help reduce the average length of stay for patients. Inpatient service physicians are also an integral part of the post-discharge coordination of patient care by directing how care outside the hospital setting should be established and coordinated by improving the care coordination through effective working relationships with the ED. We believe that effective hospitalist programs result in better patient outcomes and lower costs. We frequently provide hospitalist services to our customers in combination with other physician services. During 2017, our ED and hospitalist medicine providers handled more than 19.3 million emergency room visits.
Anesthesiology Services
We are a leading national provider of anesthesia services in the United States. Our anesthesia care teams provide anesthesiology services to hospitals, ASCs and other healthcare facilities. These teams are typically comprised of board-certified physicians and allied health professionals. Our anesthesiologists are a key part of the effective management and productivity of hospital surgery departments, ASCs and other healthcare facilities. During 2017, our anesthesia professionals handled more than 2.9 million anesthetic cases.
Radiology/Tele-radiology Services
We are a leading national provider of radiology services, including diagnostic, interventional and tele-radiology services, to hospitals, imaging centers and physician group practices in the United States. Many of our radiologists provide their services at healthcare facilities where they interpret all modalities of radiology images. They can consult directly with attending physicians, providing prompt, accurate interpretations, which promotes the professional development of our radiologists as they interact constantly with the physicians at our clients’ facilities. During 2017, our radiology professionals interpreted over 9.9 million studies.
Children’s Services
We are a leading national provider of children’s services in the United States. Through our children's services teams, which include on-site medical directors, physicians and nurse practitioners, we provide neonatal management services at our healthcare facility partners' neonatal intensive care units (NICUs). We continue to expand our provision of children’s services in pediatric hospitalist, pediatric intensivist and pediatric emergency medicine subspecialties. During 2017, our children’s services professionals supported approximately 300,000 patient days.
Other Services
Surgery Services. We offer management, oversight and surgeon staffing for trauma surgery services. This service gives hospitals the opportunity to raise their trauma designation by providing expanded coverage for and management of surgery services.
Post-Acute Care Services. We provide direct patient care and care coordination by clinicians outside the acute care setting through physician-led post-acute care services, including transitional care teams and tele-monitoring and tele-medicine. We serve patients who require comprehensive care across various settings, many of whom suffer from advanced illnesses and chronic diseases. We believe that providers of care management solutions outside the hospital can offer an attractive value proposition. 
Office-Based Services. We operate groups of office-based medical practices that primarily focus on women’s health and provide services in the areas of gynecology and obstetrics. We maintain and operate our office-based practices in communities where the practices support and integrate with our facilities-based specialties, providing additional value to our healthcare facility clients through coordination of care. We provide management services to affiliated office-based practices and typically manage all aspects of the practice other than the provision of medical services, except in jurisdictions where we are permitted to also provide clinical management services.

Item 1. Business - (continued) 

Support Services 
We provide a full range of hospital-based physician staffing and related management services for each of our physician services specialties, which include:
Contract Management. We utilize an integrated approach to contract management that involves physicians, non-clinical business experts and operational and quality assurance specialists. An on-site medical director responsible for the day-to-day oversight of the relationship, including clinical quality, works closely with the facility’s management in developing strategic initiatives and objectives. A quality manager develops site-specific quality improvement programs, and a practice improvement staff focuses on chart documentation, operational improvement and physician utilization patterns. 
Staffing. We provide healthcare facilities with a full range of staffing services to ensure that each contract is staffed with the appropriate mix of qualified physicians and other medical professionals. Our dedicated clinical teams include qualified physicians and other healthcare professionals responsible for the delivery of high-quality, cost-effective care. These teams also rely on managerial personnel, many of whom have clinical experience, who oversee the administration and operations of the clinical area. 
Recruiting. Many healthcare facilities lack the dedicated resources and expertise necessary to identify and attract specialized physicians. Our marketing and recruiting staff utilizes our proprietary recruiting support systems and databases to increase the success and efficiency of our recruiters and our physician retention rates.
Scheduling. Our scheduling departments schedule, or assist our medical directors in scheduling, physicians and other healthcare professionals in accordance with the coverage model at each facility. We provide 24-hour service to ensure that unscheduled situations such as physician illness and personal emergencies do not result in a disruption of coverage.
Operational Improvement Assessments. On behalf of our hospital customers, we implement process improvement programs that are directed toward enhancement of operating and triage systems, and improvement of critical operational metrics, including turnaround times, “left without being treated,” and throughput times. These programs are delivered to the clinical and non-clinical members of the hospital ED as well as other areas of a healthcare facility where services are being provided.
Practice Support Services. In some situations, facilities and physician groups that are not contracted or affiliated with us are interested in receiving stand-alone management services such as billing and collection, scheduling, recruitment and risk management, and at times we unbundle our services to meet these needs. We provide these services to independent physician groups and healthcare facilities under practice support agreements that generally have a term of one to three years.
Physician Services Segment Overview
The growing complexity of the healthcare delivery system has led many healthcare facilities to increasingly engage third-party providers to provide medical coverage and administrative functions to improve productivity, increase the overall quality of care and reduce administrative costs. We believe the primary clinical areas we serve, which include emergency and hospitalist medicine, anesthesiology, radiology and children’s services, are specialties that are extremely important lines of service for the overall provision of care. The market for services in our specialties tends to be highly fragmented and is predominantly served by smaller group practices.
We believe our physician services segment is well-positioned to benefit from certain trends including the following:
Shift towards national providers of physician services. Hospitals, ASCs and other healthcare facilities are increasingly utilizing national providers of healthcare professionals as a means of achieving targeted physician coverage levels, including by addressing difficulties in hiring and retaining physicians and increasing operational efficiency to improve patient flow, reduce wait times, coordinate care, shorten lengths of stay and reduce readmission rates, all of which lead to lower costs and promote improved patient care. Historically, hospitals, ASCs and other healthcare facilities have relied on local practice groups to provide physician services, but an increasing number have been turning to national physician groups to meet their increasingly complex needs. We are a direct beneficiary of this continuing shift from smaller local groups to larger national provider organizations. We believe we are well positioned to serve as a trusted partner to health systems in their transformation to integrated healthcare delivery networks.
Consolidation of healthcare providers. Historically, healthcare has predominantly been provided through smaller, fragmented local provider groups. However, due to changes in reimbursement, increasing regulatory compliance requirements and growing client demands for quality measurement and cost efficiencies, hospitals, ASCs and other healthcare facilities, in some instances, are increasingly consolidating with one another, provider groups are consolidating into larger groups and individual physicians are 

5


Item 1. Business - (continued) 

seeking larger partners. A significant portion of our growth has come from consolidation with regional provider groups, other acquisitions of smaller physician group practices and new contract wins, all of which have in part been driven by these consolidation trends.
Opportunities created by healthcare reform. The healthcare sector is periodically subject to regulatory, legislative and other political reform initiatives, at the federal and state level, that significantly impact government healthcare programs, reimbursement models, and health insurance coverage. Recent reform initiatives include efforts to shift governmental reimbursement models away from fee for service methodologies toward value-based approaches. In particular, under the Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015 (MACRA), physicians will receive payment incentives or reductions based on their performance with respect to clinical quality, efficiency, clinical improvement activities and meaningful use of electronic health records. We believe our continuing focus on clinical excellence and monitoring the clinical quality of our services positions us favorably to benefit from the shift toward value-based reimbursement models. Other initiatives have increased access to health insurance, including the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (Health Reform Law), and other healthcare reform measures. The Health Reform Law has also increased the obligation of healthcare providers to provide coordinated care and held providers accountable for showing measurable patient outcomes. As a healthcare provider with a national footprint, under the Health Reform Law, as currently in effect, we believe we are in a favorable position to serve the expected growth in patient populations and to meet our clients’ needs for increased coordination and outcomes measurement. However, the Health Reform Law has been modified by congressional action since its enactment, including the repeal of the mandate requiring substantially all U.S. citizens to obtain qualifying health insurance coverage, and may in the future be repealed or further modified as leaders in both the executive and legislative branches of government have stated their intention to do so. See "Government Regulation-Health Reform Law" later in this report.
Increased competition for specialty physicians. With a growing and aging population in the United States, demands for specialty physician services are increasingly outpacing the supply of qualified practitioners. We believe there will be a shortage of physicians in each of our specialties occurring in the next ten years. This growing shortage has led to increasing challenges in recruiting and retaining specialty physicians among hospitals, ASCs and other healthcare facilities, which we believe we can service in part by utilizing other allied healthcare professionals, such as certified registered nurse anesthetists, advanced registered nurse practitioners and physician assistants. Given our expertise in recruiting healthcare professionals in our specialty fields and the attractiveness of our business model to such specialists, we believe we are well-positioned to continue to recruit and retain healthcare professionals and meet the increasing demand for their services in the years to come.
Physician Services Strategy
We intend to grow the revenue and profitability of our physician services segment by:
Delivering distinctive service to our existing client base to drive strong same-contract growth. The foundation of our physician services business lies in how we service our existing base of health system customers. To ensure that we maintain and further strengthen these client relationships, we pursue the following key strategies:

• | expand our national physician services capabilities through management expertise, enhancements in our internal physician recruiting, credentialing and onboarding organizations, further development of our provider quality metrics capabilities and investment in reimbursement technologies;


• | provide our health system clients with a compelling and diverse suite of clinical solutions to deliver on our customers' mandate for increased clinical quality, patient satisfaction and coordination of care;


• | work with our clients to develop increased efficiencies through the application of best practice information regarding physician staffing and procedural turnaround;


• | further advance our relationships with national managed care companies to facilitate favorable contract terms and more efficient revenue cycle management;


• | collaborate with hospitals, ASCs and other healthcare facilities to improve their operations by leveraging the clinical leadership of our physicians at clients’ facilities; and


• | recruit and retain high quality physicians and healthcare professionals by providing clinical resources, comprehensive administrative practice support, competitive compensation and career opportunities.

Organically expanding through new contract wins. The fragmentation of physician services providers creates significant opportunities for organic growth, as we believe that we can provide better solutions for hospitals, ASCs and other healthcare facilities than those offered by smaller provider groups. Our differentiated capabilities and market presence have enabled us to win contracts with both new and existing clients and we expect to continue to capitalize on these trends. Within our existing client base, there is a significant opportunity to win new contracts by expanding our relationships with existing health system partners by adding additional specialties 

6


Item 1. Business - (continued) 

at their facilities. We have significantly invested in expanding the breadth and focus of our physician services segment business development functions. We believe our expanded efforts and dedicated internal resources will position us well to continue to win new contracts.
Executing acquisitions to augment our organic growth. As physician services providers continue to consolidate, we believe we will have the opportunity to augment the organic growth of our physician services segment through opportunistic acquisitions of regional and local providers. We will selectively target strategic “platform” practices for future growth in new geographies and “in-market” practices in geographies where we have an established presence. In the last five years, the Company, including its predecessors, has successfully acquired and integrated more than 50 physician group practices for a combined acquisition price of approximately $3.1 billion.
Enhancing profitability by achieving further operating efficiencies. We believe we can improve the operating efficiency of our physician services business as we grow. Our infrastructure is designed to achieve economies of scale by enhancing profitability with revenue growth without compromising the quality of operations or clinical care. We believe our processes related to managed care contracting, billing, coding, collection and compliance have driven a track record of effective and efficient revenue cycle management. We continue to make investments in infrastructure, including management information systems that we believe will enable us to improve clinical quality and key client metrics while reducing the cost of providing patient care.
Physician Services Revenues
Our physician services segment revenue is derived principally from the provision of physician services to patients of the healthcare facilities we serve and primarily consists of fee for service revenue from third-party payors. We also receive contract revenue, which represents income earned from the Company's hospital customers to supplement payments from third-party payors. We record revenue at the time services are provided, net of a contractual allowance and provision for uncollectibles. Revenue less the contractual allowance represents the net revenue expected to be collected from third-party payors including managed care, commercial and governmental payors such as Medicare and Medicaid and patients insured by these payors.
We also recognize revenue for services provided during a particular period but not yet billed. Expected collections are estimated based on fees and negotiated payment rates in the case of third-party payors, the specific benefits provided for under each patient’s healthcare plan, mandated payment rates under the Medicare and Medicaid programs, and historical cash collections. Our provision for uncollectibles includes the estimate of uncollectible balances due from uninsured patients, uncollectible co-pay and deductible balances due from insured patients and special charges, if any, for uncollectible balances due from managed care, commercial and governmental payors. We record net revenue from uninsured patients at its estimated realizable value, which includes a provision for uncollectible balances, based on historical cash collections, net of recoveries.
We provide the majority of billing for our employed and affiliated physicians through our internal billing function. We also selectively utilize third-party revenue cycle management providers to perform billing. Additionally, we have invested in several applications that provide the foundation for the day-to-day operations of our physician services business, including facilities-based billing and office-based billing.
Retroactive adjustments, recoupments or refund demands may change amounts realized from third-party payors. Retroactive adjustments to amounts previously reimbursed can and do occur on a regular basis as a result of reviews and audits. Additional factors that could complicate our physician services billing include:

• | disputes between payors as to which party is responsible for payment;


• | the difficulty of adherence to specific compliance requirements, diagnosis coding and various other procedures mandated by the government; and


• | failure to obtain proper physician credentialing and documentation in order to bill governmental payors.

Contracts. We have contracts with (i) hospital and ASC customers to provide professional staffing and related management services, (ii) healthcare facilities and independent physician groups to provide management services and (iii) affiliated physician groups and medical professionals to provide management services and various benefits. As provider of multispecialty physician services with a national footprint, we also contract with large health systems. 
We deliver services to our hospital customers and their patients through two principal types of contractual arrangements. We most frequently contract directly with the hospital to provide physician staffing and management services. In some instances, a physician-owned professional corporation (PC) contracts with the hospital to provide physician staffing and management services, and the PC, in turn, contracts with us for management and administrative services, including billing, scheduling support, accounting and other 

7


Item 1. Business - (continued) 

services. The PC pays our management fee from the fees it collects from patients, third-party payors and, in some cases, the hospital customer. Our physicians and other healthcare professionals who provide services under these hospital contracts do so pursuant to independent contractor or employment agreements with us, or pursuant to arrangements with the professional corporation that has a management agreement with us.
Generally, agreements with hospitals are awarded on a competitive basis with an initial term of three years subject to automatic one-year renewals, and allow for termination by either party upon specified notice. Pursuant to our agreements with hospital customers:

• | we bill patients and third-party payors directly for physician fees,


• | we bill patients and third-party payors directly for physician fees, with the hospital paying us an additional pre-arranged fee for our services, or


• | we bill the hospitals directly for the physicians fees.

We bill patients and third-party payors for physician-related services, which is often referred to as the “professional component.” Separately, hospitals and other allied health providers bill the same patients and third-party payors for services they provide, including medical equipment and diagnostic testing. In all cases, the hospitals are responsible for billing and collecting for non-physician related services as well as for providing the capital for medical equipment and supplies associated with the services we provide. 
We contract with healthcare professionals as either independent contractors or employees to provide services to our customers. The healthcare professionals generally are paid an hourly rate for each hour of coverage, a variable rate based upon productivity or other objective criteria or a combination of both a fixed hourly rate and a variable rate component. We typically arrange for professional liability and workers compensation coverage for our healthcare professionals. 
Contracts with healthcare professionals typically have one-year terms with automatic renewal clauses for additional one-year terms. The contracts can be terminated with cause for various reasons and usually contain provisions allowing for termination without cause by either party upon 90 days’ notice. Agreements with physicians generally contain a non-compete or non-solicitation provision.
The following table summarizes our approximate payor mix as a percentage of net revenue and our approximate payor mix based on patient encounters for the periods indicated, assuming the Merger was completed on January 1, 2016.

 | Percentage of Net Revenue | | Percentage of Total Volume
 | Year Ended December 31, | | Year Ended December 31, 
 | 2017 | | 2016 | | 2015 | 2017 | | 2016 | | 2015
Medicare | 20 | % | | 20 | % | 13 | % | | 33 | % | 32 | % | 36 | %
Medicaid | 8 | | | 8 | | 5 | | | 23 | | 25 | | 22 | 
Commercial and managed care | 55 | | | 54 | | 71 | | | 31 | | 30 | | 33 | 
Self-pay | 2 | | | 1 | | 1 | | | 13 | | 13 | | 9 | 
Net fee for service revenue | 85 | % | | 83 | % | 90 | % | | 100 | % | 100 | % | 100 | %
Contract and other revenue | 15 | | | 17 | | 10 | | | | | | 
Net revenue for physician services | 100 | % | | 100 | % | 100 | % | | | | | 

Competition
The physician services segment is highly fragmented, and we consider our primary competitors to be local physician group practices. On a regional and national basis, we compete with companies such as Mednax Inc., Team Health, US Acute Care Solutions, U.S Anesthesia Partners, Fresenius, Schumacher Clinical Partners and California Emergency Physicians.
Physician Services Locations
As of December 31, 2017, we had contracts covering more than 1,800 clinical departments at healthcare facilities in 45 states and the District of Columbia. For the year ended December 31, 2017, Arizona, California, Florida, New Jersey and Texas accounted for approximately 62% of our physician services segment net revenue. We generally negotiate and enter into separate contracts with facilities to which we deliver physician services. However, many facilities are affiliated with one another or owned by the same entity. As a result, while no single facility represents more than 10% of our physician services segment revenue, there are several significant client relationships with groups of affiliated facilities that result in a concentration of revenue. During 2017, facilities affiliated with 

8


Item 1. Business - (continued) 

HCA Holdings, Inc. comprised approximately 20% of our consolidated net revenue and approximately 24% of our physician services segment net revenue. 
Ambulatory Services Segment
We are one of the largest owners and operators of ambulatory surgical centers (ASCs or surgery centers) in the United States based upon total number of facilities. We acquire, develop and operate ASCs in partnership with physicians and health systems. We generally own a majority interest, primarily 51%, in the facilities we operate. We also own minority interests in certain surgery centers in partnerships with leading health systems and physicians and intend to continue to pursue such partnerships. At December 31, 2017, we operated 264 ASCs in 35 states and the District of Columbia with approximately 2,000 physician partners and 1,000 affiliated physicians who utilize our surgery centers.
ASCs primarily provide elective, high volume, lower-risk surgical procedures across multiple specialties, including, among others, gastroenterology, ophthalmology, and orthopaedics. Our ASCs are designed with a cost structure that creates significant savings for patients and payors when compared to surgical services performed in hospital outpatient departments (HOPDs). We acquire, develop and operate ASCs through the formation of strategic partnerships with physicians to better serve the communities in the markets we serve. Since physicians are critical to the delivery of healthcare, we have developed our operating model to encourage physicians to affiliate with us. We believe we attract physicians because we design our facilities and adopt staffing, scheduling and clinical systems and protocols with the goal of increasing physician efficiency. We believe that our focus on physician satisfaction combined with providing safe, high-quality healthcare in a friendly and convenient environment for patients will continue to make our ASCs an attractive alternative to HOPDs for physicians, patients and payors. We believe our facilities, when compared to HOPDs, (i) enhance the quality of care for our patients, (ii) provide significant administrative, clinical and efficiency benefits to physicians, and (iii) offer a lower cost alternative for patients and payors.
The types of procedures performed at each surgery center depend on the specialty of the practicing physicians who use the surgery center. The procedures most commonly performed at our surgery centers are:

• | gastroenterology - colonoscopy and other endoscopy procedures;


• | ophthalmology - cataracts and retinal laser surgery; and


• | orthopaedic - knee and shoulder arthroscopy and carpal tunnel repair.

Ambulatory Services Segment Overview

For many years, government programs, private insurance companies, managed care organizations and self-insured employers have implemented cost containment measures intended to limit the growth of healthcare expenditures. These cost-containment measures, together with technological advances, have contributed to the significant shift in the delivery of healthcare services away from traditional inpatient hospital settings to more cost-effective alternate sites, including ASCs. ASCs have been widely viewed as a successful way to increase efficiency by improving the quality of, and access to, healthcare and increasing patient satisfaction, while simultaneously reducing costs. According to data issued by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) in 2017, there were approximately 5,500 Medicare-certified ASCs. We believe that approximately 66% of those ASCs performed procedures in a single specialty and approximately 34% performed procedures in more than one specialty (multispecialty). Among the single specialty ASCs, we believe over 2,400 are in our preferred specialties of gastroenterology, ophthalmology, orthopaedic, ear, nose and throat (ENT) and urology, while the remainder are in specialties such as plastic surgery, podiatry and pain management. Of our preferred specialties, we believe approximately 67% of single specialty ASCs and 27% of multispecialty ASCs are independently owned.

We believe the following factors have contributed to the increased migration of procedures to outpatient surgical facilities:

Cost‑effective alternative. Ambulatory surgery is generally less expensive than hospital-based surgery for a number of reasons, including lower facility development costs, more efficient staffing and space utilization, and a specialized operating environment focused on cost containment. Accordingly, charges to patients and payors by ASCs are generally less than hospital charges.
Physician and patient preference. We believe many physicians prefer ASCs because these facilities enhance physicians’ productivity by providing them with greater scheduling flexibility, more consistent nurse staffing and faster turnaround time between cases, allowing them to perform more surgeries in a defined period of time. In contrast, HOPDs generally serve a broader group of physicians, including those involved with emergency procedures, which can result in postponed or delayed surgeries for non-emergency procedures. Many patients prefer ASCs as a result of more convenient locations, shorter waiting times and more convenient scheduling and registration than HOPDs.
Ambulatory Services Strategy
We are a leader in the acquisition, development and operation of ASCs. The key components of our strategy are to:


• | attract and retain physicians that are leaders in their specialty and community;


• | increase same-center revenues and profitability at our existing surgery centers;


• | expand our national network of ASCs by selectively acquiring both single-specialty ASCs and multispecialty ASCs, and developing new ASCs in partnership with physicians and health systems; and


• | pursue the acquisition of companies that own and operate multiple ASCs.


Attract and retain physicians that are leaders in their specialty and community. We typically structure partnerships with physicians in a 51% / 49% ownership relationship, whereby we are the majority member and provide management and administrative services to 

10


Item 1. Business - (continued) 

our partners. We believe our focus on physician satisfaction, combined with providing safe, high-quality healthcare in a patient friendly and convenient environment helps us attract and retain physician partners.

Increase same-center revenue growth. We grow revenues in our existing surgery centers primarily through increasing procedure volume by (i) increasing the number of physicians performing procedures at our ASCs, (ii) marketing our ASCs to referring physicians, payors and patients, and (iii) achieving efficiencies in center operations. For the year ended December 31, 2017, we achieved same-center revenue growth of 1.8%.

Growth in the number of physicians performing procedures. The most effective way to increase procedure volume and revenues at our ASCs is to increase the number of physicians who use our ASCs through: 


• | the physicians affiliated with the ASCs recruiting new physicians to their practices;


• | identifying additional physicians to join the partnerships that own the ASCs; and


• | recruiting non-partner physicians in the same or other specialties to use the ASCs.


Marketing our ASCs to referring physicians, payors and patients. We market our ASCs to referring physicians and payors by emphasizing the quality, high patient satisfaction and lower cost at our ASCs, including through programs designed to educate employers and patients as to the health and cost benefits of our services. We have a dedicated business development team that is responsible for negotiating contracts on behalf of our ASCs with third-party payors and negotiating reimbursement rates pursuant to existing contracts. 

Achieving efficiencies in center operations. We have dedicated teams with business and clinical expertise that are responsible for implementing best practices within our ASCs. The implementation of these best practices allows the ASCs to improve operating efficiencies through:


• | physician scheduling enhancements;


• | improved patient flow; and


• | improved operating room turnover.


We enhance the profitability of our ASCs through benefits we receive from economies of scale such as group purchasing, staffing and clinical efficiencies and cost containment initiatives. We also track center performance relative to certain benchmarks in order to maximize center-level revenues and profitability. The information we gather and collect from our ASCs and ambulatory services segment operations team members allows us to develop best practices and identify those ASCs that could most benefit from improved operating efficiency techniques and cost containment measures.

Expand our national network of ASCs. While we have historically been an active acquirer of ASCs, the market remains fragmented, providing many opportunities for additional acquisitions. We target ownership in single-specialty ASCs that perform gastrointestinal endoscopy, ophthalmology and orthopaedic procedures, as well as multispecialty ASCs that are equipped and staffed to perform surgical procedures in more than one specialty. As of December 31, 2017, approximately 66% of our ambulatory services segment revenues were from single-specialty ASCs that perform gastroenterology or ophthalmology procedures. These specialties have a higher concentration of older patients than other specialties, such as orthopaedics or ENT. We will also pursue the acquisition of companies that own and operate multiple ASCs when those opportunities arise.
We also plan to continue expanding our network of ASCs through partnerships with hospitals and hospital systems. As a result of recent healthcare trends, many hospitals and hospital systems are seeking to enter or improve their operations within the ASC market in order to offer a complete continuum of care as well as to establish better relationships with physicians who have a need to operate in both in-patient and out-patient environments. As a result of our deep experience in ASC operations, we believe the relationships we have established with hospitals and hospital-owned entities bring both quality and efficiency to such relationships.

We typically look to acquire ASCs that meet the following criteria:


• | Diversified physician group: ASCs that have eight to ten (or more) physicians. In order to manage succession planning, we look to acquire ASCs where physicians vary in age in order to limit the risk of several physicians exiting the practice in a short period of time.


• | Market leader: ASCs that are market leaders for the procedures performed in that facility.


• | Contracts with payors: ASCs that contract with all or most of the major commercial payors in their market.


• | History of growth: ASCs with a track record of consistent case and revenue growth.


11


Item 1. Business - (continued) 

The development staff of our ambulatory services segment identifies existing ASCs that are potential acquisition candidates and physicians who are potential partners for new center development and conducts a review of all aspects of the surgery center's operations.

In presenting to physicians the advantages of developing a new ASC in partnership with us, our development staff emphasizes the proximity of a surgery center to a physician’s office, the simplified administrative procedures, the ability to schedule consecutive cases without preemption by inpatient or emergency procedures, the rapid turnaround time between cases, the high technical competency of the center’s clinical staff and the state-of-the-art surgical equipment. We also focus on our expertise in developing and operating ASCs, including contracting with vendors and third-party payors. In a development project, we provide services, such as financial feasibility pro forma analysis, site selection, financing for construction, equipment and build out and architectural oversight. Capital contributed by the physicians and our company plus debt financing provides the funds necessary to construct and equip a new surgery center and initial working capital.

As part of each surgery center acquisition or development transaction, we generally form an LLC or LP, which are referred to herein as “partnerships,” where certain states require such a model and enter into an operating agreement or a LP agreement with our physician partners. We generally own 51% of the partnerships. Under these agreements, we receive a percentage of the net income and cash distributions of the entity equal to our percentage ownership interest in the entity and have the right to the same percentage of the proceeds upon a sale or liquidation of the entity. In the LP structure, as the sole general partner, one of our affiliates is generally liable for the debts of the LP. However, the physician partners are generally required to guarantee their pro rata share of any indebtedness or lease agreements to which the limited partnership is a party in proportion to their ownership interest in the LP.

Except in limited instances, we manage each partnership and oversee the business office, contracting, marketing, financial reporting, accreditation, clinical, regulatory and administrative operations of the surgery center. The physician partners provide the center with a medical director and performance improvement chairman and may provide certain other specified services such as billing and collections, transcription and accounts payable processing. In addition, the partnership may lease the services of certain non-physician personnel from entities affiliated with the physician partners, who will provide services at the center. Certain significant aspects of the partnership's governance are overseen by an operating board, which is typically comprised of equal representation by us and our physician partners. We work closely with our physician partners to increase the likelihood of a successful partnership.
Under many of our agreements with physician partners of our surgery centers, we are obligated to purchase the interests of the physicians at an amount as specified in the limited partnership and operating agreements in the event that their continued ownership of interests in the limited partnerships and limited liability companies becomes prohibited. The determination of such a prohibition generally is required to be made by our counsel in concurrence with counsel of the physician partners or, if they cannot concur, by a nationally recognized law firm with expertise in healthcare law jointly selected by us and the physician partners. The interest we are required to purchase will not exceed the minimum interest required as a result of the change in the law or regulation causing such prohibition.

Ambulatory Services Revenues
Revenues from our ASCs are derived from facility fees charged for surgical procedures performed and, at certain of our surgery centers (primarily ASCs that perform gastrointestinal endoscopy procedures), charges for anesthesia services provided by medical professionals employed or contracted by our ASCs. These fees vary depending on the procedure, but usually include all charges for operating room usage, special equipment usage, supplies, recovery room usage, nursing staff and medications. Facility fees do not include professional fees charged by the physicians who perform the surgical procedures. Revenues are recorded at the time of the patient encounter and billings for such procedures are made on or about that same date. At the majority of our surgery centers, it is our policy to collect patient co-payments and deductibles at the time the surgery is performed. Our revenues are recorded net of estimated contractual adjustments from third-party medical service payors.
ASCs depend upon third-party reimbursement programs, including governmental and private insurance programs, to pay for substantially all of the services rendered to patients. During 2017, we derived approximately 27% of our ambulatory services segment revenue from governmental healthcare programs, primarily Medicare and managed Medicare programs, and the remainder from a wide mix of commercial payors and patient co-pays and deductibles. The Medicare program currently pays ASCs in accordance with a predetermined fee schedule. Our surgery centers are not required to file cost reports and, accordingly, we have no unsettled amounts from governmental third-party payors.
In addition to payment from governmental programs, ASCs derive a significant portion of their revenues from private health insurance plans. These plans include both standard indemnity insurance programs as well as managed care programs, such as preferred provider organizations and HMOs. The strengthening and consolidation of managed care systems nationally has resulted in increased 

12


Item 1. Business - (continued) 

competition among providers of surgery center services that contract with these systems. Further, most of the plans offered through the health insurance exchanges created by the Health Reform Law provide for narrow networks that restrict the number of participating providers or tiered networks that impose significantly higher cost sharing obligations on patients who obtain services from providers in a disfavored tier. Exclusion from participation in a managed care network or assignment to a disfavored tier could result in material reductions in patient volume and revenues of our ambulatory services segment. Some of our competitors may have greater financial resources and market penetration than we do. We believe that all payors, both governmental and private and certain other industry participants, such as large employer groups and their affiliates, will continue their efforts over the next several years to reduce healthcare costs and that these efforts will generally result in a less stable market for healthcare services. While no assurances can be given concerning the ultimate success of our efforts to contract with healthcare payors, we believe that our position as a lower-cost alternative for certain surgical procedures should enable our surgery centers to compete effectively in the evolving healthcare marketplace.

Competition
We consider our primary competitors to be regional and national ASC providers, including hospitals and health systems, such as United Surgical Partners, Inc., Surgical Care Affiliates and Surgery Partners. We also compete with national, regional and local hospital systems for the development of new surgery centers.
Accreditation

We believe that undergoing and maintaining voluntary accreditation signifies our commitment to quality. Managed care organizations in certain markets will only contract with a facility that is accredited by either the Accreditation Association for Ambulatory Health Care (AAAHC) or The Joint Commission. Substantially all of our ASCs are accredited by AAAHC or The Joint Commission and have received three-year certifications.
Ambulatory Services Locations
At December 31, 2017, we operated 264 ASCs in 35 states and the District of Columbia. The size of our typical single-specialty ASC is approximately 6,000 to 10,000 square feet. The size of our typical multispecialty ASC is approximately 10,000 to 14,000 square feet. Each center typically has two to three operating or procedure rooms with areas for reception, preparation, recovery and administration and is specifically tailored to meet the needs of its physician partners.

Item 1. Business - (continued) 

Medical Transportation
On August 7, 2017, we entered into a definitive agreement to divest our medical transportation business, AMR, to an entity controlled by funds affiliated with Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. As a result, our medical transportation business has been classified as discontinued operations and is no longer a separate reportable segment. We expect to complete the divestiture of AMR during the first quarter of 2018. AMR is the largest ambulance provider in the nation and a leading provider of other medical transportation services in the United States. Ambulance services encompass both “911” emergency response and non-emergency transport services, including critical care transfers, wheelchair transports and other inter-facility transports. Emergency response services include the dispatch of ambulances equipped with life support equipment and staffed with paramedics and/or emergency medical technicians (EMTs) to provide immediate medical care to injured or ill patients. Non-emergency services utilize paramedics, EMTs and/or nurses to transport patients between healthcare facilities or between facilities and patient residences. 
AMR provides substantially all of its medical transportation services under its American Medical Response (AMR) brand name. AMR operates under other names when required to do so by local statute or contractual agreement. AMR's broad geographic footprint enables it to contract on a national and regional basis with insurance companies, healthcare facilities and government agencies. 
A significant portion of AMR's medical transportation business net revenue was generated from emergency “911” ambulance services. These services include treating and stabilizing patients, transporting the patient to a hospital or other healthcare facility and providing attendant medical care en route. Non-emergency ambulance services revenues included critical care transfers, wheelchair transports and other inter-facility transports, with the remaining balance of net revenue was generated from managed transportation services, fixed-wing air ambulance services and the provision of training, dispatch and other services to communities and public safety agencies including services provided to the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). AMR has a national contract with FEMA to provide ambulance and para-transit services, as well as rotary and fixed-wing air ambulance transportation services to supplement federal and military responses to disasters, acts of terrorism and other public health emergencies in the full 48 contiguous states.
Medical Transportation Overview
AMR provides a full range of emergency and non-emergency ambulance transport and related services, which include:
“911” Response Services
AMR provides emergency response services primarily under long-term exclusive contracts with communities and hospitals. AMR's contracts typically stipulate that it must respond to “911” calls in the designated area within a specified response time. AMR utilizes two types of ambulance units: Advanced Life Support (ALS) units and Basic Life Support (BLS) units. ALS units, which are staffed by two paramedics or one paramedic and an EMT, are equipped with high-acuity life support equipment such as cardiac monitors, defibrillators and oxygen delivery systems, and carry pharmaceutical and medical supplies. BLS units are generally staffed by two EMTs and are outfitted with medical supplies and equipment necessary to administer first aid and basic medical treatment. The decision to dispatch an ALS or BLS unit is determined by contractual requirements, as well as by the nature of the patient’s medical situation. Exclusive “911” contracts with communities and government agencies typically specify maximum fees a provider may charge and set forth minimum requirements, such as response times, staffing levels, types of vehicles and equipment, quality assurance and insurance coverage. The rates that a provider is permitted to charge for services under a contract for “911” emergency ambulance services and the amount of the subsidy, if any, the provider receives from a community or government agency depend in large part on the nature of the services it provides, the payor mix and the performance requirements.
Non-Emergency Medical Transportation Services
We provide transportation to patients requiring ambulance or wheelchair transport with varying degrees of medical care needs between healthcare facilities or between healthcare facilities and their homes. Unlike emergency response services, which typically are provided by communities or private providers under exclusive or semi-exclusive contracts, non-emergency transportation usually involves multiple contract providers at a given facility, with one or more of the competitors designated as the “preferred” provider. Non-emergency transport business generally is awarded by a healthcare facility, such as a hospital or nursing home, or a healthcare payor, such as a health maintenance organization (HMO), managed care organization or insurance company. Usage tends to be controlled by the facility discharge planners, nurses and physicians who are responsible for requesting transport services. Non-emergency services are provided primarily by private ambulance companies. Non-emergency medical transportation services include: (i) inter-facility critical care transport, (ii) wheelchair and stretcher-car transports and (iii) other inter-facility transports.

14


Item 1. Business - (continued) 

Other Services
In addition to “911” emergency and non-emergency ambulance services, AMR provides the following managed transportation services, dispatch services, event medical services, paramedic training, fixed-wing air ambulance services, community paramedic, on-site and offshore EMS, and industrial and community fire protection services.
Medical Transportation Revenues
AMR receive payment from the following sources:

• | federal and state governments, primarily under the Medicare and Medicaid programs;


• | HMOs and private insurers;


• | individual patients;


• | fees for stand-by and event driven coverage, including from its national contract with FEMA; and


• | community subsidies.

Emergency transport. Contracts with communities to provide emergency transport services are typically exclusive, with terms of three to five years in length and generally are obtained through a competitive bidding process. In some instances where AMR is the existing provider, communities elect to renegotiate existing contracts rather than initiate new bidding processes. “911” contracts often contain options for earned extensions or evergreen provisions. AMR's “911” emergency response arrangements typically specify maximum fees AMR may charge and set forth minimum requirements, such as response times, staffing levels, types of vehicles and equipment, quality assurance and insurance coverage. Communities and government agencies may also require us to provide a performance bond or other assurances of financial responsibility. The rates AMR is permitted to charge for services under a contract for emergency ambulance services and the amount of the subsidy, if any, received from a community or government agency depend in large part on the nature of the services AMR provides, payor mix and performance requirements.
Non-emergency transport. AMR has arrangements to provide non-emergency ambulance services with hospitals, nursing homes and other healthcare facilities that require a stable and reliable source of medical transportation for their patients. These contracts typically designate AMR as the preferred ambulance service provider of non-emergency ambulance services to those facilities and permits AMR to charge a base fee, mileage reimbursement and additional fees for the use of particular medical equipment and supplies. AMR has historically provided a portion of its non-emergency transports to facilities and organizations in competitive markets without specific contracts.
Non-emergency transports often are provided to managed care or insurance plan members who are stabilized at the closest available hospital and are then moved to facilities within their health plan’s network. We believe the increased prevalence of managed care benefits larger ambulance service providers, which can service a higher percentage of a managed care provider’s members. This allows the managed care provider to reduce its number of vendors, thus reducing administrative costs and allowing it to negotiate more favorable rates with healthcare facilities. AMR's scale and broad geographic footprint enable contracting on a national and regional basis with managed care and insurance companies. We believe that communities, government agencies, healthcare facilities, managed care companies and insurers consider the quality of care, historical response time performance and total cost to be among the most important factors in awarding and renewing contracts.
Competition
Competition in the ambulance transport market is based primarily on:

• | the ability to improve customer service, such as on-time performance and efficient call intake;


• | the ability to provide comprehensive clinical care;


• | the ability to recruit, train and motivate employees, particularly ambulance crews who have direct contact with patients and healthcare personnel; and


• | pricing, billing and reimbursement expertise.

AMR's predominant competitors are local fire departments and other local government providers. Larger private provider competitors include Falck, a Danish corporation with a significant U.S. presence, Acadian Ambulance Service in Louisiana and Paramedics Plus. Small, locally-owned operators principally serve the inter-facility transport market.

15


Item 1. Business - (continued) 

Medical Personnel
Paramedics and EMTs must be state-certified and locally credentialed to transport patients and perform emergency care services. Certification as an EMT typically requires completion of a program designated by the U.S. Department of Transportation, such as those offered at AMR's training institute, NCTI. In addition, specialized courses may be completed to target specific patient populations, such as pediatrics, geriatrics, trauma and burns. In most communities, the local physician medical director, often in conjunction with a physician advisory board, develops medical protocols to be followed by paramedics and EMTs in a service area. In addition, real-time instructions are conveyed on a case-by-case basis through direct communications between the ambulance crew and hospital emergency physicians. This consultation allows for more comprehensive evaluation and treatment of difficult cases. Like physicians, both paramedics and EMTs must complete continuing education programs and, in some cases, state supervised refresher training and/or examinations to maintain their certifications.
Medical Transportation Locations
During 2017, AMR provided services in 41 states and the District of Columbia. Its broad geographic footprint enables AMR to contract on a national and regional basis with insurance companies, healthcare facilities and government agencies.
Government Regulation
Our operations and relationships with healthcare providers such as hospitals, ASCs and other healthcare facilities and healthcare professionals are subject to extensive regulation by numerous federal and state government entities as well as local government agencies. Specifically, but without limitation, we are subject to the following types of laws and regulations.
Health Reform. In recent years, the U.S. Congress and certain state governments have enacted a number of measures designed to effect major change across healthcare services. Most prominent among these efforts, the Health Reform Law contains a number of provisions designed to reduce Medicare program spending, including an annual productivity adjustment that reduces payment updates to ASCs and various initiatives that may reduce payments for physician services. The Health Reform Law also expanded coverage of previously uninsured individuals through a combination of public program expansion and private sector health insurance reforms. We believe the Health Reform Law has generally resulted in increased volume at facilities at which we provide physician services and at our surgery centers. Certain provisions of the Health Reform Law, including those promoting Accountable Care Organizations (ACOs) and other coordinated care models, may make it more difficult to compete for patients, negatively impacting our surgery centers, physician practices and health facilities we partner with. Additionally, within our physician services segment, we derive a significant portion of our revenue from payments made by government healthcare programs, including Medicare and Medicaid. CMS has implemented, or is implementing, a number of programs and requirements intended to transform Medicare from a passive volume-based payment system to an active purchaser of quality goods and services. These efforts directly impact hospitals, among other providers and may also affect the level of utilization of and payments received for our physician services.
Leaders in both the executive and legislative branches of government have stated their intention to repeal, replace, or significantly modify the Health Reform Law, its implementation or its interpretation. In 2017, Congress eliminated the financial penalty associated with the individual mandate, effective January 2019. In addition, the President signed an executive order directing federal agencies to take actions to minimize the “economic and regulatory burdens” of the Health Reform Law. The impact of efforts to repeal, replace or modify the Health Reform Law, or other efforts to reform healthcare delivery or financial systems, may materially adversely impact our business. Because of the many variables involved, including uncertainties surrounding any future legislative or administrative action to repeal, replace or significantly modify the Health Reform Law, we are unable to predict the net effect of the Health Reform Law.
Licensure and certification. In order to receive Medicare reimbursement, we must meet applicable conditions for coverage set forth by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) for the facility and service type and also comply with state and local laws and regulations, all of which are subject to change from time to time. Each of our existing surgery centers are certified as Medicare providers or suppliers. Our ASC services are subject to periodic Medicare certification surveys. Additional licensure, certification, or accreditation requirements may apply. For example, state licensing of ASCs is required to operate of each of our surgery centers and to participate in federally-funded programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid. Our facilities are also subject to federal, state and local laws addressing issues such as occupational safety, employment, medical leave, insurance regulations, civil rights and discrimination and medical waste and other environmental issues.
Our affiliated physicians participate in Medicare. In addition, every state imposes licensing requirements on individual physicians, and many states impose licensing requirements on facilities and services operated and owned by physicians. Certain non-physician practitioners, including physician assistants and nurse practitioners (sometimes referred to as “midlevel practitioners”), may also 

16


Item 1. Business - (continued) 

enroll in Medicare and are required to be licensed. Further, our other healthcare professionals may also be subject to other licensure, certification, or accreditation requirements. There can be no assurance that our physicians and non-physician practitioners will continue to qualify for participation, to the extent applicable, or meet licensure standards. 
In some states, a certificate of need (CON) process controls the development of certain facilities and services, such as ASCs. CON statutes and regulations generally provide that, prior to the expansion of existing surgery centers, the construction of new healthcare facilities, the acquisition of major items of equipment or the introduction of certain new services, approval must be obtained from the designated state health planning agency. Approval is conditioned on the designated state health planning agency’s determination that a need exists for expanded or additional facilities or services. Our ASC development strategy focuses on states that do not require a CON. Acquisitions of existing surgery centers usually do not require CON approval.
Billing and reimbursement compliance. Billing and reimbursement rules are complex, change frequently and may vary depending on the source of payment. For example, Medicare and other payors generally only cover services determined to be medically necessary. Providers must carefully bill for and document services provided to ensure accurate coding, including use of the correct ICD-10 code and comply with supervision requirements when billing for services provided by midlevel practitioners. 
When our services are covered by multiple payors, financial responsibility is to be allocated among the payors in a process known as coordination of benefits (COB). The rules governing COB are complex, particularly when one of the payors is Medicare or another government program. Under these rules, in some cases, the government payor can be billed as a “secondary payor” only after recourse to a primary payor (e.g., a liability insurer) has been exhausted. If multiple payors reimburse us an amount which, in the aggregate, exceeds the amount to which we are entitled, we are obligated to process a refund. 
In the event any of our billing and collection practices violate applicable laws, regulations, and other guidance, we could be subject to penalties, refund demands and recoupments. When the federal government covers items or services, federal fraud and abuse laws also apply. Further, to the extent that the complexity associated with billing for our services causes delays in our cash collections, we assume the financial risk of increased carrying costs associated with the aging of our accounts receivable as well as increased potential for bad debts which could have a material adverse effect on our revenue, provision for uncompensated care and cash flow.
Fraud and Abuse Provisions
Federal Anti-Kickback Statute. The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits healthcare providers and others from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or paying, directly or indirectly, any remuneration (including any kickback, bribe or rebate) in return for, or to induce, referrals or orders for services or items covered by a federal healthcare program. The federal Anti-Kickback Statute is very broad in scope, and many of its provisions have not been uniformly or definitively interpreted by case law or regulations. Courts have found a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute if just one purpose of the remuneration is to generate referrals, even if there are other lawful purposes. Furthermore, knowledge of the law or intent to violate the law is not required to establish a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute.
Violations may result in criminal penalties or fines of up to $100,000, imprisonment for up to five years, and substantial civil penalties for each violation, plus three times the amount claimed. Civil monetary penalties, including those for violations of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and those imposed under the FCA, are adjusted annually based on updates to the Consumer Price Index and were recently increased under the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018. In addition, violations may result in exclusion from participation in the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Exclusion from these programs would result in significant reduction in revenues and would have a material adverse effect on our business. The Health Reform Law provides that submission of a claim for services or items generated in violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim and may be subject to additional penalties under the federal False Claims Act (FCA). 
Congress and HHS have published safe harbors that outline categories of activities that are deemed protected from prosecution under the federal Anti-Kickback Statute. Failure to meet the requirements of a safe harbor does not necessarily render the conduct or business arrangement illegal under the federal Anti-Kickback Statute. However, such conduct and business arrangements may lead to increased scrutiny by governmental enforcement authorities. The limited partnerships and limited liability companies that own our surgery centers do not meet all of the criteria of a safe harbor. However, we believe that our surgery centers and the related limited partnerships and limited liability companies are in compliance with the current requirements of applicable federal and state law because, among other factors:

• | the limited partnerships and limited liability companies exist to effect legitimate business purposes, including the provision of high quality, cost-effective and efficient services to the patients served;


17


Item 1. Business - (continued) 


• | the limited partnerships and limited liability companies function as an extension of the practices of physicians who are affiliated with the surgery centers and the surgical procedures are performed personally by these physicians without referring the patients outside of their practice;


• | our physician partners have a substantial investment at risk in the limited partnerships and limited liability companies;


• | terms of the investment do not take into account the volume of the physician partners’ past or anticipated future services provided to patients of the surgery centers;


• | the physician partners are not required or encouraged as a condition of the investment to treat Medicare or Medicaid patients at the surgery centers or to influence others to refer such patients to the surgery centers for treatment;


• | the limited partnerships, the limited liability companies, our subsidiaries and our affiliates do not loan any funds to or guarantee any debt on behalf of the physician partners with respect to their investment; and


• | distributions by the limited partnerships and limited liability companies are allocated uniformly in proportion to ownership interests.

The safe harbor regulations also set forth a safe harbor for personal services and management contracts. Certain of our limited partnerships and limited liability companies have entered into ancillary services agreements with our physician partners’ group practices, pursuant to which the practice may provide the center with billing and collections, transcription, payables processing, payroll and other ancillary services. The consideration payable by a limited partnership or limited liability company for certain of these services may be based on the volume of services provided by the practice, which is measured by the limited partnership’s or limited liability company’s revenues. Although these relationships do not meet all of the criteria of the personal services and management contracts safe harbor, we believe that the ancillary services agreements are in compliance with the current requirements of applicable federal and state law because, among other factors, we believe the fees payable to the physician practices are equal to the fair market value of the services provided.
The HHS Office of Inspector General (OIG) is authorized to issue advisory opinions regarding the interpretation and applicability of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, including whether an activity constitutes grounds for the imposition of civil or criminal sanctions. Although advisory opinions are not binding on any entity other than the parties who submitted the requests, advisory opinions provide some guidance as to how the OIG would analyze a particular arrangement. The OIG has issued advisory opinions in which it concluded that proposed arrangements between anesthesia groups and facilities, including, physician-owned ASCs could result in prohibited remuneration under the federal Anti-Kickback Statute. Certain of our limited partnerships and limited liability companies have entered into certain arrangements for professional services, including arrangements for anesthesia services. We believe our arrangements for anesthesia services can be differentiated from those described in the negative OIG advisory opinions and are in compliance with the requirements of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute.
In connection with our physician services business, we have a variety of financial relationships with physicians, hospitals, ASCs, and other healthcare services, including joint venture arrangements. These financial relationships do not meet all of the criteria of the personal services and management contracts safe harbor, but we believe that the arrangements are in compliance with the current requirements of applicable federal and state law because, among other factors, we believe the fees payable under the arrangements are consistent with fair market value of the services provided.
Prohibition on certain self-referrals and physician ownership of healthcare facilities. The federal physician self-referral law, commonly referred to as the Stark Law, prohibits a physician from making a referral for a designated health service to an entity if the physician or a member of the physician’s immediate family has a financial relationship with the entity, unless an exception applies. Sanctions for violating the Stark Law include denial of payment, refunding amounts received for services provided pursuant to prohibited referrals, substantial civil money penalties per prohibited service provided and a separate penalty for a circumvention scheme. These penalties are adjusted annually based on updates to the Consumer Price Index. In addition, violations may result in exclusion from participation in the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Exclusion of our surgery centers or physician groups from these programs could result in significant loss of revenues and could have a material adverse effect on us. Further, failure to refund amounts received as a result of a prohibited referral on a timely basis may constitute a false or fraudulent claim and may result in civil penalties and additional penalties under the FCA. The Stark Law applies to referrals involving the following services under the definition of “designated health services”: clinical laboratory services; physical therapy services; occupational therapy services; radiology and imaging services; radiation therapy services and supplies; durable medical equipment and supplies; parenteral and enteral nutrients, equipment and supplies; prosthetics, orthotics and prosthetic devices and supplies; home health services; outpatient prescription drugs; and inpatient and outpatient hospital services. CMS has issued final regulations interpreting the Stark Law that help clarify the requirements of the exceptions to the Stark Law, but it is difficult to determine how the government will interpret many of these exceptions for enforcement purposes. 
A number of provisions of the Stark Law implementing regulations limit how the Stark Law affects ASCs. Under these regulations, services that would otherwise constitute a designated health service, but that are paid by Medicare as a part of the surgery center 

18


Item 1. Business - (continued) 

payment rate, are not a designated health service for purposes of the Stark Law. The so-called ASC exemption to the Stark Law also applies to any radiology and imaging procedures that are integral to a covered ASC surgical procedure and that are performed immediately before, during, or immediately following the surgical procedure (that is, on the same day). Similarly, CMS has excluded from the Stark Law definition of “outpatient prescription drugs” any drugs that are integral to an ASC procedure and are “covered as ancillary services” under the revised ASC payment system. The Stark Law continues to prohibit a physician-owned ASC from furnishing outpatient prescription drugs for use in a patient’s home. In addition, there is a Stark Law exception covering implants, prosthetics, implanted prosthetic devices and implanted durable medical equipment provided in a surgery center setting under certain circumstances. Because of these exemptions, we believe the Stark Law does not prohibit physician ownership or investment interests in our surgery centers to which they refer patients.
With respect to our physician services business, we contract with hospitals and other providers of designated health services. Our physician practices also provide services, such as imaging and laboratory services, that constitute designated health services. Thus, we are required to structure our financial relationships involving providers of designated health services in a manner that complies with a Stark Law exception. There are a number of exceptions that may apply to our physician services business, including the exceptions for bona fide employment relationships, indirect compensation arrangements and in-office ancillary services. We attempt to structure our relationships to meet an exception to the Stark Law when required, but the regulations implementing the exceptions are detailed and complex, and we cannot guarantee that every relationship complies fully with the Stark Law.
Several states in which we operate have self-referral statutes similar to the Stark Law. Often these state laws are broad in scope and apply regardless of the source of payment for care. Little precedent exists for the interpretation or enforcement of these state laws. We believe that physician ownership of surgery centers is not prohibited by any of these state self-referral statutes. We can give no assurances that further judicial or agency interpretations of existing federal or state laws or further legislative restrictions on physician ownership or investment in, or financial relationships with, healthcare entities will not be issued that could have a material adverse effect on us.
The Federal False Claims Act and similar federal and state laws. We are subject to state and federal laws that govern the submission of claims for reimbursement. One of the most prominent of these laws is the federal FCA, which prohibits an individual or entity from knowingly and willfully presenting a claim (or causing a claim to be presented) that is false or fraudulent for payment from the government, including the Medicare and Medicaid programs and the health insurance exchanges created under the Health Reform Law, if those payments include any federal funds. The standard for “knowing and willful” often includes conduct that amounts to a reckless disregard for whether accurate information is presented by claims processors. There are many potential bases for liability under the FCA, including knowingly and improperly avoiding repayment of an overpayment received from the government and the knowing failure to report and return an overpayment within 60 days of identifying the overpayment. The government may use the FCA to prosecute Medicare and other government program fraud in areas such as coding errors, billing for services not provided and submitting false cost reports. Violations of other statutes, such as the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, can serve as a basis for liability under the FCA.
The FCA may be enforced by the federal government directly, or by a qui tam plaintiff (or whistleblower) on the government’s behalf. When a private plaintiff brings a qui tam action under the FCA, the defendant often will not be made aware of the lawsuit until the government commences its own investigation or makes a determination whether it will intervene. When a defendant is determined by a court of law to be liable under the FCA, the defendant may be required to pay three times the amount of the alleged false claim, plus substantial mandatory civil penalties for each separate false claim. These penalties are adjusted annually based on updates to the Consumer Price Index. A private plaintiff who brings a qui tam lawsuit may receive a share of any settlement or judgment. 
Every entity that receives at least $5.0 million annually in Medicaid payments must have written policies for all employees, contractors or agents, providing detailed information about false claims, false statements and whistleblower protections under certain federal laws, including the federal FCA, and similar state laws. A number of states, including states in which we operate, have adopted their own false claims provisions as well as their own qui tam provisions whereby a private party may file a civil lawsuit in state court. States that enact false claims laws that are comparable to the federal FCA are entitled to an increased share of FCA recoveries.
We believe that we have procedures in place to ensure the accurate completion of claims forms and requests for payment. However, the laws and regulations defining proper Medicare or Medicaid billing are complex and have not been subjected to extensive judicial or agency interpretation. Billing errors can occur despite our best efforts to prevent or correct them, and we cannot assure you that the government will regard such errors as inadvertent and not in violation of the FCA or related statutes. 
Other fraud and abuse laws. In addition to the laws described above, various other laws and regulations prohibit fraud and abuse in the health care industry and provide for significant penalties. For example, the knowing and willful defrauding of, or attempt to defraud, a healthcare benefit program, including both governmental and private healthcare programs and plans, may result in criminal 

19


Item 1. Business - (continued) 

penalties. Further, the payment of inducements to Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries in order to influence those beneficiaries to order or receive services from a particular provider or practitioner may result in civil penalties. Federal enforcement officials have numerous enforcement mechanisms to combat fraud and abuse, including an incentive program under which individuals can receive up to $1,000 for providing information on Medicare fraud and abuse that leads to the recovery of at least $100 of Medicare funds. In addition, federal enforcement officials have the ability to exclude from Medicare and Medicaid any investors, officers and managing employees associated with business entities that have committed healthcare fraud. Evolving interpretations or enforcement of current, or the adoption of new, federal or state laws or regulations could affect many of our arrangements. Law enforcement authorities, including the OIG, are increasing their scrutiny of arrangements between healthcare providers and potential referral sources to ensure that the arrangements are not designed as a mechanism to exchange remuneration for patient care referrals or opportunities. Investigators have demonstrated a willingness to look behind the formalities of a business transaction to determine the underlying purposes of payments between healthcare providers and potential referral sources.
Healthcare investigations. Both federal and state government agencies have heightened and coordinated civil and criminal enforcement efforts as part of numerous ongoing investigations of healthcare companies, as well as their executives and managers. These investigations relate to a wide variety of topics, including referral relationships and billing practices. The Health Reform Law includes additional federal funding of $350 million over 10 years to fight healthcare fraud, waste and abuse, which includes $10 million for federal fiscal year (FFY) 2018. From time to time, the OIG and the Department of Justice have established national enforcement initiatives that focus on specific billing practices or other suspected areas of abuse. Some of our activities could become the subject of governmental investigations or inquiries. For example, we have significant Medicare billings and we have joint venture arrangements involving physician investors. In addition, our executives and managers, many of whom have worked at other healthcare companies that are or may become the subject of federal and state investigations and private litigation, could be included in governmental investigations or named as defendants in private litigation. We are not aware of any current governmental investigations involving any of our facilities, our executives or our managers. A future adverse investigation of us, our executives or our managers, even if it does not result in a determination of a liability, could result in significant expense to us, as well as adverse publicity.
Privacy and security requirements. There are currently numerous legislative and regulatory initiatives at the state and federal levels addressing the privacy and security of patient health and other identifying information. The privacy and security regulations promulgated pursuant to HIPAA extensively regulate the use and disclosure of individually identifiable protected health information and require “covered entities,” including healthcare providers, to implement administrative, physical and technical safeguards to protect the security of such information. Violations of the regulations may result in criminal penalties and substantial civil penalties. These penalties are adjusted annually based on updates to the Consumer Price Index. HHS enforces HIPAA and is required to perform compliance audits. State attorneys general are also authorized to bring civil actions seeking either injunction or damages in response to violations of HIPAA privacy and security regulations that threaten the privacy of state residents. A covered entity may be subject to penalties as a result of a business associate (an entity that handles individually identifiable health information on behalf of a covered entity) violating HIPAA if the business associate is found to be an agent of the covered entity. Business associates are also directly subject to certain provisions of the HIPAA security and privacy regulations and may be penalized for violations of the regulations. Covered entities must report breaches of unsecured protected health information to affected individuals without unreasonable delay, but not to exceed 60 days following discovery of the breach by the covered entity or its agents. Notification must also be made to HHS and, in certain situations involving large breaches, to the media. There is a presumption that all non-permitted uses or disclosures of unsecured protected health information are breaches unless the covered entity or business associate establishes that there is a low probability the information has been compromised. 
In addition to HIPAA, there are numerous other laws and legislative and regulatory initiatives at the federal and state levels addressing privacy and security concerns. We remain subject to any federal or state laws and regulations that encompass privacy concerns or the reporting of security breaches that are more restrictive than the regulations issued under HIPAA. These laws and regulations vary and could impose additional penalties. For example, they may require us to notify affected individuals in the event of a data breach involving certain individually identifiable health or financial information. In some cases, the Federal Trade Commission uses its consumer protection authority to initiate enforcement actions in response to data breaches.
EMTALA. Because we perform services at hospitals and other types of healthcare facilities, we and our affiliated physicians may be subject to laws which are applicable to those entities. For example, our operations are impacted by the Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act of 1986 (EMTALA), which prohibits “patient dumping” by requiring hospitals and hospital EDs and others to assess and stabilize any patient presenting to the hospital’s ED or urgent care center requesting care for an emergency medical condition, regardless of the patient’s ability to pay. Many states in which we operate have similar state law provisions concerning patient dumping. Violations of EMTALA can result in exclusion of the offending physician from the Medicare and Medicaid programs and civil monetary penalties. These penalties increased are adjusted annually based on changes to the Consumer Price Index.

Item 1. Business - (continued) 

Fee-splitting; Corporate practice of medicine. We employ or contract with physicians or physician‑owned PCs to deliver physician services to our customers and their patients. We frequently enter into management services contracts with these physicians and PCs pursuant to which we provide billing, scheduling and a wide range of other services, and they pay us for those services out of the fees they collect from patients and third-party payors. These activities are subject to various state laws that prohibit the practice of medicine by lay entities or persons, the “corporate practice of medicine,” and are intended to prevent unlicensed persons from interfering with or influencing the physician’s professional judgment. In addition, various state laws also generally prohibit the sharing of professional services income with nonprofessional or business interests. Activities other than those directly related to the delivery of healthcare, such as scheduling, contracting, setting rates and the hiring and management of non-clinical personnel, may implicate the restrictions on the corporate practice of medicine or fee-splitting. In such states, we maintain long-term management contracts with affiliated physician groups, which employ or contract with physicians to provide physician services. In most instances within our surgery center business, the physicians and physician group practices whose members perform procedures at our surgery centers are not affiliated with us, other than through the physicians’ ownership in the entity that owns the surgery centers and through any service agreements we have with the physicians. We believe that we are in material compliance with applicable state laws relating to the corporate practice of medicine and fee-splitting. However, regulatory authorities or other parties, including our affiliated physicians, may assert that, despite these arrangements, we are engaged in the corporate practice of medicine or that our contractual arrangements with affiliated physician groups constitute unlawful fee-splitting. In this event, we could be subject to adverse judicial or administrative interpretations, to civil or criminal penalties, our contracts could be found legally invalid and unenforceable or we could be required to restructure our contractual arrangements with our affiliated physician groups.
Fair Debt Collection Practices Act. Some of our operations may be subject to compliance with certain provisions of the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act and comparable statutes in many states. Under the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, a third-party collection company is restricted in the methods it uses to contact consumer debtors and elicit payments with respect to placed accounts. Requirements under state collection agency statutes vary, with most requiring compliance similar to that required under the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act. We believe we are in substantial compliance with the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act and comparable state statutes where applicable.
Antitrust laws. The federal government and most states have enacted antitrust laws that prohibit certain types of conduct deemed to be anti-competitive. These laws prohibit price fixing, market allocation, bid-rigging, concerted refusal to deal, market monopolization, price discrimination, tying arrangements, acquisitions of competitors and other practices that have, or may have, an adverse effect on competition. Violations of federal or state antitrust laws can result in various sanctions, including criminal and civil penalties. Antitrust enforcement in the healthcare sector is currently a priority of the Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Justice. We believe we are in compliance with such federal and state laws, but courts or regulatory authorities may reach a determination in the future that could adversely affect our operations.
Environmental matters. We are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to hazardous materials, pollution and the protection of the environment. Such regulations include those governing emissions to air, discharges to water, storage, treatment and disposal of wastes, including medical waste, remediation of contaminated sites, and protection of worker health and safety. These laws and regulations frequently change and have become increasingly stringent over time. Non-compliance with these laws and regulations may result in significant fines or penalties or limitations on our operations or claims for remediation costs, as well as alleged personal injury or property damages. We believe our current operations are in substantial compliance with all applicable environmental, health and safety requirements and that we maintain all material permits required to operate our business.
Certain environmental laws and regulations impose strict, and under certain circumstances joint and several, liability for investigation and remediation of the release of regulated substances into the environment. Such liability can be imposed on current or former owners or operators of contaminated sites, or on persons who dispose or arrange for disposal of wastes at a contaminated site. Releases have occurred at a few of the facilities we lease as a result of historical practices of the owners or former operators. Based on available information, we do not believe that any known compliance obligations, releases or investigations under environmental laws or regulations will have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations. However, there can be no guarantee that these releases or newly discovered information, more stringent enforcement of or changes in environmental requirements, or our inability to enforce available indemnification agreements will not result in significant costs. 
Employees

As of December 31, 2017, we and our affiliated entities employed or contracted with approximately 69,300 persons, approximately 46,200 of whom were full-time employees or contractors and 23,100 of whom were part-time employees or contractors. We employ or contract with approximately 16,800 employees performing various clinical support and corporate functions. We lease the services of approximately 800 full-time employees and 400 part-time employees from entities affiliated with the physician partners in our ASCs.

Support Infrastructure and Technology
To support our clinical staff and client facilities, we maintain an infrastructure that provides clinical, administrative and business support services to physicians, other healthcare professionals and administrative staff. These support services include but are not limited to:

• | non-clinical operation management;


• | physician and allied care recruiting;


• | revenue cycle management;


• | compliance, education and oversight;


• | managed care contracting with third-party payors;


• | information technology;


• | human resources;


• | risk management;


• | quality improvement; and


• | credentialing.

These support services are critical to the success of our business. Personnel located at our corporate headquarters primarily provide these services, but we also have regional offices where we have substantial operations. These services allow us to leverage our operational excellence and existing infrastructure to provide services to our clients, employees and physicians. Our infrastructure has enabled us to integrate newly developed or acquired businesses while achieving significant economies of scale.
We have invested in and developed management information systems that support our current operations and that management believes will support our projected growth. We purchase hardware and software that has been customized for us, as well as develop our own technology in both our clinical and administrative areas, which we believe may provide a competitive advantage over local, regional and emerging national providers. There are several applications currently in use and under development that provide the foundation for our day-to-day operations, including:

• | Billing services - Billing systems that perform facilities-based revenue cycle management for each of the specialties in which we provide physician services, as well as for many of our ASCs.


• | Enterprise management - Enterprise-wide reporting systems that are used for all essential accounting and finance functions, which include both integrated human resource and payroll functions.


• | Recruitment and business development - A third-party database used by our business development departments and our physician recruitment subsidiary. This application is primarily used to develop a database of medical professionals that can be targeted in the recruitment process and also to manage other aspects of the recruitment and hiring process.


• | Web-based applications - Our web-based comprehensive neonatal clinical electronic health record system, which is used in each of the facilities where we provide NICU and newborn nursery services to gather all pertinent clinical data from our patients to determine outcomes. Our web-based portal providing physician partners with access to financial information, financial and quality benchmarking reports along with best practices from the ambulatory services segment community of surgery centers and peer, physician-to-physician, insights on latest technologies and therapies.

Intellectual Property
We have registered the trademarks for certain of our businesses, including Envision Physician Services and AmSurg. We have also registered the trademarks for certain logos used in the marketing of our businesses, including Envision Healthcare, Envision Physician Services and AmSurg. Generally, registered trademarks have perpetual life, provided that they are renewed on a timely basis and continue to be used properly as trademarks. We have also developed proprietary software that we protect through copyrights or contractual provisions and confidentiality procedures and agreements, including our EmComp, EmBillz and MEDS applications. Other than the intellectual property described above, we do not believe our business is dependent to a material degree on patents, copyrights, trademarks or trade secrets. Other than licenses to commercially available software, we do not believe that any of our licenses to third-party intellectual property are material to our business taken as a whole.

22


Item 1. Business - (continued) 

Insurance
Given the nature of the services we provide, we are subject to professional and general liability claims and related lawsuits in the ordinary course of business. We maintain insurance with third-party insurers generally on a claims-made basis, subject to self-insured retentions, exclusions and other restrictions. A substantial portion of our professional and general liability loss risks are being provided by a third-party insurer that is fully reinsured by our wholly owned captive insurance company. In addition, our wholly owned captive provide coverage for a substantial portion of our employee workers' compensation claims. The assets, liabilities and results of operations of our wholly owned captive insurance company subsidiary are included in our consolidated financial statements. 
The liabilities for self-insurance include estimates of the ultimate costs related to both reported claims on an individual and aggregate basis and unreported claims. We also obtain professional liability insurance on a claims-made basis from third-party insurers for certain of our owned practices and certain of our employed and affiliated physicians. 
Our reserves for our professional and general liability claims within the self-insured retention are based upon periodic actuarial calculations. Our reserves for losses and related expenses represent estimates involving actuarial and statistical projections, at a given point in time, of our expectation of the ultimate resolution plus administration costs of the losses that we have incurred. Our reserves are based on historical claims, demographic factors, industry trends, severity and exposure factors and other actuarial assumptions calculated by an independent actuarial firm. The independent actuarial firm performs studies of projected ultimate losses on an annual basis and we utilize these actuarial estimates to determine appropriate reserves. Liabilities for claims incurred but not reported are not discounted. The estimation of these liabilities is inherently complex and subjective, as these claims are typically resolved over an extended period of time, often as long as ten years or more. We periodically re-evaluate our accruals for our professional and general liabilities, and our actual results may vary significantly from our estimates if future claims differ from expected trends. The key assumptions used in our actuarial valuations are subject to constant adjustment as a result of changes in our actual loss history and the movement of projected emergence patterns as claims develop.
Corporate Compliance Program and Corporate Integrity Obligations 
We have developed a corporate compliance program in an effort to monitor compliance with federal and state laws and regulations applicable to healthcare entities, to ensure that we maintain high standards of conduct in the operation of our business and to implement policies and procedures so that employees act in compliance with all applicable laws, regulations and our policies. Our program also attempts to monitor compliance with our Corporate Compliance Plan, which details our standards for: (i) business ethics, (ii) compliance with applicable federal, state and local laws, and (iii) business conduct. We have a Compliance Department whose focus is to prevent, detect and mitigate regulatory risks and remediate issues if identified. We attempt to accomplish this mission through:

• | providing guidance, education and proper controls based on the regulatory risks associated with our business model and strategic plan,


• | conducting internal audits and reviews to identify any improper practices that may be occurring,


• | resolving regulatory matters, and


• | enhancing the ethical culture and leadership of the organization.

The OIG has issued a series of Compliance Program Guidance documents in which the OIG has set out the elements of an effective compliance program. We believe our compliance program has been structured appropriately in light of this guidance. The primary compliance program components recommended by the OIG, all of which we have attempted to implement, include:

• | formal policies and written procedures,


• | designation of a Compliance Officer,


• | education and training programs,


• | internal monitoring and reviews,


• | responding appropriately to detected misconduct,


• | open lines of communication, and


• | discipline and accountability.

Our Board reviews the effectiveness of our corporate compliance program on an annual basis. The Compliance and Quality Committee of our Board also meets regularly to provide oversight of our Compliance Program. Our corporate compliance program is based on the overall goal of promoting a culture that encourages employees to conduct activities with integrity, dignity and care for those we serve, and in compliance with all applicable laws and policies. Notwithstanding the foregoing, we audit compliance with our Compliance Program on a sample basis. Although such an approach reflects a reasonable and accepted approach in the industry, we cannot assure you that our program will detect and rectify all compliance issues in all markets and for all time periods.

23


Item 1. Business - (continued) 

As do other healthcare companies which operate effective compliance programs, from time to time we identify practices that may have resulted in Medicare or Medicaid overpayments or other regulatory issues. For example, we have previously identified situations in which we may have inadvertently utilized incorrect billing codes for some of the services we have billed to government programs such as Medicare or Medicaid, or billed for services which may not meet medical necessity guidelines. In such cases, if appropriate, it is our practice to disclose the issue to the affected government programs and to refund any resulting overpayments and, if appropriate, penalties. The government usually accepts such disclosures and repayments without taking further enforcement action, and we generally expect that to be the case with respect to our past and future disclosures and repayments. However, it is possible that such disclosures or repayments will result in allegations by the government that we have violated the False Claims Act or other laws, leading to investigations and possibly civil or criminal enforcement actions. We are required to refund any overpayments within 60 days of discovery. Failure to refund overpayments on a timely basis could result in civil monetary penalties or provide a basis for a false claims act allegation.
Corporate Integrity Agreements
When the U.S. Government settles a case involving allegations of billing or contracting misconduct with a healthcare provider, it typically requires the provider to enter into a Corporate Integrity Agreement (“CIA”) with the OIG for a set period of years. As a condition of settlement of a government investigation against our Rural/Metro Corporation subsidiary, our medical transportation operations were previously subject to a CIA requiring that we maintain a corporate compliance program. Rural/Metro was released from its obligations under the CIA in January 2018. On December 19, 2017, in connection with the resolution of the DOJ's investigation into physician services provided by the Company’s EmCare subsidiary at hospitals affiliated with Health Management Associates, Inc., the Company entered into a CIA with respect to its physician services business. The CIA provides that we will maintain, over a five-year term, a corporate compliance program with oversight of our emergency department and hospitalist medicine physician service lines that includes oversight, reporting, policy, screening and monitoring obligations, certain of which have been previously implemented through our existing compliance program, as described above. 
Among the expanded requirements to be implemented pursuant to the physician services CIA are the following: (i) additional contracting procedures to comply with the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, (ii) independent review of emergency and hospitalist medicine facility contracting, (iii) notification to the OIG of government investigations or legal proceedings, and (iv) reporting of overpayments and other "reportable events" (as defined in the CIA). We will satisfy our obligations under the CIA through our ongoing compliance program, which is overseen by our Board and was developed to monitor compliance on a comprehensive basis across all service lines at the direction of our Chief Compliance Officer.
If we fail or if we are accused of failing to comply with the terms of our existing CIAs, we may be subject to additional litigation or other government actions, including being excluded from participating in the Medicare program and other federal healthcare programs. If we enter into any settlement of healthcare regulatory claims with the U.S. Government in the future, we may be required to enter into additional CIAs.
See Item 1A, “Risk Factors-Risks Related to Healthcare Regulation” for additional information related to regulatory matters.
Seasonality
Historically, the impact of seasonal effects on our revenues and operating results has been dampened due to growth from acquisitions as well as our geographic diversification. Without giving effect to these growth and diversification factors and with the exception of emergency medicine and children's services, our net revenue would fluctuate based on the number of business days in each calendar quarter, because the majority of medical services provided by our anesthesiology, office-based practices and ambulatory surgery centers consist of scheduled procedures and office visits that occur during business hours. Our net revenue would also be impacted by unpredictable weather events such as snowstorms or hurricanes that reduce the number of days of operations as well as the number of patients. The timing, severity and geographical impact of influenza and other recurring viruses has also impacted revenues derived from our ED service line. Revenue in the fourth quarter was also be impacted by an increased utilization of services as patients try to utilize their healthcare benefits before they expire at year-end. In addition, we incur a significantly higher payroll tax expense during the first and second quarters due to a significant number of our employees exceeding the level of taxable wages for social security contributions during the second half of the year.
