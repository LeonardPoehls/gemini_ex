Item 1. Business.
 
Unless the context otherwise requires, the terms the “Company”, “Delta”, “we,” “our” and “us” refers to Delta International Oil & Gas Inc. and, as the context requires, its consolidated subsidiaries.
 
Background 
 
Delta was incorporated in Delaware on November 17, 1999. Our name was changed from Delta Mutual Inc. to our present name on October 29, 2013. We intend to change our name in the near future to reflect the changed focus of our business to real estate development.
 
The primary focus of the Company’s business since 2008 has been investments in oil and gas concessions in Argentina through our South American Hedge Fund, LLC (“SAHF”) subsidiary, which held oil and gas investments in Argentina. As a result of the review by our management team and our board of directors of oil and gas exploration and production operations in Argentina, and evaluation of a number of oil and gas properties over a period of several years, we concluded to dispose of our Argentina oil and gas operations, which was done in 2017 with the sale of SAHF, although we retain rights to a portion of the sale proceeds of certain Argentina concessions. During 2017, the Company focused on acquiring small interests in oil and gas properties and companies in the United States. After three acquisitions, the company could not find the appropriate funding for these projects, so it decided to divest from them as well. Following this decision, the Company decided to move forward with the acquisition of Nipton, Inc.
 
Our principal offices are located at HC1 Box 360, 107355 Nipton Rd., Nipton, CA 92364. Our telephone number is (720)573-0102. Our common stock is quoted on the Over-the-Counter Electronic Bulletin Board under the symbol “DLTZ”.
 
Recent Developments
 
On April 5, 2018, pursuant to a Securities Exchange Agreement dated as of March 14, 2018 (the “Agreement”), in exchange for 160,000 shares of our Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, convertible into 160,000,000 shares of our common stock, we closed the purchase from American Green, Inc. (“American Green”) of its subsidiary Nipton, Inc., a California corporation, the assets of which are comprised of all of the real estate properties included in the unincorporated township of Nipton, California (“Nipton”). Nipton is located near the Nevada border a short distance from Rte. 15, the principal highway between Los Angeles and Las Vegas.
 
Following the closing of the Nipton Acquisition, Nipton, Inc. became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, with American Green, the former stockholder of Nipton, Inc., owning a controlling interest of approximately 82% of the outstanding shares of common stock of Delta. Santiago Peralta has resigned as a director of the Company.

American Green, Inc., now our controlling stockholder, is the second oldest publicly-traded cannabis company in America and has participated in nearly all facets of the cannabis market. Delta’s management’s intentions are for Delta’s Nipton, Inc. subsidiary to act as a property developer, manager and lessor for companies in the medical or recreational cannabis sectors in the State of California, including such initiatives as the transformation of nearly-abandoned towns into “cannabis-friendly” destinations. It has been American Green’s vision (and now, Delta’s vision) to use Nipton, California as a revitalization model for other near-deserted small towns across America while retaining as much of the town’s and region’s natural charm. American Green will remain under contract with Delta to manage the Nipton asset and project for 10 years.
 
General
 
Through the Nipton Acquisition, we have changed our focus from the oil and gas industry to real estate development activities involving the further development and construction in Nipton, and we intend to expand our operations in Nipton and beyond to general real estate development opportunities for companies that are state-licensed firms involved in the medical and recreational markets for marijuana, initially in California. Full-scale real estate development and leasing activities in Nipton are projected to commence with the implementation of licensing and commercial operational regulations in San Bernardino County for licensed cannabis related businesses. To date, our commercial operations in Nipton under American Green’s management have been focused on cannabis group event hosting, and in the overall property rehabilitation and development of Nipton. Only after state and county regulatory and zoning authority regulations permitting commercial activities of firms operating in the recreational and medical cannabis sectors are in place, would we move into the cannabis product real estate development sector for development and leasing operations for licensed clients in that sector. We are evaluating real estate development operations in counties in California where the cannabis regulatory structure is in place, as well as in other states, although expanding real estate development activities outside San Bernardino County would require substantial additional capital.
 
American Green acquired Nipton in September 2017, and has since invested in excess of $2 million in infrastructure, commercial facilities and improvements. Nipton is situated on approximately 120 acres and is an unincorporated township with approximately fifteen buildings, such as houses, retail stores, a hotel and ECO cabins and Tee Pee’s. AG Managed Services (an American Green subsidiary) provides consulting and capital resources for existing and new-build industry operations such as its joint venture relationship it enjoys with Paw Puddy Pet Products. Nipton has received a substantial amount of media publicity, and virtually all of the major news networks have done features on the town and our plans for it. As the Nipton project develops in the future, the Company plans to interact with county, and state federal agencies to ensure it is acting well within all legal guidelines in all projects it undertakes in the acquisition and or construction, ownership, and management of commercial properties leased to California state-licensed operators for their regulated cultivation of medical-use cannabis or licensed recreational marijuana (THC and CBD) in the growing and warehouse retail facilities markets, as well as ancillary non-cannabis focused related properties.
 
Initially, our operations in Nipton will focus on development to build up the town’s infrastructure and industrial and commercial base, as well on the bottling of fresh CBD-infused water direct from a nearby aquifer which the Company will then seek to distribute throughout California. Discussions are underway with several well-established edible and extraction companies that have expressed interest in having production facilities in the town as well, all to be done paying strict adherence to regulatory guidelines. Ultimately, the Company would plan to develop Nipton so that it offers a variety of commercial and recreational attractions including: cannabidiol (CBD) and mineral baths, cannabis-product retail outposts, artists-in-residence programs, culinary events, and bed-and-breakfast lodging to complete the charming small-town experience. Future plans for the town also include setting the standard for energy efficiency and environmentally responsible tourism. We intend to expand the existing solar farm to move Nipton toward becoming a completely energy-independent town, including the development of the town’s existing aquifer system for water supply.

Market and Regulatory Conditions and Risks
 
Twenty-nine U.S. states, the District of Columbia and the territories of Guam and Puerto Rico have legalized the use of cannabis for medical use in some form, and eight have legalized cannabis for adult recreational use, in addition to the District of Columbia. Continued development of the regulated cannabis industry depends on continued legislative authorization at the state level. Progress is not assured and any number of factors could slow or halt progress in the cannabis industry.
 
Shortly after California fully legalized marijuana for recreational, as well as medical, use on January 1, 2018, the US Attorney General Jeff Sessions rescinded the so-called “Cole Memo” issued in President Obama’s administration, thereby potentially paving the way for federal prosecutors to target marijuana businesses. In a January 4, 2018 memorandum for all United States Attorneys, the Office of the Attorney General stated that prosecutors should follow the well-established principles that govern all federal prosecutions, and that the Cole Memo’s nationwide guidance specific to marijuana enforcement was unnecessary and thereby was rescinded. In addition, the Attorney General has expressed disapproval of marijuana legalization. The Cole Memo had generally allowed states to implement their own cannabis laws without U.S. Justice Department interference and banks to open accounts for some marijuana-related companies. The Cole memo rescission has made some banks question the legality of transactions in this industry, effectively making many legal cannabis companies consider once again working only in cash.

Federal Regulation
 
Cannabis is classified as a Schedule I controlled substance by the Drug Enforcement Agency, or DEA, and the U.S. Department of Justice with no medical use, and therefore it is illegal to grow, possess and consume cannabis under federal law. The Controlled Substances Act of 1910 (the “CSA”), bans cannabis-related businesses; the possession, cultivation and production of cannabis-infused products; and the distribution of cannabis and products derived from it. The federal government has the option of enforcing U.S. drug laws, creating a climate of legal uncertainty regarding the production and sale of medical- and recreational-use cannabis. Marijuana use, possession, and distribution being illegal under federal law, there is no exception or special treatment for medical use, and California law cannot override federal law
Laws Applicable to Banking for Cannabis Industry
 
All banks are subject to federal law, whether the bank is a national bank or state-chartered bank. At a minimum, all banks maintain federal deposit insurance which requires adherence to federal law. Violation of federal law could subject a bank to loss of its charter. Financial transactions involving proceeds generated by cannabis-related conduct can form the basis for prosecution under the federal money laundering statutes, unlicensed money transmitter statutes and the Bank Secrecy Act. For example, under the Bank Secrecy Act, banks must report to the federal government any suspected illegal activity, which would include any transaction associated with a cannabis-related business. These reports must be filed even though the business is operating in compliance with applicable state and local laws. Therefore, financial institutions that conduct transactions with money generated by cannabis-related conduct could face criminal liability under the Bank Secrecy Act for, among other things, failing to identify or report financial transactions that involve the proceeds of cannabis-related violations of the CSA.
 
The Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, or FinCen, guidance sets forth extensive requirements for financial institutions to meet if they want to offer bank accounts to cannabis-related businesses, including close monitoring of businesses to determine that they meet all of the requirements established by the U.S. Department of Justice. As a result, many banks are hesitant to offer any banking services to cannabis-related businesses, including opening bank accounts. If our proposed tenants are unable to access banking services, they will not be able to enter into leasing arrangements with us, as our leases will require rent payments to be made by check or wire transfer.

California Regulation 
 
Medical use of marijuana/cannabis has been legal since Proposition 215, the “Compassionate Use Act,” passed in 1996). In 2003, “safe harbor” amounts of 6 mature or 12 immature plants and 8 ounces of dried cannabis were established, guidelines for dispensaries were established and the rights of local governments to regulate such businesses. The California Medical and Adult-Use Cannabis Regulation and Safety Act enacted July 2017 now governs a complex licensing system for commercial production and sales of marijuana.
 
California has 58 counties and 482 incorporated cities across the state, each with the option to create its own rules or ban marijuana altogether. San Bernardino County and many of its cities still prohibit marijuana businesses but residents of the City of San Bernardino approved legislation, known as the San Bernardino Regulate Marijuana Act of 2016, which authorizes the City of San Bernardino to regulate both medical and recreational cannabis businesses consistent with California State law.
 
Licensing and Local Regulations
 
Where applicable, we will apply for applicable state and local licenses and permits that are necessary to conduct our business in compliance with local laws. There may be restrictions imposed on cannabis operators, which will restrict where cannabis operations may be located and the manner and size to which they can grow and operate. Zoning can be subject to change or withdrawal, and properties can be re-zoned. The zoning of our properties will have a direct impact on our business operations.
 
Many cities and counties prohibit or regulate dispensaries and the cultivation of marijuana. Any county or city may have its own unique ordinances. Due to the rapid changes in the law and the ongoing debates over marijuana, many local governments are currently revising their ordinances and placing tax and other measures before their voters.
 
San Bernardino County, where Nipton is located, is in southern California and is the fifth most populous county in the state and the twelfth most populous county in the United States. The Board of Supervisors moved in 2016 to ban all commercial cannabis activities within San Bernardino County with ordinance 4309 (now Chapter 84.34 of the County Code). Section 84.34.040 of this new ordinance provides for the following exemptions:
 
The prohibition concerning commercial cannabis activity does not apply to a person with an identification card cultivating cannabis for his or her personal medical use or to a primary caregiver cultivating cannabis for the personal medical use of no more than five specified persons with identification cards, subject to the following requirements:
 
(a)  The cannabis is not sold, distributed, donated, or provided to any other person or entity.
 
(b)  A primary caregiver may only receive compensation in full compliance with Health and Safety Code § 11362.765, subdivision
 
(c)  Cultivation may only be conducted indoors at the private residence of the person with an identification card or the primary caregiver of the person with an identification card.
 
(d)  Cultivation shall be limited to no more than:
 
(1)  Twelve cannabis plants per person with an identification card or primary caregiver per private residence; and,
 
(2)  An aggregate total of 24 cannabis plants per private residence when more than one person with an identification card or primary caregiver lives at the private residence.
 
A 45-day interim ordinance prohibiting marijuana businesses, outdoor cultivation and cannabis business adopted by the San Bernardino City Council expired February 3, 2018.
