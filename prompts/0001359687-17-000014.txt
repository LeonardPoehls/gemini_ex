ITEM 1.    BUSINESS
Business Development
Red Trail Energy, LLC was formed as a North Dakota limited liability company in July of 2003, for the purpose of constructing, owning and operating a fuel-grade ethanol plant near Richardton, North Dakota in western North Dakota. References to "we," "us," "our" and the "Company" refer to Red Trail Energy, LLC. We began production in January 2007.
On October 10, 2016, we satisfied the contingencies set forth in a Real Estate Sales Agreement (the "Real Estate Sales Agreement") between the Company and Bismarck Land Company, LLC. As a result of the satisfaction of the contingencies in the Real Estate Sales Agreement, we closed on the purchase of approximately 338 acres of land that we will use for an expansion of the Company's rail yard. In exchange for the purchased real estate, we agreed to issue to Bismarck Land Company, LLC two million of our membership units. We also agreed to a Profit and Cost Sharing Agreement with Bismarck Land Company, LLC that became effective with the closing of the real estate purchase. The Profit and Cost Sharing Agreement provides that we will share 70% of the net revenue generated by us from business activities conducted on the purchased real estate which are brought to the Company by Bismarck Land Company, LLC. This obligation will terminate ten years after the real estate closing or after Bismarck Land Company, LLC receives $10 million in proceeds from the agreement. In addition, we will pay Bismarck Land Company, LLC 70% of any net proceeds received by us from the sale of the subject real estate if a sale were to occur in the future, subject to the $10 million cap and the 10 year termination of this obligation.
In March 2017, we entered into a new $10 million revolving loan (the "Revolving Loan") with U.S. Bank National Association ("U.S. Bank"). As part of this transaction, we signed a Credit Agreement dated March 17, 2017 (the "Credit Agreement"). The Revolving Loan replaces our credit facilities with First National Bank of Omaha. Interest accrues on any outstanding balance on the Revolving Loan at a rate of 1.77% in excess of the one-month London Interbank Offered Rate ("LIBOR"). The maturity date of the Revolving Loan is May 31, 2018. Our ability to draw funds on the Revolving Loan is subject to a borrowing base calculation as set forth in the Credit Agreement. The Revolving Loan is subject to certain financial covenants as set forth in the Credit Agreement. The most significant financial covenants require us to maintain a fixed charge coverage ratio of no less than 1.25:1.00 and a current ratio of no less than 1.50:1.00. Our fixed charge coverage ratio measures our ability to pay our fixed expenses. Our current ratio measures our liquidity and ability to pay short-term and long-term obligations.
Financial Information
Please refer to "ITEM 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" for information about our revenue, profit and loss measurements and total assets and liabilities and "ITEM 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" for our financial statements and supplementary data. 
Principal Products

The principal products that we produce are ethanol, distillers grains and corn oil. The table below shows the approximate percentage of our total revenue which is attributed to each of our primary products for each of our last three fiscal years.

Product | Fiscal Year 2017 | | Fiscal Year 2016 | | Fiscal Year 2015
Ethanol | 82 | % | | 78 | % | 81 | %
Distillers Grains | 14 | % | | 19 | % | 17 | %
Corn Oil | 4 | % | | 3 | % | 2 | %

Ethanol
Ethanol is ethyl alcohol, a fuel component made primarily from corn and various other grains, which can be used as: (i) an octane enhancer in fuels; (ii) an oxygenated fuel additive for the purpose of reducing ozone and carbon monoxide vehicle emissions; and (iii) a non-petroleum-based gasoline substitute. Ethanol produced in the United States is primarily used for blending with unleaded gasoline and other fuel products. Ethanol blended fuel is typically designated in the marketplace according to the percentage of the fuel that is ethanol, with the most common fuel blend being E10, which contains 10% ethanol. The United States Environmental Protection Agency (the "EPA") has approved the use of gasoline blends that contain 15% ethanol, or E15, 
4

for use in all vehicles manufactured in model year 2001 and later. In addition, flexible fuel vehicles can use gasoline blends that contain up to 85% ethanol called E85. 
Distillers Grains
The principal co-product of the ethanol production process is distillers grains, a high protein animal feed supplement primarily marketed to the dairy and beef industry. We produce two forms of distillers grains: distillers dried grains and modified distillers grains. Modified distillers grains is processed corn mash that has been dried to approximately 50% moisture which has a shelf life of approximately seven days and is often sold to nearby markets. Distillers dried grains is processed corn mash that has been dried to approximately 10% moisture. It has a longer shelf life and may be sold and shipped to any market regardless of its vicinity to our ethanol plant. 
Corn Oil
In March 2012, we commenced operating our corn oil extraction equipment. The corn oil that we are capable of producing is not food grade corn-oil and it cannot be used for human consumption. The primary uses of the corn oil that we produce are for animal feed, industrial uses and biodiesel production.
Principal Product Markets
We market nearly all of our products through a professional third party marketer, RPMG, Inc. ("RPMG"). The only products we sell which are not marketed by RPMG are certain modified distillers grains which we market internally to local customers. RPMG is a subsidiary of Renewable Products Marketing Group, LLC ("RPMG, LLC"). We are a part owner of RPMG, LLC which allows us to realize favorable marketing fees for our products and allows us to share in the profits generated by RPMG, LLC. Our ownership interest in RPMG, LLC also entitles us to a seat on its board of directors which is filled by Gerald Bachmeier, our Chief Executive Officer.  Except for the modified distillers grains we market locally, RPMG decides where our products are marketed and sold. Our products are primarily sold in the domestic market; however, as domestic production of ethanol, distillers grains and corn oil continue to expand, we anticipate increased international sales of our products. Recently, the United States has exported a significant amount of distillers grains to Mexico, Turkey, South Korea, Thailand, China and Canada. In addition, the United States exported significant amounts of ethanol to Canada, Brazil, India, China, South Korea, the Philippines and Peru. 
We expect our product marketer to explore all markets for our products, including export markets. However, due to high transportation costs, and the fact that we are not located near a major international shipping port, we expect a majority of our products to continue to be marketed and sold domestically. 
Distribution Methods
Our ethanol plant is located near Richardton, North Dakota in Stark County, in the western half of North Dakota. We selected the Richardton site because of its proximity to existing coal supplies, the initial fuel source for our ethanol plant, and accessibility to road and rail transportation. Our plant is served by the Burlington Northern and Santa Fe Railway Company.

We sell and market the ethanol, distillers grains and corn oil produced at the plant through normal and established markets, including local, regional and national markets. Our products are primarily shipped by rail and by truck in our local market. We have separate marketing agreements with RPMG for our ethanol, distillers grains and corn oil. Whether or not our products are sold in local markets will depend on decisions made by RPMG, except for the modified distillers grains which we internally market locally. Local markets are evaluated on a case-by-case basis.

Ethanol

We have an exclusive marketing agreement with RPMG for the purposes of marketing and distributing all of the ethanol we produce at the ethanol plant. Because we are an owner of RPMG, LLC, our marketing fees are based on RPMG's actual cost to market our ethanol. Our ethanol marketing agreement provides that we can sell our ethanol either through an index arrangement or at a fixed price agreed to between us and RPMG. The term of our ethanol marketing agreement is perpetual, until it is terminated according to the terms of the agreement. The primary reasons the ethanol marketing agreement would terminate are if we cease to be an owner of RPMG, LLC, if there is a breach of the agreement which is not cured, or if we give advance notice to RPMG that we would like to terminate the agreement. Notwithstanding our right to terminate the ethanol marketing agreement, we may be obligated to continue to market our ethanol through RPMG for a period of time after the termination. Further, following the termination, we agreed to accept an assignment of certain railcar leases which RPMG has secured to service us. If the ethanol marketing agreement is terminated, it would trigger a redemption of our ownership interest in RPMG, LLC.

Distillers Grains

On August 29, 2013, we executed a distillers grain marketing agreement with RPMG effective starting on October 1, 2013. Pursuant to the marketing agreement, RPMG markets all of the dried distillers grains we produce and we will continue to internally market our modified distillers grains. Due to the fact that we are a part owner of RPMG, LLC, RPMG will only charge us its actual cost of marketing our distillers grains to its customers.  The initial term of the marketing agreement was one year and thereafter the agreement renews for additional one year periods unless we elect not to renew the agreement. The agreement may be terminated by either party based on certain events described in the agreement or based on the bankruptcy or insolvency of either party. 
We market and sell our modified distillers grains internally.  Substantially all of our sales of modified distillers grains are to local farmers and feed lots.
Corn Oil
In March 2012, we executed a corn oil marketing agreement with RPMG to sell all of the corn oil that we produce. We pay RPMG a commission based on each pound of corn oil that RPMG sells on our behalf. The initial term of the corn oil marketing agreement was one year and the agreement automatically renews for additional one year terms unless either party gives notice that it will not extend the agreement past the current term.
New Products and Services
We did not introduce any new products or services during our 2017 fiscal year. 
Sources and Availability of Raw Materials 
Corn
Our ethanol plant used approximately 22 million bushels of corn during our 2017 fiscal year, or approximately 60,000 bushels per day, as the feedstock for its dry milling process. Our commodity manager is responsible for purchasing corn for our operations, scheduling corn deliveries and establishing hedging positions to protect the price we pay for corn. 
During our 2017 fiscal year, we were able to secure sufficient corn to operate the plant and do not anticipate any problems securing enough corn during our 2018 fiscal year. Almost all of our corn is supplied from farmers and local grain elevators in North Dakota and South Dakota. Corn prices have been lower in recent years due to large corn crops harvested in each of the last four years. Further, growing conditions were favorable during 2017 which led to a large corn crop harvested in the fall of 2017. As a result of these large corn crops, we have not had difficulty securing the corn we require for our operations. While we do not anticipate encountering problems sourcing corn, a shortage of corn could develop, particularly if we experience an extended drought or other production problem during our 2018 fiscal year.  Poor weather can be a major factor in increasing corn prices.  If the United States were to endure an entire growing season with poor weather conditions, it could result in a prolonged period of higher than normal corn prices.  
Corn prices are also impacted by world supply and demand, the price of other commodities, current and anticipated stocks, domestic and export prices and supports and the government's current and anticipated agricultural policy.  Corn prices have been volatile in the past and volatility could return to the market in the future. While we have experienced several years of very favorable corn crops with relatively flat corn demand which reduced market corn prices, if poor weather conditions lead to a decrease in the amount of corn produced in the future, it could result in corn price volatility and increased corn prices. 
Natural Gas
Following our natural gas conversion project which was completed during the second quarter of our 2015 fiscal year, we use natural gas as the fuel source to power our ethanol plant. We are using natural gas to produce process steam and to dry our distillers grains products. Due to our close proximity to the Bakken oil field which produces a significant amount of natural gas, we anticipate that natural gas prices in our area will remain lower and the cost to transport the natural gas to our ethanol plant will be low. We entered into a natural gas supply agreement with Rainbow Gas Company which provides a supply of natural gas to the ethanol plant. We do not anticipate any difficulty securing the natural gas we require to operate the ethanol plant.
6

Coal
In previous years, we used coal as the fuel source to operate our ethanol plant. However, we converted the ethanol plant to a natural gas fired plant during the second quarter of our 2015 fiscal year. As a result, we do not anticipate using coal to fire the ethanol plant in the future and changes in the price or availability of coal will not impact our operations. We maintain the equipment necessary to operate the ethanol plant using coal as the fuel source which management believes could benefit us in the future, especially if natural gas prices increase or natural gas is not available at the ethanol plant.
Electricity

The production of ethanol uses significant amounts of electricity. We entered into a contract with Roughrider Electric Cooperative to provide our needed electrical energy.   This contract was renewed in August 2017. This contract automatically renews unless either party gives notice of its intent not to renew the agreement.
Water
To meet the plant's water requirements, we entered into a ten-year contract with Southwest Water Authority to purchase raw water.  Our contract requires us to purchase a minimum of 160 million gallons of water per year.  We anticipate receiving adequate water supplies during our 2018 fiscal year.
Patents, Trademarks, Licenses, Franchises and Concessions
We do not currently hold any patents, trademarks, franchises or concessions. We were granted a perpetual and royalty free license by ICM, Inc. ("ICM") to use certain ethanol production technology necessary to operate our ethanol plant. The cost of the license granted by ICM was included in the amount we paid to Fagen, Inc. to design and build the plant. 
Seasonality of Sales
We experience some seasonality of demand for our ethanol, distillers grains and corn oil. Since ethanol is predominantly blended with gasoline for use in automobiles, ethanol demand tends to shift in relation to gasoline demand. As a result, we experience some seasonality of demand for ethanol in the summer months related to increased driving and, as a result, increased gasoline demand. In addition, we experience some increased ethanol demand during holiday seasons related to increased gasoline demand. We also experience decreased distillers grains demand during the summer months due to natural depletion in the number of animals at feed lots and during times when cattle are turned out to pasture. Finally, corn oil is used for biodiesel production which typically decreases in the winter months due to decreased biodiesel demand. This decrease in biodiesel demand leads to decreased corn oil demand during the winter months.
Working Capital
We primarily use our working capital for purchases of raw materials necessary to operate our ethanol plant and for capital expenditures to maintain and upgrade the plant. Our primary sources of working capital are cash from our operations as well as our revolving line-of-credit with US Bank. Management anticipates that we will have sufficient working capital to operate at capacity during our 2018 fiscal year without seeking additional sources of equity or debt financing. However, if we experience unfavorable operating conditions during our 2018 fiscal year, it is possible we may need to secure additional sources of working capital. 
Dependence on a Few Major Customers
As discussed above, we rely on RPMG for the sale and distribution of all of our ethanol, dried distillers grains and corn oil. Accordingly, we are highly dependent on RPMG for the successful marketing of most of our products. We anticipate that we would be able to secure alternate marketers should RPMG fail, however, a loss of our relationship with RPMG could significantly harm our financial performance.
Competition
We are in direct competition with numerous ethanol producers, many of which have greater resources than we have. Larger ethanol producers may be able to take advantage of economies of scale due to their larger size and increased bargaining power with both customers and raw material suppliers. As of October 27, 2017, the Renewable Fuels Association ("RFA") estimates that there are 213 ethanol production facilities in the United States with capacity to produce approximately 16.1 billion gallons 
7

of ethanol annually. The RFA also estimates that approximately 3% of the ethanol production capacity in the United States is currently idled. In the past, the ethanol industry experienced consolidation where a few larger ethanol producers emerged who control a large portion of United States ethanol production. The largest ethanol producers include Archer Daniels Midland, Flint Hills Resources, Green Plains Renewable Energy, Pacific Ethanol, POET, and Valero Renewable Fuels, each of which are capable of producing significantly more ethanol than we produce. Collectively this group controls approximately 47% of the ethanol production capacity in the United States. 
The following table identifies the largest ethanol producers in the United States along with their production capacities.

Ethanol Competition
Ethanol is a commodity product where competition in the industry is predominantly based on price and consistent fuel quality. Larger ethanol producers may be able to realize economies of scale in their operations that we are unable to realize. Further, we have experienced increased competition from oil companies who have purchased ethanol production facilities, including Valero Renewable Fuels and Flint Hills Resources, which are subsidiaries of larger energy companies. These oil companies are required to blend a certain amount of ethanol each year. Therefore, the oil companies may be able to operate their ethanol production facilities at times when it is unprofitable for us to operate our ethanol plant. Further, some ethanol producers own multiple ethanol plants which may allow them to compete more effectively by providing them flexibility to run certain production facilities while they have other facilities shut down. This added flexibility may allow these ethanol producers to compete more effectively, especially during periods when operating margins are unfavorable in the ethanol industry. Finally some ethanol producers who own ethanol plants in geographically diverse areas of the United States may spread the risk they encounter related to feedstock prices due to localized decreased corn production and supplies. 
We anticipate increased competition from renewable fuels that do not use corn as the feedstock. Many of the current ethanol production incentives are designed to encourage the production of renewable fuels using raw materials other than corn. One type of ethanol production feedstock that is being explored is cellulose. Cellulose is the main component of plant cell walls and is the most common organic compound on earth. Cellulose is found in wood chips, corn stalks, rice straw, amongst other common plants. Cellulosic ethanol is ethanol produced from cellulose. If this technology can be profitably employed on a commercial scale, it could potentially lead to ethanol that is less expensive to produce than corn based ethanol. Cellulosic ethanol may also capture more government subsidies and assistance than corn-based ethanol. This could decrease demand for our product or result in competitive disadvantages for our ethanol production process.
A number of automotive, industrial and power generation manufacturers are developing alternative clean power systems using fuel cells, plug-in hybrids, electric cars or clean burning gaseous fuels. Electric car technology has recently grown in popularity, especially in urban areas. While there are currently a limited number of vehicle recharging stations, making electric cars not feasible for all consumers, there has been increased focus on developing these recharging stations to make electric car technology more widely available in the future. Additional competition from these other sources of alternative energy, particularly in the automobile market, could reduce the demand for ethanol, which would negatively impact our profitability.
In addition to domestic producers of ethanol, we face competition from ethanol produced in foreign countries, particularly Brazil. Ethanol imports have been lower in recent years and ethanol exports have been higher which was one of the reasons for improved operating margins in the ethanol industry. As of May 1, 2013, Brazil increased its domestic ethanol use requirement 
8

from 20% to 25% which decreased the amount of ethanol available in Brazil for export. Further, in August 2017, Brazil instituted a quota and tariff on ethanol produced in the United States and exported to Brazil which also is likely to decrease the amount of ethanol Brazil has available for export. In the future, we may experience increased ethanol imports from Brazil which could put negative pressure on domestic ethanol prices and result in excess ethanol supply in the United States. 
Competition among ethanol producers may continue to increase as gasoline demand decreases due to more fuel efficient vehicles being produced. If the concentration of ethanol used in most gasoline does not increase and gasoline demand is lower due to increased fuel efficiency by the vehicles operated in the United States, competition may increase among ethanol producers to supply the ethanol market.
Finally, many ethanol producers are increasing their production capacities through expansion projects which are expected to start becoming operational during our 2018 fiscal year. These expansion projects may lead to an excess supply of ethanol in the market which could negatively impact market ethanol prices.
Distillers Grains Competition
Our ethanol plant competes with other ethanol producers in the production and sales of distillers grains. Distillers grains are primarily used as an animal feed which replaces corn and soybean meal. As a result, we believe that distillers grains prices are positively impacted by increases in corn and soybean prices. In addition, in recent years the United States ethanol industry has increased exports of distillers grains which management believes has positively impacted demand and prices for distillers grains in the United States. In the event these distillers grains exports decrease, it could lead to an oversupply of distillers grains in the United States which could result in increased competition among ethanol producers for sales of distillers grains and could negatively impact distillers grains prices in the United States.
Corn Oil Competition
We compete with many ethanol producers for the sale of corn oil. Many ethanol producers have installed the equipment necessary to separate corn oil from the distillers grains they produce which has increased competition for corn oil sales and has resulted in lower market corn oil prices.
Governmental Regulation and Federal Ethanol Supports
Federal Ethanol Supports
The ethanol industry is dependent on the ethanol use requirement in the Federal Renewable Fuels Standard (the "RFS"). The RFS requires that in each year, a certain amount of renewable fuels must be used in the United States. The RFS is a national program that does not require that any renewable fuels be used in any particular area or state, allowing refiners to use renewable fuel blends in those areas where it is most cost-effective. The RFS statutory volume requirement increases incrementally each year until the United States is required to use 36 billion gallons of renewable fuels by 2022. Starting in 2009, the RFS required that a portion of the RFS must be met by certain "advanced" renewable fuels. These advanced renewable fuels include ethanol that is not made from corn, such as cellulosic ethanol and biomass based biodiesel. The use of these advanced renewable fuels increases each year as a percentage of the total renewable fuels required to be used in the United States.
The EPA has the authority to waive the RFS statutory volume requirement, in whole or in part, provided one of the following two conditions have been met: (1) there is inadequate domestic renewable fuel supply; or (2) implementation of the requirement would severely harm the economy or environment of a state, region or the United States. Annually, the EPA is required to pass a rule that establishes the number of gallons of different types of renewable fuels that must be used in the United States which is called the renewable volume obligations ("RVO").
The statutory RVO for all renewable fuels for 2017 was 24 billion gallons, of which corn-based ethanol could meet 15 billion gallons of the RVO. However, the EPA rule decreased the total RVO to 19.28 billion gallons and maintained the 15 billion gallon corn-based ethanol limit. On November 30, 2017, the final RVO for 2018 was set at 19.29 billion gallons and the corn-based ethanol RVO was set at 15 billion gallons. 
The ethanol industry believes that this significant departure from the statutory requirements for the RFS is not supported by the law and will have a significant negative impact on the ethanol industry. Management anticipates that there will be legal challenges to the EPA's final RVO release.

Most ethanol that is used in the United States is sold in a blend called E10. E10 is a blend of 10% ethanol and 90% gasoline. E10 is approved for use in all standard vehicles. Estimates indicate that gasoline demand in the United States is approximately 143 billion gallons per year. Assuming that all gasoline in the United States is blended at a rate of 10% ethanol and 90% gasoline, the maximum domestic demand for ethanol is approximately 14.3 billion gallons per year. This is commonly referred to as the "blend wall," which represents a theoretical limit where more ethanol cannot be blended into the national gasoline pool. This is a theoretical limit because it would not be possible to blend ethanol into every gallon of gasoline that is being used in the United States and it discounts the use of higher percentage blends such as E15 or E85. These higher percentage blends may lead to additional ethanol demand if they become more widely available and accepted by the market.
Many in the ethanol industry believe that it will be impossible to meet the RFS requirement in future years without an increase in the percentage of ethanol that can be blended with gasoline for use in standard (non-flex fuel) vehicles. The EPA has approved the use of E15, gasoline which is blended at a rate of 15% ethanol and 85% gasoline, in vehicles manufactured in the model year 2001 and later. However, there are still state hurdles that need to be addressed in some states before E15 will become more widely available. Many states still have regulatory issues that prevent the sale of E15. Sales of E15 may be limited because it is not approved for use in all vehicles, the EPA requires a label that management believes may discourage consumers from using E15, and retailers may choose not to sell E15 due to concerns regarding liability. In addition, different gasoline blendstocks may be required at certain times of the year in order to use E15 due to federal regulations related to fuel evaporative emissions which may limit E15 sales in these markets. As a result, the approval of E15 by the EPA has not had an immediate impact on ethanol demand in the United States.
Effect of Governmental Regulation
The government's regulation of the environment changes constantly. We are subject to extensive air, water and other environmental regulations and we have been required to obtain a number of environmental permits to construct and operate the ethanol plant. It is possible that more stringent federal or state environmental rules or regulations could be adopted, which could increase our operating costs and expenses. It also is possible that federal or state environmental rules or regulations could be adopted that could have an adverse effect on the use of ethanol. Plant operations are governed by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration ("OSHA"). OSHA regulations may change such that the costs of operating the ethanol plant may increase. Any of these regulatory factors may result in higher costs or other adverse conditions effecting our operations, cash flows and financial performance. 
We have obtained all of the necessary permits to operate the ethanol plant. During our 2017 fiscal year, we incurred costs and expenses of approximately $50,000 complying with environmental laws, including the cost of obtaining permits. Although we have been successful in obtaining all of the permits currently required, any retroactive change in environmental regulations, either at the federal or state level, could require us to obtain additional or new permits or spend considerable resources in complying with such regulations. Management believes converting the plant to use natural gas as the fuel source instead of coal will reduce our environmental compliance costs.
In late 2009, California passed a Low Carbon Fuels Standard ("LCFS"). The California LCFS requires that renewable fuels used in California must accomplish certain reductions in greenhouse gases which is measured using a lifecycle analysis, similar to the RFS. The LCFS could have a negative impact on demand for corn-based ethanol and result in decreased ethanol prices affecting our ability to operate profitably.
The European Union concluded an anti-dumping investigation related to ethanol produced in the United States and exported to Europe which resulted in the imposition of a tariff on the imported ethanol. This tariff has in the past and may continue to result in decreased exports of ethanol to Europe thereby negatively impacting the market price of ethanol in the United States. The anti-dumping tariff is scheduled to expire in 2018 which may result in additional exports to the European Union during our 2018 fiscal year.
In August 2017, Brazil instituted an import quota for ethanol produced in the United States and exported to Brazil, along with a 20% tariff on ethanol imports in excess of the quota. This tariff and quota have reduced exports of ethanol to Brazil and may continue to negatively impact ethanol exports from the United States. Any reduction in ethanol exports could negatively impact market ethanol prices in the United States.
Employees
As of December 15, 2017, we had 46 full-time employees. We anticipate that we will have approximately 47 full-time employees during the next 12 months.

Financial Information about Geographic Areas
All of our operations are domiciled in the United States. All of the products sold to our customers for our 2017, 2016 and 2015 fiscal years were produced in the United States and all of our long-lived assets are domiciled in the United States. We have engaged a third-party professional marketer which decides where our products are marketed and we have limited control over the marketing decisions made by our marketer. Our marketer may decide to sell our products in countries other than the United States. However, we anticipate that our products will primarily be marketed and sold in the United States.
