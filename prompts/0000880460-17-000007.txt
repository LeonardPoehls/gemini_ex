For reporting purposes, the wholesale business also includes the Company’s manufacturing divisions, Parlux and Five Star, which own and license designer and other fragrance brands, that are sold to national department stores, international distributors, through QFG, SOW's consignment business and Perfumania's retail stores, paying royalties to the licensors based on a percentage of sales. All manufacturing operations are outsourced to third-party manufacturers. 
Our retail business is conducted through three subsidiaries:

• | Perfumania, a specialty retailer of fragrances and related products,


• | Perfumania.com, an internet retailer of fragrances and other specialty items, and

Wholesale Business
QFG distributes designer fragrances to mass market retailers, drug and other chain stores, retail wholesale clubs, traditional wholesalers, and other distributors throughout the United States. It buys designer fragrances principally from the brand owners/manufacturers. QFG strives to increase its selection of brands, sizes and price points in order to be a one stop shop for its customers. QFG’s sales are principally to retailers such as Burlington Coat Factory ("Burlington"), Kohl’s, Marshalls, Nordstrom Rack, Ross Stores, Sears, Walgreens and Wal-Mart. 
Parlux engages in the manufacture (through sub-contractors), distribution and sale of Kenneth Cole®, Shawn Carter, professionally known as Jay-Z®, Paris Hilton®, Jessica Simpson®, Rihanna®, Marc Ecko®, Vince Camuto®, Donald Trump® and Ivanka Trump® fragrances and related beauty products on an exclusive basis as a licensee or sublicensee. The Jason Wu® fragrance will launch during the summer of 2017. Parlux's products are distributed in a variety of sizes and packaging. Beauty related products such as body lotions, creams, shower gels, deodorants, soaps and dusting powders complement the fragrance line. Parlux designs and creates fragrances using its own staff and independent contractors. Parlux supervises the design of its packaging by independent contractors to create products appealing to the intended customer base. The creation and marketing of each product line is closely linked with the applicable brand name, its positioning and market trends for the prestige fragrance industry. This development process usually takes twelve to eighteen months to complete. Parlux's fragrances generally retail at prices ranging from $25 to $1,500 per item with the core products between $70 and $85, and, along with certain of Five Star's licensed brands (see below), are sold in the United States in national and regional department stores,

including Belk, Bon Ton, Boscovs, Dillards, Lord & Taylor, Macy's, Neiman Marcus, Nordstrom and Stage Stores, on military bases throughout the United States, at Perfumania's retail stores, through SOW's consignment business and at selected other cosmetic retailers. In international markets, distributors sell Parlux's products to local department stores as well as to numerous perfumeries in the local markets. Selected Parlux products are also sold by QFG. We also fulfill a selection of fragrances for several online retailers, shipping directly to their customers and billing the retailers.
Five Star’s owned and licensed brands include Tommy Bahama®, Bijan®, Gale Hayman®, Michael Jordan®, Pierre Cardin®, Royal Copenhagen®, Royal Secret®, Vicky Tiel®, XOXO®, Snookie®, Realm®, Norell®, Lutece®, Pavlova®, Raffinee®, and the Major League Baseball clubs, and are sold principally through QFG, SOW’s consignment business and Perfumania’s retail stores, and to a lesser extent at selected United States national and regional department stores. Five Star handles the manufacturing, on behalf of Perfumania, of the Jerome Privee® product line, which includes bath and body products, and which is sold exclusively in Perfumania’s retail stores.
There were no customers who accounted for more than 10% of revenues in fiscal 2016 or 2015.
Retail Business
Perfumania is a leading specialty retailer and distributor of a wide range of brand name and designer fragrances. At January 28, 2017, Perfumania operated a chain of 287 “full service” retail stores, specializing in the sale of fragrances and related products at discounted prices up to 75% below the manufacturers’ suggested retail prices. Each of Perfumania’s retail stores generally offers approximately 2,000 different fragrance items for women, men and children. These stores stock brand name and designer brands such as Azzaro®, Burberry®, Bvlgari®, Calvin Klein®, Carolina Herrera®, Christian Dior®, Dolce & Gabbana®, Donna Karan®, Estee Lauder®, Giorgio Armani®, Givenchy®, Gucci®, Guess®, Hugo Boss®, Issey Miyake®, Jimmy Choo®, Lacoste®, Mont Blanc®, Paco Rabanne®, Ralph Lauren/Polo®, Versace® and Yves Saint Laurent®1 as well as Parlux and Five Star brands. Perfumania also exclusively carries a private label line of bath and body products under the name Jerome Privee®. The retail business is principally operated through Magnifique Parfumes and Cosmetics, Inc., a subsidiary of Perfumania, and the stores operate under the name “Perfumania.”® Perfumania’s retail stores are located in regional malls, manufacturers’ outlet malls, lifestyle centers and suburban strip shopping centers.
Perfumania.com, our Company-owned website, offers a selection of our more popular products for sale online. We benefit from our ability to reach a large group of customers from a central site. This also enables us to display a larger number of products than traditional store-based or catalog sellers, and the ability to frequently adjust featured selections and edit content and pricing provides significant merchandising flexibility. Our website not only builds brand awareness but generates incremental sales and helps us access geographic markets where we do not have a physical store. It is designed to complement the in-store experience and play a vital role in both our omni-channel strategy and the customer experience, and provides for full omni-channel capabilities, including “ship-from-store,” “order-in-store,” “reserve-in-store” and “purchase-online-pickup-in-store”, enabling our customers to interact with Perfumania any way they want. 
SOW operates the largest national designer fragrance consignment program, with contractual relationships to sell products on a consignment basis in approximately 1,600 stores, including more than 600 Kmart locations nationwide, as well as through customers such as Steinmart, Bealls and K&G. SOW determines the pricing and the products displayed in each of its retail consignment locations and pays a percentage of the sales proceeds to the retailer for its profit and overhead applicable to these sales. Overhead includes sales associate payroll and benefits, rental of fragrance space and, in some instances, an inventory shrink allowance. Consignment fees vary depending in part on whether SOW or the retailer absorbs inventory shrinkage.
The retail segment’s overall profitability depends principally on our ability to purchase a wide assortment of merchandise at favorable prices, attract customers and successfully conclude retail sales. Other factors affecting our profitability include general economic conditions, competition, availability of volume discounts, number of stores in operation, timing of store openings and closings and the effects of special promotions. 
Seasonality and Quarterly Results
The Company’s business is highly seasonal, with the most significant activity occurring from September through

December each year. Wholesale sales are stronger during the months of September through November, since retailers need to receive merchandise well before the holiday season begins, with approximately 36.6% and 37.5% of total wholesale revenues being generated during these three months in fiscal 2016 and 2015, respectively. Retail revenues are the greatest in December, with approximately 21.0% and 20.4% of retail revenues being generated this month in fiscal 2016 and 2015, respectively, as is typical for a retail operation. 
Strategy
The Company’s business strategy includes its product strategy and its sales strategy. We review and seek to improve both on an ongoing basis. 
The Company uses its experience in the fragrance industry, knowledge of the fragrance market, and business relationships to selectively acquire new fragrance licenses and to introduce new products in order to adapt to shifting consumer preferences and to offset the gradual decline in sales of products that are later in their life cycles. It seeks to increase the portfolio of brands for both wholesale distribution and retail sale by presenting a diverse sales opportunity for a designer’s brand, thereby enhancing its purchasing opportunities.
The Company’s sales strategy has historically relied heavily on retail stores in desirable locations. When opening new stores, Perfumania has sought locations primarily in high traffic manufacturers’ outlet malls, regional malls and, selectively, on a stand-alone basis in suburban shopping centers in metropolitan areas. We continuously monitor store performance and periodically close under-performing stores, which typically have been older stores in less desirable locations. As of January 28, 2017, we operated 287 Perfumania stores in the United States, Puerto Rico and the United States Virgin Islands. 
With the rapidly increasing shift in consumer shopping patterns out of traditional retail to e-commerce, management is reviewing and updating the Company’s sales strategy, including our business model and cost structure, to identify initiatives to reduce and align our overhead structure with our current business model, improve supply chain efficiency, optimize marketing spending, reduce expenses and improve operating results in the long-term. 
We are focused on carefully managing and reducing Perfumania's physical retail store portfolio. We intend to strictly limit the number of new Perfumania store openings for the foreseeable future, and will focus on maximizing sales and store productivity and controlling expenses at existing stores. We are also accelerating the closure of under-performing stores and stores where we anticipate declining mall traffic and do not see the potential for long-term growth and profitability. In fiscal 2015 and 2016, Perfumania opened nine and four stores, respectively, excluding seasonal locations, and closed 16 stores and 30 stores, respectively, excluding seasonal locations. During the first quarter of fiscal 2017, we closed an additional 43 stores.
We emphasize our internet / e-commerce strategy as described above under “Retail Business.” Increasing the sales of Perfumania's e-commerce website is one of our key growth strategies and, during fiscal 2017, we will allocate additional resources and focus on improving our customer's online experience and will look for new ways to leverage digital technologies and to connect with our customers. We believe we can significantly increase our e-commerce penetration and establish the framework of a successful long-term e-commerce strategy. As customers increasingly shop across multiple channels, we will continue to invest in these and other omni-channel initiatives in order to create a more seamless shopping experience for our customers.
 Supply Chain and Manufacturing
Excluding owned and licensed brands of Parlux and Five Star, the Company purchases approximately 75% of its fragrances directly from brand owners/manufacturers and the balance from distributors and wholesalers. Its suppliers include a majority of the largest fragrance manufacturers in the United States. The distributors represent, for the most part, long-standing relationships, some of which are also customers of the Company. The Company maintains a regular dialogue with all fragrance brand manufacturers directed toward broadening its product offerings to its customers. The Company believes that having both wholesale and retail customers is desirable to most fragrance brand manufacturers and enhances its opportunities to further expand these relationships. As is customary in the fragrance industry, the Company has no long-term or exclusive contracts with these suppliers.
Raw materials and components (“raw materials”) for Parlux's and Five Star's fragrance products are available mainly from sources in the United States, Europe and the Far East. We source the raw materials, which are delivered from independent suppliers directly to third-party contract manufacturers who produce and package the finished products based on our estimated anticipated needs. Our fragrance products are manufactured primarily in plants located in New Jersey and neighboring states. As is customary in our industry, we do not have long-term agreements with our contract manufacturers. Management believes it has good relationships with its manufacturers and there are alternative sources available should one or more of these manufacturers be unable to produce at competitive prices.
 5

To date, we have not had difficulty obtaining raw materials at competitive prices. We know of no reason to believe that this situation will change in the near future, but there can be no assurance that this will continue. The lead time for certain of our raw materials inventory (up to six months) requires us to maintain at least a three to six month supply of some items in order to ensure production schedules. These lead times are most applicable to glass and plastic component orders. Many of our unique designs require the creation of molds in addition to the normal production process. If a new mold is required, it may take approximately six to eight months to create the new mold. 
Marketing and Sales
Parlux maintains its own fragrance sales and marketing staff and sells directly to retailers, primarily national and regional department stores, who we believe will maintain the image of our owned and licensed products as prestige fragrances. Parlux products are currently sold in over 3,000 retail outlets in the United States and on a global basis throughout a network of international distributors. Selected Parlux products are also sold in our Perfumania stores, SOW consignment retail outlets and by QFG. For our licensed brands, we employ traditional vehicles such as magazine print advertising and cooperative advertising with our retailers, and we increasingly utilize social networking, mobile, and digital applications. 
For QFG, wholesale sales representatives maintain regular dialogue with customers to generate selling opportunities and to assist them in sourcing products at low prices. All sales personnel have access to current inventory information that is generally updated with each order, allowing immediate order confirmation to customers and ensuring that ordered products are in stock for prompt shipment. 
For SOW, the Company works with consignment retailers to develop in-store promotions employing signage, displays or unique packaging to merchandise and promote products in addition to developing ad campaigns for specific events as required by the retailers, e.g., mailers, inserts and national print advertising. The cornerstone of our marketing philosophy for our Perfumania stores is to develop customer awareness that the stores offer an extensive assortment of brand name and designer fragrances at discount prices.
Intellectual Property Rights
The Company’s portfolio of fragrance brands is of great importance to its business. Parlux holds the exclusive worldwide distribution rights for the following licenses: Kenneth Cole, Shawn Carter, professionally known as Jay-Z, Paris Hilton, Jessica Simpson, Rihanna, Marc Ecko, Vince Camuto, Donald Trump, Ivanka Trump and Jason Wu. Five Star owns the Lutece, Norell, Pavlova, Realm, Raffinee and Royal Secret brands, among others. It licenses designer and other fragrance brands, such as Tommy Bahama, Bijan, Gale Hayman, Michael Jordan, Pierre Cardin, Royal Copenhagen, Vicky Tiel, XOXO, Snookie and the Major League Baseball clubs, often acquiring exclusive worldwide distribution rights. Current expiration dates for these licenses (whereupon automatic or discretionary renewal periods may commence) range from September 30, 2017 to December 31, 2022, excluding the Gale Hayman license which expires on January 1, 2093. Many of our license agreements are subject to our obligation to make required minimum royalty payments, minimum advertising and promotional expenditures and/or, in some cases, meet minimum sales requirements. In addition to the trade name and service mark Perfumania, Perfumania operates one store under the trade name Perfumania Plus.
We primarily rely on trademark laws to protect our intellectual property rights. In addition to using registered trademarks covering licensed brands, we have a large proprietary portfolio of U.S. and foreign registered trademarks and applications. U.S. trademark ownership depends on use and remains effective as long as the trademark is used. Trademark registration provides certain additional protections. U.S. trademark registrations are generally renewable for as long as the trademark is used. Trademark ownership in foreign countries applying common law also depends on continued use, with registration providing certain additional protections. In the European Union and other foreign countries, ownership rights are based on registration. Terms of registrations in such countries range from seven to fifteen years and are generally renewable. We occasionally register the copyright to packaging materials, and we also rely on trade secret and other contractual restrictions to protect the commercial terms of our licenses. From time to time, we bring litigation against those who, in our opinion, infringe our proprietary rights, but there can be no assurance that either such efforts, or any contractual restrictions used, will be adequate or effective. Also, owners of other brands may, from time to time, allege that we have violated their intellectual property rights, which may lead to litigation and material legal expense.
Information Technology
We are committed to having information systems that enable us to obtain, analyze and act upon information on a timely basis and to maintain effective financial and operational controls.  
During the first quarter of fiscal 2016, we completed the roll-out of new technology and processes for the Perfumania retail business, focused on creating an outstanding experience for our customers, including new point of sale hardware and software, full omni-channel capability enabling Perfumania customers to interact with Perfumania any way they want - on-line

or in-stores, new customer relationship management system and loyalty program ("Perfumania Perks"), new merchandising and planning systems and additional back office systems improving functions such as sales audit, loss prevention, analytics and reporting.
Initiatives focused on ensuring the realization of the full benefits of these new capabilities are currently underway and will continue throughout fiscal 2017.
Competition
Competition is intense and varies among the markets in which the Company competes. As a retailer, the Company competes with a wide range of chains and large and small stores, as well as manufacturers, including some of the Company’s suppliers. In the wholesale business, the Company competes with many distributors. Generally, the basis of competition is brand recognition, quality and price. The Company believes that the most important reasons for its competitive success in the wholesale business include its established relationships with manufacturers and large customers, popular recognition of its proprietary and licensed brands, and its efficient, low-cost sourcing strategy and ability to deliver products to consumers at competitive prices. Perfumania’s retail competitors include department stores, regional and national retail chains, drug stores, cosmetic retailers, supermarkets, duty-free shops and other specialty online and brick and mortar retail stores. Some of its competitors sell fragrances at discount prices and some are part of large national or regional chains that have substantially greater resources and name recognition than Perfumania. Perfumania’s stores compete on the basis of selling price, promotions, customer service, merchandise variety, store location and ambiance. Internet fragrance sales are highly competitive and Perfumania.com competes on the basis of selling price, merchandise variety, ease of selection and cost of delivery. Some of the Company’s competitors may enjoy competitive advantages, including greater financial resources that can be devoted to competitive activities, such as sales and marketing, brand development and strategic acquisitions.
Employees
At January 28, 2017, the Company had 1,783 employees, of whom 178 were involved in warehousing, 1,282 were employed in Perfumania’s retail stores, 251 in marketing, sales and operations, and 72 in finance and administration. We use temporary warehouse personnel to assist with seasonal requirements, and temporary part-time retail employees are added shortly before the Thanksgiving holiday weekend. Some of our warehouse employees are represented by a union. The Company has never experienced a work stoppage, strike or other interruption in business as a result of a labor dispute.
Distribution
The Company utilizes independent national trucking companies, primarily UPS, to deliver merchandise to its stores and some of its wholesale customers. Other wholesale customers are responsible for their own shipping arrangements. Retail store deliveries are generally made weekly, with more frequent deliveries during the holiday season. Such deliveries permit the stores to minimize inventory storage space and increase the space available for display and sale of merchandise. Sales by Perfumania.com are shipped via UPS and are delivered within a few days of being ordered.
