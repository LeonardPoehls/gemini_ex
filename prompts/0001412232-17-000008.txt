Item 1. | Business

We are a leading global independent provider of product and service solutions to laboratory and production customers. We have significant market positions in Europe and North America. We also have operations in Asia-Pacific and other key emerging markets to support our multinational customers across the globe. We serve a critical role in connecting customer sites with laboratory product suppliers across multiple industries and geographies. We offer a broad portfolio of branded and private label laboratory products, a full range of value-added services and custom manufacturing capabilities to meet our customers’ needs. Services represent a growing but currently small portion of our overall net sales. We offer a wide selection of unique products and have developed an extensive global infrastructure including thousands of sales and service-focused professionals. We deliver value to our customers by improving the costs, efficiency and effectiveness of their research laboratories and production operations. We deliver value to our suppliers by providing them with cost-effective channel access to a global and diverse customer base.
Our portfolio includes chemicals, reagents, consumables, durable products and scientific equipment and instruments with a range of complexity and sophistication. We offer most of the leading branded products to the customer segments we serve. Our private label products enhance our branded product offerings by providing additional choice at varying price points to our customers. We complement our branded and private label product portfolio with value-added service offerings marketed under the VWRCATALYST® brand, including sourcing and procurement, logistics, chemical and equipment tracking and sample management. We continue to expand our service offerings to include more complex scientific research support services such as genotyping, bioreactor servicing, compound management, customized kit assembly, clinical trial support and single-use technology configuration. In addition, we offer custom manufacturing solutions, including buffers, reagents, active pharmaceutical ingredients, high purity ingredients, ultra-pure acids and other chemicals used in biopharmaceutical and industrial applications and production processes. We believe these growing value-added service offerings integrate us within our customers’ critical operational processes and further differentiate our value proposition from that of our competitors. We believe our range of offerings and capabilities enhances our ability to expand our addressable market and gain market share leading to incremental net sales and profits.
Business Segments
We report financial results on the basis of two segments organized by geographic region: Americas and EMEA-APAC. Our Americas segment is comprised of operations located principally in the United States and Canada as well as in Puerto Rico, Mexico and select countries in Central and South America, including Costa Rica, Brazil, Argentina and Chile, and includes 67 facilities located in 8 countries. The EMEA-APAC segment is comprised of our operations located principally in Europe as well as in certain Asia-Pacific countries, and includes 110 facilities located in 26 countries.
The following table presents the percentage of net sales from each of our reportable segments:

Products and Services
Branded and Private Label Laboratory Products
We provide value to our customers by offering a broad portfolio of branded and private label laboratory products, including custom manufacturing. Our portfolio of branded products gives our customers access to some of the most recognized brands in the world. We enhance our customers’ choice by offering a lower cost, private label alternative to branded products. Private label laboratory products represented approximately 19% of our 2016 net sales. During 2016, we processed nearly 18,000 customer orders per day with an average order size of over $700. 
We classify our branded and private label laboratory products as consumable or durable. Consumable products include chemicals, laboratory and production supplies and science education products. These products are essential to research and quality control laboratories and are generally used on a recurring basis. We offer an extensive selection of branded and private label consumable products. Our private label offering includes custom manufactured chemicals, including buffers, reagents, active pharmaceutical ingredients, high purity ingredients, ultra-pure acids and other chemicals used in biopharmaceutical and industrial applications and production processes. Consumable products represented approximately 73% of our 2016 net sales. We also offer durable products and scientific instruments with varying levels of complexity and sophistication. These products represented approximately 18% of our 2016 net sales.
Value-Added Services
We complement our branded and private label product portfolio with a number of customized value-added services, under the VWRCATALYST® brand. In addition to procurement, logistics, chemical and equipment tracking and glassware autoclaving, we offer complex scientific research support services such as DNA extraction, bioreactor servicing, compound management and customized kit assembly. This enables us to support a higher level of science on behalf of our customers, enabling them to focus on areas of research. Value-added services represented approximately 4% of our 2016 net sales.

History
The origins of our business date to 1852 in Sacramento, California when we initially sold glassware and laboratory supplies to the mining industry. We first became a publicly-owned company in 1986 after a spin-off from Univar Corporation. In 1999, we were acquired by Merck KGaA and soon combined with its European distribution operations to become a leader in the global laboratory products market under the name “VWR International Corporation.” In 2004, we were divested by Merck KGaA and acquired by Clayton, Dubilier & Rice, a private equity firm, in a leveraged transaction.
In 2007, we were acquired by Varietal, an entity owned by investment funds affiliated with Madison Dearborn Partners, certain co-investors and members of management. As a result of our 2014 IPO and subsequent secondary offerings of our stock, Varietal now owns 35% of our common stock.
Customers
Our customer base is diverse and stable. We provided solutions to about 105,000 customers in 2016, including a significant number of the companies on the Fortune 500 list, about 5,000 leading academic institutions and thousands of smaller businesses in multiple industries. We centrally manage and actively collaborate with our largest global customers and provide them with value-added services, optimize the efficiency of their research, production and procurement activities and support them with dedicated on-site professionals and technicians. In addition, we manage relationships with our regional customers on a local basis, with a focus on their particular customer segment-specific needs. We estimate that we shipped products to more than 250,000 unique customer sites in 2016.
We seek long-term, collaborative relationships with our customers. The substantial majority of our 50 largest customer relationships are governed by three to five year contracts that typically include pricing and volume incentives intended to earn the majority of their laboratory products and services business.
We are a significant provider of laboratory products, chemicals, safety equipment and life science supplies to a majority of the world’s 20 largest pharmaceutical companies. In 2016, our top 20 customers accounted for approximately 20% of our net sales, with no single customer representing more than 4% of our net sales. At December 31, 2016, our top ten customers have had relationships with us averaging nearly 11 years.
Suppliers
We distribute branded and private label products sourced from over 4,000 laboratory product suppliers located across the globe, including most of the leading developers and manufacturers of those products who sell through distributors. We seek strong relationships with our largest suppliers, most of which have partnered with us for more than 20 years. Our ten largest suppliers in 2016 accounted for 32% of our purchases, with no individual supplier accounting for more than 8%.
Our supplier relationships are based on contracts that vary in geographic scope, duration, product and service type, and some include exclusivity provisions. Those relationships may include distribution, sales and marketing support as well as servicing of instruments and equipment.
We manufacture a portion of our private label products, primarily laboratory and production chemicals, and source the remainder from third-parties, including our established branded suppliers. We utilize a disciplined process to ensure the high quality of our private label products. Private label products provide our customers with a value-focused alternative to branded products and generally provide us higher margins.

Sales and Marketing
We reach customers through a well-trained global sales force, comprehensive websites and targeted catalogs. Our sales force is comprised of over 3,700 sales and sales support professionals, including over 300 sales specialists in areas such as life science, chromatography, production, chemicals and furniture, selected for their in-depth industry and product knowledge. Our sales professionals include native speakers for each of the countries in which we operate, allowing them to have high impact interactions with our customers across the globe.
Our e-commerce platform plays a vital role in how we conduct business with our customers. Over half of the orders that we process originate from our e-commerce platform, including websites that feature our full product offering on a multi-language platform. Our websites utilize Google® search analytics and feature personalized search tools, customer specific web solutions and enhanced data on 2.6 million products that optimize our customers’ online purchasing experience and better integrate our customers’ processes with our own. Our websites are designed to integrate acquisitions, drive geographical expansion and serve segmented market needs with relative ease.
We also publish flyers, brochures, magazines and catalogs in about 20 languages distributed worldwide. Our general catalogs are supplemented by specialty catalogs and brochures for specific industries, scientific applications and product lines. For example, we have developed “all you need” catalogs for brewing, dairy, life science and genomics. In addition, we produce several serial publications that engage our customers with informative articles and a focused product offering, timed to release during prime purchasing seasons.
Distribution Network, Facilities and Infrastructure
Our global infrastructure consists of over 170 facilities to deliver a broad array of products to our customers within 24 to 48 hours. We have a unique pan-European platform, reaching customers throughout Europe with industry-leading efficiency and service levels. Our network includes over 4.7 million square feet of distribution space from strategically-located distribution centers, smaller regional service centers, “just-in-time” facilities and customer contact centers. Below is a summary of these facilities:

• | our distribution centers receive products from manufacturers, manage inventory and fill and ship customer orders;


• | our regional service centers are located near selected customer locations and are designed to supply a limited number of products to those customers that require a high level of service;


• | we also operate “just-in-time” facilities at or near customer sites to meet their needs promptly;


• | customer contact centers are responsible for order entry and service; and


• | our two service centers employ more than 1,000 associates who provide commercial and administrative support services to us and our customers and suppliers.

We also contract with third parties to ship products directly to our customers.
Our global headquarters is in Radnor, Pennsylvania, and our European headquarters is in Darmstadt, Germany. 
Technology
We have a highly automated ERP system that promotes standardization and simplicity. Our global web infrastructure provides seamless integration with our customers. These technology platforms support rapid development and deployment of enhancements so that we may quickly adapt to meet the technology needs of our customers and seamlessly integrate new acquisitions. We have made significant investments in our IT platform to implement a common ERP and e-commerce platform to enhance the customer experience. In 2016, over half of 
4

our orders were derived from our electronic platforms including EDI and e-commerce. We have more than 175,000 customer accounts on our website.
Our IT operating strategy is to act globally when possible and locally where necessary to strategically facilitate our business objectives and to develop a stable, growth oriented infrastructure and global informational system platform. Our IT infrastructure has evolved into a cohesive group of global computing platforms. This development has reduced costs while improving our overall quality and delivering more value.
Competition
We operate in a highly competitive environment with a diverse and fragmented base of competitors, many of whom focus on specific regions and market segments. Competitive factors in the customer segments we serve include service and delivery, breadth of product line, price, customer support, e-commerce capabilities and the ability to meet the special and local needs of our customers.
In our Americas laboratory products business, we compete primarily with Fisher Scientific. Most of our other competitors are laboratory equipment manufacturers that sell directly to their customers and smaller distributors that focus on specific geographies and product categories. In our services business, we compete with life science companies that offer laboratory management services such as Fisher Scientific, PerkinElmer and Agilent Technologies, local service providers and other service outsourcing companies.
In our EMEA-APAC laboratory products business, we have a unique Pan-European platform that provides us with an important competitive advantage. We principally compete with Fisher Scientific for certain global customers and with regional competitors. In our services business, we predominantly compete with small businesses operating on a regional basis.
We believe that our competitive strengths position us well in our customer segments and the geographies we serve. We leverage our scale, customer access, depth of product and service offerings, marketing strategies and sales force, financial profile and management team to deliver superior solutions to our customers and to provide extensive market channel access to our suppliers.
Employees
As of December 31, 2016, we had over 10,200 employees, including nearly 4,700 in North America, 4,100 in Europe, 1,200 in Asia-Pacific (including over 1,000 employees in our shared service centers) and over 200 in Central and South America. Of these employees, nearly 3,400 or 33% are in customer facing roles. As of December 31, 2016, about 4% of our employees in North America were represented by unions, and virtually all of our employees in Europe are represented by workers’ councils and/or unions. We believe our relations with our employees are good.
Trademarks and Tradenames
We believe the VWR tradename is well recognized in the global laboratory products market and by scientists and is therefore a valuable asset to us. We use a number of different registered and unregistered trademarks and service marks for our products and services, substantially all of which are owned by us. However, we have not registered all of our trademarks or service marks in each country in which we do business. Generally, registered trademarks have perpetual lives, provided that they are renewed on a timely basis and continue to be used properly as trademarks, subject only to the rights of third parties to seek cancellation of the marks.
Our business is not dependent to a material degree on patents, copyrights or trade secrets although we consider our catalogs, websites and proprietary software integral to our operations. Although we believe we have adequate policies and procedures in place to protect our intellectual property, we have not sought patent protection for our processes nor have we registered the copyrights in any of our catalogs, websites or proprietary software. Other 
5

than licenses to commercially available third party software, we have no licenses to intellectual property that are significant to our business.
Government Regulation
Some of the products we offer and our operations are subject to complex and stringent laws and regulations governing the production, storage, handling, transportation, import, export and distribution of chemicals, drugs and other similar products. Included among these laws are regulations are the operating and security standards of the United States Drug Enforcement Administration, the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau, the Food and Drug Administration, the Bureau of Industry and Security and various state boards of pharmacy as well as comparable state and foreign agencies. In addition, our operational activities must comply with the rules and regulations of the Department of Transportation, the Federal Aviation Administration and similar foreign agencies. We are also required to abide by the anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws of all countries in which we operate, including the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended (the “FCPA”). While we believe we are in compliance in all material respects with such laws and regulations, any non-compliance could result in substantial fines, penalties or assessments or otherwise restrict our ability to provide competitive distribution services and thereby have an adverse impact on our financial condition.
Environmental, Health and Safety Matters
We are subject to a broad range of foreign, federal, state and local environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, including those pertaining to air emissions, water discharges, the manufacturing, handling, disposal and transport of hazardous materials and solid waste, the investigation and remediation of contamination and otherwise relating to health and safety and the protection of the environment and natural resources. As our global operations have involved and continue to involve the manufacturing, handling, transport and distribution of materials that are, or could be, classified as toxic or hazardous, there is a risk of contamination and environmental damage inherent in our operations and the products we manufacture, handle, transport and distribute. Our environmental, health and safety liabilities and obligations may result in significant capital expenditures and other costs, which could negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. We may be fined or penalized by regulators for failing to comply with environmental, health and safety laws and regulations. In addition, contamination resulting from our current or past operations may trigger investigation or remediation obligations, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Based on current information, we believe that any costs we may incur relating to environmental, health and safety matters will not be material. We cannot be certain, however, that identification of presently unidentified environmental, health and safety conditions, new regulations, more vigorous enforcement by regulatory authorities or other unanticipated events will not arise in the future and give rise to additional environmental liabilities, business interruptions, compliance costs or penalties which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, environmental laws and regulations are constantly evolving, and it is not possible to predict accurately the effect they, or any new regulations or legislation, may have in future periods.
Insurance
We maintain commercial insurance programs with third parties in the areas of executive risk, commercial property, business interruption and casualty (including product liability). We also self-insure certain risks inherent in our business which, taken together with the deductible levels and exclusions contained within our third party programs, results in our recording of accruals for incurred claims. Our ultimate exposure may be mitigated by amounts we expect to recover from third parties associated with such claims.
