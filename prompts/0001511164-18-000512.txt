ITEM 1:
BUSINESS

Overview

The Company is in the business of selling video and audio capture devices initially targeted to law enforcement agencies. With over 30 years of marketing to law enforcement, the Companys CEO, Paul Feldman is able to leverage his extensive knowledge and base of contacts to produce sales. The Company has established a web site at www.forceprovideo.com whereby customers can view the Companys products and place orders. We believe that given recent current events between law enforcement agencies and the public, which has been widely reported by the media, there is a significant market opportunity for the Companys products. In the first quarter of fiscal 2016, the Company received multiple orders for the LE10 camera System. The LE10 is a small bodied, high definition (HD) camera which is half the size and half the price of most law enforcement cameras currently available. The LE10 and more recent addition the LE50 are rich with features that make them ideal for on-demand video and audio capture. The LE10 and LE50 do not require special software or expensive storage contracts. The video files can quickly be downloaded into a standard law enforcement case file and the micro SD cards are sealed in the provided static evidence bags and then securely stored in the department's evidence locker. The Companys Video LE10 and LE50 cameras are a rugged design which incorporates Ambarella (NASDAQ "AMBA") made chips that allow the cameras to record high definition video.
Product Development and Sales

Our on-body mini-camera was developed by Paul Feldman, our Chief Executive Officer, President and Director who has significant experience in the development and commercialization of security and surveillance related products. From 2001 through August 2009, Mr. Feldman served as President and a Director of Law Enforcement Associates, Inc., a manufacturer of surveillance products and audio intelligent devices which were sold to the U.S. military and law enforcement. Patent technologies previously developed by Mr. Feldman include U.S. Patent Number 7,631,601 Surveillance Projectile and U.S. Patent Number 2006/0283,345 Surveillance Projectile.

Our video and audio capture devices are compact, ergonomic, tamperproof and designed to capture HD video and/or audio on demand enabling our customers to capture content while engaged in a wide range of activity. We also sell accessories that enhance the functionality and versatility of our products, including mounts, such as the helmet, handlebar, roll bar and tripod mounts, as well as mounts that enable users to wear the camera on their bodies, such as the wrist housing, chest harness and head strap. Other accessories include spare batteries, charging accessories and memory drives. Our products are marketed primarily to law enforcement due to their unique need to capture important events in the course of their duties.

Competition

The market for on-body cameras is highly competitive. Further, we expect competition to increase in the future as existing competitors introduce new and more competitive offerings alongside their existing products, and as new market entrants introduce new products into our markets. We compete against established, well-known camera manufacturers such as Axon- Taser,WatchGuard and Provision. Many of our current competitors have substantial market share, diversified product lines, well- established supply and distribution systems, strong worldwide brand recognition and greater financial, marketing, research and development and other resources than we do.

In addition, many of our existing and potential competitors have substantial competitive advantages, such as:


 longer operating histories;
 
 the capacity to leverage their sales efforts and marketing expenditures across a broader portfolio of products;
 
 broader distribution and established relationships with channel partners;
 
 access to larger established customer bases;
 
 greater financial resources;
 
 large intellectual property portfolios; and
 
 the ability to bundle competitive offerings with other products and services.

Moreover, smartphones and tablets with photo and video functionality have significantly displaced traditional camera sales. It is possible that, in the future, the manufacturers of these devices, such as Apple Inc. and Samsung, may design them for use in a range of conditions, including challenging physical environments, or develop products similar to ours. In addition to competition or potential competition from large, established companies, new companies may emerge and offer competitive products. Further, we are aware that certain companies have developed cameras designed and labeled to appear similar to our products, which may confuse consumers or distract consumers from purchasing our products.

Increased competition may result in pricing pressures and reduced profit margins and may impede our ability to continue to increase the sales of our products or cause us to lose market share, any of which could substantially harm our business and results of operations

Seasonality

Our business, as well as the industry in which we operate, is not seasonal.

Intellectual Property

We currently have a patent pending on a new product 

Other than the aforementioned pending patent, we have no registered or patented intellectual property. Trademarks and trade names distinguish the various companies from each other. If customers are unable to distinguish our products from those of other companies, we could lose sales to our competitors. We do not have any registered trademarks and trade names, so we only have common law rights with respect to infractions or infringements on its products. Many subtleties exist in product descriptions, offering and names that can easily confuse customers. The name of our principal products may be found in numerous variations of the name and descriptions in various media and product labels. This presents a risk of losing potential customers looking for our products and buying someone elses because they cannot differentiate between them. 
Employees

As of the date of this report, we have three full time employees including Paul Feldman who is our Director, Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer. Mr. Feldman spends approximately sixty (60) hours per week on our business. We have one full time employees who provide clerical and administrative services and one full time sales person.

None of our employees are represented by a collective bargaining agreement, nor have we experienced any work stoppages. We maintain good relationships with our employees.
