Item 1. Business.

Our management originally founded Napro, Inc. (“Napro”), an Ohio corporation, in 1985 as an enterprise for launching new ventures and acquiring companies in various lines of business. In 1996, Napro formed a wholly owned Ohio subsidiary, Virtu Company (“Virtu”), to market proprietary products to the retail pet business under the OurPet’s® label. Napro then changed its name to OurPet’s Company effective March 19, 1998. On July 16, 1998, Manticus, Inc. (“Manticus”), a Colorado corporation, obtained all of the outstanding shares of OurPet’s/Napro in exchange for 8,000,000 shares of Manticus common stock. After the transaction, the former holders of OurPet’s/Napro shares owned approximately 89% of Manticus’ shares. Effective August 10, 1998, OurPet’s/Napro was merged into Manticus and ceased to exist. Prior to this merger, no affiliation or other relationship existed between Manticus and us or our shareholders. Operations for the newly merged entity were, and continue to be, conducted in Ohio. Manticus proceeded to become licensed in the State of Ohio as a foreign corporation, known as OurPet’s Company. Effective October 12, 1998, Manticus’ Articles of Incorporation were amended in the State of Colorado to reflect its new name as OurPet’s Company. After the merger, management of the former OurPet’s/Napro assumed management of the surviving company.
 
In January 2006, OurPet’s purchased substantially all the assets of PetZone, a competitor that manufactured and distributed cat, dog and bird feeders, storage bins, and cat and dog toys to the pet specialty, mass retailers and grocery chains. In July 2010, OurPet’s purchased substantially all the assets of Cosmic Pet Products, a leading provider of catnip products, cat toys, and other cat products such as scratchers and cat treats. In April 2015, OurPet’s purchased seven bowl/feeder products, including the molds, from Molor Products. In December 2016, the Company formed a wholly owned subsidiary named Series OP to self-insure against certain business losses. Also in December 2016 the Company formed another wholly owned subsidiary, OurPet’s DISC, Inc. (“DISC”), an Ohio corporation, which has elected to be a Domestic International Sales Corporation under U.S. tax law. A commission is paid by OurPet’s to DISC for sales of manufactured products of at least 51% U.S. content being sold to countries outside the U.S.

Packaged Facts, a leading publisher in the United Sates of market studies on consumer products, recently published its report of the “U.S. Pet Market Outlook, 2016-2017.” It estimates the overall pet products and services market totaled $77.07 billion in 2015. The report expects the industry to reach about $96 billion by the end of 2020. The pet supplies segment (OurPet’s segment) was the third-largest segment in 2015 with $15.18 billion in revenue. This segment showed an increase of 4.7% from the previous year. U.S. retail channel sales of pet products, which includes pet food and pet supplies, were estimated at $45.3 billion in 2015, up 3.4% over 2014 (U.S. Pet Market Outlook, 2016-2017).

Packaged Facts cites higher income households as crucial to the success of the pet industry. It also identifies the human/animal bond and humanization of pets as key drivers. As it explains in its outlook study that, “[h]umanization of pets is a natural expression of the ‘pets as family’ trend, whereby pet owners treat their pets like children and are highly receptive to products similar to the ones they use for themselves” (U.S. Pet Market Outlook, 2016-2017).
 
The pet industry has proven to be generally recession resistant with annual growth rates favorable to the overall economy over a business cycle.
 
We sell our products in the following market segments:
 
Mass Retailers—e.g., Wal-Mart
 Pet Superstores—e.g., PetsMart, Petco 
 Regional Pet Chains—e.g., Pet Supplies Plus
 Pet Catalogues—e.g., Drs. Foster & Smith 
 Internet—e.g., Amazon.com
 Clubs—e.g., Costco 
 Military Exchange Chains—e.g., AAFES
 Grocery Chains—e.g., Kroger, Publix 
 Pet Food Manufacturers—e.g., Nestle Purina
 Pet Distributors—e.g., Animal Supply 
 International Customers—e.g., Pet’s at Home
 
The companies listed above are intended to serve as examples only. As a standard industry practice, price lists are provided to distributors, who in turn place products with retailers. Larger retailers with a national presence will generally order product directly from us pursuant to the price list and subject to negotiated additional terms, if any. With the exception of a written price list, many of the arrangements with retailers or distributors are verbal. As such, written contracts often do not exist. Customers submit their own standard purchase orders based on our current price list. Even the larger retailers, which might have written contracts with us, are under no obligation to purchase specific product from us. While all of the above companies may currently buy product from OurPet’s, none of these customers are under any contractual obligation to purchase a specific volume of product or to continue making any purchases in the future. We currently have approximately 200 customers to whom we sell products, with the total number and specific customers changing from time to time. With the exception of Wal-Mart, none of our customers account for 10.0% or more of our sales. For the year ended December 31, 2016, $7,095,139 (26.2%) of our revenue was derived from Wal-Mart. For more information, see our Consolidated Financial Statements, notes, and tables included in this Form 10-K.
 
We currently market products, such as: dog, cat, and bird feeders; dog and cat toys; cat and dog waste management products; catnip products; and natural, nutritional pet supplements and topical products. We conduct our marketing and sales activities through 14 employees and 20 independent sales representatives’ organizations. Domestic independent sales representatives are paid commissions, which range from 3% to 10% of net sales to customers.
 
Our marketing strategies include, among others: trade shows; customer visits; social media; telemarketing; direct mail; As Seen on TV programs, trade journal advertising; product sampling programs; and customer support programs, such as advertising and promotional allowances.
 
We are one of many companies in the accessory and consumable pet products market with no measurable percentage of that market. Our competition in the healthy feeding systems, interactive toys, and healthy consumable products markets are both domestic and foreign companies, many of whom manufacture their products in low cost areas such as India, East Asia, Southeast Asia, and Mexico.
 
Most of our products are proprietary and we have been granted or assigned 93 United States and international patents and have 50 United States and international patents pending for cat and dog toys, dog feeders, and waste management products. We registered trademarks for “The OurPet’s Company” as our corporate identity, and “OurPets” as our pet specialty brand as well as Pet Zone® for the Food, Drug and Mass retail channel. To protect our trade names we obtained 61 trademark registrations and applied for 22 trademark registrations, which are still pending.

As of January 27, 2017, we had a total of 53 employees, 51 of which are full time employees. These employees consist of: 4 officers; 13 employees (not including 1 officer) in sales and marketing; 1 employee in business & product development; 4 employees (not including 2 officers) in finance and administration; 6 employees (not including 1 officer) in operations; and 25 employees (2 of them part time) in production, warehousing and shipping, at our Fairport Harbor, Ohio and Mentor, Ohio facilities. Most of our manufacturing is subcontracted to outside vendors; however, we do perform some light manufacturing at our Mentor, Ohio facility for the production of catnip and tuna consumable products. None of our employees are subject to a collective bargaining agreement. We have not experienced any work stoppages and believe we have good relations with our employees.
 
In January 2014, the Company contracted with a Professional Employer Organization (PEO) which co-employs the company’s employees.  The PEO and the Company share and allocate responsibilities and liabilities.  The PEO assumes much of the responsibility and liability for the business of employment such as risk management, human resources (HR) management, benefits administration, workers compensation, payroll and payroll tax compliance.  The Company retains the responsibility for hiring, firing and managing its employees and operations.   The purpose of the Company’s contracting with a PEO was to strengthen the Company’s HR functions and provide its employees with a wider range of benefits at more affordable prices.  The Company changed PEO providers in January of 2016 primarily for the purpose of obtaining better benefits at lower costs.
 
We conduct our own research and development activities and also use outside sources to perform specific projects such as engineering drawings and prototype models. Research and development costs are charged to expenses as incurred, and totaled $223,025 for the year ended December 31, 2016 and $308,202 for the year ended December 31, 2015.
