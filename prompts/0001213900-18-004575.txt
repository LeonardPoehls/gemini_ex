Item 1. Business 
General 
 
Coates International, Ltd. (“we” or the “Company”) has been developing over a period of more than 20 years the patented Coates Spherical Rotary Valve® (“CSRV®”) system technology which is adaptable for use in piston-driven internal combustion engines of many types. Independent testing of various engines in which we incorporated our CSRV® system technology (“CSRV® Engines”) confirmed meaningful fuel savings when compared with internal combustion engines based on the conventional “poppet valve” assembly prevalent in most internal combustion engines throughout the world. In addition, our CSRV® Engines produced only ultra-low levels of harmful emissions while in operation. Engines operating on the CSRV® system technology can be powered by a wide selection of fuels. We believe that these three major advantages of the CSRV® system technology constitute the first revolutionary technological advancement of the internal combustion engine suitable for large scale production since its introduction more than one hundred years ago. 
 
The CSRV® system is designed to replace the intake and exhaust conventional “poppet valves” currently used in almost all piston-driven stationary, automotive, motorcycle, and marine engines. Unlike conventional valves which protrude into the engine combustion chamber, the Coates® rotary valve system utilizes spherical valves that rotate in a cavity formed between a two-piece cylinder head. The Coates rotary valve system uses approximately 1/10th of the moving parts of conventional poppet valve assemblies. As a result of these design improvements, management believes that the engines incorporating the Coates rotary valve system (Coates Engines®) will last significantly longer and will require less lubrication over the life of the engine, as compared to conventional engines. In addition, Coates rotary valves can be designed with a larger opening into the engine cylinder than conventional valves so that more fuel and air can be inducted into and expelled from the cylinder in a shorter period of time. Larger valve openings permit higher revolutions-per-minute (RPM’s) and permit higher compression ratios with lower combustion chamber temperatures, allowing the Coates Engine® to produce more power than equivalent conventional engines. The CSRV® engine is a highly thermal-efficient power unit.
 
We have been granted an exclusive license to this technology from our founder, George J. Coates and his son, Gregory G. Coates (the “Coates License Agreement”), in the Territory defined to include North America, Central America and South America (the “Americas”).
 
Since inception, the bulk of our development costs and related operational costs have been funded through cash generated from the sales of our common stock, issuances of promissory notes and convertible promissory notes, capital contributions, licensing fees for our CSRV® system technology, revenue from the performance of contractual research and development activities involving the CSRV® system technology, sales of a small number of natural gas powered CSRV® industrial electric power generator sets (“Gen Sets”) and a gain on the sale of the land and building that serves as our principal operating facility. During the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, we did not have any sales and we had revenues from research and development of $19,200 and $29,200, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, we incurred net losses of ($8,386,000) and ($8,356,000), respectively. The accumulated net losses from inception of the Company through December 31, 2017, amounted to approximately ($73,713,000). We may continue to be unprofitable until the CSRV® Engine is successfully introduced into the marketplace, or we receive substantial licensing revenues. These accumulated losses were substantially related to research and development of our intellectual property, patent filing and maintenance costs, costs incurred related to efforts to raise additional working capital and general and administrative expenses in connection with our operations. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we raised $955,000 of new working capital from issuances of convertible promissory notes, issuances of promissory notes to related parties, sales of registered shares of common stock under equity purchase agreements and private sales of common stock and common stock warrants.

Background
 
Coates Spherical Rotary Valve® System Technology
 
The internal combustion engine has been in use for more than 100 years and is the most widely used engine in the world. Industry sources indicate that there are more than 120 million new combustion engines built in the world every year and that 40 million engines are rebuilt annually. In the late 1960’s and 1970’s, most vehicle combustion engines in the United States were running at a compression ratio of 12 to 1 which resulted in an engine thermal efficiency of approximately 35 percent. The rest of the engine’s power is lost in friction, pumping and heat loss. It was learned that lead additives in fuel created unacceptable health risks, therefore the lead was removed. The use of unleaded gasoline created a number of technical problems, principally related to overheating of the engine compression chamber, causing pre-ignition and resulting in damage to the engine. The problem was largely solved by lowering engine compression ratios, thereby lowering thermal efficiency from approximately 35% to approximately 22%. This loss of efficiency reduces gas mileage and engine performance. Efficiency can be improved by increasing “volumetric efficiency” at maximum RPM’s, but conventional poppet valves tend to “float” or bounce at higher RPM’s and are consequently unable to deliver adequate air to the cylinder. In an attempt to solve this problem, engine manufacturers increased the number of poppet valves per cylinder, but this approach created other problems that caused unburned fuel to escape through the exhaust valve stems leading to a loss of power, lower gas mileage, and increased pollutants. However, variable valve timing can partially solve these additional problems, but that solution involves additional moving parts that eventually degrade and wear out. Also, variable valve timing on quick deceleration can cause piston and valve contact with resultant serious damage to the engine. Furthermore, conventional valves with solid “valve lifters” as opposed to hydraulic valve lifters must have clearances readjusted periodically. Poppet valves are the most troublesome part of the internal combustion engine. The basic inefficiencies of the conventional poppet valve design result in engine inefficiency and decreases in engine life, thermal efficiency, fuel efficiency, engine power output and increased pollution.
 
Conventional poppet valves also have significant environmental deficiencies. Conventional exhaust valve stems are lubricated with engine oil which burns off in the combustion chamber and is expelled through the exhaust directly into the atmosphere. Intake valves are also lubricated with engine oil, which is washed off and forced into the combustion chamber with the air and fuel mixture. This slows combustion, produces further emissions and eventually clogs the catalytic converter.
 
Management believes that the patented CSRV® system solves or significantly mitigates these problems. Coates rotary valves® are vented and charged on the opposite side of each valve sphere and rotate away from the combustion chamber, reducing combustion chamber constant temperature and allowing higher compression ratios that make the engine significantly more efficient and powerful.
 
We have successfully adapted our technology to industrial engines to power electric generators and intend to begin to manufacture and market engines, once we raise sufficient working capital, utilizing our proprietary designs operating on a multitude of fuels such as LNG, CNG, propane, flare-off gas and hydrogen.
 
Hydrogen Reactor Technology Owned by George J. Coates
 
George J. Coates has developed a hydrogen reactor which rearranges H2O water molecules into HOH molecules also known as Hydroxy-Gas. Hydroxy-Gas has a different molecular structure than hydrogen gas which will power the Hydrogen Gen Sets. It consists of two hydrogen atoms. The Hydroxy-Gas produced by the hydrogen reactor can then be harvested for use as a type of fuel. While Mr. Coates intends to continue with development of this technology to enable the harvested Hydroxy-Gas to be utilized as the fuel source to power our patented CSRV® Engines, development is being intentionally postponed in order to focus on developing Hydrogen Gen Sets. The next phase of this research and development will focus on powering larger, industrial engines. If successful, this application will only require a ready supply of water and would be suitable for stationary engines and generators. Conventional internal combustion engines employing poppet valve assemblies require lubrication and would experience excessive heat and friction if powered with Hydroxy-Gas. This, in turn, would cause the engines to burn out in a rather short period of time. The materials and components of the CSRV® Engines do not require such lubrication and because of their design, are able to operate relatively trouble-free on Hydroxy-Gas as the engine fuel. There can be no assurance that this technology can be developed successfully, or that if developed, it will be feasible to penetrate the internal combustion engine market with this technology.
 
We previously agreed to collaborate on the development of this technology with WTF Asia International Ltd. (“WTF Asia”), a Hong Kong-based entity to enable it to be applied to large industrial Gen Sets. We have determined that it is no longer feasible to work with WTF Asia due to the owner’s health and concerns with the status of WTF Asia’s technology. The Company intends to independently pursue further development of this technology.
 
We anticipate that application for patent protection of this technology will be filed upon completion of the research and development. Although at this time no arrangements have been made between us and George J. Coates, owner of the technology, regarding licensing of the hydrogen reactor, Mr. Coates has provided his commitment to license this technology to us once the related patent protection is in place. Accordingly, we do not currently have any rights to manufacture, use, sell and distribute the hydrogen reactor technology, should it become commercially feasible to manufacture and distribute products powered by the Hydroxy-Gas fuel. We have been responsible for all costs incurred to date related to the development of this technology.

Markets 
 
The design of the CSRV® system technology provides us with the flexibility to retrofit our existing internal combustion engines of all sizes and applications to appeal to a number of different geographic and product markets. In addition, the CSRV® system technology has been designed to operate effectively on a wide range of alternative fuels. Accordingly, there are no technical barriers that need to be overcome in order to strategically target economically feasible markets for products powered by internal combustion engines including, but not limited to the following: engines for electric power generators for various applications ranging from home use to the largest industrial complexes to augmented “grid” installations; engines to power motorcycles, automobiles, light trucks, heavy trucks, machinery, railroads, marine engines, military equipment, light aircraft, helicopters, lawn mowers, snowmobiles and jet skis, etc. 
 
According to the most recent available data in a table published by the Federal Highway Administration of the U.S. Department of Transportation titled “Highway Statistics 2016,” there were total U.S. vehicle registrations for the fifty states as follows:
 

Automobiles | | Buses | | Trucks | Motorcycles | Total | 
------------+-------------+-------+---------+--------+-------------+-------+----------
 | 112,961,266 | | 976,161 | | 146,182,276 | | 8.679.380 | 268,799,083

Strategy
 
Our long-term objective is to become a leader throughout the Americas in the design, manufacture, licensing to third party manufacturers and sales and distribution of our CSRV® internal combustion engines for a wide variety of uses. Our primary targeted market is the industrial electric power generator market. We have adapted the CSRV® system technology to manufacture our 14.0 liter inline, 6-cylinder, 855 cubic inch engine industrial generator fueled by natural gas (“Natural Gas Gen Sets”), one of many types of Natural Gas Gen Sets. In parallel to penetrating the commercial/industrial generators market, we intend to adapt the CSRV® system technology to be used in other markets, in which internal combustion engines are used, such as motor vehicles, motorcycles, trucks, ships, trains, military equipment, light aircraft, helicopters and others.
Operational Plan
 
Manufacturing, Sales and Distribution
 
We have completed development of the CSRV® system technology-based Natural Gas Gen Sets and are prepared to commence the production phase of our operations, provided we raise sufficient new working capital.


We may also pursue other opportunities to enter into licensing arrangements with third party manufacturers with existing industry experience and manufacturing capacity.
 
We intend to take advantage of the fact that essentially all the components of the CSRV® generator engine may be readily sourced and acquired from subcontractors, and, accordingly, expect to manufacture the engine generator by developing assembly lines within owned manufacturing facilities. We intend to initially commence production of Gen Sets on a small scale. This will enable us to prove our concept for the CSRV® system technology and we expect this will dovetail with the existing substantial demand in the marketplace. We plan to address this demand by establishing large scale manufacturing operations in the United States. Transitioning to large scale manufacturing is expected to require a substantial increase in our work force and substantial capital expenditures. 
 
Our ability to establish such manufacturing operations, recruit plant workers, finance initial manufacturing inventories and fund capital expenditures is highly dependent on our ability to successfully raise substantial new working capital in an amount and at a pace which matches our business plans. Potential sources of such new working capital include sales of our equity and/or debt securities through private placement, pursuing and entering into additional sublicensing agreements with OEM’s and/or distributors and positive working capital generated from sales of our CSRV® products once we raise sufficient new working capital and commence production. Although we have been successful in raising sufficient working capital to continue our ongoing operations, we have encountered very challenging credit and equity investment markets and have not been able to raise sufficient new working capital to enable us to commence production of our CSRV® products. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in raising adequate new working capital or even any new working capital to carry out our business plans.

Sublicensing
 
In February 2015, we granted a non-exclusive distribution sublicense to Renown Power Development, Ltd., a China-based sales and distribution company (“Renown”) covering the territory defined as the Western Hemisphere. Under this sublicense, Renown will be permitted to sell, lease and distribute CSRV® products. We received an initial non-refundable deposit of $500,000 to date. In addition, after Renown receives an aggregate of $10,000,000, it is required to pay us 25% of all funds it receives from any and all sources until it fully pays the contractual licensing fee. Renown has not made any payments towards this license during the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016. Until Coates Power can begin production of CSRV® products for Renown, we will not receive any further monies from our sublicense with Renown.
 
Coates Power has agreed to initially source its production parts and components from us. In February 2015, we received cash with an order from Coates Power for approximately $131,000 of production parts and components, at cost, in connection with its plans to manufacture two initial Gen Sets. In June 2015, by mutual consent of the parties, it was agreed that we would assemble two completed Gen Sets for shipment to Coates Power in China in lieu of shipping the parts and components. This amount is included in Deposits in the accompanying balance sheet at December 31, 2017.
 
Material Agreements
 
License Agreement – George J. Coates and Gregory G. Coates
 
We hold a license from George J. Coates and Gregory G. Coates which provides us with the right to use, manufacture, distribute, lease and sublicense the patented CSRV® system technology (the “Coates License Agreement”) in the territory defined as the Western Hemisphere. Under the Coates License Agreement, we were granted an exclusive, perpetual, royalty-free, fully paid-up license to the intellectual property that specifically relates to an internal combustion engine that incorporates the CSRV® Engine and that is currently owned or controlled by them (the “CSRV® Intellectual Property”), plus any CSRV® Intellectual Property that is developed by them during their employment with us. In the event of insolvency or bankruptcy of the Company, the licensed rights would terminate and revert back to George J. Coates and Gregory G. Coates.
Non-Exclusive Distribution Sublicense Agreement with Renown Power Development, Ltd.
 
This material sublicense agreement, which was consummated in February 2015, is discussed in detail above under the section titled “Sublicensing.”
 
Sublicense Agreement with Almont Energy, Inc. for the Territory of Canada
 
In 2010, Almont Energy Inc. (“Almont”), a privately held, independent third-party entity based in Alberta, Canada became the assignee of a sublicense which covers the use of the CSRV® system technology in the territory of Canada in the oil and gas industry (the “Canadian License”). This sublicense is currently inactive because the parties have not fulfilled their obligations thereunder due to our delay in starting up production and delivery of CSRV® products to Almont. The parties mutually agreed to consider the basis on which the license could be reactivated at such time that we are successful in starting up manufacturing operations.

Competition
 
Management believes that the Coates Engine® generators which are based on the CSRV® system technology will provide substantially enhanced efficiencies in power generation and longevity. We believe that the Coates Engines® will outperform other comparable natural gas-fueled electric generator engines currently utilized in the energy conversion market.
 
Notwithstanding our perceived competitive advantages, the power generation market is a highly competitive industry currently occupied by extremely large companies such as Caterpillar, Inc., which owns MAK, Perkins and FG Wilson, Detroit Diesel Corporation, AB Volvo, Cummins and Marathon, among others. These companies have far greater financial and other resources than we do and already occupy segments of the power generation market. In order to successfully penetrate this industry, the Coates Engines® will have to produce the performance and durability results anticipated by management and sell at a price or prices that will enable it to effectively compete and gain entrance into this market.
 
Parts and Supplies
 
To date, management has utilized the services of various vendors and suppliers available throughout the United States to provide all of the parts necessary to produce the Coates Engines®. We intend to continue to purchase all of our raw materials and parts, manufactured to our specifications, from a wide assortment of suppliers. We have signed a letter of intent with Marathon Electric Manufacturing Corp. for the supply of generators and components. We also entered into an agreement with Cummins Power Systems (a business owned by Cummins Inc.) to supply industrial engine blocks and components to us for our manufacturing activities. We intend to initially commence the assembly of the Coates Engines® at our existing New Jersey facility and to subsequently acquire additional facilities to increase our manufacturing capacity, as needed.
Licenses and Patents
 
The Coates License Agreement grants us an exclusive, perpetual, royalty-free, fully paid-up license in the territory of North, Central and South America, to use all intellectual property rights that are currently owned or controlled by the licensors that directly relate to an internal combustion engine that includes the CSRV® system technology. The license also covers any new or improved technology and related intellectual property rights that are directly related to the CSRV® Engine system technology developed by the licensors during their employment with us.
 
Included in the license are intellectual property rights for 17 patents registered in the United States; certain patents registered in Canada, Mexico, in countries in Central and South America relating to the CSRV® system technology; and one U.S. patent application filed by Mr. George J. Coates. These patents are owned by George J. Coates and Gregory G. Coates. Under our license agreement, we are obligated to pay for all costs relating to the ongoing maintenance of the patents.

We rely upon patents, trade secrets, know-how and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position. We can provide no assurance that we can successfully limit unauthorized or wrongful disclosures of trade secrets or otherwise confidential information. In addition, to the extent we rely on trade secrets and know-how to maintain our competitive technological position, there can be no assurance that others might not independently develop the same, similar or superior techniques.
 
We have also granted sublicenses to Renown Power Development, Ltd. and Almont Energy, Inc. as discussed in more detail under the section titled “Plan of Operations.” The sublicense with Almont is currently in an inactive status.
 
Environmental Regulatory Compliance
 
All of our engines, including the Coates Engine®, are subject to extensive environmental laws, rules and regulations that impose standards for emissions and noise. Initially, compliance with the emissions standards promulgated by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”), as well as those imposed by the State of New Jersey and other jurisdictions where we expect our engines will be used, will have to be achieved in order to successfully market the Coates Engine®. When selling individual engines, we are not subject to the governmental standards as set forth in 40CFR (Code of Federal Regulations) 1048, which regulates environmental standards for natural gas-powered industrial engines. In this case, the purchaser or sublicensee becomes responsible for complying with applicable governmental standards in its territory. We believe that our natural gas-powered engine/generators comply with governmental standards as set forth in 40CFR (Code of Federal Regulations) 1048, that regulates environmental standards for natural gas-powered industrial engines. Our ability to comply with applicable and future emissions standards is necessary for us to enter and continue to operate in the power generation and other markets. Failure to comply with these standards could result in a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.
Employees
 
We currently have four (4) employees, including George J. Coates and his son Gregory G. Coates, who perform management, assembly and research and development functions. None of our employees are represented by a labor union or are a party to a collective bargaining agreement. We believe that we have good relations with our employees.
