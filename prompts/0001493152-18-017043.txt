ITEM 1. BUSINESS. 
Corporate History and Structure
 
The Company was incorporated on October 16, 2008 in the State of Nevada as “Oreon Rental Corporation”. At the time of its incorporation, the management of the Company intended to operate electronics rental stores in Ternopil and other similar cities throughout Ukraine. However, at the time of its incorporation and its initial public offering of common stock in October 2008, the Company did not own any such stores, nor did it have any ongoing business operations. The Company underwent a change in management in January 2010. Following the change in management, the Company decided not to proceed with its original plan of operations and to shift its business focus to that of an independent oil and gas company engaged in the acquisition, drilling and production of oil and natural gas properties and prospects. During 2014, the Company wound down its oil and natural gas operations and decided to complete a reverse recapitalization with Avant Diagnostics, Inc., a Nevada Corporation established in 2009.
Acquisition of Avant Diagnostics, Inc.
 
Effective December 29, 2014, the Company completed a reverse recapitalization, as agreed in the definitive Agreement and Plan of Reorganization, of 100% of the outstanding equity interests of American Liberty Petroleum Corp. (“ALP”). Avant stockholders received 74,354,139 shares of common stock for a 93% equity interest in ALP. Such share exchange was calculated based on a one-for-one conversion ratio after a 1 for 17 reverse stock split of ALP which was subsequently effected in March 2015. The split affected the ALP common stock and not the Avant common stock. All references in the accompanying consolidated financial statements to the number of shares, options and other common stock equivalents, price per share and weighted-average number of shares outstanding of common stock have been adjusted to retroactively reflect the effect of the reverse stock split. Per the terms of the Agreement and Plan of Reorganization, ALP was delivered with zero assets and $70,000 in liabilities at time of closing. Following the reverse merger, we changed the name of ALP to “Avant Diagnostics, Inc.” The transaction was regarded as a reverse recapitalization whereby Avant was considered to be the accounting acquirer as it retained control of ALP after the exchange. Although ALP is the legal parent company, the share exchange was treated as a recapitalization of ALP. Avant is the continuing entity for financial reporting purposes. Accordingly, the assets and liabilities and the historical operations reflected in the financial statements are those of Avant for all periods presented.

As of September 30, 2017, there remained a total of 3,510,000 shares of common stock that still had not been converted by Avant stockholders as part of the reverse recapitalization. The Agreement and Plan of Reorganization does not provide for cash in lieu of exchange of shares and provides that upon the merger, the stockholders acquired their rights in ALP shares and all outstanding shares of Avant were deemed to be cancelled. There is no timeframe as to when the stockholders must convert their shares and, as of the date of this report, the shares have not been issued.
 
Since the end of the fiscal year ended September 30, 2017 and through the date of this report, we have focused on executing our business plan by acquiring proprietary diagnostic technology in the areas of oncology and neurology, as well as the addition of a revenue producing CLIA/CAP laboratory. We succeeded in executing on these objectives by the purchase of Amarantus Diagnostics, Inc. (“ADI”) and the purchase of the business assets and certain liabilities of Theranostics Health, Inc. (“THI”). We intend on executing unique commercialization strategies for each of our proprietary diagnostic tests.

Recent Developments
 
During the period subsequent to September 30, 2017 through the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018, management has engaged in cost cutting measures primarily in the area of THI corporate overhead. These measures have resulted in bringing operating costs in line with current sales and trying to improve revenue from the new and existing THI pharma services, heading into in the fourth quarter of 2017 – traditionally the fourth quarter of the calendar year is THI’s best performing quarter.

Marketing and Pricing
 
The Company derives its revenue from the performance under research and development contracts. These contracts require the Company to provide services directed towards specific objectives and include developmental milestones and deliverables. Up-front payments are recorded as deferred revenue and recognized when milestones are achieved. The Company may be reimbursed for certain costs incurred in preforming the specific research and development activities and records the reimbursement as revenues.
Market Opportunity
 
According to a study conducted by Quest Diagnostics, the largest clinical testing laboratory in the U.S., the laboratory testing market in the United States is approximately $50 billion market that is 60% controlled by testing performed by hospital-based laboratories. The remaining portion of this market is divided between independent clinical laboratories (35%) and physician office laboratories (POLs) that perform 5% of overall testing. Within the independent clinical laboratory segment, Quest Diagnostics and LabCorp are the two largest national reference labs and control approximately $12.5 billion of this $17.5 billion market segment. The remaining $5 billion is controlled by other national laboratories and smaller independent regional laboratories. Within this $50 billion market, most of the testing that is performed is for routine lab tests and anatomic pathology tests and services. However, recently there has been a dramatic increase in gene-based and esoteric testing. Esoteric tests include procedures in the areas of molecular diagnostics, protein chemistry, cellular immunology, and advanced microbiology. Commonly ordered esoteric tests include viral and bacterial detection tests, drug therapy monitoring tests, autoimmune panels, and complex cancer evaluations.
 
The growth of these specialized tests has been made possible through new molecular diagnostic technologies that make it possible to detect diseases earlier, utilize genetic testing for disease predisposition, and advance the use of personalized medicine, such as the tailoring of cancer therapies to those individuals most likely to respond. Esoteric tests typically require highly-skilled technical personnel and generally require more sophisticated technology, equipment or materials. As a result, esoteric tests are generally reimbursed at higher levels than routine tests. This increase in specialized testing is evidenced by the shift in Quest Diagnostics’ esoteric testing revenues from less than 10% of total revenues to their current level of 20% over the past 9 years. In the case of LabCorp, the second largest clinical testing laboratory in the country, in 2009 esoteric testing accounted for 36% of their annual consolidated revenue, which they expect to grow to 40% within three to five years. In addition to Quest Diagnostics and LabCorp, there are approximately 60 commercial laboratories that control the independent clinical laboratory market segment in the United States. There are also approximately 300 genetic testing laboratories in the U.S., with 80% of them affiliated with academic institutions. As a result of these new trends, molecular diagnostic testing that supports personalized medicine is now the fastest growing segment within the overall laboratory testing market.

In addition to the laboratory testing market, there is another market that is comprised of diagnostic instrumentation and test kits that are marketed for the purpose of performing diagnostic testing on human samples, which normally uses blood, urine, or other body fluid specimens. This market is referred to as the in vitro diagnostic (IVD) market and literally means “within the glass”, as in a test tube. A test that is performed in vitro is one that is done in glass or plastic vessels in the laboratory as opposed to in vivo, which is performed in a living organism. This combination of instrumentation and test kits is generally sold to reference laboratories, hospital clinical laboratories, state and national health testing facilities, and other laboratories that in turn perform the laboratory tests and provide results to physicians and their patients. According to a report published by PricewaterhouseCoopers titled “Diagnostics 2009”, the worldwide IVD market was $37 billion in 2007 and is expected to grow by 5% per annum to $50 billion in 2012. According to market research by Kalorama Information, the U.S. IVD market is the single largest diagnostics market in the world and represents 43% of the global IVD market. The largest IVD companies in the world are Roche, Abbott, Siemens, Johnson & Johnson (Ortho), Beckman Coulter, bioMérieux, Inverness Medical, Bio-Rad, Sysmex, and Becton Dickenson. All of these 10 companies have IVD sales exceeding $1 billion and collectively they represent approximately 85% of the total worldwide IVD market. The fastest growing segment within the IVD market is molecular diagnostics, which is expected to grow by 14% per annum and reach $5 billion in 2012. In the context of this PricewaterhouseCoopers market report, molecular diagnostics includes only those tests that analyze the DNA or RNA of an organism. However, molecular diagnostics is more often widely defined to include tests that analyze other types of molecules as well. In their report, PricewaterhouseCoopers goes on to state that besides the dramatic increase in molecular diagnostics, some of the biggest changes within the diagnostics industry will be the increased use of:
 

● | Early diagnostics: Diagnostic products permitting the detection of a disease at very early stages of its development thus giving more treatment options (e.g. early ovarian and lung cancer detection allowing surgery); 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Prognostics: Diagnostics that provide a prediction or estimate the risk of developing a particular condition based on phenotypic (e.g. transcriptomic, proteomic or metabolomic) parameters; or genomic (e.g. hereditary or gene based) characteristics; 
● | Companion diagnostics: Diagnostic products to evaluate an individual patient’s likelihood of benefiting from a particular therapeutic or risk of suffering certain adverse events from a particular therapeutic. Companion diagnostics represent a greater integration between diagnostics and therapeutics; 
● | Screening tests: Diagnostics performed on people prior to a clinical manifestation of disease - this contrasts with most other medical checks, which are performed when symptoms are already available. Screening typically involves testing a target population for a particular condition as part of a public health strategy; 
● | Pharmacogenomic tests: Examine the influence of genetic variation on drug response in patients by correlating gene expression or single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with a drug’s efficacy or toxicity. The aim of pharmacogenomics is to take into account a patient’s genotype to optimize drug therapy, i.e. to maximize efficacy while minimizing adverse effects.

There are a number of key trends that are having a significant impact on the clinical testing business and represent opportunities for companies that can develop novel diagnostic tests. Clinical laboratory testing is an essential healthcare service and is being favorably impacted by the following:
 

● | Demographics: The growing and aging population is increasing the demand for clinical testing; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Increased testing: Physicians are increasingly relying on diagnostic testing to help identify disease risk, detect the symptoms of disease earlier, aid in the choice of therapeutic regimen, and monitor patient compliance and to evaluate treatment results; 
● | Advances in science and technology: Recent medical advances have allowed earlier diagnosis and treatment of diseases and continuing research and development in the area of genomics is expected to yield new, more sophisticated and specialized diagnostic tests. These advances also are spurring interest in, and demand for, personalized or tailored medicine; 
● | Prevention and wellness: There is an increased awareness of the benefits of preventative medicine and wellness. Consumers, employers, health plans, and government agencies are increasingly focusing on detecting diseases earlier and providing preventative care that helps avoid disease. 

 
As a result of these significant changes in the laboratory testing and IVD markets, it is evident that there is a significant commercial opportunity for companies that provide products or services that address the new needs of the evolving diagnostics marketplace. This is the market opportunity that the Company is addressing through its introduction of diagnostics tests that use patented, patent-pending, and proprietary technology to improve health and reduce the overall cost of healthcare through early detection, prevention, and treatment.
 
Our Strategy
 
The Company’s solution is to utilize the technology that it has exclusively licensed from Wayne State University to exploit the new opportunities that are evolving in the diagnostics industry. The Company was created to specifically commercialize microarray-based diagnostic tests and services that are focused on early detection and pre-symptomatic screening. These new tests are based on patented and proprietary technology that is well-suited to be run in a central or regional laboratory utilizing samples that are collected by healthcare providers and sent to the authorized CLIA/ISO-certified testing facility for processing. This approach is similar to the business model that Myriad Genetics, Inc. (Revenues: $470.45 million; market cap: $2.86 billion; NASDAQ:MYGN) has utilized with the seven tests that it markets that determine predisposition to hereditary breast cancer, ovarian cancer, colon cancer, endometrial cancer and melanoma skin cancer. However, whereas Myriad Genetics determines a predisposition to a particular disease, the Company will market diagnostic tests that can be used to screen for the actual disease itself, in most cases before any symptoms have been observed. To achieve this goal of commercializing new diagnostic opportunities, the Company is leveraging off the strategic relationships that have been established with organizations such as Wayne State University and others to develop unique and high value-added diagnostic tests.
 
Although the initial focus of the Company is the OvaDx® test, the Company will explore opportunities for other microarray-based diagnostic tests, which may include pre-symptomatic screening tests for Parkinson’s disease, Alzheimer’s disease, prostate cancer, and other applications that allow early detection. The Company will also explore companion diagnostic opportunities for pharmaceuticals such as Plavix®, the world’s leading anti-clotting medication that is manufactured by Bristol-Myers Squibb in conjunction with Sanofi-Aventis Pharmaceuticals. With the completion of the human genome sequencing project, genetic research has increased its focus on identifying the variations of the specific genes in the genome. These variations are what define individual characteristics, including disease states or a statistical propensity for disease. The implications are far-reaching and impact not only the research community, but also individual patients and medical providers. Diagnostic tests that detect diseases very early in their progression will provide options for earlier treatments that may improve the patient’s quality of life and prognosis by delaying or preventing disease progression or even death. Medical providers will incur major cost savings by avoiding costly late stage disease treatments.

License Agreements
 
As a result of a Technology Transfer Agreement dated July 18, 2009, between Avant Diagnostics, Inc. and Arriyat Corporation (“Arriyat”), Avant has exclusive license rights to all of the trade secrets and protocols required for the sale and use of the OvaDx® ovarian cancer test. In addition, as a result of a technology transfer agreement with a stockholder of Avant, we will benefit from an extensive microarray technology patent portfolio and expertise, which includes the following:

● | Patented microarray printing technology: Arrayit’s patented (U.S. Patent 6,101,946) microarray printing technology is differentiated from other techniques in the market because other companies are limited by what they can deposit on a microarray; specifically DNA. The Arrayit technology can deposit any kind of molecule on a microarray, including DNA, proteins, antibodies, patient samples, diagnostic elements, and other compounds. This unique technology gives the Company a competitive advantage in the types of future diagnostic products that it develops and commercializes, as well as freedom to operate in the microarray manufacturing marketplace. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Patented VIP technology: Arrayit’s patented microarray diagnostic Variation Identification Platform (VIP) technology has the ability to test 10, 100, 1,000, 10,000, and up to 100,000 patients on a single microscope substrate slide requiring only one assay to match 100,000 patients to a particular disease state. Should any one of those 10 to100,000 patient samples contain the marker for the disease being tested it would produce a red spot; if no disease, a green spot. This procedure also identifies carriers as yellow spots. Because of the sophistication of this patent, one lab could test hundreds of thousands of patient samples a day after receiving a sample of DNA from each patient. VIP is the only method available to the industry that can accomplish this. This is a revolutionary improvement by saving time and money, laboratory space, personnel, equipment, chemicals, reagents and consumables. It also positions the Company uniquely. As microarray diagnostics continue to gain acceptance in healthcare, the need to screen thousands of patients a day will make any competitor’s one patient per slide per experiment methodology far too costly and time consuming. Even when testing just 10 patients, the patented VIP method has impressive 10-fold decrease in time and cost over methods that use one microarray per test. VIP technology is especially attractive for population-wide diagnostic screening applications, such as the H1N1 virus and other infectious diseases. VIP technology is also extremely useful in limited-population screening as companion diagnostics for drugs such as Plavix®. Plavix® patients that have the CYP2C19 gene variant respond poorly to Plavix® treatment and a VIP test to screen Plavix® patients would improve drug efficacy by targeting the correct segment of the population that can benefit from this drug. Avant’s multi-patient genotyping procedure is protected by the following patents: 


● | U.S. Patent 6,913,879 Australia 2002218740 Europe 1343911 Korea 10-0756015 New Zealand 523560 Singapore 94899 Taiwan I280282 Israel 153848 People’s Republic of China L01813972.8 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Microarray expertise: The future success of the Company is made possible by leveraging off the ability to continually innovate and develop sophisticated microarray based diagnostic products. The Company relies on the identification of biomarkers and the ability to commercialize them by utilizing Arrayit’s delivery technology. The Company is seizing the opportunities created by Arrayit’s advanced technologies that are driving the discovery of unique biomarkers in laboratories around the globe. The microarrays manufactured by Arrayit and utilized in the Company’s tests are considered to be the best in the industry and are 99% pure (versus 70% for competitors) and are the most sensitive on the market.

● | Growing menu of screening tests: The Company’s OvaDx® ovarian cancer test will set the standard for early detection and pre-symptomatic screening utilizing a microarray based diagnostic test. We expect to expand this menu of tests to provide other early detection tests for key diseases where adequate diagnostic screening tests do not exist and where early detection can save lives and improve quality of life, such as Parkinson’s disease, Alzheimer’s disease, prostate cancer, and other diseases and medical conditions. We expect that other cancer tests, neurological assays, and areas such as allergy and food intolerance testing will benefit from the efficient patient screening model that are utilized in our tests. Additional markets for consideration that will also benefit from screening tests using our licensed technology are blood typing, parentage testing, forensics, human leukocyte antigen (HLA) analysis, infectious disease diagnosis, food testing, crop testing, and anti-terrorism analysis. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Ability to leverage strategic relationships: We expect that the relationships that have been established with the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), Sandia Laboratories, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), UT MD Anderson Cancer Center, The Parkinson’s Institute, MIT, Stanford University, the NIH, and other prestigious institutions, organizations, and companies around the world will benefit us immensely as we strive to create a world-class diagnostic testing company. We believe that our relationships will allow us to license biomarkers discoveries from these and other research facilities that have the potential to create innovative diagnostic tests. Similar to our relationship with Wayne State University, and the worldwide exclusive licensing and sponsored research agreements that we put in place with them, we believe additional novel diagnostic tests can be developed based on licensing of biomarkers discovered by our academic and scientific collaborators. 

Governmental Regulation
 
The services that we provide are regulated by federal, state and foreign governmental authorities. Failure to comply with the applicable laws and regulations can subject us to repayment of amounts previously paid to us, significant civil and criminal penalties, loss of licensure, certification, or accreditation, or exclusion from government health care programs. The significant areas of regulation are summarized below.
Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 and State Regulation
 
Each of our clinical laboratories must hold certain federal, state and local licenses, certifications and permits to conduct our business. Laboratories in the United States that perform testing on human specimens for the purpose of providing information for the diagnosis, prevention, or treatment of disease are subject to the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988, or (“CLIA”). CLIA requires such laboratories to be certified by the federal government and mandates compliance with various operational, personnel, facilities administration, quality and proficiency testing requirements intended to ensure that testing services are accurate, reliable and timely. CLIA certification also is a prerequisite to be eligible to bill state and federal health care programs, as well as many private insurers, for laboratory testing services. Our laboratories in Salt Lake City, Utah, Austin, Texas and South San Francisco, California are CLIA certified to perform high complexity tests.
 
In addition, CLIA requires our certified laboratories to enroll in an approved proficiency testing program if it performs testing in any category for which proficiency testing is required. Our laboratories periodically test specimens received from an outside proficiency testing organization and then submit the results back to that organization for evaluation. If our laboratories fails to achieve a passing score on a proficiency test they lose their right to perform testing. Further, failure to comply with other proficiency testing regulations, such as the prohibition on referral of a proficiency testing specimen to another laboratory for analysis, can result in revocation of our laboratories’ CLIA certification.
 
As a condition of CLIA certification, each of our laboratories is subject to survey and inspection every other year, in addition to being subject to additional random inspections. The biennial survey is conducted by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (“CMS”), a CMS agent (typically a state agency), or, a CMS-approved accreditation organization. Our laboratories are accredited by the College of American Pathologists (“CAP”), which is a CMS-approved accreditation organization.

CLIA provides that a state may adopt laboratory regulations that are more stringent than those under federal law. Our laboratories are licensed by the appropriate state agencies in the states in which they operate, if such licensure is required. In addition, our laboratories hold state licenses from California, Florida, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island and Maryland, to the extent that they accept specimens from one or more of these states, each of which require out-of-state laboratories to obtain licensure. If a laboratory is out of compliance with state laws or regulations governing licensed laboratories, penalties for violation vary from state to state but may include suspension, limitation, revocation or annulment of the license, assessment of financial penalties or fines, or imprisonment. We believe that we are in material compliance with all applicable licensing laws and regulations.
 
Food and Drug Administration
 
Although the Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) has consistently claimed that it has the authority to regulate laboratory-developed tests (“LDTs”) that are developed, validated and performed only by a CLIA certified laboratory, it has historically exercised enforcement discretion by not otherwise regulating most LDTs. Nevertheless, the FDA recently indicated that it is promulgating draft guidance for FDA regulation of most LDTs in the future.
 
After a medical device is placed on the market, numerous regulatory requirements apply. These include:
 

● | compliance with the QSR, which require manufacturers to follow stringent design, testing, control, documentation, record maintenance, including maintenance of complaint and related investigation files, and other quality assurance controls during the manufacturing process; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | labeling regulations, which prohibit the promotion of products for uncleared, unapproved or “off-label” uses and impose other restrictions on labeling; and 
● | medical device reporting obligations, which require that manufacturers investigate and report to the FDA adverse events, including deaths, or serious injuries that may have been or were caused by a medical device and malfunctions in the device that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if it were to recur. 

 
Failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements can result in enforcement action by the FDA, which may include sanctions, including but not limited to, warning letters; fines, injunctions, and civil penalties; recall or seizure of the device; operating restrictions, partial suspension or total shutdown of production; refusal to grant 510(k) clearance or PMA approvals of new devices; withdrawal of 510(k) clearance or PMA approvals; and civil or criminal prosecution. To ensure compliance with regulatory requirements, medical device manufacturers are subject to market surveillance and periodic, pre-scheduled and unannounced inspections by the FDA.
 
HIPAA and other privacy laws
 
The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”), established comprehensive federal protection for the privacy and security of health information. The HIPAA standards apply to three types of organizations: health plans, healthcare clearing houses, and healthcare providers which conduct certain healthcare transactions electronically (“Covered Entities”). Title II of HIPAA, the Administrative Simplification Act, contains provisions that address the privacy of health data, the security of health data, the standardization of identifying numbers used in the healthcare system and the standardization of certain healthcare transactions. The privacy regulations protect medical records and other protected health information by limiting their use and release, giving patients the right to access their medical records and limiting most disclosures of health information to the minimum amount necessary to accomplish an intended purpose. The HIPAA security standards require the adoption of administrative, physical, and technical safeguards and the adoption of written security policies and procedures.
 
On February 17, 2009, Congress enacted Subtitle D of the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, provisions of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. HITECH amends HIPAA and, among other things, expands and strengthens HIPAA, creates new targets for enforcement, imposes new penalties for noncompliance and establishes new breach notification requirements for Covered Entities. Regulations implementing major provisions of HITECH were finalized on January 25, 2013 through publication of the HIPAA Omnibus Rule (the “Omnibus Rule”).
 

-14-
----


Under HITECH’s new breach notification requirements, Covered Entities must report breaches of protected health information that has not been encrypted or otherwise secured in accordance with guidance from the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (the “Secretary”). Required breach notices must be made as soon as is reasonably practicable, but no later than 60 days following discovery of the breach. Reports must be made to affected individuals and to the Secretary and in some cases, they must be reported through local and national media, depending on the size of the breach. Breach reports can lead to investigation and enforcement.
 
We are currently subject to the HIPAA regulations and maintain an active compliance program that is designed to identify security incidents and other issues in a timely fashion and enable us to remediate, mitigate harm or report if required by law. We are subject to prosecution and/or administrative enforcement and increased civil and criminal penalties for non-compliance, including a new, four-tiered system of monetary penalties adopted under HITECH. We are also subject to enforcement by state attorneys general who were given authority to enforce HIPAA under HITECH. To avoid penalties under the HITECH breach notification provisions, we must ensure that breaches of protected health information are promptly detected and reported within the company, so that we can make all required notifications on a timely basis. However, even if we make required reports on a timely basis, we may still be subject to penalties for the underlying breach.
 
In addition to the federal privacy regulations, there are a number of state laws regarding the privacy and security of health information and personal data that are applicable to our clinical laboratories. Many states have also implemented genetic testing and privacy laws imposing specific patient consent requirements and protecting test results by strictly limiting the disclosure of those results. State requirements are particularly stringent regarding predictive genetic tests, due to the risk of genetic discrimination against healthy patients identified through testing as being at a high risk for disease. We believe that we have taken the steps required of us to comply with health information privacy and security statutes and regulations, including genetic testing and genetic information privacy laws in all jurisdictions, both state and federal. However, we may not be able to maintain compliance in all jurisdictions where we do business. Failure to maintain compliance, or changes in state or federal laws regarding privacy or security, could result in civil and/or criminal penalties and could have a material adverse effect on our business.
 
We are subject to laws and regulations related to the protection of the environment, the health and safety of employees and the handling, transportation and disposal of medical specimens, infectious and hazardous waste and radioactive materials. For example, the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (“OSHA”), has established extensive requirements relating specifically to workplace safety for healthcare employers in the U.S. This includes requirements to develop and implement multi-faceted programs to protect workers from exposure to blood-borne pathogens, including preventing or minimizing any exposure through needle stick injuries. For purposes of transportation, some biological materials and laboratory supplies are classified as hazardous materials and are subject to regulation by one or more of the following agencies: the U.S. Department of Transportation, the U.S. Public Health Service, the United States Postal Service and the International Air Transport Association. We generally use third-party vendors to dispose of regulated medical waste, hazardous waste and radioactive materials and contractually require them to comply with applicable laws and regulations.
 
International regulations
 
We market our tests outside of the United States and are subject to foreign regulatory requirements governing laboratory licensure, human clinical testing, use of tissue, privacy and data security, and marketing approval for our tests. These requirements vary by jurisdiction, differ from those in the United States and may require us to implement additional compliance measures or perform additional pre-clinical or clinical testing. On September 26, 2012, the European Commission released the first drafts of the new European Union (“EU”) regulations for medical devices and IVDs that if finalized will impose additional regulatory requirements on IVDs used in the EU. In many countries outside of the United States, coverage, pricing and reimbursement approvals are also required. We are also required to maintain accurate information and control over sales and distributors’ activities that may fall within the purview of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, its books and records provisions and its anti-bribery provisions.

Reimbursement and Billing
 
Reimbursement and billing for diagnostic services is generally highly complex. Laboratories must bill various payors, such as private third-party payors, including MCOs and state and federal health care programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, and each may have different billing requirements. Additionally, the audit requirements we must meet to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations, as well as our internal compliance policies and procedures, add further complexity to the billing process. Other factors that complicate billing include:

● | variability in coverage and information requirements among various payors; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | missing, incomplete or inaccurate billing information provided by ordering physicians; 
● | billings to payors with whom we do not have contracts; 
● | disputes with payors as to which party is responsible for payment; and 
● | disputes with payors as to the appropriate level of reimbursement. 

 
Depending on the reimbursement arrangement and applicable law, the party that reimburses us for our services may be:
 

● | a third party who provides coverage to the patient, such as an insurance company or MCO; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | a governmental payor; or 
● | the patient. 

Federal and State Fraud and Abuse Laws
 
A variety of federal laws prohibit fraud and abuse involving state and federal health care programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid. These laws are interpreted broadly and enforced aggressively by various state and federal agencies, including CMS, the Department of Justice, the Office of Inspector General for the Department of Health and Human Services (“OIG”), and various state agencies. In addition, the Medicare and Medicaid programs increasingly use a variety of contractors to review claims data and to identify improper payments as well as fraud and abuse. Any overpayments identified must be repaid to the Medicare program unless a favorable decision is obtained on appeal. In some cases, these overpayments can be used as the basis for an extrapolation, by which the error rate is applied to a larger universe of claims, and which can result in even higher repayments.
 
Anti-Kickback Laws
 
The Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in exchange for or to induce either the referral of an individual, or the furnishing, arranging for or recommending of an item or service that is reimbursable, in whole or in part, by a federal health care program. “Remuneration” is broadly defined to include anything of value, such as, for example, cash payments, gifts or gift certificates, discounts, or the furnishing of services, supplies or equipment. The Anti-Kickback Statue is broad and prohibits many arrangements and practices that are lawful in businesses outside of the health care industry.
 
Recognizing the breadth of the Anti-Kickback Statute and the fact that it may technically prohibit many innocuous or beneficial arrangements within the health care industry, the OIG has issued a series of regulations, or safe harbors. Compliance with all requirements of a safe harbor immunizes the parties to the business arrangement from prosecution under the Anti-Kickback Statute. The failure of a business arrangement to fit within a safe harbor does not necessarily mean that the arrangement is illegal or that the OIG will pursue prosecution. Still, in the absence of an applicable safe harbor, a violation of the Anti-Kickback Statute may occur even if only one purpose of an arrangement is to induce referrals. The penalties for violating the Anti-Kickback Statute can be severe. These sanctions include criminal and civil penalties, imprisonment and possible exclusion from the federal health care programs. Many states have adopted laws similar to the Anti-Kickback Statute, and some apply to items and services reimbursable by any payor, including private third-party payors.

Physician Self-Referral Bans
 
The federal ban on physician self-referrals, commonly known as the Stark Law, prohibits, subject to certain exceptions, physician referrals of Medicare patients to an entity providing certain designated health services, which include laboratory services, if the physician or an immediate family member of the physician has any financial relationship with the entity. Several Stark Law exceptions are relevant to arrangements involving clinical laboratories, including: (1) fair market value compensation for the provision of items or services; (2) payments by physicians to a laboratory for clinical laboratory services; (3) certain space and equipment rental arrangements that satisfy certain requirements; and (4) personal services arrangements. Penalties for violating the Stark Law include the return of funds received for all prohibited referrals, fines, civil monetary penalties and possible exclusion from the federal health care programs. In addition to the Stark Law, many states have their own self-referral bans, which may extend to all self-referrals, regardless of the payor.
State and Federal Prohibitions on False Claims
 
The federal False Claims Act imposes liability on any person or entity that, among other things, knowingly presents, or causes to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment to the federal government. Under the False Claims Act, a person acts knowingly if he has actual knowledge of the information or acts in deliberate ignorance or in reckless disregard of the truth or falsity of the information. Specific intent to defraud is not required. The qui tam provisions of the False Claims Act allow a private individual to bring an action on behalf of the federal government and to share in any amounts paid by the defendant to the government in connection with the action. Penalties include payment of up to three times the actual damages sustained by the government, plus civil penalties of between $5,500 and $11,000 for each false claim, as well as possible exclusion from the federal health care programs. In addition, various states have enacted similar laws modeled after the False Claims Act that apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state health care programs, and, in several states, such laws apply to claims submitted to any payor.
Civil Monetary Penalties Law
 
The federal Civil Monetary Penalties Law, or the CMP Law, prohibits, among other things (1) the offering or transfer of remuneration to a Medicare or state health care program beneficiary if the person knows or should know it is likely to influence the beneficiary’s selection of a particular provider, practitioner, or supplier of services reimbursable by Medicare or a state health care program, unless an exception applies; (2) employing or contracting with an individual or entity that the provider knows or should know is excluded from participation in a federal health care program; (3) billing for services requested by an unlicensed physician or an excluded provider; and (4) billing for medically unnecessary services. The penalties for violating the CMP Law include exclusion, substantial fines, and payment of up to three times the amount billed, depending on the nature of the offense.
Employees
 
During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2017, the Company had one active employee, who is the Company’s former Chief Executive Officer. The Company has not experienced any work disruptions or stoppages and it considers relations with its employee to be good. No employee of the Company is covered by a collective-bargaining agreement.
