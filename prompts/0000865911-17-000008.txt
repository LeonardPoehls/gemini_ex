Definitive Agreement with First Interstate BancSystem, Inc.
On November 17, 2016, First Interstate BancSystem, Inc. (“First Interstate”) and Cascade announced a definitive agreement (the “First Interstate merger agreement”) under which First Interstate, parent company of First Interstate Bank, will acquire Cascade in a cash and stock transaction for total consideration valued at approximately $590.5 million in aggregate, or $7.62 per share based on the First Interstate closing price of $38.40 per share on November 17, 2016 (the “First Interstate merger”). The First Interstate merger will create a unique regional banking franchise that extends from the Mountain West to the Pacific Northwest and will provide First Interstate with a presence in several high-growth markets, including Bend, Oregon and Boise, Idaho.
Pursuant to the terms of the First Interstate agreement, Cascade shareholders will receive 0.14864 shares of First Interstate Class A common stock and $1.91 in cash in exchange for each share of Cascade common stock they hold. The exchange ratio is fixed and the portion of shares received by Cascade shareholders is expected to qualify as a tax-free exchange. Cascade shareholders will own approximately 20% of the outstanding capital stock of First Interstate once the transaction is complete. 
The First Interstate merger is expected to result in long-term annual earnings per share accretion of 10% and 2018 earnings per share accretion of over 8% after accelerating the debit interchange limitations from the Durbin amendment brought on by crossing $10 billion in consolidated total assets. First Interstate is expected to recover the tangible book value dilution experienced in this transaction in approximately five years. 
3

Each of the board of directors of Cascade and First Interstate has unanimously approved the First Interstate merger, and the directors and certain large shareholders of Cascade have entered into agreements with First Interstate pursuant to which they have agreed to vote their shares of Cascade common stock in favor of the First Interstate merger. Additionally, the directors of First Interstate have entered into agreements with Cascade pursuant to which they have agreed to vote their shares of First Interstate common stock in favor of the First Interstate merger. 
First Interstate and Cascade expect to close the First Interstate merger early in the third quarter of 2017 after satisfaction of customary closing conditions, including regulatory approvals and the approvals of the First Interstate and Cascade shareholders. Immediately following the completion of the First Interstate merger, it is anticipated that Bank of the Cascades will be merged with and into First Interstate Bank. Upon completion of the First Interstate merger, two members of Cascade’s Board of Directors will be added to the First Interstate Board of Directors.
Acquisition of Prime Pacific Financial Services, Inc.
On August 1, 2016, Prime Pacific Financial Services, Inc. (“PPFS”) merged with and into Cascade with Cascade continuing as the surviving corporation (the “PPFS merger”). Immediately after the PPFS merger, Prime Pacific Bank, a wholly-owned subsidiary of PPFS, merged with and into the Bank, with the Bank continuing as the surviving bank. 
Each share of PPFS common stock was converted into the right to receive 0.3050 shares of Cascade common stock. The conversion of PPFS common stock resulted in Cascade issuing 2,921,012 shares of its common stock. 
Acquisition of Bank of America Branches
On March 4, 2016, the Bank completed the purchase of 15 branch locations in Oregon and southwest Washington from Bank of America, National Association (the “branch acquisition” and together with the PPFS merger, the “2016 acquisitions”). The Bank assumed approximately $469.9 million of branch deposits, paying a 2.00% premium on the average balance of deposits assumed, for a cash purchase price of $9.7 million. 
Merger Completed with Home Federal Bancorp 
On May 16, 2014, pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of October 23, 2013, between the Company and Home Federal Bancorp (“Home”), Home merged with and into Cascade with Cascade continuing as the surviving corporation (the “Home merger”). Immediately after the Home merger, Home Federal Bank, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Home, merged with and into the Bank, with the Bank continuing as the surviving bank. 
Each share of Home’s common stock was converted into the right to receive $8.43 in cash and 1.6772 shares of Cascade common stock. The conversion of Home’s common stock resulted in Cascade paying $122.2 million in cash and issuing 24,309,131 shares of its common stock. 
Business Overview
The Company’s banking business is closely tied to the economies of Idaho, Oregon and Washington, which in turn are influenced by regional and national economic trends and conditions. Idaho, Oregon and Washington have recently been experiencing improved economic trends, including gains in employment and increased real estate activity. National and regional economies and real estate prices have generally improved, as has business and consumer confidence. The Company’s markets, however, continue to be sensitive to general economic trends and conditions, including real estate values, and an unforeseen economic shock or a return of adverse economic conditions could cause deterioration of local economies and adversely affect the Company’s business, financial condition and results of operations.
Business Strategies 
Cascade’s mission statement is “dedicated to delivering the best in banking for the financial well-being of our customers and stockholders.” The Company’s primary business objective is to continue to improve and diversify revenue resulting in sustainable profitability consistent with safe and sound business principals and its risk management appetite. Growth in franchise value, net income and earnings per share are considered primary metrics for which management goals are established. The achievement of growth in deposits, loans and customer relationships support these metrics. In addition, the Company seeks accretive merger and acquisition transactions to profitably leverage its infrastructure and enhance franchise value. To complement these priorities, the Company also focuses on (i) diversification of its earning assets to mitigate credit risk; (ii) expanding its relationship deposits to fund asset growth; (iii) diversification of revenue sources to reduce income volatility; (iv) improving its operating efficiency; (v) consistently delivering quality customer service and applying technology to enhance the delivery of banking services; and (vi) retaining a high-performing work force. Because of the uncertainties of the current economic climate, competitive factors and the risk factors described in Item 1A of this report, there can be no assurance that Cascade will be successful executing these strategies.

Highlights of the Company’s progress over recent years include a significant reduction in adversely risk rated loans and the improvement of credit quality metrics to levels that are generally consistent with those of peer banks, enabling the termination of the prior regulatory agreements in 2013. See “Supervision and Regulation - Regulatory Actions” for more information on the regulatory agreements. 
Employees 
Cascade views its employees as an integral resource in achieving its strategies and long-term goals, and considers its relationship with its employees to be strong. Bancorp has no employees other than its executive officers who are also employees of the Bank. The Bank had 615 full-time equivalent employees as of December 31, 2016. 
Risk Management 
The Company has risk management policies with respect to identification, assessment and management of important business risks. Such risks include, but are not limited to, credit quality and loan concentration risks, liquidity risk, interest rate risk, economic and market risk, as well as operating risks such as compliance, disclosure, internal control, legal and reputation risks. The Company’s board of directors and related committees review and oversee the implementation of policies that specify various controls and risk tolerances. 
Credit risk management objectives include the implementation of loan policies and underwriting practices designed to prudently manage credit risk, and monitoring processes designed to identify and manage loan portfolio risk and concentrations. 
Liquidity management policies are designed to maintain an appropriate volume and mix of core relationship deposits and time deposit balances to minimize liquidity risk while efficiently funding the Company’s loan and investment activities. From time to time, the Company has augmented its funding base with borrowings from reliable counterparties such as the Federal Home Loan Bank of Seattle and Des Moines (“FHLB”) and the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco (“FRB”). 
The Company monitors and manages its sensitivity to changing interest rates by utilizing simulation analysis and scenario modeling and by adopting asset and liability strategies and tactics to control the volatility of its net interest income in the event of changes in interest rates. 
Operating risks are managed through policies, procedures and implementation of and adherence to a system of internal controls. Internal controls are subject to testing in the course of internal audit and regulatory compliance activities. Policies, procedures and controls are enhanced over time in conjunction with the Company’s risk management strategies. However, there are a wide range of complex risks inherent in the Company’s business, and there can be no assurance that internal controls will always detect, contain, eliminate or prevent risks that could result in adverse financial results in the future.
Competition 
Commercial and consumer banking in Oregon, Idaho and Washington are highly competitive businesses. The Bank competes principally with other banks, thrifts, credit unions, mortgage companies, broker dealers and insurance companies and increasingly other non-bank financial services providers. All of its competitors may also use the Internet as a platform to originate loans and/or acquire deposits. In addition to price competition for deposits and loans, market participants compete with respect to the scope and type of services offered, customer service levels, convenience, fees and service charges. Improvements in technology, communications and the Internet have intensified delivery channel competition. Competitor behavior may result in heightened competition among banking and financial services market participants and thus may adversely affect the Company’s future profitability. 
The Company believes that it has been able to compete effectively with financial services competitors because of its execution of local delivery-based community banking strategies, its delivery of technology and mobile banking services, and because of its focus on banking small to medium-sized businesses, professionals and consumers in its locales. The Bank endeavors to offer attractive financial products and services delivered by effective bankers that are differentiated by their professionalism and customer service. The Bank’s products and services are designed to be convenient, with flexible delivery alternatives. In addition, the Bank’s lending and deposit officers have significant experience and reputation in their respective marketplaces. This enables them to maintain close working relationships with their customers. 
The Company serves the markets of Central, Southern, Coastal and Northwest Oregon, as well in the greater Boise/Treasure Valley, Idaho and Seattle, Washington metro areas. Loan competition in Oregon, Idaho and Washington is substantial, and success is dependent on price and terms, as well as effectiveness of bankers in building relationships with customers. The Company believes that branch network competitiveness and profitability are enhanced when the Bank has consequential market share in these key markets. In that regard, the Company’s branch strategy targets community bank oriented markets in small- to medium-sized cities and towns away from mega-metropolitan areas. For example, in the Bend, Oregon Metropolitan Statistical Area (“MSA”) as of June 30, 2016, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation’s (“FDIC”) “Deposit Market Share Report” indicated the Company had the number one deposit market share at 28% of total deposit balance in the Bend, Oregon MSA. 
5

At December 31, 2016, loans and deposits in Oregon markets accounted for approximately 64.5% and 72.1%, respectively, of total balances, while Idaho loans and deposits were approximately 16.8% and 23.1%, respectively, of total balances. Loans and deposits in Washington at December 31, 2016, were approximately 6.1% and 4.9%, respectively. Approximately 12.6% of loans are to borrowers located outside of the Company’s primary markets with the aim of diversifying earning assets and to meet asset and liability management strategies. 
Supervision and Regulation 
The operations of the Company and the Bank may be affected by legislative changes and by the policies of various regulatory authorities. Management is unable to predict the nature or the extent of the effects on its business and earnings that fiscal or monetary policies, economic control or new federal or state legislation may have in the future. The regulatory framework under which we operate is intended primarily for the protection of depositors and the FDIC’s Deposit Insurance Fund and not for the protection of our security holders and creditors. The significant laws and regulations that apply to the Company and the Bank are summarized below. The summaries are qualified in their entirety by reference to the full text of the statutes, regulations and policies that are described.
Regulatory Agencies 
As a registered bank holding company, the Company is subject to the supervision and regulation of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the “Federal Reserve Board”) and, acting under delegated authority, the FRB pursuant to the Bank Holding Company Act, as amended (the “BHC Act”).
As an Oregon state-chartered bank, the Bank is subject to the supervision and regulation of the Division of Finance and Corporate Securities (“Oregon DFCS”) and, with respect to the Bank’s Idaho branching operations, the Idaho Department of Finance and, with respect to the Bank’s Washington operations, the Washington State Department of Financial Institutions. As a state-chartered bank that is not a member of the Federal Reserve, the Bank is also subject to the supervision and regulation of the FDIC.
Regulatory Actions
Bancorp
On October 26, 2009, Bancorp entered into a written agreement with the FRB and Oregon DFCS (the “Written Agreement”) that required Bancorp to take certain measures to improve its safety and soundness. Under the Written Agreement, Bancorp was required to develop and submit for approval a plan to maintain sufficient capital at Bancorp and the Bank within 60 days of the date of the Written Agreement. The Company submitted a strategic plan on October 28, 2009. As of December 31, 2012, Bancorp met the 10% Tier 1 leverage ratio requirement per the Written Agreement. On July 8, 2013, the Bancorp entered into a memorandum of understanding (“FRB-MOU”) with the FRB and the Oregon DFCS that terminated the Written Agreement. On October 23, 2013, the FRB-MOU was lifted by the FRB and Oregon DFCS.
Bank
On August 27, 2009, the Bank entered into an agreement with the FDIC, its principal federal banking regulator, and the Oregon DFCS, that required the Bank to take certain measures to improve its safety and soundness. In connection with this agreement, the Bank stipulated to the issuance by the FDIC and the Oregon DFCS of a cease-and-desist order (the “Order”) against the Bank as a result of certain findings from an examination of the Bank concluded in February 2009 based upon financial and lending data measured as of December 31, 2008 (the Report of Examination, or “ROE”). In entering into the stipulation and consenting to entry of the Order, the Bank did not concede the findings or admit to any of the assertions therein. Under the Order, the Bank was required to take certain measures to improve its capital position, maintain liquidity ratios, reduce its level of non-performing assets, reduce its loan concentrations in certain portfolios, improve management practices and board supervision, and assure that its reserve for loan losses is maintained at an appropriate level. 
On March 7, 2013, the Bank entered into a memorandum of understanding (“MOU”) with the FDIC and the Oregon DFCS that terminated the Order. The MOU restricted the Bank from paying dividends without the written consent of the FDIC and Oregon DFCS and required that the Bank maintain higher levels of capital than may be required by published capital adequacy requirements. In particular the MOU required the Bank to maintain the minimum capital requirements for a “well-capitalized” bank, including a Tier 1 leverage ratio of at least 10.00%. On September 5, 2013, the MOU was lifted by the FDIC and Oregon DFCS. 
Bank Holding Company Regulation
Bancorp is a one-bank holding company within the meaning of the BHC Act and, as such, is subject to regulation, supervision and examination by the Federal Reserve Board. Bancorp is required to file annual reports with the Federal Reserve Board and to provide the Federal Reserve Board such additional information as the Federal Reserve Board may require.
Acquisitions by Bank Holding Companies
6

The BHC Act generally requires every bank holding company to obtain the prior approval of the Federal Reserve Board before (i) acquiring, directly or indirectly, ownership or control of any voting shares of another bank or bank holding company if, after such acquisition, it would own or control more than 5.00% of such shares (unless it already owns or controls the majority of such shares); (ii) acquiring all or substantially all of the assets of another bank or bank holding company; or (iii) merging or consolidating with another bank holding company. The Federal Reserve Board will not approve any acquisition, merger or consolidation that would have a substantial anticompetitive result, unless the anticompetitive effects of the proposed transaction are clearly outweighed by a greater public interest in meeting the convenience and needs of the community to be served. The Federal Reserve Board also considers capital adequacy and other financial and managerial factors in reviewing acquisitions or mergers, as well as Community Reinvestment Act (“CRA”) performance.
The Change in Bank Control Act, as amended, and the related regulations of the Federal Reserve Board require any person or groups of persons acting in concert (except for companies required to make application under the BHC Act), to file a written notice with the Federal Reserve Board or, acting under delegated authority, the appropriate Federal Reserve Bank, before the person or group acquires control of the Company. The Change in Bank Control Act defines “control” as the direct or indirect power to vote 25% or more of any class of voting securities or to direct the management or policies of a bank holding company or an insured bank. A rebuttable presumption of control arises under the Change in Bank Control Act where a person or group controls 10% or more, but less than 25%, of a class of the voting stock of a company or insured bank which is a reporting company under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), such as the Company, or such ownership interest is greater than the ownership interest held by any other person or group.
In addition, the Change in Bank Control Act prohibits any entity from acquiring 25% (5% in the case of an acquirer that is a bank holding company) or more of a bank holding company’s or bank’s voting securities, or otherwise obtaining control or a controlling influence over a bank holding company or bank without the approval of the Federal Reserve Board. On September 22, 2008, the Federal Reserve Board issued a policy statement on equity investments in bank holding companies and banks, which allows the Federal Reserve Board to generally be able to conclude that an entity’s investment is not “controlling” if the investment in the form of voting and nonvoting shares represents in the aggregate (i) less than one-third of the total equity of the banking organization (and less than one-third of any class of voting securities, assuming conversion of all convertible nonvoting securities held by the entity) and (ii) less than 15% of any class of voting securities of the banking organization.
Permissible Activities
With certain exceptions, the BHC Act also prohibits a bank holding company from acquiring or retaining direct or indirect ownership or control of more than 5.00% of the voting shares of any company which is not a bank or bank holding company, or from engaging directly or indirectly in activities other than those of banking, managing or controlling banks, or providing services for its subsidiaries. The principal exceptions to these prohibitions involve certain non-bank activities which, by statute or by Federal Reserve Board regulation or order, have been identified as activities closely related to the business of banking or of managing or controlling banks. In making this determination, the Federal Reserve Board considers whether the performance of such activities by a bank holding company can be expected to produce benefits to the public such as greater convenience, increased competition or gains in efficiency in resources, which can be expected to outweigh the risks of possible adverse effects such as decreased or unfair competition, conflicts of interest or unsound banking practices.
Source of Strength
Regulations and historical practice of the Federal Reserve Board have required bank holding companies to serve as a source of financial strength for their subsidiary banks. The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the “Dodd-Frank Act”) codified this requirement, but added managerial strength to the requirement, and extended it to all companies that control an insured depository institution. The appropriate federal banking regulators are required by the Dodd-Frank Act to issue final rules to carry out this requirement. 
Capital Adequacy
Banks and bank holding companies are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by state and federal banking agencies. Capital adequacy guidelines and, additionally for banks, prompt corrective action regulations involve quantitative measures of assets, liabilities and certain off-balance-sheet items calculated under regulatory accounting practices. Capital amounts and classifications are also subject to qualitative judgments by regulators about components, risk weighting and other factors.
The Federal Reserve Board and the FDIC have substantially similar risk-based capital ratio and leverage ratio guidelines for banking organizations, referred to as the “Basel III Rules.” The risk-based guidelines are intended to ensure that banking organizations have adequate capital given the risk levels of assets and off-balance sheet financial instruments. The Basel III Rules provide for increased risk-based and leverage capital ratio requirements and refine the definition of what constitutes “capital” for purposes of calculating those ratios. Under the Basel III Rules, which became effective for the Company and the Bank on January 1, 2015, banking organizations are required to maintain minimum ratios for common equity Tier 1 capital, Tier 1 capital and total capital to risk-weighted assets (including certain off-balance sheet items, such as letters of credit). For 
7

purposes of calculating the ratios, a banking organization’s assets and some of its specified off-balance sheet commitments and obligations are assigned to various risk categories. A depository institution’s or holding company’s capital, in turn, is classified in one of two tiers, depending on type:
Core Capital (Tier 1). Tier 1 capital includes common equity, retained earnings, qualifying non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock, a limited amount of qualifying cumulative perpetual stock at the holding company level, minority interests in equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries, qualifying trust preferred securities, less goodwill, most intangible assets and certain other assets; and
Supplementary Capital (Tier 2). Tier 2 capital includes, among other things, perpetual preferred stock and trust preferred securities not meeting the Tier 1 definition, qualifying mandatory convertible debt securities, qualifying subordinated debt, and allowances for possible loan and lease losses, subject to limitations.
As of December 31, 2016, Bancorp, like other bank holding companies, was required to maintain the following risk-based capital ratios: (i) a new common equity Tier 1 (“CET1”) risk-based capital ratio of 4.5%; (ii) a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6% (increased from 4%); and (iii) a total risk-based capital ratio of 8% (unchanged from previous rules). As of December 31, 2016, the Bank, like other depository institutions, was required to maintain similar capital levels under capital adequacy guidelines. Common equity Tier 1 capital consists of retained earnings and common stock instruments, subject to certain adjustments, as well as accumulated other comprehensive income (“AOCI”) except to the extent that Bancorp and the Bank exercised a one-time irrevocable option to exclude certain components of AOCI. 
Bank holding companies and banks are also required to comply with minimum leverage ratio requirements. The leverage ratio is the ratio of a banking organization’s Tier 1 capital to its total adjusted quarterly average assets (as defined for regulatory purposes). The requirements as of December 31, 2016 necessitate a minimum leverage ratio of 4.00% for bank holding companies and banks that have the highest supervisory rating. For a depository institution to be considered “well-capitalized” under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, its leverage ratio must be at least 5.00%.
The Basel III Rules also establish a “capital conservation buffer” of 2.5% above the regulatory minimum risk-based capital requirements. The capital conservation buffer requirement was phased in beginning in January 2016 at 0.625% of risk-weighted assets and will increase by that amount each year until fully implemented in January 2019. The conservation buffer, when fully phased in added to the capital requirements, will result in the following minimum ratios: (i) a common equity Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 7.0%, (ii) a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 8.5%, and (iii) a total risk-based capital ratio of 10.5%. An institution will be subject to limitations on certain activities including payment of dividends, share repurchases and discretionary bonuses to executive officers if its capital level is below the buffered ratio. Although these capital ratios do not become fully phased in until 2019, the banking regulators will expect bank holding companies and banks to meet these requirements well ahead of that date.
The Basel III Rules also revise the prompt corrective action framework (as discussed below), which is designed to place restrictions on insured depository institutions, including the Bank, if their capital levels do not meet certain thresholds. These revisions became effective January 1, 2015. The prompt correction action rules include a common equity Tier 1 capital component and increase certain other capital requirements for the various thresholds. As of January 1, 2015, insured depository institutions are required to meet the following capital levels in order to qualify as “well-capitalized:” (i) a new common equity Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6.5%; (ii) a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 8% (increased from 6%); (iii) a total risk-based capital ratio of 10% (unchanged from current rules); and (iv) a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 5% (unchanged from current rules).
The Federal Reserve may also set higher capital requirements for holding companies whose circumstances warrant it. For example, holding companies experiencing internal growth or making acquisitions are expected to maintain strong capital positions substantially above the minimum supervisory levels, without significant reliance on intangible assets. At this time, the bank regulatory agencies are more inclined to impose higher capital requirements to meet well-capitalized standards and future regulatory change could impose higher capital standards as a routine matter. As of December 31, 2016, the Company’s regulatory capital ratios and those of the Bank are in excess of the levels established for “well-capitalized” institutions under the new rules.
The Basel III Rules set forth certain changes in the methods of calculating certain risk-weighted assets, which in turn will affect the calculation of risk based ratios. Under the Basel III Rules, higher or more sensitive risk weights would be assigned to various categories of assets, including certain credit facilities that finance the acquisition, development or construction of real property, certain exposures or credits that are 90 days past due or on nonaccrual, foreign exposures and certain corporate exposures. In addition, these rules include greater recognition of collateral and guarantees, and revised capital treatment for derivatives and repo-style transactions.

Regulations Concerning Cash Dividends
The principal source of Bancorp’s cash revenues historically has been dividends received from the Bank. In addition, the appropriate regulatory authorities are authorized to prohibit banks and bank holding companies from paying dividends, the payment of which would constitute an unsafe or unsound banking practice.
Under the Oregon Business Corporation Act (“OBCA”), the Company may declare a dividend to its stockholders only if, after giving it effect, in the judgment of the Cascade Board of Directors, the Company would be able to pay its debts as they become due in the usual course of business and the Company’s total assets would at least equal the sum of its total liabilities (plus the amount that would be needed if the Company were to be dissolved at the time of the distribution to satisfy the preferential rights upon dissolution of stockholders whose preferential rights are superior to those receiving the distribution). The Federal Reserve Board also has further authority to prohibit dividends by bank holding companies if their actions constitute unsafe or unsound practices. The Federal Reserve Board has issued a policy statement and supervisory guidance on the payment of cash dividends by bank holding companies, which expresses the Federal Reserve Board’s view that a bank holding company should pay cash dividends only to the extent that, (1) the company’s net income for the past year is sufficient to cover the cash dividends, (2) the rate of earnings retention is consistent with the company’s capital needs, asset quality, and overall financial condition, and (3) the minimum regulatory capital adequacy ratios are met. It is also the Federal Reserve Board’s policy that bank holding companies should not maintain dividend levels that undermine their ability to serve as a source of strength to their banking subsidiaries.
The Company has no plans to pay dividends to its stockholders at this time.
Bank Regulation
The Bank is a FDIC-insured bank that is not a member of the Federal Reserve Board, and is subject to the supervision and regulation of the Oregon DFCS and the FDIC. These agencies may prohibit the Bank from engaging in what they believe constitute unsafe or unsound banking practices.
The Dodd-Frank Act 
The Dodd-Frank Act has resulted and continues to result in a major overhaul of the financial institution regulatory system. Among other things, the Dodd-Frank Act created the Financial Stability Oversight Council, which focuses on identifying, monitoring and addressing systemic risks in the financial system. In addition, branching restrictions were relaxed and national banks and state banks are able to establish branches in any state if that state would permit the establishment of the branch by a state bank chartered in that state. The Volcker Rule amended the BHC Act to generally prohibit banking entities from engaging in the short-term proprietary trading of securities and derivatives for their own account and bar them from having certain relationships with hedge funds or private equity funds. Included within the range of funds covered by the regulations are certain trust-preferred securities that back collateralized debt obligations. As the Company does not currently hold any of the prohibited investments, this aspect of the Volcker Rule has not had and is not expected to have any impact on the Company’s financial statements. In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act repealed the prohibition on paying interest on demand deposits, so that financial institutions are now allowed, but not required, to pay interest on demand deposits. The Dodd-Frank Act also includes provisions that, among other things, reorganize bank supervision and strengthen the authority of the Federal Reserve Board. 
The Dodd-Frank Act requires fees charged for debit card transactions to be both “reasonable and proportional” to the cost incurred by the card issuer. The maximum permissible interchange fee that an issuer may receive for an electronic debit transaction is $0.21 per transaction and 5 basis points multiplied by the value of the transaction. Any debit card issuer that has, along with its affiliates (i.e., any company that controls, is controlled by or is under common control with another company), fewer than $10 billion of assets will be exempt from the limit on interchange fees. The bank is starting to see some erosion of its debit card revenue on a per customer basis now that merchants can select more than one network for transaction routing.
Although the majority of the Dodd-Frank Act’s rulemaking requirements have been met with finalized rules, approximately one-fourth of the rulemaking requirements are either still in the proposal stage or have not yet been proposed. In addition, on February 3, 2017, President Donald J. Trump signed an executive order calling for the administration to review various U.S. financial laws and regulations. The full scope of President Trump's short-term legislative agenda is not yet fully known, but it may include certain deregulatory measures for the banking industry, including the structure and powers of the CFPB and other areas under the Dodd-Frank Act. Accordingly, it is difficult to anticipate the continued impact this expansive legislation will have on the Company, its customers and the financial industry generally.
Consumer Financial Protection Bureau 
The Dodd-Frank Act also created a new, independent federal agency called the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, or CFPB, which is granted broad rule-making, supervisory and enforcement powers under various federal consumer financial protection laws, including the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, Truth in Lending Act (“TILA”), Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act (“RESPA”), Fair Housing Act, Fair Credit Reporting Act, Fair Debt Collection Act, the Consumer Financial 
9

Privacy provisions of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act and certain other statutes. The CFPB has examination and primary enforcement authority with respect to depository institutions with more than $10 billion in assets as well as their affiliates. Depository institutions with $10 billion or less in assets, such as the Bank, are subject to rules promulgated by the CFPB, which may increase their compliance risk and the costs associated with their compliance efforts, but the banks will continue to be examined and supervised by federal banking regulators for consumer compliance purposes. The CFPB has authority to prevent unfair, deceptive or abusive practices in connection with the offering of consumer financial products. 
The CFPB has already finalized rules relating to remittance transfers under the Electronic Fund Transfer Act, which requires companies to provide consumers with certain disclosures before the consumer pays for a remittance transfer. In addition, on January 10, 2013, the CFPB released its final “Ability-to-Repay/Qualified Mortgage” rules, which amend TILA’s implementing regulation, Regulation Z. Regulation Z currently prohibits a creditor from making a higher-priced mortgage loan without regard to the consumer’s ability to repay the loan. The final rule implements sections 1411 and 1412 of the Dodd-Frank Act, which generally require creditors to make a reasonable, good faith determination of a consumer’s ability to repay any consumer credit transaction secured by a dwelling (excluding an open-end credit plan, timeshare plan, reverse mortgage, or temporary loan) and establishes certain protections from liability under this requirement for “qualified mortgages.” The final rule also implements section 1414 of the Dodd-Frank Act, which limits prepayment penalties. Finally, the final rule requires creditors to retain evidence of compliance with the rule for three years after a covered loan is consummated. This rule became effective January 10, 2014. The CFPB allowed for a small creditor exemption for banks with assets under $2 billion and that originate less than 500 mortgage loans in 2015. As of January 1, 2016, the small creditor exemption was extended to banks with assets under $2 billion and that originate less than 2,000 mortgage loans. 
On November 20, 2013, pursuant to section 1032(f) of the Dodd-Frank Act, the CFPB issued the Know Before You Owe TILA/RESPA Integrated Disclosure Rule (“TRID”), which combined the disclosures required under TILA and sections 4 and 5 of RESPA, into a single, integrated disclosure for mortgage loan transactions covered by those laws. TRID, which requires the use of a Loan Estimate that must be delivered or placed in the mail no later than the third business day after receiving the consumer’s application and a Closing Disclosure that must be provided to the consumer at least three business days prior to consummation, became effective for applications received on or after October 3, 2015 for applicable closed-end consumer credit transactions secured by real property. Creditors must only use the Loan Estimate and Closing Disclosure forms for mortgage loan transactions subject to TRID. All other mortgage loan transactions continue to use the Good Faith Estimate and the Initial Truth-in-Lending Disclosure at application and the HUD-1 Settlement Statement and the Final Truth-in-Lending Disclosure at closing. TRID also has new tolerance requirements and record retention requirements. Of note, the creditor must retain evidence of compliance with the Loan Estimate requirements, including providing the Loan Estimate, and the Closing Disclosure requirements for three years after the later of the date of consummation, the date disclosures are required to be made or the date the action is required to be taken. Additionally, the creditor must retain copies of the Closing Disclosure, including all documents related to the Closing Disclosure, for five years after consummation.
Although it is difficult to predict at this time the extent to which the CFPB’s final rules impact the operations and financial condition of the Bank, such rules may have a material impact on the Bank’s compliance costs, compliance risk and fee income.
Community Reinvestment Act
The CRA requires depository institutions to assist in meeting the credit needs of their market areas consistent with safe and sound banking practice. Under the CRA, each depository institution is required to help meet the credit needs of its market areas by, among other things, providing credit to low- and moderate-income individuals and communities. Depository institutions are periodically examined for compliance with the CRA and are assigned ratings. In order for a bank holding company to commence any new activity permitted by the BHC Act, or to acquire any company engaged in any new activity permitted by the BHC Act, each insured depository institution subsidiary of a bank holding company must have received a rating of at least “satisfactory” in its most recent examination under the CRA. Furthermore, banking regulators take into account CRA ratings when considering approval of a proposed transaction. The most recent CRA rating of the Bank is “satisfactory.” 
Safety and Soundness Standards
Under the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act each federal banking agency is required to prescribe, by regulation, non-capital safety and soundness standards for institutions under its authority. These standards are to cover internal controls, information systems, internal audit systems, loan documentation, credit underwriting, interest rate exposure, asset growth, compensation, fees and benefits, such other operational and managerial standards as the agency determines to be appropriate, and standards for asset quality, earnings and stock valuation. An institution which fails to meet these standards must develop a plan acceptable to the agency, specifying the steps that the institution will take to meet the standards. Failure to submit or implement such a plan may subject the institution to regulatory sanctions. The Company believes that the Bank meets substantially all the required standards that have been adopted.

Prompt Corrective Action 
The Federal Deposit Insurance Act, as amended (the “FDIA”), requires among other things, the federal banking agencies to take “prompt corrective action” in respect of depository institutions that do not meet minimum capital requirements. The FDIA sets forth the following five capital tiers: “well-capitalized,” “adequately capitalized,” “undercapitalized,” “significantly undercapitalized” and “critically undercapitalized.” A depository institution’s capital tier will depend upon how its capital levels compare with various relevant capital measures and certain other factors, as established by regulation. The relevant capital measures are the total capital ratio, the Tier 1 capital ratio and the leverage ratio.
As of December 31, 2016, a bank will be: (i) “well-capitalized” if the institution has a total risk-based capital ratio of 10.00% or greater, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 8.00% or greater, a CET1 risk-based capital ratio of 6.50% and a leverage ratio of 5.00% or greater, and is not subject to any order or written directive by any such regulatory authority to meet and maintain a specific capital level for any capital measure; (ii) “adequately capitalized” if the institution has a total risk-based capital ratio of 8.00% or greater, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6.00% or greater, CET1 risk-based capital ratio of 4.50% and a leverage ratio of 4.00% or greater and is not “well-capitalized;” (iii) “undercapitalized” if the institution has a total risk-based capital ratio that is less than 8.00%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 6.00%, a CET1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 4.50%, or a leverage ratio of less than 4.00%; (iv) “significantly undercapitalized” if the institution has a total risk-based capital ratio of less than 6.00%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 4.00%, a CET1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 3.00%, or a leverage ratio of less than 3.00%; and (v) “critically undercapitalized” if the institution’s tangible equity is equal to or less than 2.00% of average quarterly tangible assets. An institution may be downgraded to, or deemed to be in, a capital category that is lower than indicated by its capital ratios if it is determined to be in an unsafe or unsound condition or if it receives an unsatisfactory examination rating with respect to certain matters. A bank’s capital category is determined solely for the purpose of applying prompt corrective action regulations, and the capital category may not constitute an accurate representation of the bank’s overall financial condition or prospects for other purposes.
The FDIA generally prohibits a depository institution from making any capital distributions (including payment of a dividend) or paying any management fee to its bank holding company if the depository institution would thereafter be “undercapitalized.” “Undercapitalized” institutions are subject to growth limitations and are required to submit a capital restoration plan. The agencies may not accept such a plan without determining, among other things, that the plan is based on realistic assumptions and is likely to succeed in restoring the depository institution’s capital. In addition, for a capital restoration plan to be acceptable, the depository institution’s bank holding company must guarantee that the institution will comply with such capital restoration plan. The bank holding company must also provide appropriate assurances of performance. The aggregate liability of the bank holding company is limited to the lesser of: (i) an amount equal to 5.00% of the depository institution’s total assets at the time it became undercapitalized; and (ii) the amount which is necessary (or would have been necessary) to bring the institution into compliance with all capital standards applicable with respect to such institution as of the time it fails to comply with the plan. If a depository institution fails to submit an acceptable plan, it is treated as if it is “significantly undercapitalized.” 
“Significantly undercapitalized” depository institutions may be subject to a number of requirements and restrictions, including orders to sell sufficient voting stock to become “adequately capitalized,” requirements to reduce total assets, and cessation of receipt of deposits from correspondent banks. “Critically undercapitalized” institutions are subject to the appointment of a receiver or conservator. 
The appropriate federal banking agency may, under certain circumstances, reclassify a well-capitalized insured depository institution as adequately capitalized. The FDIA provides that an institution may be reclassified if the appropriate federal banking agency determines (after notice and opportunity for hearing) that the institution is in an unsafe or unsound condition or deems the institution to be engaging in an unsafe or unsound practice. 
The appropriate agency is also permitted to require an adequately capitalized or undercapitalized institution to comply with the supervisory provisions that would be applicable if the institution were in the next lower category (but not treat a significantly undercapitalized institution as critically undercapitalized) based on supervisory information other than the capital levels of the institution. 
At December 31, 2016, the Company and Bank met regulatory benchmarks for a “well-capitalized” designation. At that date, Bancorp’s Tier 1 leverage, Common equity Tier 1 capital, Tier 1 risk-based capital and total risk-based capital ratios were 8.60%, 10.53%, 10.53%, and 11.58%, respectively, and the Bank’s Tier 1 leverage, Common equity Tier 1 capital, Tier 1 risk-based capital and total risk-based capital ratios were 8.44%, 10.31%, 10.31%, and 11.36%, respectively. 
Dividends
Oregon banking laws impose certain limitations on the payment of dividends by Oregon state chartered banks. The amount of the dividend may not be greater than the Bank’s unreserved retained earnings, less, to the extent not already charged against earnings or reflected in a reserve, the following: (i) all bad debts, which are debts on which interest is past due and unpaid for at least six months, unless the debt is fully secured and in the process of collection; (ii) all other assets charged off as required by 
11

the Director of the Department of Consumer and Business Services or a state or federal examiner; and (iii) all accrued expenses, interest and taxes of the institution. During the fourth quarter of 2012, the Bank received regulatory approval to adjust retained earnings to zero at September 30, 2012. Since that date the retained earnings account has been replenished through positive earnings from the Bank.
Deposit Insurance 
Substantially all of the deposits of the Bank are insured up to applicable limits by the Deposit Insurance Fund, referred to as the DIF, of the FDIC and are subject to deposit insurance assessments to maintain the DIF. The maximum amount of deposit insurance for banks and savings institutions is $250,000 per depositor.
The amount of FDIC assessments paid by each DIF member institution is based on its relative risk of default as measured by regulatory capital ratios and other supervisory factors and is calculated based on an insured institution’s average consolidated assets less tangible equity capital, instead of being based on deposits.
For the purpose of determining an institution’s assessment rate, each institution is provided an assessment risk assignment, which is generally based on the risk that the institution presents to the DIF. Insured institutions with assets of less than $10.0 billion are placed in one of four risk categories. These risk categories are generally determined based on an institution’s capital levels and its supervisory evaluation. These institutions will generally have an assessment rate that can range from 2.5 to 45 basis points. However, the FDIC does have flexibility to adopt higher or lower assessment rates without additional rule-making provided that (i) no one such quarterly adjustment is in excess of 2 basis points; and (ii) the net cumulative adjustment cannot exceed 2 basis points. In the future, if the reserve ratio reaches certain levels, these assessment rates will generally be lowered. 
The minimum ratio of assets in the DIF to the total of estimated insured deposits is now 1.35%, and the FDIC has until September 30, 2020 to meet the reserve ratio.
All FDIC-insured institutions are also required to pay assessments to the FDIC to fund interest payments on bonds issued by the Financing Corporation, or FICO, an agency of the federal government established to recapitalize a predecessor to the DIF. These assessments, which are adjusted quarterly, will continue until the FICO bonds mature in 2017 through 2019. The annual FICO assessment rate for the first quarter of 2017 is 0.54 basis points.
Incentive Compensation
In June 2010, the Federal Reserve Board, Office of Comptroller of the Currency, and FDIC issued comprehensive final guidance on incentive compensation policies intended to ensure that the incentive compensation policies of banking organizations do not undermine the safety and soundness of such organizations by encouraging excessive risk-taking. The guidance, which covers all employees that have the ability to materially affect the risk profile of an organization, either individually or as part of a group, is based upon the key principles that a banking organization’s incentive compensation arrangements should (i) provide incentives that do not encourage risk-taking beyond the organization’s ability to effectively identify and manage risks; (ii) be compatible with effective internal controls and risk management; and (iii) be supported by strong corporate governance, including active and effective oversight by the organization’s board of directors. 
The Federal Reserve Board will review, as part of the regular, risk-focused examination process, the incentive compensation arrangements of banking organizations, such as the Company, that are not “large, complex banking organizations.” The findings of the supervisory initiatives will be included in reports of examination. Enforcement actions may be taken against a banking organization if its incentive compensation arrangements, or related risk-management control or governance processes, pose a risk to the organization’s safety and soundness and the organization is not taking prompt and effective measures to correct the deficiencies.
In addition, Section 956 of the Dodd-Frank Act required certain regulators (including the FDIC, SEC and Federal Reserve Board) to adopt requirements or guidelines prohibiting excessive compensation. In May 2016, the federal banking regulators, joined by the SEC, proposed such a rule that is tailored based on the asset size of the institution. All covered financial institutions would be subject to a prohibition on paying compensation, fees, and benefits that are “unreasonable” or “disproportionate” to the value of the services performed by a person covered by the proposed rule (generally, senior executive officers and employees who are significant risk-takers). Moreover, the proposed rule includes a new requirement which provides that an incentive-based compensation arrangement must (i) include financial and non-financial measures of performance, (ii) be designed to allow non-financial measures of performance to override financial measures of performance, when appropriate (so called safety and soundness factors), and (iii) be subject to adjustment to reflect actual losses, inappropriate risk taking, compliance deficiencies, or other measures or aspects of financial and non-financial performance.
The Dodd-Frank Act contains a number of provisions relating to compensation applying to public companies such as the Company. The Dodd-Frank Act added Section 14A(a) to the Exchange Act that requires companies to include a separate non-
12

binding resolution subject to stockholder vote in their proxy materials approving the executive compensation disclosed in the materials. In addition, Section 14A(b) to the Exchange Act requires any proxy or consent solicitation materials for a meeting seeking stockholder approval of an acquisition, merger, consolidation or disposition of all or substantially all of a company’s assets to include a separate non-binding stockholder resolution approving certain “golden parachute” payments made in connection with the transaction. Finally, Section 10D to the Exchange Act requires the SEC to direct the national securities exchanges to require companies to implement a policy to “claw back” certain executive payments that were made based on improper financial statements. 
UDAP and UDAAP
Recently, banking regulatory agencies have increasingly used a general consumer protection statute to address “unethical” or otherwise “bad” business practices that may not necessarily fall directly under the purview of a specific banking or consumer finance law. The law of choice for enforcement against such business practices has been Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act (the “FTC Act”), which is the primary federal law that prohibits unfair or deceptive acts or practices (“UDAP”), and unfair methods of competition in or affecting commerce. “Unjustified consumer injury” is the principal focus of the FTC Act. Prior to the Dodd-Frank Act, there was little formal guidance to provide insight to the parameters for compliance with UDAP laws and regulations. However, UDAP laws and regulations have been expanded under the Dodd-Frank Act to apply to “unfair, deceptive or abusive acts or practices,” (“UDAAP”), which have been delegated to the CFPB for supervision. The CFPB has published a Supervision and Examination Manual that addresses compliance with and the examination of UDAAP.
Financial Privacy and Technology Risk Management
The federal banking regulators adopted rules that limit the ability of banks and other financial institutions to disclose non-public information about consumers to nonaffiliated third parties. These limitations require disclosure of privacy policies to consumers and, subject to certain exceptions, allow consumers to prevent disclosure of certain personal information to a nonaffiliated third party. These regulations affect how consumer information is transmitted through diversified financial companies and conveyed to outside vendors. 
Bank Secrecy Act, Anti-Money Laundering and the USA Patriot Act 
The USA PATRIOT Act (the “USA Patriot Act”), substantially broadened the scope of United States anti-money laundering laws and regulations by imposing significant new compliance and due diligence obligations, creating new crimes and penalties and expanding the extra-territorial jurisdiction of the United States. The United States Treasury Department has issued and, in some cases, proposed a number of regulations that apply various requirements of the USA Patriot Act to financial institutions. These regulations impose obligations on financial institutions to maintain appropriate policies, procedures and programs to detect, prevent and report money laundering and terrorist financing and to verify the identity of their customers. These programs must, at a minimum, provide for a system of internal controls to assure ongoing compliance, provide for independent testing of such systems and compliance, designate individuals responsible for such compliance and provide appropriate personnel training. Moreover, certain of those regulations impose specific due diligence requirements on financial institutions that maintain correspondent or private banking relationships with non-U.S. financial institutions or persons. Specifically, the Bank Secrecy Act imposes an affirmative obligation on the Bank to report currency transactions that exceed certain thresholds and to report other transactions determined to be suspicious. In addition, on May 10, 2016, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network issued a final rule regarding customer due diligence requirements for covered financial institutions in connection with their Bank Secrecy Act and Anti-Money Laundering policies. The final rule adds a requirement to understand the nature and purpose of customer relationships and identify the “beneficial owner” of legal entity customers. The formal implementation date is May 11, 2018. Failure of a financial institution to maintain and implement adequate programs to combat money laundering and terrorist financing, or to comply with all of the relevant laws or regulations, could have serious legal and reputational consequences.
Restrictions on Transactions with Affiliates 
The Bank and any subsidiaries it may have are subject to certain restrictions under federal law on extensions of credit by, and certain other transactions with, Bancorp and any non-banking affiliates it may have. Section 23A of the Federal Reserve Act generally imposes limitations on, and requires collateral for, extensions of credit by an insured depository institution, such as the Bank, and its non-bank affiliates, such as Bancorp. The total amount of the above transactions is limited in amount, as to any one affiliate, to 10% of the Bank’s capital and surplus and, as to all affiliates combined, to 20% of its capital and surplus. In addition, Section 23B of the Federal Reserve Act requires that transactions between an insured depository institution and a non-bank affiliate must generally be on terms at least as favorable to the depository institution as transactions with a non-affiliate. Finally, the Bank is also subject to restrictions on extensions of credit to its executive officers, directors, principal stockholders and their related interests. These extensions of credit (1) must be made on substantially the same terms, including interest rates and collateral, as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with third parties and (2) must not involve more than the normal risk of repayment or present other unfavorable features. The Dodd-Frank Act expanded coverage 
13

of transactions with insiders by including credit exposure arising from derivative transactions (which are also covered by the expansion of Section 23A). The Dodd-Frank Act prohibits an insured depository institution from purchasing or selling an asset to an executive officer, director, or principal shareholder (or any related interest of such a person) unless the transaction is on market terms, and, if the transaction exceeds 10% of the institution’s capital, it is approved in advance by a majority of the disinterested directors. The Bank is also subject to certain lending limits and restrictions on overdrafts to such persons. A violation of these restrictions may result in the assessment of substantial civil monetary penalties on the Bank or any officer, director, employee, agent or other person participating in the conduct of the affairs of the Bank, the imposition of a regulatory order and other regulatory sanctions.
Reserve Requirements 
The Bank is subject to Federal Reserve Board regulations under which depository institutions may be required to maintain non-interest-earning reserves against their deposit accounts and certain other liabilities. Currently, reserves must be maintained against transaction accounts (primarily NOW accounts and checking accounts). The regulations generally require that for 2017 reserves be maintained in the amount of 3.0% of the aggregate of transaction accounts over $15.5 million up to $115.1 million. Net transaction accounts up to $15.5 million are exempt from reserve requirements. The amount of aggregate transaction accounts in excess of $115.1 million is subject to a reserve ratio of 10.0%. The amounts of transaction accounts subject to the various reserve ratios are generally adjusted by the Federal Reserve Board annually. During 2016 and 2015, the Bank was in compliance with the requirements described above. 
Risk Retention 
The Dodd-Frank Act requires that, subject to certain exemptions, sponsors of mortgage- and other asset-backed securities retain not less than 5% of the credit risk of the related mortgage loans or other assets. On November 19, 2014, the federal banking regulators, together with the SEC, the Federal Housing Finance Agency and the Department of Housing and Urban Development, issued a final rule implementing this requirement. Generally, the final rule provides various ways in which the retention of risk requirement can be satisfied and also describe exemptions from the retention requirements for various types of assets, including mortgage loans. 
Consumer Protection Laws and Regulations 
The Bank and its affiliates are subject to a broad array of federal and state consumer protection laws and regulations that govern almost every aspect of their business relationships with consumers. These include the Truth in Lending Act, the Truth in Savings Act, the Electronic Fund Transfer Act, the Expedited Funds Availability Act, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Housing Act, the SAFE Act, the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, the FHA, the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, the Fair Credit Reporting Act, the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, the Service Members’ Civil Relief Act, the Right to Financial Privacy Act, the Home Ownership and Equity Protection Act, the Consumer Leasing Act, the Fair Credit Billing Act, the Homeowners Protection Act, the Check Clearing for the 21st Century Act, laws governing flood insurance, laws governing consumer protections in connection with the sale of insurance, federal and state laws prohibiting unfair, deceptive and abusive business practices, foreclosure laws and various regulations that implement some or all of the foregoing. These laws and regulations mandate certain disclosure requirements and regulate the manner in which financial institutions must deal with customers when taking deposits, making loans, collecting loans and providing other services. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations can subject the Bank to various penalties, including, but not limited to, enforcement actions, injunctions, fines, civil liability, criminal penalties, punitive damages and the loss of certain contractual rights. The Bank is currently operating with real estate loan portfolios within the parameters of such guidance.
Concentrated Commercial Real Estate Lending Regulations 
The federal banking regulatory agencies have promulgated guidance governing financial institutions with concentrations in commercial real estate lending, such guidance being recently supplemented as of December 18, 2015. The guidance provides that a bank has a concentration in commercial real estate lending if (1) total reported loans for acquisition, construction, land development, and other land represent 100.0% or more of total capital or (2) total reported loans secured by multifamily and nonfarm residential properties and loans for acquisition, construction, land development, and other land represent 300.0% or more of total capital and the bank’s commercial real estate loan portfolio has increased 50% or more during the prior 36 months. Owner occupied loans are excluded from this second category. If a concentration is present, management must employ heightened risk management practices that address, among other things, Board and management oversight and strategic planning, portfolio management, development of underwriting standards, risk assessment and monitoring through market analysis and stress testing, and maintenance of increased capital levels as needed to support the level of commercial real estate lending. The Bank is currently operating with real estate loan portfolios within such percentage levels.
Office of Foreign Assets Control Regulation 
The United States has imposed economic sanctions that affect transactions with designated foreign countries, nationals and others. The sanctions, which are administered by the U.S. Treasury Department Office of Foreign Assets Control (“OFAC”), 
14

targeting countries take many different forms. Generally, however, they contain one or more of the following elements: (i) restrictions on trade with or investment in a sanctioned country, including prohibitions against direct or indirect imports from and exports to a sanctioned country and prohibitions on “U.S. persons” engaging in financial transactions relating to making investments in, or providing investment-related advice or assistance to, a sanctioned country; and (ii) blocking of assets in which the government or specially designated nationals of the sanctioned country have an interest, by prohibiting transfers of property subject to U.S. jurisdiction (including property in the possession or control of U.S. persons). Blocked assets (e.g., property and bank deposits) cannot be paid out, withdrawn, set off or transferred in any manner without a license from OFAC. Failure to comply with these sanctions could have serious legal and reputational consequences. 
Other Legislative and Regulatory Initiatives
In addition to the specific proposals described above, from time to time, various legislative and regulatory initiatives are introduced in Congress and state legislatures, as well as by regulatory agencies. Such initiatives may include proposals to expand or contract the powers of bank holding companies and depository institutions or proposals to substantially change the financial institution regulatory system. Such legislation could change banking statutes and the operating environment of the Company in substantial and unpredictable ways. If enacted, such legislation could increase or decrease the cost of doing business, limit or expand permissible activities or affect the competitive balance among banks, savings associations, credit unions, and other financial institutions. The Company cannot predict whether any such legislation will be enacted, and, if enacted, the effect that it, or any implementing regulations, would have on the financial condition or results of operations of the Company. A change in statutes, regulations or regulatory policies applicable to Bancorp or the Bank could have a material effect on the business of the Company.
