Our Current Business
 
We are an early stage company and have limited business operations and nominal revenues.
 
We operate a landscape design and construction business that specializes in green, water conserving products and services. Our company offers customers in the greater Los Angeles area the option to convert their current water-consuming gardens into attractive alternative layouts that require a fraction of the water needed to sustain a traditional lawn. Our company specializes in faux grass (artificial lawns), desert-oriented plants and grasses that are misers on water, as well as naturally-sourced landscaping stones, enclosed fencing, and other construction materials.
 
To date, our activities have been limited to determining our material supply channels, commencing initial projects, branding efforts, and the raising of capital.
 
Principal Products, Services and Their Markets
 
Our company provides comprehensive landscaping services centered on the fundamental promotion of water conservation through 'green' gardening practices in the greater Los Angeles area. California is currently coming out of an unprecedented 4-year drought, and in fact, one of the worst periods of drought in the state's recorded history. In summer, the temperatures in the Greater Los Angeles area and surrounding valleys consistently soar to record-high levels, and the supporting water reservoirs, while greatly replenished over the past 2016-2017 winter, reached critically low levels prior. Traditionally, Southern California relies on the rainy season from December to April to replenish reservoirs that are used for everything from vital agricultural irrigation and drinking water, to manufacturing industries and household use, which includes a large proportion for lawn and garden watering. Historically, the moisture-heavy winter storms that rolled in over the Sierra Nevada mountains deposited large alpine snow packs that subsequently melted in spring months to supply up to 30% of the state's water requirements. Now, while it appears that the winter of 2016-2017 has supplied some relief in the form of El Nina induced storms, 2015 saw the existing snow pack at its second-lowest level on record. Hence, while it can be surmised that the immediate California water crisis is over, it does not mean that the larger need to conserve CA water is gone. On the contrary, the California government recognizes that this is a long-term need.

The motivation for our company came in part from the desire to help address California's drought crisis by providing individuals with the ability to choose sustainable water-saving landscape alternatives. Our sustainable garden solutions not only offer an array of options for groundcover and plant materials, but select species that are naturally more indigenous to the arid environment and flourish in such climates. The idea of a "desert oasis," planting high water-demand plants in an arid setting is no longer realistic from an environmental or economic perspective. Through selecting beautiful low-demand plant material, alongside natural stone surfaces, dramatic landscape settings can be created to conserve both water and money year after year.
 
For individuals seeking to maintain a more traditional appearance of their gardens with the juxtaposition of grass in this emerging desert landscape, our company has specifically targeted the use of ultra-realistic faux grass to supplant the use of real grass for 'lawnscapes'. The technology of faux grass has made significant strides in quality, aesthetic, and price over recent years. Older versions of faux grass, or artificial turf as it was more commonly called, often lacked the look and feel of real grass, were prone to fading and wear, and were in some cases hazardous in its construction - containing unwanted elements such as lead. Previous generations of faux grass simply could not match the beauty of a real, lush lawn, however, this is no longer the case. Faux grass is now a well-constructed, durable, safe, and viable alternative to real grass, with remarkable visual similarities to real grass. Faux grass lawns are purposely built, determining density and height of grass 'blades' based on needs of residential and commercial uses. From pet ownership to recreational playing fields, these made in the USA solutions are readily available and highly customizable.
 
Our company has undertaken initial projects and is in a state of refining its processes and procedures. It also recognized the need to include outdoor fencing as part of its list of services. The demand of customers wishing to enclose their newly installed landscaping has increase significantly. Our company does all of the project construction, and ensures that each element is properly designed and installed. We also warranty all of our work.
 
The market for our services is currently strong and growing, and select local government programs are available to help customers subsidize the cost of their projects. Our company provides full service care for residential and commercial properties, from initial landscape design, to hard and soft materials selection, plant or synthetic groundcovers, as well as installation. As water conservation emerges in the consciousness of the consumer, our company is positioned to be a leading resource for innovation in this field.
 
Our company’s initial market test in the South Bay area of Los Angeles has gone well, and we are looking to expand our customer base into areas such as Glendale and Burbank, California The company is also looking to expand its internet marketing efforts in the first 3 months of 2018.
 
Distribution Methods
 
Potential customers find our company primarily through an on-line campaign that leverages our website (http://www.go2greenlandscaping.com). On-line ads and marketing platforms, such as Google Adwords, will be employed in our initial 2018 campaign. It is also hoped that as our marketing is fully launched and customers start to enjoy our services, a solid referral network will be created. Our company will also take out strategic ads and place coupons in local home flyers and home and garden publications.
Status of Publicly Announced New Products or Services
 
Our company has no new publicly announced products or services.
 
Competitive Business Conditions and Strategy; the Company's Position in the Industry
 
Our company will compete with other local faux grass and landscape installation companies. Established companies such as AGI (Artificial Grass Inc.) and "Fass" Fake Grass, among others, are well established in the Greater Los Angeles market and produce quality work. We will be in direct competition with these firms, but are attempting to create our own niche in this rapidly expanding market. What sets our company apart is that we provide an all-encompassing water conservation and landscape solution. Our company approaches each customer and looks at their lawn, garden and landscaping needs in their totality.

We are able to assess all aspects of a customer's landscaping needs, from the installation of faux grass, to the determining of proper plants and foliage, to the shipping and installation of landscape construction materials. Rather than simply being only a turf installer, we will provide complete landscaping solutions that aesthetically blend all of the elements together to create water conserving function, with eye-pleasing form. Everything will be geared to bringing water usage to an absolute minimum, but do it in a way that exceeds our customer's expectations and almost masks the underlying purpose with the sheer beauty of the finished product.
 
Our company is also positioned to act as a go to educational resource that provides do-it-yourself information for customers that are both inclined to research and undertake projects on their own. In 2018, we will provide project information and ideas that will be available for download from our website. We will also provide key details on government incentives that can significantly reduce the cost of a project, as well as long-term cost savings.
 
Talent Sources and Names of Principal Suppliers
 
The key to our success is determined by the quality of our leadership and the degree to which we excel in at customer service. Tom Toth is a local Los Angeles contractor, who has built a number of successful construction businesses. Mr. Toth currently owns Pacific Vinyl Fences, which installs durable fencing, deck and patio covers. Mr. Toth, in operating his current business, was requested by existing customers to provide information about faux grass and ecological landscaping.
 
Mr. Toth has also done a considerable amount of practical research and has identified local garden centers that can provide low water consumption plants and greenery, as well as local wholesalers of faux grass that is 100% American made and of high quality. Also, through Mr. Toth's network of construction industry contacts, a reliable source of landscaping materials has been identified.
 
Our company is also in the process of acquiring the services of a landscape designer that can render 3-D designs and graphic illustrations. The main goal being to supply a seamless customer experience from the first estimate through to the design and construction phases.
 
Our company also has the services of John Scavo. Mr. Scavo is an established Los Angeles based entrepreneur. Mr. Scavo has founded a number of successful companies, and he currently specializes in supplying high quality catering for the motion picture business. He devotes his marketing and sales expertise to our company and has built a comprehensive marketing strategy that will connect our company with our targeted upper-tier demographic. Mr. Scavo also realized the tertiary benefit of our company, in that every gallon of water saved domestically can help go to the irrigation of sustainable and natural crops (food stuffs).
