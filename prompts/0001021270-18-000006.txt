 Summary of Business Results and Plans
 Famous Dave’s of America, Inc. (“Famous Dave’s”, the “Company,” “we,” “us” or “our”) was incorporated as a Minnesota corporation in March 1994 and opened its first restaurant in Minneapolis, Minnesota in June 1995. The following table summarizes the changes in the number of Company-owned and franchise-operated restaurants for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2017 and January 1, 2017:

  As of December 31, 2017, Famous Dave’s restaurants operated in 32 states, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, Canada, and the United Arab Emirates. An additional 61 franchise restaurants were committed to be developed through signed area development agreements at December 31, 2017. Throughout fiscal 2017, we closed 13 underperforming Company-owned restaurants and our franchisees closed an additional 15 restaurants.
 During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, we refranchised eight Company-owned restaurants located at Columbia, Maryland, Frederick, Maryland, Laurel, Maryland, Waldorf, Maryland, Alexandria, Virginia, Chantilly, Virginia, Oakton, Virginia and Woodbridge, Virginia. During the first quarter of fiscal 2016, we refranchised seven Company-owned restaurants in the Chicago area located at Addison, Algonquin, Bolingbrook, Evergreen Park, North Riverside, Orland Park and Oswego, Illinois. As a result of these transactions, we have classified the operating results of these restaurants as discontinued operations for all years reported and have excluded them from the results of continuing operations.

 In fiscal 2017, we rolled out several initiatives aimed at increasing sales and traffic and reducing costs in our restaurants and support center. We revitalized our beverage menu and rolled out delivery programs via third-party delivery services. The beverage menu has been implemented at all of our Company-owned restaurants that serve alcohol and most of our franchise operated restaurants that serve alcohol. The delivery program is in various stages of implementation within our participating system-wide restaurants that are served by delivery service providers. As it relates to costs in our restaurants, we implemented programs aimed at reducing food waste and optimizing labor through the use of technology and training. We are also working to simplify our back of house operations to drive efficiencies in our restaurants. Additionally, in fiscal 2017, we took certain steps to realign our general and administrative expense structure. See Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis for more information.
 In fiscal 2018, as well as continuing to execute on the actions that we took in fiscal 2017, we intend to revitalize and streamline the core Famous Dave’s concept, and develop and test new BBQ concepts with attractive unit economics. We also expect to continue to leverage technology to increase operational efficiencies, facilitate more frequent training, and utilize consumer data to expand our base of loyal guests (“Guests”).
 Throughout this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we refer to certain metrics of our franchise-operated restaurants; however, franchise-operated restaurants are not owned by us and therefore are not included in our consolidated results of operations and financial position. We believe that disclosure of certain information related to franchise-operated restaurants provides useful information to investors as the performance of franchise-operated restaurants directly impacts royalty and other revenues that we receive from our franchisees and has an impact on the perceived success and value of the Famous Dave’s brand.
 Financial Information about Segments
 Since its inception, our revenue, operating income and assets have been attributable to the single industry segment of the foodservice industry. Our revenue and operating results for each of the last two fiscal years, and our assets for each of the last two fiscal years, are disclosed in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data to this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Narrative Description of Business
 Famous Dave’s restaurants, a majority of which offer full table service, feature wood-smoked and off-the-grill entrée favorites that fit into the broadly defined barbeque category. We seek to differentiate ourselves by providing high-quality food in distinctive and comfortable environments with signature décor and signage. As of December 31, 2017, 11 of our Company-owned restaurants were full-service and five were counter-service. Generally, our prototypical design includes a designated bar, a signature exterior smokestack, a separate entrance for our To Go business and a patio (where available). We have designs that can be adapted to fit various location sizes and desired service styles such as full-service or counter-service.
 In fiscal 2017, our franchisees opened two restaurants in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates and Green Bay, Wisconsin. In fiscal 2016, four franchise openings were a mixture of conversions of existing full-service casual dining restaurants to our concept as well as new construction, including two restaurants opened in the United Arab Emirates. In Fiscal 2018, we may look to incentivize our franchisees to open additional restaurants, either traditional Famous Dave’s restaurants or our to-be-announced new concept. We offer conversion packages that provide our franchisees with the flexibility to convert existing restaurants as well as existing retail footprints into a Famous Dave’s restaurant. Due to the flexibility and scalability of our concept, we believe that there are a variety of development opportunities available now and in the future.

 We pride ourselves on the following:
 High Quality Food – Each restaurant features a distinctive selection of authentic hickory-smoked and off-the-grill barbecue favorites, such as flame-grilled St. Louis-style and baby back ribs, Texas beef brisket, Georgia chopped pork, country-roasted chicken, and signature sandwiches and salads. Also, enticing side items, such as corn bread, potato salad, coleslaw and Wilbur BeansTM, accompany the broad entrée selection. Homemade desserts, including Famous Dave’s Bread Pudding and Hot Fudge Kahlua Brownies, are another specialty. To complement our entrée and appetizer items and to suit different customer tastes, we offer six regional barbeque sauces: Rich & Sassy®, Texas PitTM, Georgia MustardTM, Devil’s Spit®, Sweet and ZestyTM and Wilbur’s RevengeTM. These sauces, in addition to a variety of seasonings, rubs, marinades, and other items are also distributed in retail grocery stores throughout the country under licensing agreements.
 We believe that high quality food, a menu that is over 85% “scratch cooking” and the fact that we smoke our meats daily at each of our restaurants are principal points of differentiation between us and other casual dining competitors and are a significant contributing factor to repeat business. We also feel that our focus on barbecue being a noun, a verb and a culture allows for product innovation without diluting our brand. As a noun, barbeque refers to the art of the smoke and sauce. As a verb, barbeque refers to the act of grilling. As a culture, barbeque refers to the competitive spirit. As a result, we see few geographic impediments to scaling our concept and brand.
 Focus on Guest Experience – We believe that a renewed focus on enhancing our Guests’ experience and listening to their feedback is an essential pillar of the Company. In fiscal 2018, we will continue to test and further enhance our Guests’ experience by focusing on hospitality, food execution and training. We believe a positive Guest experience, combined with our high-quality food, makes Famous Dave’s appealing to families, children, teenagers and adults of all ages and socio-economic and demographic backgrounds.
 Distinctive Environment - Décor and Music – Our original décor theme was a nostalgic roadhouse shack (“Original Shack”), as defined by the abundant use of rustic antiques and items of Americana. This format was used for both full-service and counter-service restaurant formats. In late 1997, we introduced the “Lodge” format which featured décor reminiscent of a comfortable “Northwoods” hunting lodge with a full-service dining room and small bar. In addition, we developed a larger “Blues Club” format that featured authentic Chicago Blues Club décor and live music seven nights a week. We have evolved our format to that of a full-service concept with several “prototypical” designs that incorporate the best attributes of the past restaurants while providing a consistent brand image.
 Operating Strategy
 We believe that our ability to achieve sustainable profitable growth is dependent upon us delivering high-quality experiences in terms of both food and hospitality to every Guest, every day, and to enhance brand awareness in our markets. Key elements of our strategy include the following:
 Operational Excellence – During fiscal 2017, we continued to focus on operational excellence and integrity, and on creating a consistently enjoyable Guest experience, both in terms of food and hospitality, across our system. We define operational excellence as also meaning an unyielding commitment to superior service for our Guests during every visit.  In our restaurants, we strive to emphasize value and speed of service by employing a streamlined operating system based on a focused menu and simplified food preparation techniques while remaining true to authentic barbeque. Operational excellence is also an uncompromising attention to the details of our recipes, preparation and cooking procedures, handling procedures, rotation, sanitation, cleanliness and safety.
 Our menu focuses on a number of popular smoked, barbequed, grilled meats, entrée items and delicious side dishes which are prepared using easy-to-operate kitchen equipment and processes that use proprietary seasonings, sauces and mixes. This streamlined food preparation system helps manage the cost of operation by requiring fewer staff, lowering training costs, and eliminating the need for highly compensated chefs. Additionally, barbeque has the ability to be batch cooked and held, which enables our award winning food to get to our Guests quickly, whether in the restaurant, at their homes, or at a catering event. In order to enhance our appeal, expand our audience, increase frequency, and feature our cravable products, we have assembled a research and development product pipeline designed to generate new, delicious and exciting menu items that allow us to regularly update our menu.

 Human Resources and Training/Development - A key ingredient to our success lies with our ability to hire, train, engage and retain employees at all levels of our organization. We place a great deal of importance on creating an exceptional working environment for all of our employees. Through our Human Resource and Training/Development resources, tools and programs, we continually enhance and support superior performance within our restaurants and Support Center. Our foundational guiding principle is doing the right thing for the organization and our Guests while ensuring we have the right people in the right roles with the right resources and tools.
 We are a performance-based organization, committed to recognizing and rewarding performance at all levels of the organization. Our performance management process includes performance calibration at the organizational level as a means of providing measurable, comparative employee evaluations relative to peer contribution, taking into account specific core competencies and goals. It is designed to provide a complete picture of performance that is consistent across the organization. We offer a total rewards program that is benchmarked closely against the industry and includes health and welfare coverage, 401(k) and non-qualified deferred compensation with a company match, base pay and incentive pay programs developed to sustain our market competitive position. Our Human Resource and Training organization focuses on the selection and retention of talent through programs in overall workforce planning, performance management, development, safety and risk reduction, and continued enhancements in our organizational structures for all positions in the business.
 In the Training and Development arena, we offer a variety of ongoing on-the-job and classroom training programs for the operations teams (hourly employees, Restaurant Managers, and Multi-Unit Managers) in an effort to create defined career paths. Our Management Trainee program provides new restaurant managers a foundational based training for restaurant operations, including ServSafe Food and Alcohol Certification, and several learning sessions focused on the basic behaviors and skills of a Famous Dave’s Manager. We also offer a Famous Dave’s Leadership Series program which provides a library of workshop offerings focused on building and strengthening core skills in the areas of communication, teamwork, coaching, change management and performance management. In addition, we have incorporated e-learning training tasks, skills and processes on-demand.
 Restaurant Operations
 Our ability to manage multiple restaurants in geographically diverse locations is central to our overall success. In each market, we place specific emphasis on the position of General Manager, and seek talented individuals that bring a diverse set of skills, knowledge, and experience to the Company. We strive to maintain quality and consistency in each of our restaurants through the careful training and supervision of employees and the establishment of, and adherence to, high standards relating to performance, food and beverage preparation, and maintenance of facilities.
 All Managers must complete an eight-week training program, during which they are instructed in areas such as food quality and preparation, customer service, hospitality, and employee relations. We have prepared operations manuals relating to food and beverage quality and service standards. New employees participate in training under the close supervision of our Management. We have a Director of Company Operations who is responsible for overseeing all Company-owned restaurants. This individual works closely with the General Managers to support day-to-day restaurant operations. In addition, the Director of Company Operations assists in the professional development of our General Managers and is also instrumental in driving our vision of operational integrity and contributing to the improvement of results achieved at our restaurants, including building sales, developing personnel and growing profits. The Director of Company Operations reports directly to our Chief Operating Officer.
 Off-Premise Occasions - Focus on Convenience
 In addition to our lively and entertaining dine-in experience, we provide our Guests with maximum convenience by offering an expedient take-out service along with catering and delivery. We believe that Famous Dave’s entrées and side dishes are viewed by Guests as traditional American "picnic foods" that maintain their quality and travel particularly well, making them an attractive choice to replace a home-cooked meal. Also, the high quality, fair prices and avoidance of preparation time make take-out of our product particularly attractive. Our off-premise sales provide us with revenue opportunities beyond our in-house seating capacity and we continue to seek ways to leverage these segments of our business. We see catering and delivery as a tremendous opportunity for new consumers to sample our product who would not otherwise have had the opportunity to visit our restaurants. Each restaurant has a dedicated vehicle to support our catering initiatives and many restaurants are served by multiple third-party delivery providers.

 Our restaurants have been designed specifically to accommodate a significant level of To Go sales, including a separate To Go entrance with prominent and distinct signage, and for added convenience, we separately staff the To Go counter. To further enhance To Go sales, we offer our Guest the ability to order online to improve convenience. We believe our focus on To Go enables Famous Dave’s to capture a greater portion of the “take-out” market by allowing consumers to “trade within our brand,” when dining in is not always an option. We pursue efforts to increase awareness of To Go in all Company-owned and franchise-operated restaurants by featuring signage and merchandising both inside and outside the restaurants.
 Guest Satisfaction – We believe that we achieve a significant level of repeat business by providing high-quality food, efficient friendly service, and warm caring hospitality in an entertaining environment at moderate prices. We strive to maintain quality and consistency in each of our restaurants through the purposeful hiring, training and supervision of personnel and the establishment of, and adherence to, high standards of performance, food preparation and facility maintenance. We have also built family-friendly strategies into each restaurant’s food, service and design by providing children’s menus, smaller-sized entrees at reduced prices and changing tables in restrooms.
 Value Proposition and Guest Frequency – We offer high quality food and a distinctive atmosphere at competitive prices to encourage frequent patronage. Lunch and dinner entrees range from $6.99 to $26.99, resulting in a per person dine-in and To Go average of $14.99 during fiscal 2017. During fiscal 2017, per person average tickets for lunch averaged $13.01 and per person average ticket for dinner averaged $16.98. We intend to use value priced offerings, new product introductions, and the convenience of connecting with Guests on their own terms, to drive new and infrequent Guests into our restaurants for additional meal occasions.
 Marketing, Promotion and Sales
 We believe that by specializing in unique and distinctive smoked meats, poultry & fish, our menu specialty helps set the brand apart from the rest of the crowded field in casual dining. To further develop the advertising and promotional materials and programs designed to create brand awareness and increase the reach of the brand, we have a system-wide marketing fund. All Company-owned restaurants, and those franchise-operated restaurants with agreements signed after December 17, 2003 are generally required to contribute 1.0% of net sales to this fund, which substantially funds the marketing and digital teams. In fiscal 2017, the Marketing Ad Fund contribution for contributing franchisees was 1.0% of net sales and will continue to be so in fiscal 2018.
 The marketing team, working with outside agencies and other resources, is responsible for the advertising, promotion, creative development, and branding for Famous Dave’s. Franchise-operated restaurants place the advertising and marketing programs in their local markets based on contractual requirements. Famous Dave’s uses industry standard marketing efforts that include brand and graphic design, broadcast media, digital, online & social media platforms, public relations and out-of-home vehicles.
 The strategic focus for marketing and promotion is to ensure that Famous Dave’s is recognized as the category–defining brand in BBQ, to create and sustain attractive differentiation in consumer’s mind, and to continue to strengthen the brand’s positioning and consistency. To help drive top-line sales, we have implemented a Guest research driven innovation process to create our rolling 12‑month marketing calendar with specific strategic goals. Additionally, a number of new initiatives were planned around enhancing the menu, the Guest experience, events marketing and social media.
 In 2017, we highlighted value and affordability in our menu along with promoting additional value offerings through limited time offer’s and day of the week offerings such as “Smokin’ Deals.” We also continued to promote our To Go and Catering offering while rolling out delivery on a large-scale basis. This has allowed us to connect with Guests on their terms and offer unique and often compelling sources of growth, and each occasion is growing at a different rate. Leveraging this occasions matrix, we are uniquely poised to offer more immediate relevancy and sales opportunities by solving the Guest’s daily dinner dilemma and address these differences in our marketing, including menu, promotional outreach, pricing, and new product news.

 Location Strategy
 We believe that the barbeque segment of the casual dining niche of the restaurant industry continues to offer strong growth opportunities, and we see few impediments to our growth on a geographical basis. Our geographical concentration, as of December 31, 2017, was 43% Midwest, 5% Middle Atlantic, 9% South, 30% West, 8% Northeast and 5% International.
 We prepare an overall market development strategy for each market. The creation of this market strategy starts with identifying trade areas that align demographically with the target Guest profile. The identified trade areas are then assessed for viability and vitality and prioritized as initial, second tier, or future development. Since markets are dynamic, the market strategy includes a continual and ongoing assessment of all existing restaurant locations. If financially feasible, a restaurant may be relocated as the retail or residential focus in a trade area shifts.
 As part of our development strategy, we have engaged design firms to redesign and reimage the traditional full-service prototype. These firms have assisted in developing plans for future service style models such as an updated counter-service, line-service and hybrid flex-service models. The future service-style models will allow us to access new markets or strategically locate restaurants in existing markets where a full-service restaurant is unlikely to be financially viable. The surrounding trade area will determine which service style is appropriate. Site selection will focus on newly developed green-field retail developments or existing retail projects being re-developed.  Conversion opportunities will be considered on a case by case basis. We intend to finance company restaurant development through the use of cash on hand, cash flow generated from operations, through availability on our revolving line of credit and a rights offering that we expect to commence subsequent to the filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
 We expect to continue to grow our franchise program. Our goal is to continue to improve the economics of our current restaurant prototypes, while providing more cost-effective development options for our franchisees. Our franchise system is a significant part of our brand’s success. As such, another one of our goals is to be a valued franchisor; to enhance communication and recognition of best practices throughout the system and to continue to expand our franchisee network here and outside of the United States.
 Purchasing
 To provide the freshest ingredients and in order to maximize operational efficiencies for our food products, we strive to obtain consistent quality items at competitive prices from reliable sources, including identifying secondary suppliers for many of our key products. Additionally, our secondary suppliers help us assure supply chain integrity and better logistics. Finally, to reduce freight costs, we continually aim to optimize our distribution networks, where the products are shipped directly to the restaurants through our foodservice distributors. Each restaurant’s management team determines the daily quantities of food items needed and orders such quantities to be delivered to their restaurant.
 Approximately 85% of our food and non-alcoholic beverage purchases are on contract, with the majority being proteins. Pork represents approximately 32% of our total purchases, while beef, which includes hamburger and brisket, is approximately 13%, chicken is approximately 13%, and seafood is approximately 2%.
 Our purchasing team is also responsible for managing the procurement of non-food items for our restaurants, including restaurant equipment, small wares and restaurant supplies. Also, they contract many of our restaurants repair and maintenance services along with managing our utility costs.
 Information Technology
 We recognize the importance of leveraging information and technology to support and extend our competitive position in the restaurant industry. We continue to invest in capabilities that provide secure and efficient operations, maximize the Guest experience, and provide the ability to analyze data that describes our operations.

 We have implemented a suite of restaurant and general headquarter systems which support operations by providing transactional functions (ordering, card processing, etc.) and reporting at both the unit and support center level. Interfaces between Point-of-Sale (POS), labor management, inventory management, menu management, key suppliers, and employee screening/hiring and financial systems all contribute to the following operator and corporate visibility:

· | Average Guest check broken down by location, by server, by day part, and by revenue center;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Daily reports of revenue and labor (both current and forecasted);
--+------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Monthly reporting of detailed revenue and expenses; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------


· | Ideal vs. actual usage variance reporting for critical restaurant-level materials.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Trademarks
 Our Company has registered various trademarks, makes use of various unregistered marks, and intends to vigorously defend these marks. “Famous Dave’s” and the Famous Dave’s logo are registered trademarks of Famous Dave’s of America, Inc. The Company highly values its trademarks, trade names and service marks and will defend against any improper use of its marks to the fullest extent allowable by law. Franchise Program
 We are revising our franchise disclosure document and expect to be authorized to offer and sell franchises in all states by the end of the first quarter. Our growth and success depends in part upon our ability to attract, contract with and retain qualified franchisees. It also depends upon the ability of those franchisees to successfully operate their restaurants with our standards of quality and promote and develop Famous Dave’s brand awareness.
 Although we have established criteria to evaluate prospective franchisees, and our franchise agreements include certain operating standards, each franchisee operates his/her restaurants independently. Various laws limit our ability to influence the day-to-day operation of our franchise restaurants. We cannot assure you that franchisees will be able to successfully operate Famous Dave’s restaurants in a manner consistent with our standards for operational excellence, service and food quality.

 Our Franchise Operations Department is led by our Chief Operating Officer, who guides the efforts of five Franchise Business Consultants. The Franchise Business Consultants have the responsibility of supporting our franchisees throughout the system and play a critical role for us as well as for our franchise community. The Franchise Business Consultants manage the relationship between us and our franchisees and provides an understanding of the roles, responsibilities, differences, and accountabilities of that relationship. They are active participants towards enhancing performance, as they partner in strategic and operations planning sessions with our franchise partners and review the individual strategies and tactics for obtaining superior performance for the franchisee. They ensure compliance with obligations under our area development and franchise agreements. Franchisees are encouraged to utilize all available assistance from the Franchise Business Consultants and the Support Center but are not required to do so.
 We have a comprehensive operations scorecard and training tool that helps us measure the operational effectiveness of our Company-owned and franchise-operated restaurants. This scorecard is used to evaluate, monitor and improve operations in areas such as Guest satisfaction, health and safety standards, community involvement, and local store marketing effectiveness, among other operating metrics. Also, we generally provide support as it relates to all aspects of franchise operations including, but not limited to, store openings and operating performance. Finally, we solicit feedback from our franchise system by having an active dialogue with all franchisees throughout the year.
 The franchisee’s investment depends primarily upon restaurant size. This investment includes the area development fee, initial franchise fee, real estate and leasehold improvements, fixtures and equipment, POS systems, business licenses, deposits, initial food inventory, small wares, décor and training fees as well as working capital. In fiscal 2017, certain of our franchisees were required to contribute 1.0% of net sales to a marketing fund dedicated to providing digital and creative services. Currently, franchisees are required to spend approximately 1.5% of their net sales annually on local marketing activities.
 Seasonality
 Our restaurants typically generate higher revenue in the second and third quarters of our fiscal year as a result of seasonal traffic increases and high catering sales experienced during the summer months, and lower revenue in the first and fourth quarters of our fiscal year, due to possible adverse weather which can disrupt Guest and team member transportation to our restaurants. Government Regulation
 Our Company is subject to extensive state and local government regulation by various governmental agencies, including state and local licensing, zoning, land use, construction and environmental regulations and various regulations relating to the sale of food and alcoholic beverages, sanitation, disposal of refuse and waste products, public health, safety and fire standards. Our restaurants are subject to periodic inspections by governmental agencies to ensure conformity with such regulations. Any difficulty or failure to obtain required licensing or other regulatory approvals could delay or prevent the opening of a new restaurant, and the suspension of, or inability to renew a license, could interrupt operations at an existing restaurant, any of which would adversely affect our operations. Restaurant operating costs are also affected by other government actions that are beyond our control, including increases in minimum hourly wage requirements, worker’s compensation insurance rates, health care insurance costs, property and casualty insurance, and unemployment and other taxes. We are also subject to "dram-shop" statutes, which generally provide a person injured by an intoxicated person the right to recover damages from an establishment that wrongfully served alcoholic beverages to the intoxicated person.
 As a franchisor, we are subject to federal regulation and certain state laws that govern the offer and sale of franchises. Many state franchise laws impose substantive requirements on franchise agreements, including limitations on non-competition provisions and the termination or non-renewal of a franchise. Bills have been introduced in Congress from time to time that would provide for federal regulation of substantive aspects of the franchisor-franchisee relationship. As proposed, such legislation would limit, among other things, the duration and scope of non-competition provisions, the ability of a franchisor to terminate or refuse to renew a franchise, and the ability of a franchisor to designate sources of supply.

 The 1990 Federal Americans with Disabilities Act prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability in public accommodations and employment. We could be required to incur costs to modify our restaurants in order to provide service to, or make reasonable accommodations for, disabled persons. Our restaurants are currently designed to be accessible to the disabled, and we believe we are in substantial compliance with all current applicable regulations relating to this Act.
 Team Members
 As of December 31, 2017, we employed approximately 722 team members of which approximately 95 were salaried full-time employees. None of our team members are covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We believe that we have good relationships with our team members.
