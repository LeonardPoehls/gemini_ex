Item 1. Business
Corporate Overview
 
Our principal executive offices are located at 6 – 307, 2735 West Pebble Road, Las Vegas, Nevada, 89123. Our telephone number is (250) 258-7481.
 
Our common stock is quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board under the symbol “APGA”.
 
Corporate History
 
We were incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on July 20, 2006 under the name “Zebra Resources Incorporated” (aka “Zebra Resources Inc.”). At inception, we were an exploration stage company engaged in the acquisition, exploration and development of mineral properties.
 
We are investigating several business opportunities to enhance shareholder value.
 
Effective March 17, 2010, we effected a one (1) old for two (2) new forward stock split of our issued and outstanding common stock. As a result, our authorized capital increased from 75,000,000 to 150,000,000 shares of common stock and our issued and outstanding increased from 32,000,000 shares of common stock to 64,000,000 shares of common stock, all with a par value of $0.001.
 
Also effective March 17, 2010, we changed our name from "Zebra Resources Incorporated" to "American Paramount Gold Corp.", by way of a merger with our wholly owned subsidiary American Paramount Gold Corp., which was formed solely for the change of name.
 
The name change and forward stock split became effective with the Over-the-Counter Bulletin Board at the opening for trading on April 12, 2010 under the new stock symbol "APGA".
 
On July 30, 2010, our directors approved the adoption of the 2010 Stock Option Plan (“2010 Plan”) which permits our company to issue up to 6,500,000 shares of our common stock to directors, officers, employees and consultants of our company upon the exercise of stock options granted under the 2010 Plan. As at August 31, 2016, there are no outstanding stock options.
 
On November 16, 2011, our company’s board of directors approved a forty (40) for one (1) reverse stock split of our authorized and issued and outstanding common shares.
 
On November 28, 2011, the Nevada Secretary of State accepted for filing a Certificate of Change, wherein we effected an amendment to our Articles of Incorporation to decrease the authorized number of shares of our common stock from 150,000,000 to 3,750,000 shares of common stock, par value of $0.001. On November 29, 2011 the Nevada Secretary of State accepted for filing a Certificate of Correction, wherein we effected an amendment to our Articles of Incorporation to correct the Certificate of Change filed on November 28, 2011 to state that no fractional shares shall be issued and that fractional shares shall be rounded up rather than rounded down.
 
The reverse split became effective with the Over-the-Counter Bulletin Board at the opening of trading on January 26, 2012. Our new symbol is “APGA”. Our new CUSIP number is 02882T 204.
 
Our Current Business
 
We are an exploration stage mining company engaged in the identification, acquisition, and exploration of metals and minerals which until recently was focused on gold mineralization on our property located in Nevada. We intend to conduct exploration and development programs on our recently optioned property.

Since we are an exploration stage company, there is no assurance that a commercially viable mineral reserve exists on any of our current or future properties. We do not know if an economically viable mineral reserve exists on our property and there is no assurance that we will discover one. Even if we do eventually discover a mineral reserve on our property, there can be no assurance that we will be able to develop our property into a producing mine and extract those resources. Both mineral exploration and development involve a high degree of risk and few properties which are explored are ultimately developed into producing mines.
 
Subsidiaries
 
We do not have any subsidiaries.
 
Research and Development Expenditures
 
We have incurred $nil in research and development expenditures over the last two fiscal years.
 
Employees
 
Currently, with the exception of our directors and officers, we do not have any employees. Additionally, we have not entered into any consulting or employment agreements with our president, chief executive officer, treasurer, secretary or chief financial officer. Our directors, executive officers and certain contracted individuals play an important role in the running of our company. We do not expect any material changes in the number of employees over the next twelve-month period. We do and will continue to outsource contract employment as needed.
