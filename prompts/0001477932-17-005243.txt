ITEM 1. BUSINESS
GENERAL INFORMATION
 
Castle Holding Corp. (“CHOD”) is a holding company which was incorporated in Nevada on June 13, 1986. On September 30, 1987, CHOD acquired Castle Securities Corp., a New York corporation which operated as a securities broker dealer from November 1, 1985 to October 31, 2003. On April 11, 1991, CHOD formed Church Street Securities Corp., a New York corporation which operated as a securities broker dealer from October 26, 1995 to January 6, 2005. From January 2005 to June 2015, CHOD and its subsidiaries had minimal business operations and operating revenues. Commencing July 2015, CHOD’s subsidiary SAS Health and Beauty Corp. (“SAS”) has engaged in the production and sales of a skin care product called SAS Flower of Youth Facial Lift Spray. In November 2016, SAS also started marketing two vitamin supplement products called “JDI MultiVitamin/MultiMineral with NeuStem” and “NeuStem”.
 
On November 20, 2014, pursuant to a Stock Purchase Agreement involving a change in control of CHOD, CHOD was assigned a License Agreement between Cappello’s Inc. (“Cappello’s”) and Emergent Health Corporation (“EMGE”) dated August 26, 2014. On April 28, 2016, as a result of EMGE’s failure to pay CHOD royalties due under the License Agreement, the License Agreement was terminated and rights to the Licensed Products reverted to CHOD.
 
Through its subsidiary SAS, the Company is considering the manufacturing and marketing of the Licensed Products. The products relate to a line of stem cell nutrition and anti-aging ones which are patented and were well accepted by those familiar with these latest sectors in nutritional supplementation.
