ITEM 1. DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS.
 
Narrative Description of the Business 
 

We are a fee-based marketing, media and investor relations consultant to public and private companies. We may also invest in companies from time to time, including our clients, as a secondary activity.
 
We operate out of one office in Colorado. Currently, our principal business address is 1001-A E. Harmony Road, #366, Fort Collins, Colorado 80525. We have no specific plans at this point for additional offices.
 
Operations
 
As a consultant to both public and private companies, we promote public visibility and market acceptance for our clients. We use a number of techniques to achieve these objectives for our clients, including developing public recognition of their business plans and strategic goals, managing investor relations, and engaging in website development and media production. We also utilize various social media outlets and services to deliver our client's message.  We are paid fees for our services by our clients under written consulting agreements.


 Approximately 97.5% of the revenues of our clients in fiscal year 2017 came from entities which were under common principal ownership with our majority shareholder. For the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, we recorded advisory/consulting revenue of $157,926 and $178,019 respectively. Of the $157,926 and $178,019 recorded advisory/consulting revenue in 2017 and 2016, $153,901 and $157,970 is related party revenue. This advisory/consulting fee revenue relates to services performed for Nexcore Group, LP, Peter Kloepfer, and Bohemian Asset Management, Inc. We and the related parties have common affiliates.
 
 As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, we recorded $12,000 and $6,000, respectively, as accounts receivable, related party. In 2017 and 2016, one of our investments declared a distribution of $164,500 and $322,726, respectively.
 
Currently, we believe that we have sufficient capital to sustain our business operations beyond December 31, 2018. We were not profitable for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 although we have been profitable in the fiscal year ended December 31, 2014. If we could develop and sustain ongoing profitability, we could operate at our present level indefinitely.


We have had ongoing discussions with and due diligence reviews of possible acquisition candidates but have not entered into any definitive agreements.

Markets
 
We believe that the primary reason that clients would work with us rather than competitors is the existing relationships that we can develop. We believe that client loyalty and satisfaction is the basis for success in this business. Therefore, we believe that we have developed and expanded on already existing relationships to develop a competitive edge. We utilize the expertise of our principal officer to develop our business.
Customers and Competition
 
Our business involves acting as a fee-based marketing and media consultant and, secondarily, as an investor. Both businesses are highly competitive. There are numerous similar companies providing such services in the United States of America. Our competitors will have greater financial resources and more expertise in this business. Our ability to develop our business depends on our ability to successfully develop our business plan in this highly competitive environment. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to continue to do so successfully.
Employees
     Until December 31, 2017, we had one full-time employee: Mr. Steve Anderson, our President. We also had a part-time employee, Ms. Joni Troska, our corporate Secretary. In addition, we reimburse our employees for all necessary and customary business related expenses.  We have no plans or agreements which provide health care, insurance or compensation on the event of termination of employment or change in our control.  We do not pay our Director for any Board meeting he attends.
 
As of December 31, 2017, the Company terminated the employment of our full-time and part-time employees. They received aggregate severance pay of $131,000 in February, 2018. They will continue to provide support as outside contractors.

 
How to Obtain our SEC Filings
 
We file annual, quarterly, and special reports, proxy statements, and other information with the Securities Exchange Commission (SEC). Reports, proxy statements and other information filed with the SEC can be inspected and copied at the public reference facilities of the SEC at 100 F Street N.E., Washington, DC 20549. Such material may also be accessed electronically by means of the SEC's website at www.sec.gov.
 
We also have a corporate website, www.westmountainco.com, on which we post our regulatory filings.
