ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Business Development

Northsight Capital Inc. was incorporated in the State of Nevada on May 21, 2008. We were originally formed to engage in the business of marketing, developing, and producing unique, proprietary water products. Our original intended line of enhanced bottled waters was based upon the experience and expertise of our founder, designed to make everyday hydration and nutrition a more enjoyable experience. In May of 2008, we commenced our initial operations, and had no significant assets. In May 2010, we abandoned our pursuit of the proprietary bottled water business. Since then and until June 23, 2014, we were a shell company within the meaning of applicable securities laws as we had no operations and our business was comprised of seeking acquisition candidates. We commenced limited operations during the quarterly period ended March 31, 2014.

In May, 2011, Safe Communications, Inc. (n/k/a Kuboo, Inc.) acquired 80% of the Companys issued and outstanding common stock, and, as a result, became its parent company. On June 23, 2014, the Company completed the acquisition of approximately 7,500 cannabis related Internet domain names from Kae Yong Park, an individual who became our majority shareholder as a result of the acquisition. Currently, we own approximately 2,700 cannabis related internet domain names. In consideration of the acquisition of the 7,500 cannabis related Internet domain names from Kae Park, the Company:

·
 Issued an aggregate of 78.5 million shares of its common stock to Ms. Park;

·
 Issued to the seller a promissory note in the principal amount of $500,000. The note was amended and restated to provide that the first $100,000 installment payment due under the Note would be made July 25, 2014 (earlier than required), in exchange for which Kae Yong Park agreed to waive all interest due over the term of the note. Kae Yong Park has waived the requirement that the Company pay the $100,000 due under the Amended and Restated Note, until August 25, 2014. Such $100,000 has since been paid to Ms. Park. The remaining balance of $400,000 is payable in thirty-six equal monthly installments, commencing on the fifteenth day following the first month the Company realizes at least $150,000 in gross revenue;

·
 Agreed to pay a monthly royalty equal to the product of (i) six percent (6%) and (ii) the excess of the gross monthly revenue over $150,000. The royalty payment shall be payable for a period of thirty-six months from and after the first month in which the Companys gross revenues are in excess of $150,000.

Kuboo, Inc. continues to be a significant stockholder of the Company. John Venners, the President, CEO and a director of Kuboo, Inc., serves as the Companys Executive Vice President of Operations and sits on our board of directors (see Note 17 - Related Party Transactions).

On February 29, 2016, the Company entered into a joint venture agreement with Tumbleweed Holdings, Inc. (TW), pursuant to which a newly formed joint venture company had been developing an online dating service around the URL, www.jointlovers.com. Per the Joint Venture Agreement, the Company and TW own 60% and 40% respectively of equity of the joint venture company. Under the joint venture agreement, the Company and TW agreed as follows:

·
 The Company contributed the URL www.jointlovers.com to the joint venture entity, in exchange for 60% of the joint venture company.

·
 TW contributed $30,000 and agreed to contribute an additional $70,000 towards the development of the online web portal, in exchange for 40% of the joint venture company. With any additional funds required for development to be contributed 60% by the Company and 40% by TW.

·
 Revenue from the joint venture company will be shared proportionally with a portion of operating income to be used to repay principal and income due under the convertible notes referenced below (up to $165,000 in principal amount of notes).

·
 TW agreed to purchase an aggregate of $150,000 in principal amount of convertible notes, convertible into shares of the Companys common stock at a conversion price of $.20 per share. In addition to repayment of principal, if the joint venture company has revenues, the notes are entitled to receive a portion of the joint venture companys operating income until they have received an amount equal to 50% of the face value of the notes.

We are currently engaged in litigation with Tumbleweed with respect to the Joint Venture.  See Item 3 Legal Proceedings.

On November 23, 2016, we entered into a non-binding Letter of Intent, as amended (LOI), to acquire Stargreen Holdings, LLC, a Los Angeles, California, company (Stargreen). The LOI expires April 30, 2017, subject to extension by agreement. Stargreen has filed applications for licenses/permits to cultivate and dispense legal marijuana and has entered into agreements to acquire/lease properties where it intends to cultivate, manufacture and dispense products to the legal medical and recreational marijuana markets. These agreements are subject to Stargreen securing funding necessary to consummate these acquisitions. As a condition of closing, the LOI requires Stargreen to secure, on mutually agreeable terms, a minimum investment into our company of $2.5 million (maximum of $23.1 million). To acquire Stargreen, we expect to issue Stargreen that number of shares of common stock, such that, after giving effect to said acquisition (but before the financing), Stargreen will own 75% of our issued and outstanding common stock. The closing of the acquisition of Stargreen is subject to various conditions, including satisfactory completion of due diligence, negotiation of definitive agreements, consummation at closing of the minimum $2.5 million funding on mutually agreeable terms and satisfaction prior at closing of certain of our preexisting liabilities. 

Although Stargreen does not currently own or operate any legal marijuana businesses, subject to receipt of funding and necessary permits and licenses, Stargreen intends to build a large portfolio of assets to capitalize on industry supply chain economics by producing services and products at each stage. The planned extraction and cultivation operations will use state of the art equipment and resource management techniques to maximize quality and profitability while minimizing use of natural resources. 

There is currently no assurance that we will close on the Stargreen acquisition.

The Company was previously a shell company within the meaning of applicable securities laws. The Company has ceased to be a shell company within the meaning of applicable securities laws in that the Company has raised capital, hired employees, leased space, acquired domain names, including prior to the acquisition described herein, engaged consultants and advisors, completed the construction and launch of several web portals, including WeedDepot.com and TheMarijuanaCompanies.com, conducted sales and marketing related activities, and negotiated vendor relationships.

The Company intends to build a variety of websites/portals around these domain names. These websites/portals will serve as directories for businesses engaged in the lawful sale and distribution of cannabis and hemp related products and services. To date we have completed and launched eight cannabis related websites, as described below. As noted below, subject to the receipt of additional funding, we intend to complete and launch an additional three cannabis related websites. 

Products and Services

The Companys principal business is to provide a wide variety of online directories for a broad range of businesses engaged in the lawful sale and distribution of cannabis and hemp related products.

The following constitute the Companys major product categories: a monthly listing in one or more of the Companys online directories, paid advertising in one or more of the Companys online directories and leasing to customers one or more Internet domain names for the customers exclusive use.
 
5

The principal markets for the Companys services are businesses that are engaged in the lawful sale and distribution of cannabis and cannabis related products and wish to (i) be included in one or more of the Companys state based online directories, (ii) advertise in the Companys online directories or (iii) lease one or more internet domain names from the Company.

A list of the approximately 7,500 internet domain names we acquired from Kae Yong Park (who became our majority shareholder in connection with the acquisition) is filed as Exhibit 99.3 to the Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the Commission June 25, 2014. We currently own approximately 2,700 cannabis related internet domain names.

Domain names we do not lease to customers will point to one or more of our websites based on the relevance of the internet domain name to the particular website.

We have already completed and launched the following websites:

·
 WeedDepot.com
 ·
 RateMyStrain.com
 ·
 420Careers.com
 ·
 MJBizWire.com
 ·
 MarijuanaRecipes.com
 ·
 MarijuanaSelfies.com
 ·
 Wiki-Weed.com
 ·
 MarijuanaMD.com
 ·
 TheMarijuanaCompanies.com

Weed Depot is a unique smart phone and internet platform directory with geo-mapping for dispensaries, doctors and clinics, head shops, tattoo parlors, and vape lounges. For mobile use, www.WeedDepot.com can be downloaded at Apple Apps and Google Play.

RateMyStrain.com - A site on which individuals or dispensaries can rate or insert new strains commenting on their use and effect. The site contains over 800 strains and descriptions.

420Careers.com - for anyone looking to hire or seeking a job in the cannabis space.

MJBizWire.com - Distribution of new events for companies in the cannabis space. Similar to PR Newswire, etc.

MarijuanaRecipes.com - A web site where subscribers can find hundreds of recipes and ingredients for creating snacks, meals and deserts using infused cannabis.

MarijuanaSelfies.com  A Web community for the freedom of expression and legalization of marijuana.

WikiWeed.com - WikiWeed.com is an informational, user-driven Wiki focused on both recreational and medical marijuana topics and information that allows collaborative editing of its content and structure by its users.

MarijuanaMD.com  A directory of medical doctors who are willing to issue medical marijuana cards to patients

TheMarijuanaCompanies.com a directory of the companys websites

Having completed the launch of the above-described websites, subject to the receipt of sufficient funding, which we currently do not have, our plan is to expand our sales and marketing activities with respect to these websites with a view to driving significant traffic to these websites, which in turn should make our directories more attractive to cannabis related enterprises that are trying to promote and advertise their business. We anticipate that it will cost approximately $35,000 per month ($400,000 per year) to effectively implement our sales and marketing plan. Currently, we do not have the requisite funds to implement our marketing plan. 

Through our joint venture with Tumbleweed, we have been developing JointLovers.com as a website/mobile application. At this time, due to a lack of funding, we are not actively pursuing further development of the JointLovers.com app. 

Subject to the receipt of sufficient funding, which we currently do not have, we intend to construct the following websites:

·
 WeedMedia.com
 ·
 MarijuanaAds.com
 
6

Once we commence development of these sites, we anticipate that it will take about six months and cost approximately $150,000 to construct and launch the foregoing websites. Currently, we do not have the requisite funds to build these websites. When and if these websites are constructed, we will also focus on the marketing these sites as well. We believe that the incremental marketing costs associated with the promotion of these to be built websites will not be material in relation to our total marketing budget.

Marketing and Distribution

Subject to the receipt of sufficient funding, which we currently do not have, we intend to expand the marketing and distribution of our services primarily through the following methods:

·
 Direct Sales
 ·
 Internet based advertising
 ·
 Social Media based campaigns
 ·
 Attendance at trade related shows
 ·
 Radio and TV Advertising
 ·
 Advertising in Industry based publications

To date, our sales and marketing related activities have included search engine optimization, direct selling efforts, direct mail, electronic mail, social media, and online advertising. We have engaged companies to assist us in our sales and marketing related activities: Hemp Media (provides online (Internet, smart phone and mobile device content to our business), New Times (print advertising), the musician Snoop Dogg (promotion of our Company and its business), and a nationally recognized mens magazine (print advertising). 
Competition

We expect to compete for consumer traffic with traditional, offline local business guides and directories and with other online providers of local and web search on the basis of a number of factors, including the reliability of our content, and the breadth, depth and timeliness of information. We also expect to compete for a share of local businesses overall advertising budgets with traditional, offline media companies and other Internet marketing providers on the basis of a number of factors, including the comprehensive nature of our online directories, effectiveness of our advertising solutions and our pricing structure. Our competitors are expected to include the following types of businesses:

(1)
 Offline. We expect to compete with offline media companies and service providers who may have existing advertising relationships with local businesses. Services provided by competitors are expected to range from yellow pages listings to direct mail campaigns to advertising and listings services on local newspapers, magazines, television and radio.

(2)
 Online. We expect to compete with Internet search engines, such as, Google, Yahoo! and Bing. We also expect to compete with various other online service providers and review and social media websites.

Currently, the Companys primary online competitors are Weedmaps and Leafly, each an online directory of medical marijuana dispensaries and doctors. Neither Weedmaps nor Leafly currently serve the legal recreational market. Accordingly, we consider these companies a competitor only with respect to medical dispensaries/doctors, and not otherwise. Currently, Weedmaps and Leafly are much larger than we are and have substantially greater financial resources than we do. We believe that we will be able to compete effectively against these companies with respect to medical dispensaries/doctors, as we expect our pricing to be much lower than that offered by either of them. The Company is not currently aware of any other online directory of cannabis related products and services.

Customers

We have not yet realized significant revenues from our operations. We expect our customers to consist of the various businesses engaged in the lawful sale and distribution of cannabis and hemp related products, including retail shops, medical dispensaries, head shops, growers, distributors, suppliers, vendors, and the like. Our customers may also include legal, marketing, and event production companies seeking to serve the cannabis industry.

To the extent practicable from a business standpoint, we intend to diversify our customer base, so that we are not dependent on any particular customer.

Personnel

As of April 17, 2017, we had three full time employees and one part time employee, in addition to a number of subcontractors. 

Website/Portal Development

Over the next twelve months, we expect to incur aggregate website development costs and expenses of approximately $175,000 related to the development of our websites and related technology and services. Our ability to engage in planned website and related technology development is subject to the availability of sufficient funds, which we currently do not have. If we are unable to fund necessary research and development, we will be at a competitive disadvantage and our business will be materially and adversely affected.
Intellectual Property

In general, we rely primarily on a combination of trade secrets, copyright and trademark laws, and confidentiality procedures to protect our technology. Due to the technological change that characterizes our business, we believe that the improvement of existing services, reliance upon trade secrets and proprietary know-how and the development of new services are generally as important as patent protection in establishing and maintaining a competitive advantage.

Circumstances outside our control could pose a threat to our intellectual property rights. For example, effective intellectual property protection may not be available in the United States or other countries in which we operate. Also, the efforts we have taken to protect our proprietary rights may not be sufficient or effective. Any significant impairment of our intellectual property rights could harm our business or our ability to compete. Also, protecting our intellectual property rights is costly and time-consuming. Any unauthorized disclosure or use of our intellectual property could make it more expensive to do business and harm our operating results.

Companies in the Internet, media and other industries may own large numbers of patents, copyrights and trademarks and may frequently request license agreements, threaten litigation or file suit against us based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. We may in the future face allegations that we have infringed the trademarks, copyrights, patents and other intellectual property rights of third parties, including our competitors and non-practicing entities. As we face increasing competition and as our business grows, we will likely face claims of infringement.

Governmental Regulation 

In general, as a company conducting business on the Internet, we are subject to a number of foreign and domestic laws and regulations relating to consumer protection, information security, data protection and privacy, among other things. In the area of information security and data protection, for example, the laws in several states require companies to implement specific information security controls to protect certain types of information. Likewise, all but a few states have laws in place requiring companies to notify users if there is a security breach that compromises certain categories of their information. Foreign data protection, privacy, and other laws and regulations can be more restrictive than those in the United States. Any failure on our part to comply with these laws may subject us to significant liabilities.

The state laws, rules and regulations governing the possession, use, sale and distribution of cannabis and products which may contain cannabis are constantly changing and evolving. Currently, the medicinal use of cannabis has been legalized in 26 states and Washington D.C. and seven of 7 of the 26 states, comprised of Alaska, California, Colorado, Maine, Massachusetts, Oregon, and Washington, plus the District of Columbia, have approved recreational consumer use of marijuana; but, pursuant to the federal Controlled Substances Act (CSA), the possession, use, sale and distribution of cannabis for recreational or medicinal purposes remains unauthorized and illegal. However, the state laws which authorize and regulate (or prohibit) the possession, use, sale and distribution of cannabis, as well as the federal laws prohibiting the same do not currently apply to our business as we are not engaged or participating in the possession, cultivation, sale or distribution of cannabis or products which may contain cannabis.

Nevertheless, as the cannabis industry continues to evolve, increased regulation and oversight by local, state and federal agencies is likely. For example, more stringent local or state regulation of the cannabis industry could adversely affect the industry which would in turn adversely affect our business. In addition, because the industry is in its infancy, the enforcement of the CSA as it relates to those using and engaging in the cannabis industry, by the Department of Justice, also remains an area of uncertainty. For example, although we do not believe it probable, if the US Federal Government were to enforce the CSA on a nationwide basis, the cannabis industry would in effect be abolished, which would have a material and adverse effect on our business, rendering us unable to continue as a going concern.

Many of these laws and regulations are still evolving and could be interpreted in ways that could harm our business. The application and interpretation of these laws and regulations are often uncertain, particularly in the new and rapidly evolving industry in which we operate, and may be interpreted and applied inconsistently from country to country and inconsistently with our current policies and practices. There are also a number of legislative proposals pending before the U.S. Congress, various state legislative bodies and foreign governments concerning data protection that could affect us. For example, the European Commission is currently considering a data protection regulation imposing operational requirements on companies that receive personal data. The proposed requirements are different from those currently in place in the European Union, and the regulation may also include significant penalties for non-compliance.

Seasonality

We have not yet realized significant revenues from our business operations. Accordingly, we do not yet have a historical basis to determine whether our revenue will be subject to seasonal fluctuation.
Available Information

More information about us can be found by visiting our corporate Internet site, www.themarijuanacompanies.com. The public may read and copy any materials we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), including our Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, and all amendments to the foregoing, at the SECs Public Reference Room at 100 F St., NE, Washington, DC 20549, on official business days during the hours of 10 AM to 3 PM. The public may obtain information on the operation of the Public Reference Room by calling the SEC at 1-800-SEC-0330. The SEC maintains an Internet site (http://www.sec.gov) that contains reports, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, and all amendments to the foregoing, proxy and information statements, and other information regarding the Company and other issuers that file electronically with the SEC.



Effect of Existing or Probable Governmental Regulations on the Business

Smaller Reporting Company

We are subject to the reporting requirements of Section 13 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act), and we are subject to the disclosure requirements of Regulation S-K of the SEC, as a smaller reporting company. That designation relieves us of some of the informational requirements of Regulation S-K.

Sarbanes/Oxley Act

We are also subject to certain provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. The Sarbanes/Oxley Act created a strong and independent accounting oversight board to oversee the conduct of auditors of public companies and strengthens auditor independence. It also requires steps to enhance the direct responsibility of senior members of management for financial reporting and for the quality of financial disclosures made by public companies; establishes clear statutory rules to limit, and to expose to public view, possible conflicts of interest affecting securities analysts; creates guidelines for audit committee members appointment, compensation and oversight of the work of public companies auditors; management assessment of our internal controls; auditor attestation of our internal controls; prohibits certain insider trading during pension fund blackout periods; requires companies and auditors to evaluate internal controls and procedures; and establishes a federal crime of securities fraud, among other provisions. Compliance with the requirements of the Sarbanes/Oxley Act will likely substantially increase our legal and accounting costs if we complete an acquisition, reorganization or merger.

Exchange Act Reporting Requirements

Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act requires all companies with securities registered pursuant to Section 12(g) of the Exchange Act to comply with the rules and regulations of the SEC regarding proxy solicitations, as outlined in Regulation 14A. Matters submitted to our shareholders at a special or annual meeting thereof or pursuant to a written consent will require us to provide our shareholders with the information outlined in Schedules 14A or 14C of Regulation 14; preliminary copies of this information must be submitted to the SEC at least 10 days prior to the date that definitive copies of this information are forwarded to our shareholders.
 
9

We are required to file annual reports on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q with the Securities Exchange Commission on a regular basis, and are required to timely disclose certain material events (e.g., changes in corporate control; acquisitions or dispositions of a significant amount of assets other than in the ordinary course of business; and bankruptcy) in a Current Report on Form 8-K.
