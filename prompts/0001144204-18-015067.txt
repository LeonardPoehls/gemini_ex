ITEM 1. BUSINESS    Overview
 MMA Capital Management, LLC was organized in 1996 as a Delaware limited liability company.  Unless the context otherwise requires, and when used in this Report, the “Company,” “MMA,” “we,” “our” or “us” refers to MMA Capital Management, LLC and its subsidiaries.
 The Company partners with institutional capital to create and manage investments in affordable housing and renewable energy.  We invest for our own account and co-invest with our institutional capital partners.  In 2017, we derived revenue from returns on our investments and from asset management, performance and other fees that relate to investments, funds and ventures that we managed.  On January 8, 2018, the Company completed the sale of certain business lines and assets and converted to an externally managed business model by engaging an affiliate of Hunt Companies, Inc. to perform management services for the Company.  Refer to the discussion in “Sale of Certain Business Lines and Assets” in Part I of this Report for more information about these developments.  The forward-looking statements in our discussions of U.S. Operations, International Operations and Corporate Operations are qualified in their entirety by that discussion. 
 At December 31, 2017, the Company operated through three reportable segments – United States (“U.S.”) Operations, International Operations and Corporate Operations.  Refer to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – Note 15, “Segment Information,” for more information about the revenues, operating profit and loss and total assets for each of our reportable segments.    Sale of Certain Business Lines and Assets
 On January 8, 2018, the Company entered into a series of material definitive agreements with affiliates of Hunt Companies, Inc. (collectively, “Hunt”) in which the Company sold certain business lines and assets to Hunt and converted to an externally managed business model by engaging Hunt to perform management services for the Company.  The Company also agreed to issue, and Hunt agreed to acquire, 250,000 of the Company’s common shares in a private placement at an average purchase price of $33.50 per share.     In this regard, on March 9, 2018, the Company issued 125,000 common shares to Hunt for $4.1 million, representing a price per share of $33.00.  Hunt is obligated to purchase the remaining 125,000 shares for $4.3 million, or $34.00 per share, within six months of January 8, 2018.
 With respect to the sale of business lines and assets, the Company sold the following to Hunt on January 8, 2018: (i) its LIHTC business; (ii) its international asset and investment management business; (iii) the loan origination, servicing and management components of its Energy Capital business; (iv) its bond servicing platform; and (v) certain miscellaneous investments (collectively, the “Disposed Assets” and the foregoing sale transaction is hereinafter referred to as the “Disposition”).  The Disposition also included certain management, expense reimbursement and other contractual rights held by the Company with respect to its Energy Capital, LIHTC and International Operations.  
 As consideration for the Disposition, Hunt agreed to pay the Company $57 million and to assume certain liabilities of the Company. The Company provided seller financing through a $57 million note receivable from Hunt FS Holdings II, LLC (the “Buyer”) that has a term of seven years, is prepayable at any time and bears interest at the rate of 5% per annum.  The unpaid principal balance on the note will amortize in 20 equal quarterly payments of $2.85 million beginning on March 31, 2020.  Additionally, the Company may also receive additional purchase price consideration for the Disposition based on the performance of the transferred LIHTC businesses.
 The Company’s option to purchase the LIHTC business of Morrison Grove Management, LLC (“MGM”) was converted to a purchase and sale agreement (the “MGM PSA”), pursuant to which the Company agreed to complete the purchase of MGM subject to certain conditions precedent.  In addition, the Company signed an agreement to acquire from an affiliate of MGM certain assets pertaining to a specific LIHTC property (the “Woodside Agreement” and together with the MGM PSA, the “MGM Agreements”).  Hunt has the right to elect to take assignment of the MGM Agreements and acquire the MGM LIHTC business and property directly from MGM and its affiliates.
 After settlement of the Disposition, and assuming Hunt elects to, and does, close under the MGM Agreements, the Company’s assets and liabilities will consist primarily of its: (i) investments in bonds and other debt obligations that finance affordable housing and infrastructure in the U.S.; (ii) investments in partnerships, including our investments in renewable energy, U.S. real estate partnerships and our 11.85% ownership interest in South Africa Workforce Housing Fund (“SAWHF”); (iii) the $57 million note receivable from the Buyer; (iv) derivative financial instruments that are used to hedge interest and foreign currency exchange risks of the Company; and (v) other assets and liabilities, including certain LIHTC assets, real estate investments, the Company’s subordinated debt and $379.2 million of net operating losses (“NOLs”) that are subject to a full valuation allowance at December 31, 2017.

As part of the transaction, the Company engaged Hunt to externally manage the Company’s continuing operations (the agreement that governs this engagement is hereinafter referred to as the “Management Agreement” while the Hunt entity that externally manages the Company is hereinafter referred to as the “External Manager”).  All employees of the Company were hired by the External Manager.  In consideration for the external management services, the Company agreed to pay the External Manager (i) a base management fee, which is payable quarterly in arrears and is calculated as a percentage of the Company’s GAAP common shareholders’ equity, with certain annual true-ups, and (ii) an incentive fee equal to 20% of the total annual return of diluted common shareholders’ equity per share in excess of 7%.  For the first and second quarters of 2018, the base management fee is fixed at $1 million per quarter, with the percentage of GAAP common shareholders’ equity calculation beginning with the third quarter of 2018.  The Company also agreed to reimburse the External Manager for certain allocable overhead costs. 
 The Company will recognize an estimated increase in GAAP common shareholders’ equity of approximately $32 million in connection with the settlement of the Disposition and estimates that it would recognize an additional $14 million increase in GAAP common shareholders’ equity should Hunt decide to take an assignment of the MGM Agreements and, subject to the terms of the MGM Agreements, consummate the acquisition of the MGM LIHTC business.  
 The impacts that the Disposition and Management Agreement have had on the continuing business operations of the Company are further discussed below.
 U.S. Operations
 At December 31, 2017, our U.S. Operations segment consisted of three business lines: Leveraged Bonds, Low Income Housing Tax Credits (“LIHTC”) and Energy Capital. We re-allocated the Other Investments component of “Energy Capital and Other Investments” to our Leveraged Bonds business line in the fourth quarter of 2016.  However, as further discussed in “Sale of Certain Business Lines and Assets” in Part I of this Report, the Company completed the sale of the following elements of its U.S. Operations on January 8, 2018: (i) the Company’s LIHTC business; (ii) the loan origination, servicing and management components of its Energy Capital business; (iii) the Company’s bond servicing platform; and (iv) certain miscellaneous investments.  The Disposition also included, among other items, certain management, expense reimbursement and other contractual rights held by the Company with respect to its Energy Capital and LIHTC business lines.  
 The impacts that the Disposition and Management Agreement have had on each business line within U.S. Operations are further discussed below.
 Leveraged Bonds Business Line 
 In our Leveraged Bonds business line, which was not conveyed in the Disposition, we primarily own and manage bonds for our own account that finance affordable housing and infrastructure in the U.S.
 The bonds we hold are fixed rate and unrated.  Our bonds are also generally tax-exempt and collateralized by affordable multifamily rental properties.  Substantially all of the rental units in these multifamily properties, which may be subsidized by the government, have tenant income and rent restrictions.      The Company also has a smaller portfolio of other real estate bonds.  This portfolio includes: (i) municipal bonds that finance the development of infrastructure for a mixed-use town center development and are secured by incremental tax revenues generated from the development, (ii) a subordinated investment in a collateralized mortgage-backed security that finances a mixed-use multifamily housing property and (iii) a tax-exempt bond that is fully secured by U.S. Treasury notes subsequent to the sale of the underlying affordable multifamily property.  
 The Company has financed its ownership of a majority of its investments in bonds through total return swap (“TRS”) agreements.  These financing arrangements enable the Company to retain the economic risks and rewards of the fixed rate bonds that are referenced in such agreements and generally require the Company to pay a variable rate of interest that resets on a weekly basis.  The Company also has executed TRS agreements to synthetically acquire the total return of multifamily bonds that it does not own. The Company has hedged a portion of the interest rate risk associated with its TRS agreements and other sources of variable interest rate exposure using various interest rate risk management agreements. 
 Table 1 provides key metrics related to all bonds in which we have an economic interest, including bonds in which we acquired an economic interest through TRS agreements (such bonds and TRS agreements are hereinafter referred to collectively as the “Bond Portfolio”).  See Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – Note 5, “Debt,” and Note 6, “Derivative Instruments,” for more information about how TRS and interest rate risk management agreements are reported in the Company’s financial statements.

Other Investments of the Leveraged Bonds Business Line
 At December 31, 2017, we owned or were an equity partner in, two direct investments in real estate consisting of one land parcel and a mixed-use town center development whose incremental tax revenues secure our infrastructure bond investments.  The carrying value of the two direct investments was $21.5 million as of December 31, 2017.    LIHTC Business Line    At December 31, 2017, our LIHTC business line primarily owned and managed limited partner (“LP”) and general partner (“GP”) investments in affordable housing communities in the U.S.  In this regard, we provided asset management and administrative services to a limited liability company formed in 2015 by the Company and a commercial bank (“TC Fund I”) that acquired limited partnership interests either directly or through fund investments in approximately 650 affordable properties.  Since the formation of TC Fund I, many properties in which it had an interest have been sold and, as of September 30, 2017, TC Fund I had investments in approximately 440 properties.  
 At December 31, 2017, we also had loan receivables from, and an option to purchase, MGM, which, at December 31, 2017, had approximately 235 properties under management.  Additionally, at December 31, 2017, our LIHTC business line had outstanding guarantees to some of the Company’s institutional investors related to the yield on the funds, the receipt of tax credits and the performance of the underlying assets.      
 On January 8, 2018, and as further discussed in “Sale of Certain Business Lines and Assets” in Part I of this Report, the Company sold its LIHTC business to Hunt as part of the Disposition while converting its option to acquire MGM into a purchase and sale agreement that the Company has retained, but for which Hunt has the right to elect to take assignment.  As part of the Disposition, the Company’s LIHTC fund-level guarantees of investor returns, individual indemnifications made to specific investors in non-guaranteed LIHTC funds and its limited tax credit guarantee to TC Fund I were assumed by Hunt.
 TC Fund I
 As consideration for providing asset management and administrative services to TC Fund I, the Company was due an asset management fee of 2% per annum on the initial capital contribution of $211.4 million by the investor with which the Company partnered to form TC Fund I.  Asset management fees were generally payable to the Company by TC Fund I after payments are made by TC Fund I to: 1) repay any tax credit losses funded by the investor; 2) redeem any investor member voluntary loans; 3) repay any mandatory loans made by the Company to fund investor tax credit losses; 4) pay any expense loans; 5) establish any required reserves; and 6) pay any accrued guarantee fees.  Cash flows to TC Fund I are generated primarily from residual events that generally occur at the end of the tax compliance period and are generally outside of the control of the Company in terms of whether and when they occur. At December 31, 2017, we anticipated that a significant amount of these properties would not generate any material residual value.  Any accrued but unpaid asset management fees bear interest at 6% per annum compounded annually.
 In connection with the formation of TC Fund I, the Company provided a limited guarantee of tax credits that are expected to be generated by TC Fund I’s portfolio of investments.  In consideration for providing this guarantee, the Company was contractually entitled to receive $4.2 million in guarantee fees from TC Fund I and, on December 31, 2015, recognized a guarantee fee receivable for this amount in conjunction with recognizing a liability of equal size related to its obligation to stand ready to perform under this guarantee.  At December 31, 2017, this guarantee fee receivable, inclusive of accrued interest, had been fully collected by the Company while the carrying value of the Company’s guarantee obligation to TC Fund I was $2.8 million.    
 To cover certain costs associated with the organization of TC Fund I, the Company advanced a loan of $5.3 million to TC Fund I upon its formation.  This loan accrues interest at 9.5% per annum, compounds annually and will be repaid by TC Fund I after it pays accrued guarantee and asset management fees.  At December 31, 2017, this loan, which had a carrying value of $0.2 million, was on non-accrual status due to the timing and amount of cash flow projections for the loan and its payment priority in TC Fund I’s waterfall, among other factors.  The non-accrual status of this loan was re-assessed by the Company each reporting period. 
 On January 8, 2018, as further discussed in “Sale of Certain Business Lines and Assets” in Part I of this Report, the Company conveyed all of its rights and obligations associated with TC Fund I to Hunt as part of the Disposition.
 Interests in and Obligations to MGM
 Prior to the sale of substantially all of our LIHTC business in 2014, we “syndicated” tax credits by forming LIHTC funds that purchased directly or indirectly the limited partnership interests in multiple Lower Tier Property Partnerships (“LTPPs”).  We raised capital from institutional investors, which comprised virtually all of the equity of the LIHTC funds, and the LIHTC funds used this capital, and sometimes interim debt financing, to purchase the limited partner interests in the LTPPs.  We were the general partner of, and managed, the LIHTC funds and usually retained an interest of between 0.01% and 1.0% in each of them.  The remaining 99.0% to 99.99% interest in each LIHTC fund was typically held by one or more large financial institutions.

We provided two general types of guarantees in connection with these transactions: (i) LIHTC fund-level guarantees where the Company, directly and indirectly, guaranteed the investors’ return on investment (“Guaranteed Funds”); and (ii) individual indemnifications to specific investors in non-guaranteed LIHTC funds related to the performance of specific LTPPs.  Because the LTPPs and the LIHTC funds (as well as any intermediate entities) are pass-through entities for federal income tax purposes, the equity owners of the LIHTC funds receive the tax benefit of the credits generated by the LTPPs.  In order for the investors in the Guaranteed Funds to benefit from low-income housing tax credits, the LTPPs in which these entities invest must operate affordable housing properties in compliance with a number of requirements in the Internal Revenue Code (the “Code”) and the regulations under it.  Failure to comply continuously with these requirements throughout a 15-year recapture period could result in loss of the right to those low-income housing tax credits, including recapture of credits that were previously taken, potentially creating a liability under our guarantee.  The execution of these guarantees caused the Company to consolidate the Guaranteed Funds for financial reporting purposes.
 As consideration for providing these guarantees, the Company received upfront guarantee fees of $28.9 million that were initially deferred for financial reporting purposes and that are amortized into earnings over the contractual life of such obligations.  At December 31, 2017, the unamortized balance of the Company’s deferred guarantee fees was $7.5 million.  However, because the Guaranteed Funds have been consolidated by the Company for reporting purposes, certain fees and other payments received from these entities are not classified as revenues in our Consolidated Statements of Operations but rather as income that is allocated to us from CFVs.
 When the Company sold its LIHTC business in 2014 to MGM, the Company agreed to indemnify MGM from investor claims related to those guarantees. Additionally, to facilitate this sale transaction, the Company made a bridge loan and a subordinated loan to MGM.  As of December 31, 2017, only the subordinated loan, which matures on June 30, 2025, remains outstanding.  This subordinated loan, which was conveyed to Hunt on January 8, 2018 as part of the Disposition, had a UPB of $13.0 million as of December 31, 2017, was non-amortizing, bore interest at a base rate of 11% that was paid quarterly and had a contingent interest feature that provided up to an additional 13% of interest annually.  However, because the conveyance of the Company’s LIHTC business could not be treated as a sale for financial reporting purposes, this subordinated loan is not recognized in the Company’s financial statements.  As a result, principal and interest payments that are made to the Company are deferred in the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets as a component of “Other Liabilities.”  At December 31, 2017, the Company had recorded $10.3 million of deferred revenue in connection with principal and interest payments received from MGM.    
 As consideration for the sale of the Company’s LIHTC business in 2014, the Company also received an option to acquire MGM, which primarily manages LIHTC investments on behalf of third party investors and for its own account.  The purchase price for the option was $12.0 million, subject to various purchase price adjustments that, as of December 31, 2017, would increase the purchase price to $13.2 million.  However, as further discussed in “Sale of Certain Business Lines and Assets” in Part I of this Report, this purchase option was converted on January 8, 2018, into the MGM PSA, which requires the Company to complete the purchase of MGM subject to certain conditions precedent.  The Company also executed an agreement on January 8, 2018, to acquire from an affiliate of MGM certain assets pertaining to a specific LIHTC property.  Hunt has the right to elect to take assignment of the MGM Agreements and settle directly with MGM.  
 Direct Real Estate Investments
 At December 31, 2017, the Company owned one real estate investment that it acquired during the third quarter of 2017.  This investment, which consists of a 98.99% LP interest in a partnership that owns affordable housing, had a carrying value of $0.9 million at December 31, 2017.  This investment was not conveyed to Hunt as part of the Disposition.  

At December 31, 2017, the Company was the general partner in four LTPPs in which it held equity interests ranging from 0.01% to 1.00%.  One of these interests was in a partnership that owns an affordable multifamily property that collateralized one of our bond investments.  The Company consolidated all four partnerships for financial reporting purposes and, as a result, recognized all of the assets and liabilities of these entities on its Consolidated Balance Sheets.  The four consolidated partnerships had a net carrying value of $18.8 million at December 31, 2017.  However, as further discussed in “Sale of Certain Business Lines and Assets” in Part I of this Report, the Company conveyed on January 8, 2018, its general partner interests in all four LTPPs to Hunt as part of the Disposition.  
 Refer to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – Note 14, “Consolidated Funds and Ventures” for more information about the assets and liabilities of these consolidated property partnerships at December 31, 2017.

Energy Capital Business Line    Throughout 2017, our wholly owned subsidiary, MMA Energy Capital, LLC (“MEC”), originated late-stage development, construction and permanent loans directly and through multiple ventures with a leading global private investment firm and an alternative asset manager (hereinafter, the “Solar Ventures”) to enable developers, design and build contractors and system owners to develop, build and operate renewable energy systems throughout North America.  The Solar Ventures included Renewable Energy Lending, LLC (“REL”); Solar Construction Lending, LLC (“SCL”); Solar Permanent Lending, LLC (“SPL”); and Solar Development Lending, LLC (“SDL”).  MEC provided loan origination, servicing, asset management and other management services to the Solar Ventures entitling it to receive reimbursement for most costs that the Company incurred in executing its responsibilities as administrative member for the Solar Ventures.  However, as further discussed in “Sale of Certain Business Lines and Assets” in Part I of this Report, on January 8, 2018, the Company sold the loan origination, servicing and management components of its Energy Capital business line to Hunt as part of the Disposition.  Additionally, the Disposition included certain management, expense reimbursement and other contractual rights held by the Company with respect to the Energy Capital business line.  
 In November 2016, the Company made an initial $75.0 million non-cash capital contribution into REL that was comprised of solar energy loan investments, including our membership interests in SCL and SPL, in exchange for a membership interest in REL.  As a result of this exchange, our interest in REL, which was not conveyed to Hunt as part of the Disposition, provides us with an indirect interest in SCL and SPL.  As stipulated in the governing documents of REL, our partner will make 100% of the incremental capital contributions to REL until it has funded 85% of the equity invested and will receive 100% of the capital distributions from REL until it has received a return of all of its contributed capital, thereby causing our ownership interest in REL to fluctuate.  At December 31, 2017, the Company’s investment in REL had a carrying value of $78.0 million, which represented a 57.0% ownership interest.  We received $5.9 million of cash distributions from REL during the year ended December 31, 2017, which reflects the Company’s share of income earned by REL.    
 Upon the formation of SDL, the Company and its capital partner agreed to contribute 50% of the initial and incremental capital contributions to the partnership.  However, during the third quarter of 2017, the partners agreed that the Company would fund 10% and our capital partner would fund the remaining 90% for a particular portfolio of loans, thereby causing our ownership interest in SDL to decrease in percentage terms.  At December 31, 2017, the Company’s investment in SDL, which was not conveyed to Hunt as part of the Disposition, had a carrying value of $19.1 million, representing an 11.2% ownership interest. We received $3.9 million in cash distributions from SDL during the year ended December 31, 2017, of which $3.4 million reflects a return of our invested capital and the remaining $0.5 million is an income distribution reflecting the Company’s share of income earned by SDL.    
 At December 31, 2017, the UPB of loans that were funded through the Solar Ventures was $278.4 million.  Loans outstanding at December 31, 2017 had a weighted-average remaining maturity and coupon of nine months and 8.7%, respectively.
 International Operations
 Throughout 2017, we managed our International Operations segment through two wholly owned subsidiaries, International Housing Solutions S.à r.l.  (“IHS”) and IHS Property Management Proprietary Limited (“IHS PM”).  During this period, IHS’s strategy was to raise, invest in and manage funds and ventures that invest in residential real estate.  This included four private real estate funds and a publicly-traded real estate investment trust (“REIT”).  IHS earned asset management fees from all five investment vehicles and also invested as a limited partner in the four funds it managed and was entitled to special distributions based on the funds’ returns. In this regard, IHS managed the following investment vehicles in 2017:

· | SAWHF is a multi-investor fund that began operations in April 2008 and is fully invested, having raised $154 million of LP capital from five different investors with an additional participating debt commitment of $80 million from the Overseas Private Investment Corporation (“OPIC”). Since its inception, SAWHF has made 35 investments involving approximately 30,000 units of affordable for-sale and rental housing in South Africa. At December 31, 2017, SAWHF was in the process of exiting its investments as it will mature in March 2018 (although the maturity of SAWHF may, subject to the consent of the investors and OPIC, be extended for up to two additional one-year periods).

· | International Housing Solutions Residential Partners Partnership (“IHS Residential Partners”) began operations in November 2013. IHS Residential Partners is a single-investor fund with a large North American institutional investor and is targeted at the emerging middle class in South Africa. At December 31, 2017, IHS and its partner had contributed approximately $68.0 million to the venture, financing investments in seven different projects totaling just under 2,100 rental units and one undeveloped land project. We do not anticipate this venture making new investments.

  In managing these funds in 2017, we were paid asset management fees and, in most cases, earned a return on our co-investment and had the opportunity to earn performance fees after various investment hurdles are met.  Additionally, throughout 2017, IHS PM provided property management services to a substantial portion of the properties in our IHS-managed funds.    On January 8, 2018, the Company conveyed its asset management business and ownership interests in IHS and IHS PM to Hunt as part of the Disposition, although the Company retained an 11.85% ownership interest in SAWHF, related financing for that investment and a foreign currency hedge agreement for risk management purposes.  Refer to the discussion in “Sale of Certain Business Lines and Assets” in Part I of this Report for more information.
 Corporate Operations
 In 2017, our Corporate Operations segment was responsible for accounting, reporting, compliance and financial planning and analysis services.  
 At December 31, 2017, this segment had interests in cash; certain interest rate derivative instruments; leases; furniture, fixtures and equipment; and various prepaid assets.  
 At December 31, 2017, the primary obligations of this segment included subordinated debt.  Refer to Liquidity and Capital Resources, as well as to Consolidated Financial Statements – Note 5, “Debt,” for more information about the Company’s debt obligations that were outstanding as of December 31, 2017.  
 On January 8, 2018, and as further discussed in “Sale of Certain Business Lines and Assets” in Part I of this Report, the Company engaged Hunt through the execution of the Management Agreement to externally manage the Company’s continuing operations.  All employees of the Company were hired by the External Manager.  Additionally, as part of the Disposition, the Company received a $57 million note receivable from the Buyer and conveyed certain leases, furniture, fixtures and equipment.  
 Competition
 In our Leveraged Bond business line of our U.S. Operations, we face competition from numerous financial institutions, including banks, government-sponsored enterprises, mutual funds and asset management companies, related to the debt and equity that we invest in real estate related assets.  Prior to the sale of our LIHTC business line on January 8, 2018, we faced similar competition in that business line.  
 In our Energy Capital business line of our U.S. Operations, we face competition from banks and other renewable energy lenders related to the loans we provide to develop and build renewable energy systems.  As further discussed in “Sale of Certain Business Lines and Assets” in Part I of this Report, the Company sold on January 8, 2018, the loan origination, servicing and management components of its Energy Capital business line to Hunt as part of the Disposition.  However, the Company still faces competition subsequent to the Disposition related to new investments made by our Energy Capital business line.  
 In our International Operations, our primary activity in 2017 was making workforce housing investments in South Africa for the funds and ventures we invest in and manage.  We competed against other investors, developers and companies to acquire, develop and manage similar housing investments.  We also competed against other asset managers in raising capital and making investments.  However, as further discussed in “Sale of Certain Business Lines and Assets” in Part I of this Report, the Company sold its International Operations to Hunt and, therefore, we no longer face competition to make workforce housing investments.

While we have historically been able to compete effectively against such competitors as a result of our service, reputation, access to investor capital and longstanding relationships with developers, many of our competitors benefit from substantial economies of scale in their business and have other competitive advantages.  The Company’s ability to compete has also historically depended on its ability to attract and retain professional and other personnel.  However, as further discussed in “Sale of Certain Business Lines and Assets” in Part I of this Report, the Company engaged Hunt on January 8, 2018, to externally manage the Company’s continuing operations while all employees of the Company were hired by the External Manager.  Therefore, our ability to compete depends on the performance of the External Manager.
 Employees  

At December 31, 2017, we had 216 employees, which included 30 employees in our U.S. and Corporate Operations and 186 employees in our International Operations (the latter headcount includes 150 employees of IHS PM).  At December 31, 2017, none of these employees were party to any collective bargaining agreements.
 On January 8, 2018, and as further discussed in “Sale of Certain Business Lines and Assets” in Part I of this Report, the Company engaged Hunt through the execution of the Management Agreement to externally manage the Company’s continuing operations.  All employees of the Company were hired by the External Manager.
