 Since the Company is not building a supply chain it believes the following:
 ●
 It carries much less facilities and labor liability.
 ●
 It chooses transactions with least capital exposure by utilizing fast computing, discovering minimum costs and maximum exit.
 ●
 Its delivered price will normally fall beneath our competitors' using less efficient methods of partnerships and cooperative pricing tactics.
 
Finding opposing targets and intelligence

Competition 
The construction industry is highly competitive and the markets in which we compete have numerous and often large companies that provide similar services. In certain end markets there are competitors with significantly greater capabilities and resources. In our construction segment, we compete with a variety of national and regional contractors. We believe price, experience, reputation, responsiveness, customer relationships, project completion track record and quality of work are key factors in customers awarding contracts across our end markets.
Large Traders
 
Strengths: Massive capitalization, large ground operations
 Weaknesses: Focused and specialized often geographically, leaving many opportunities. 
 SoOum Strategy: Take a small, individual, portion of an aggregate opportunity field. Spread across all commodities and focus on economics then transactions.

Medium-Size Traders
 
Strengths: More liquidity, well equipped
 Weaknesses: In the long term these forms tend to become more specialized, finding themselves in direct competition of Large Traders. There being little focus on economic trends these companies normally begin specializing within one or few sectors.
 SoOum Strategy: Do not compete head to head in these tight margin specializations but adjust to technological signals of superior opportunity within specific regions or commodities.

Non-Profit Organizations
 
Strengths: Access to capitalization, focus on humanitarian effort, governmental backing
 Weakness: Incentive to find and close opportunity is low. Technology not meeting demand. 
 SoOum Strategy: Work closely with NGO's gleaning intelligence to feed a competitive system in recognizing demand and supply shifts, trends leading to shortage or surplus and methods advice for entering a new markets.
