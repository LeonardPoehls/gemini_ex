ITEM 1 | BUSINESS.
-------+----------

Our Corporate History and Background
 
We were incorporated in the State of Nevada on September 5, 2013.  Our original business plan was to sell freshly squeezed juices from mobile stands in London, United Kingdom, but this business was not successful and we did not generate any revenue from this business.
 
On October 28, 2016, Roman Ehlert, our sole director, officer and principal stockholder, transferred an aggregate of 6,000,000 shares of our common stock, representing approximately 73.98% of our issued and outstanding capital stock on a fully-diluted basis, to Jun Chen, Jian Xiong, Guili Xiong, Shuwen Du, Lianze Xiong, Gang Deng, Guoping Wang, Zhongnan Liu, Yue Wang, Yebiao Ding, Xiuyuan Bai and Jiahong Du, for an aggregate purchase price of $228,000, which resulted in a change of control of our company. Mr. Ehlert resigned as our sole director and officer upon closing of this transaction and appointed Mr. Jun Chen as our sole director, Chief Executive Officer, President and Chief Financial Officer.
 
On December 16, 2016, we entered into a securities purchase agreement with PGL and its shareholders, pursuant to which we agreed to acquire 100% of the issued and outstanding shares of PGL in exchange for 500,000,000 shares of our common stock.  On the same date, Mr. Jun Chen resigned as our sole officer, effective as of December 19, 2016, but continued to serve as a member of our board of directors. Mr. Zonghua Chen was appointed as our Chief Executive Officer, President and Chief Financial Officer effective as of December 19, 2016.  In addition, effective as of December 19, 2016, our board of directors was increased from one to five members and Zonghua Chen and Maozi Cong were appointed to our board, with two vacancies remaining, and Mr. Zonghua Chen was appointed as the Chairman.
 
 On April 7, 2017, we completed the acquisition of PGL and as a result, PGL became our wholly-owned subsidiary and the former shareholders of PGL became the holders of approximately 98.4% of our issued and outstanding capital stock on a fully-diluted basis.  For accounting purposes, the transaction with PGL was treated as a reverse acquisition, with PGL as the acquirer and the Company as the acquired party.  Unless the context suggests otherwise, when we refer in this report to business and financial information for periods prior to the consummation of the reverse acquisition, we are referring to the business and financial information of PGL and its consolidated subsidiaries.
 
Also on April 7, 2017, we changed our fiscal year end from February 28 to December 31.  This change was being effectuated in connection with the aforementioned reverse acquisition.
 
We changed our name to Porter Holding International, Inc. on May 8, 2017 to more accurately reflect our new business.


As described below in more detail, through our PRC VIEs that have contractual arrangements with PGL’s subsidiary, Qianhai Porter, we are at the early stage of developing our O2O (Online to Offline) business and our goal is to become a leading innovative O2O business platform operator providing both online E-commerce and offline physical business facilities to our customers.
 
Our Corporate Structure
 
PRC laws and regulations prohibit or restrict foreign ownership of companies that operate Internet information and content, Internet access, online games, mobile, value added telecommunications and certain other businesses in which we are engaged or could be deemed to be engaged.  Consequently, we conduct certain of our operations and businesses in the PRC through our VIEs.
 
PGL, a Seychelles holding company, was formed on October 13, 2016. The share capital of the company is $50,000 divided into 500,000,000 ordinary shares of $0.0001 par value each.  On December 6, 2016, the authorized and issued capital of PGL increased to $725,000 divided into 7,250,000,000 shares with a par value of $0.0001 each.  PGL was owned and controlled by the same control group as PPBGL and Portercity.
 
On November 29, 2016, Mr. Zongiian Chen, the sole shareholder of PPBGL, transferred 100% of the outstanding shares of PPBGL to PGL. The share transfer has been accounted for as a common control transaction. Other than its 100% ownership of PPBGL, PGL has no significant assets and no other business operations.
 
PPBGL was incorporated in Hong Kong on September 21, 2016 as a company with limited liability as an investment holding company. Upon incorporation, PPBGL issued 1 ordinary share at HK$1.  Also on September 21, 2016, an additional 9,999 ordinary shares were issued, and Mr. Zongjian Chen held all the 10,000 ordinary shares of PPBGL on behalf of the original investors of Portercity.  PPBGL is currently controlled by Mr. Zongjian Chen and other investors and has no significant assets or business operations.

Qianhai Porter was incorporated in the PRC as a wholly foreign-owned enterprise with limited liability on November 21, 2016. Qianhai Porter was set up by PPBGL. Qianhai Porter was incorporated to control the shareholders’ voting interests in Portercity and become the primary beneficiary of Portercity and its wholly owned subsidiaries, Porter E-Commerce, Porter Consulting and Porter Commercial.
 
Portercity was held by Mr. Zonghua Chen (brother of Mr. Zongjian Chen) and Ms. Xiaomei Xiong (spouse of Mr. Zongjian Chen) on behalf of other investors, including Mr. Zonghua Chen himself.
 
On December 1, 2016, Portercity acquired a 100% equity interest in Porter Consulting, from Shenzhen Porter Holdings Co., Ltd., for a cash consideration of $144,154 (RMB1,000,000).
 
On December 15, 2016, our indirectly wholly-owned Chinese subsidiary, Qianhai Porter, Portercity and the shareholders of Portercity entered into the following commercial arrangements, or collectively, VIE Agreements, pursuant to which we have contractual rights to control and operate the businesses of Portercity and Portercity’s three Chinese subsidiaries, Porter E-Commerce, Porter Consulting and Porter Commercial:
 
  
· | Pursuant to a commission management and consulting services agreement, or the Service Agreement, Qianhai Porter agreed to act as the exclusive management and advisory consultant of Portercity and provide client management, marketing promotion counseling, corporate management and counseling, finance counseling and personnel training services to Portercity. In exchange, Portercity agreed to pay Qianhai Porter a management and consulting fee to be equivalent to the amount of net profit before tax of Portercity; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Pursuant to an exclusive right and option to purchase agreement, or the Option Agreement, the shareholders of Portercity granted to Qianhai Porter the exclusive right and option to purchase, at any time during the term of the Option Agreement, all of the assets of and equity interests shares in Portercity, at the exercise price equal to the lowest possible price permitted by Chinese laws;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Pursuant to a shareholders’ voting rights proxy agreement, or the Voting Rights Agreement, each of the shareholders of Portercity irrevocably appointed the representatives designated by Qianhai Porter to exercise its exclusive voting right of shareholders in the general meeting of shareholders of Portercity; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Pursuant to an equity interest pledge agreement, the Pledge Agreement, the shareholders of Portercity pledged all of the equity interests in Portercity and any and all legitimate income generated from such equity interests to Qianhai Porter to ensure the rights, privileges and concessions of Qianhai Porter under this and the above contractual arrangements.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



The foregoing description of the VIE Agreements is qualified in its entirety by reference to the text of the VIE Agreements, a copy of each of the VIE Agreements is incorporated by reference as Exhibits 10.1 through 10.4 hereto.
 
As a result of the above contractual arrangements, or the Contractual Arrangements, we maintain substantial control over the VIEs’ daily operations and financial affairs, election of their senior executives and all matters requiring shareholder approval.  Furthermore, as the primary beneficiary of the VIEs, we are entitled to consolidate the financial results of the VIEs in our own consolidated financial statements under Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standard Codification (ASC) Topic 810 and related subtopics related to the consolidation of variable interest entities, or ASC Topic 810.
 
In the opinion of Guang Dong LianRui Law Firm, our PRC legal counsel:
 
  
· | the ownership structures of our wholly-foreign owned enterprise and VIEs in China do not and will not violate any applicable PRC law, regulation, or rule currently in effect; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the contractual arrangements between our material wholly-foreign owned enterprise, our material variable interest entity and the variable interest entity equity holders governed by PRC laws are valid, binding and enforceable in accordance with their terms and applicable PRC laws, rules, and regulations currently in effect, and will not violate any applicable PRC law, regulation, or rule currently in effect.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



However, we have been further advised by our PRC legal counsel, Guang Dong LianRui Law Firm, that there are substantial uncertainties regarding the interpretation and application of current and future PRC laws, rules and regulations. Accordingly, the PRC regulatory authorities may, in the future, take a view that is contrary to the opinion of our PRC legal counsel. We have been further advised by our PRC legal counsel that if the PRC government finds that the agreements that establish the structure for operating our Internet-based business do not comply with PRC government restrictions on foreign investment in the aforesaid business we engage in, we could be subject to severe penalties including being prohibited from continuing operations. See “Risk Factors — Risks Relating to our Commercial Relationship with VIEs.”

 Our Business Plan
 
With the development of the mobile internet, e-commerce and social networks, the online and offline worlds are becoming increasingly more integrated.  O2O, standing for “online to offline”, is a term often used to describe a variety of e-commerce services that provide online information, services, or discounts to end-consumers that enhance their offline shopping experiences. The O2O business mode makes the shopping experience easier for both the merchants and end-consumers, with the ultimate goal to entice end-consumers to go to physical stores of merchants.  O2O can play a useful role in two forms of commerce: one is Online to Offline, the typical application scenarios where customers purchase a product or book a service online, and then go to an offline store to enjoy the face-to-face service or pick up the product.  However, the O2O commerce solutions industry in China is still in its early stages of development and is heavily fragmented with a wide range of services being introduced.  The O2O category stretches to include on-demand services like Didi Chuxing, the Chinese equivalent of Uber, Meituan and Dianping, China’s Groupon and Yelp, as well as click-and-collect services offered by traditional brick-and-mortar retailers. In China O2O also covers all manner of services that might not be cost effective to offer in Western markets, including pick-up dry cleaning, home haircuts or wholesale and fresh market delivery services.
 
As a newly established company with limited operation history, we are at the early stage of developing our O2O business and our goal is to become a leading innovative O2O business platform operator providing both online E- commerce and offline physical business facilities to our merchant customers, where they can conduct business, interact with their existing and potential end-consumers face to face.  Different from most other O2O companies, which often lack of integrated platforms, our goal is to provide one-stop services for our customers through our integrated online and offline platforms.  As described fully below, we are developing and intend to offer products and services including both hosting our online marketplaces, www.pt37.com and www.17yugo.com for our merchant clients to post and sell their products and services online and managing and operating physical business facilities, Porter City, that our online merchant clients can utilize to conduct their businesses offline.  We are currently developing merchant clients who are engaged in businesses including manufacturing, real estate, trade and financing.  In the future, we intend to expand our merchant client base to industries of big data, new materials, new energy, green food and environment protection.
 
Specifically, we are currently developing and plan to provide following core products and services to our customers:
 
Online Product-www.pt37.com
 
Our pt37.com platform, registered as being qualified for ICP, is a commercial cloud platform to provide free services to various small and medium size merchants.   We provide platform-hosting services to our merchant customers who can post their company profile and business opportunities, list their products and services and products or services that they are seeking.  Each product page contains pictures of the product, the price, specifications of the product and consumer reviews and ratings. Depending on the type of product, there will be additional information to help the customer make a purchase decision or recommendations of similar products. Currently, listings on the pt37.com online marketplace cover categories such as Books, Video, Instruments, Home Appliance, Electronics, Home Furniture, Clothes, Automotive, Toys, Foods and Beauty.  Within each main content category, information is further sorted into sub-categories with various search criteria and parameters to allow users to refine their information search and increase the relevancy of their search results.  End-consumers may pay online at the time they place their order, using third-party online payment platforms such as Alipay, Wechat Pay and UnionPay.  We have not but may decide to charge our merchant clients fees in the future according to their trading volumes.
 
We currently have more than 9 million registered merchant members, among which starting in 2017, we plan to select and recommend certain amount of high-quality companies to set up physical presence, such as business centers, offices and stores, in our offline business facilities we plan to develop, Porter City, for their global production, trade and financial management activities.
 
In addition, starting 2018, on a fixed monthly fee basis, we plan to provide value-added services to our merchant members through www.pt37.com, such as online advertisement and brand promotion.
 
Online Product -www.17yugo.com
 
Our 17yugo.com platform, registered as being qualified for ICP, is developed specifically for the merchants that have physical presence at our offline product, Porter City.  Similar as our PT37.com platform, our merchant customers can post their company related information and list their products and services.  We plan to charge each merchant who registers on this website between RMB 50,000 to 100,000 as deposits.  As the platform provider and operator, we intend to provide our integrated end-to-end e-commerce support covering IT solutions, store operations, online marketing, customer services and online payment and settlement.  In addition to maintaining the website, as a part of our value-added services, we intend to deploy our big data collection technologies, analyze online and offline businesses’ operational data and customers’ consumption data and provide data analysis services to our merchant customers to help them manage their business operations and sales channel and customers expansion.  We also plan to develop and offer various financial products and services to our merchant customers such as loans and credits to support their business development.

Offline Product — Porter City
 
We currently do not own or operate any offline physical business facilities.  Porter City is our offline physical business facilities product that we plan to partner with real property owners and real estate developers to develop and offer to our online merchant customers so that they can interact with their customers directly.  These facilities are expected to have a total construction area in the range of one million to four million square meters and will be located in various geographic areas globally.  We currently plan to establish about 13 to 15 Porter City facilities, including 7 in China.  We do not intend to be engaged in the business of real estate development in connection with our Porter City product.  Instead, our business partners will provide real properties and conduct the real estate development.  After the business facilities are constructed, we will act as the property operator to manage and maintain these facilities.
 
To satisfy diverse demands of various merchant clients and end-customers, in each Porter City facility, we plan to set up enterprise headquarters, procurement centers, enterprise CEO clubs, innovation centers, warehouses and logistics, exhibition centers, culture travel streets and business service centers.  We believe such flexibility is a key to our future success.  Porter City will allow end-consumers to browse and review business information of our merchant customers online and then come in to the stores, business centers and other physical facilities in Porter City to complete their business transactions and activities.  By managing and maintain these physical facilities, we believe we will facilitate these kinds of modern merchandising methods.  In addition, in the next few years we plan to provide logistic support to help our merchant clients fulfill orders and deliver their products to end consumers.
 
Sales and Marketing
 
Currently, we focus our marketing and promotion on our online and offline products, namely, PT37.com platform, 17yugo.com platform and Porter City.  We have 15 experienced sales and marketing personnel who are responsible for marketing activities, market research, promotion and advertisement.   We employ a variety of programs and marketing activities to promote recognition of our brand and our products.  We conduct merchant related marketing events, such as seminars and workshops, where we meet with local merchants to share insights in the industries, introduce and promote our online and offline products to deepen our relationship with the merchant network.  In addition, we participate in international trade shows and conferences such as the UN New Economy Forum to increase our visibility and promote our brand internationally.  We also take advantage of our two online platforms, www.pt37.com and www.17yugo.com, to advertise and introduce our business plan and services that we intend to provide through our offline Porter City.
Our Customers
 
Currently, through our VIE entity, Porter Consulting, we partner with China Payment, a third-party online payment service provider, to promote China Payment’s online payment platform to companies and businesses in Shenzhen and in return share a portion of the processing fees earned by China Payment as commission. 
 
In addition, Porter Consulting partners with Shenzhen Tongfu, a third-party online payment service provider, under which Porter Consulting agreed to promote Shenzhen Tongfu’s online payment platform, including the Point of Sale (POS) system, to companies and businesses in China and in return obtain a certain amount of commission based on the volume of trading through such online payment platform.

 We registered www.17yugo.com and www.pt37.com as our domain names on March 16, 2010 and September 16, 2008, respectively.
 
For the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, we did not incur any research and development expenses.
 
Our Competition
 
Our competitors in China include (i) major e-commerce companies, such as Alibaba Group, which operates taobao.com and tmall.com, and JD.com, Inc.; (2) major traditional brick and mortar shopping centers that aim to offer a one-stop shopping experience, such as Walmart China supercenters and Mixc malls.  We believe that the principal competitive factors in our industry include network coverage, brand recognition and reputation, product quality, selection and pricing and quality of customer service.  While many of our current or potential competitors have substantially greater financial and technical resources, longer operating histories and more established brand names and relationships than we do, we are confident that our business model will offer our customers one-stop services at a relatively low price and accordingly enhance our competitive position.
Regulation
 
Because all of our operating entities are located in the PRC, we are regulated by the national and local laws of the PRC. This section summarizes the major PRC regulations relating to our business.
The Telecommunications Regulations
 
The Telecommunications Regulations, promulgated by the PRC State Council on September 25, 2000 and amended on February 6, 2016, set out the general framework under which domestic Chinese companies such as the Company’s PRC subsidiaries and VIEs may engage in various types of telecommunications services in the PRC.  The regulations reiterate the long-standing principle that telecommunications service providers need to obtain operating licenses as a mandatory precondition to begin operation in this sector in China.  The Chinese government restricts foreign investment in Internet-related businesses.  Accordingly, we operate our Internet-related businesses in China through Portercity, our VIE operating in Shenzhen China.
Industry Catalogue Relating to Foreign Investment
 
The Guidance Catalogue of Industries for Foreign Investment, or the Catalogue, was promulgated and has been amended from time to time by the Ministry of Commerce and the National Development and Reform Commission. In Catalogue, Industries for foreign investment are divided into three categories: encouraged, restricted and prohibited.  Establishment of wholly foreign-owned enterprises is generally allowed in encouraged industries. Some restricted industries are limited to equity or contractual joint ventures, while in some cases Chinese partners are required to hold the majority interests in such joint ventures. In addition, restricted category projects are subject to higher-level government approvals. Foreign investors are not allowed to invest in industries in the prohibited category. Industries not listed in the Catalogue are generally open to foreign investment unless specifically restricted by other PRC regulations.
 

8
 


Through our subsidiaries and VIEs, we are engaged in certain industries that are classified as “restricted” or “prohibited” under the Catalogue. Pursuant to the latest Catalogue amended in March 2015, the provision of value-added telecommunications services falls in the restricted category and the percentage of foreign ownership cannot exceed 50% (excluding e-commerce).
 
Under PRC law, the establishment of a wholly foreign owned enterprise is subject to the approval of the Ministry of Commerce or its local counterparts and the wholly foreign owned enterprise must register with the competent industry and commerce bureau.
 
Foreign Investment in Value-Added Telecommunications Businesses
 
The Regulations for Administration of Foreign-invested Telecommunications Enterprises promulgated by the PRC State Council in December 2001 and subsequently amended in February 2016 set forth detailed requirements with respect to capitalization, investor qualifications and application procedures in connection with the establishment of a foreign-invested telecommunications enterprise. These regulations prohibit a foreign entity from owning more than 50% of the total equity interest in any value-added telecommunications service business in China and require the major foreign investor in any value-added telecommunications service business in China have a good and profitable record and operating experience in this industry.
The Measures for the Administration of Internet Information Services
 
The governing law for Internet information service is the Measures for the Administration of Internet Information Services, or the Internet Content Provider (“ICP”) Measures, which went into effect on September 25, 2000. Under the ICP Measures, any entity that provides information to online Internet users must obtain an operating license from Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (“MIIT”) or its local branch at the provincial level in accordance with the Telecom Regulations described above. The ICP
 
Measures further stipulate that entities providing online information services in areas of news, publishing, education, medicine, health, pharmaceuticals and medical equipment must obtain permission from responsible national authorities prior to applying for an operating license from MIIT or its local branch at the provincial or municipal level. Moreover, ICPs must display their operating license numbers in a conspicuous location on their websites.  ICPs must police their websites to remove categories of harmful content that are broadly defined. Currently, our VIE, Portercity holds an ICP license which was issued on March 7, 2014, expiring on March 7, 2019.
 
Online Privacy
 
Chinese law does not prohibit internet service providers from collecting and analyzing personal information from their users if the users agree to do so. The PRC government, however, has the power and authority to order internet service providers to submit personal information of an internet user if such user posts any prohibited content or engages in illegal activities on the internet.
 
Under the Several Provisions on Regulating the Market Order of Internet Information Services (“Order”) promulgated by the MIIT which became effective on March 15, 2012, internet service providers may not, without a user’s consent, collect the user’s personal information that can be used, alone or in combination with other information, to identify the user, and may not provide any user’s personal information to third parties without the prior consent of the user. Internet service providers may only collect users’ personal information necessary to provide their services and must expressly inform the users of the method, scope and purpose of the collection and processing of such information. They are also required to ensure the proper security of users’ personal information, and take immediate remedial measures if such information is suspected to have been inappropriately disclosed. When a User registers to our application, we require our users to accept a user agreement whereby they agree to provide certain personal information to us. We will take other measures as necessary to comply with these provisions.
 
ICPs are also required to establish and publish their rules relating to personal information collection or use, keep any collected information strictly confidential, and take technological and other measures to maintain the security of such information. ICP operators are required to cease any collection or use of the user personal information, and de-register the relevant user account, when a given user stops using the relevant Internet service. ICP operators are further prohibited from divulging, distorting or destroying any such personal information, or selling or providing such information unlawfully to other parties. In addition, if an ICP operator appoints an agent to undertake any marketing and technical services that involve the collection or use of personal information, the ICP operator is still required to supervise and manage the protection of the information. As to penalties, in very broad terms, the Order states that violators may face warnings, fines, and disclosure to the public and, in most severe cases, criminal liability.

Foreign Currency Exchange
 
Under the Foreign Currency Administration Rules promulgated in 1996 and revised in 1997, and various regulations issued by SAFE and other relevant PRC government authorities, RMB is convertible into other currencies without prior approval from SAFE only to the extent of current account items, such as trade related receipts and payments, interest and dividends and after complying with certain procedural requirements. The conversion of RMB into other currencies and remittance of the converted foreign currency outside PRC for the purpose of capital account items, such as direct equity investments, loans and repatriation of investment, requires the prior approval from SAFE or its local office. Payments for transactions that take place within China must be made in RMB. Unless otherwise approved, PRC companies must repatriate foreign currency payments received from abroad. Foreign-invested enterprises may retain foreign exchange in accounts with designated foreign exchange banks subject to a cap set by SAFE or its local office. Unless otherwise approved, domestic enterprises must convert all of their foreign currency proceeds into RMB.
 
On October 21, 2005, SAFE issued the Notice on Issues Relating to the Administration of Foreign Exchange in Fund-raising and Reverse Investment Activities of Domestic Residents Conducted via Offshore Special Purpose Companies, which became effective as of November 1, 2005. According to the notice, a special purpose company, or SPV, refers to an offshore company established or indirectly controlled by PRC residents for the special purpose of carrying out financing of their assets or equity interest in PRC domestic enterprises. Prior to establishing or assuming control of an SPV, each PRC resident, whether a natural or legal person, must complete the overseas investment foreign exchange registration procedures with the relevant local SAFE branch. The notice applies retroactively. As a result, PRC residents who have established or acquired control of these SPVs that previously made onshore investments in China were required to complete the relevant overseas investment foreign exchange registration procedures by March 31, 2006. These PRC residents must also amend the registration with the relevant SAFE branch in the following circumstances: (i) the PRC residents have completed the injection of equity investment or assets of a domestic company into the SPV; (ii) the overseas funding of the SPV has been completed; (iii) there is a material change in the capital of the SPV. Under the rules, failure to comply with the foreign exchange registration procedures may result in restrictions being imposed on the foreign exchange activities of the violator, including restrictions on the payment of dividends and other distributions to its offshore parent company, and may also subject the violators to penalties under the PRC foreign exchange administration regulations.
 
On August 29, 2008, SAFE promulgated Circular 142 which regulates the conversion by a foreign-funded enterprise of foreign currency into RMB by restricting how the converted RMB may be used. In addition, SAFE promulgated Circular 45 on November 9, 2011 in order to clarify the application of Circular 142. Under Circular 142 and Circular 45, the RMB capital converted from foreign currency registered capital of a foreign-invested enterprise may only be used for purposes within the business scope approved by the applicable government authority and may not be used for equity investments within the PRC. In addition, SAFE strengthened its oversight of the flow and use of the RMB capital converted from foreign currency registered capital of foreign-invested enterprises. The use of such RMB capital may not be changed without SAFE’s approval, and such RMB capital may not in any case be used to repay RMB loans if the proceeds of such loans have not been used. Violations of Circular 142 and Circular 45 could result in severe penalties, such as heavy fines as set out in the relevant foreign exchange control regulations.  On July 4, 2014, SAFE promulgated SAFE Circular 36, which launched a pilot reform of the administration of the settlement of the foreign exchange capitals of foreign-invested enterprises in certain designated areas from August 4, 2014. However, SAFE Circular 36 continues to prohibit foreign-invested enterprises from directly or indirectly using the Renminbi converted from their foreign exchange capitals for purposes beyond its business scope.  On March 30, 2015, SAFE promulgated Circular 19, to expand the reform nationwide. Circular 19 will come into force and replace both Circular 142 and Circular 36 on June 1, 2015. Circular 36 allows enterprises established within the pilot areas to use their foreign exchange capitals to make equity investment and removes certain other restrictions provided under Circular 142 for these enterprises. Circular 19 will remove those restrictions for all foreign-invested enterprises established in the PRC. However, both Circular 36 and Circular 19 continue to prohibit foreign-invested enterprises from, among other things, using the Renminbi fund converted from its foreign exchange capitals for expenditure beyond its business scope, providing entrusted loans or repaying loans between non-financial enterprises.
 
Dividend Distributions
 
Under applicable PRC regulations, FIEs in China may pay dividends only out of their accumulated profits, if any, determined in accordance with PRC accounting standards and regulations. In addition, a FIE in China is required to set aside at least 10% of its after-tax profit based on PRC accounting standards each year to its general reserves until the accumulative amount of such reserves reach 50% of its registered capital. These reserves are not distributable as cash dividends. The board of directors of a FIE has the discretion to allocate a portion of its after-tax profits to staff welfare and bonus funds, which may not be distributed to equity owners except in the event of liquidation.

After-tax profits/losses with respect to the payment of dividends out of accumulated profits and the annual appropriation of after-tax profits as calculated pursuant to PRC accounting standards and regulations do not result in significant differences as compared to after-tax earnings as presented in our financial statements. However, there are certain differences between PRC accounting standards and regulations and U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, arising from different treatment of items such as amortization of intangible assets and change in fair value of contingent consideration rising from business combinations.
 
In addition, under the EIT Law, the Notice of the State Administration of Taxation on Negotiated Reduction of Dividends and Interest Rates, which was issued on January 29, 2008, the Arrangement between the PRC and the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region on the Avoidance of Double Taxation and Prevention of Fiscal Evasion, which became effective on December 8, 2006, and the Notice of the State Administration of Taxation Regarding Interpretation and Recognition of Beneficial Owners under Tax Treaties, which became effective on October 27, 2009, dividends from our PRC operating subsidiaries paid to us through our Hong Kong subsidiary may be subject to a withholding tax at a rate of 10%, or at a rate of 5% if our Hong Kong subsidiary is considered a “beneficial owner” that is generally engaged in substantial business activities and entitled to treaty benefits under the Arrangement between the PRC and the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region on the Avoidance of Double Taxation and Prevention of Fiscal Evasion.
 
Laws and Regulations Related to Employment and Labor Protection
 
On June 29, 2007, the National People’s Congress promulgated the Employment Contract Law of PRC (“Employment Contract Law”), which became effective as of January 1, 2008 and amended on December 28, 2012. The Employment Contract Law requires employers to provide written contracts to their employees, restricts the use of temporary workers and aims to give employees long-term job security.
 
Pursuant to the Employment Contract Law, employment contracts lawfully concluded prior to the implementation of the Employment Contract Law and continuing as of the date of its implementation shall continue to be performed. Where an employment relationship was established prior to the implementation of the Employment Contract Law but no written employment contract was concluded, a contract must be concluded within one month after its implementation.
 
On September 18, 2008, the State Council promulgated the Implementing Regulations for the PRC Employment Contract Law which came into effect immediately. These regulations interpret and supplement the provisions of the Employment Contract Law.
 
Our standard employment contract complies with the requirements of the Employment Contract Law and its implementing regulations. We have entered into written employment contracts with all of our employees.
