ITEM 1. | BUSINESS.
--------+----------

General 
 We were incorporated on February 20, 2001 under the laws of the State of Nevada. We are an exploration stage mineral exploration company focused on the discovery and extraction of precious metals from mineral deposits in the Southwestern United States. 
 In February 2008, we acquired our lead project, a prospective gold, silver and calcium carbonate property located in Esmeralda County, Nevada, that we call the Columbus Project. The Columbus Project consists of 138 mineral claims covering approximately 6,778 acres, plus an additional 80 acres of private land, for a total of 6,858 acres including a 380 acre Permitted Mine Area (60-acre mill site and mill facility, 266-acre mine site with 54 acres defined as undisturbed area). Our current permits allow us to mine up to 792,000 tons per year to 40 feet in depth for the purpose of extracting precious metals and calcium carbonate from the Permitted Mine Area. In addition, we own 80 acres of land in the southeast quadrant of the project. Our current exploration efforts are focused on the North and South Sand Zones of the Columbus Project. 

 Columbus Project Update
During fiscal 2016, we upgraded and calibrated new equipment at the Columbus Projects onsite laboratory to ensure the accuracy of our onsite testing procedures. We also installed new high capacity thermal pretreatment, leach (TPAC) and concentration circuit equipment at the onsite pilot plant capable of processing 500 lbs. of sands per test. Recent work at the onsite laboratory and the pilot plant has created a potential new source of additional value to the Columbus Project. Testing of the gold smelting process on materials thermally treated at the pilot plant has given rise to the development of a separate smelting step that has resulted in palladium (Pd) extraction rates significantly higher than previously identified. The discovery of material quantities of extractable Pd in both the sand and the concentrates is very significant to the project.
 Current, ongoing work at the Columbus Project is now being done to optimize the second smelting step for gold extraction. In addition, we expect to install larger furnaces at the onsite pilot plant to smelt increased quantities of concentrates that are expected to be produced from each run of the pilot plant. We are hopeful that the completion of this work will allow us to determine the economics of the process metallurgy and proposed extraction methodology.
 Recent Corporate Developments 
 The following significant corporate developments occurred since the completion of our fiscal year ended December 31, 2015:

Consultant Warrants
Effective February 26, 2016, we entered into a verbal agreement with Nanominerals Corp., pursuant to which we agreed to issue to Nanominerals share purchase warrants for the purchase of up to 4,500,000 shares of our common stock, exercisable at a price of $0.40 per share for a period expiring on February 28, 2020. These warrants were issued to Nanominerals in consideration for consulting services previously provided to us during the year ended December 31, 2015 with respect to the exploration and the underlying mineralogy and metallurgy of our Columbus Project in Esmeralda County, Nevada. 
 We also issued warrants for the purchase of an additional 450,000 shares of our common stock, also exercisable at $0.40 per share and expiring on February 28, 2020, to certain other consultants for services provided by them during the year ended December 31, 2015.
 Conversion of 2015 Special Warrants into Common Stock and Warrants
Effective February 28, 2016, a total of 21,025,000 special warrants issued by us in 2015 (the 2015 Special Warrants) were automatically converted into units (each a Unit) on a 1:1 basis without the payment of any additional consideration in accordance with the terms of the 2015 Special Warrants. Each Unit consisted of one share of our common stock and one warrant entitling the holder to purchase one additional share of common stock at a price of $0.40 per share, expiring on February 28, 2020. The 21,025,000 2015 Special Warrants converted represented all of the 2015 Special Warrants that were outstanding on that date. 
 Appointment of David Z. Strickler as Interim CFO
Robert D. McDougal, our former Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer, passed away on January 15, 2016. Mr. McDougal had served in those capacities, and as a member of our Board of Directors, since 2007.
 On April 13, 2016, David Z. Strickler, our Chief Operating Officer, was appointed as Interim CFO and Interim Treasurer. Mr. Strickler first joined our Company in March 2010 as our Vice President of Finance and Administration, and in April 2015, Mr. Strickler was appointed as our Chief Operating Officer.
 Abandonment of Certain Mineral Claims
On August 31, 2016 we elected to allow 328 mineral claims that previously formed part of the Columbus Project mineral property to lapse (the Abandoned Claims) by declining to pay the BLM maintenance fees for the Abandoned Claims. By allowing the Abandoned Claims to lapse, we saved approximately $133,000 per year in claim maintenance fees. The claims retained by us primarily represent the claims making up the northwestern quadrant of the Columbus Project, as previously constituted, and includes North and South Sand Zones, as well as the permitted mine area where our pilot plant is located. As currently constituted, the Columbus Project is comprised of 126 placer claims and 12 millsite claims covering approximately 6,778 acres, plus 80 acres of private land. 
 Resignation of Steven A. Klein as Director
Effective October 13, 2016, Steven A. Klein resigned from our Board of Directors. Mr. Kleins resignation did not result from any disagreement with the Company. 
 Reduced Warrant Exercise Price Offer
Effective December 27, 2016, our Board of Directors approved amendments to our 88,450,162 outstanding share purchase warrants (the Outstanding Warrants) to temporarily reduce the exercise price of the Outstanding Warrants to $0.08 per share (the Temporary Warrant Price Reduction) until 5:00 pm (Pacific Time) on January 31, 2017 (subsequently extended to February 17, 2017, as extended, the Reduced Price Deadline).
 In conjunction with amending the exercise price for the Outstanding Warrants, the Company extended the term of 48,366,829 Outstanding Warrants issued by the Company between 2007 and 2012 that were previously scheduled to expire on December 31, 2016 (collectively, the Expiring Warrants). The Expiring Warrants were extended to the Reduced Price Deadline. Any Expiring Warrants that were not exercised by the Reduced Price Deadline have expired and are no longer exercisable.

The Temporary Warrant Price Reduction was also approved for the Companys remaining 40,083,333 Outstanding Warrants that were not scheduled to expire prior to the Reduced Price Deadline (the Non-Expiring Warrants). Any Non-Expiring Warrants that were not exercised by the Reduced Price Deadline, are still exercisable in accordance with their original terms, including the exercise price set forth under the terms of the Non-Expiring Warrants. 
 A total of 38,455,921 shares were issued between January 20, 2017 and February 27, 2017 upon the exercise of Outstanding Warrants, for total gross proceeds of $3,076,473.
 Amendments to Outstanding Stock Options
In conjunction with Temporary Warrant Price Reduction, the Board also approved amendments to certain options granted under our 2007 Stock Incentive Plan (the Plan). We reduced the exercise price of 1,367,197 options granted under the Plan to directors and executive officers of the Company to $0.08 per share (the Temporary Option Price Reduction) that were scheduled to expire on December 31, 2016 (the Expiring D&O Plan Options) and extended the term of the Expiring D&O Plan Options to the Reduced Price Deadline. Expiring D&O Plan Options that were not exercised by the Reduced Price Deadline, expired and have ceased to be exercisable. No Expiring D&O Plan Options were exercised by the Reduced Price Deadline, and all Expiring D&O Plan Options have expired. 

 The Board also approved the Temporary Option Price Reduction for 7,600,000 options granted under the Plan to directors, executive officers and certain consultants that qualify as accredited investors as defined in Regulation D of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act) that were not expiring (the Amended Non-Expiring Plan Options). Amended Non-Expiring Plan Options not exercised by the Reduced Price Deadline, may still be exercised in accordance with their original terms, including satisfaction of any vesting requirements and payment of the exercise price set forth under the terms of their option grant. A total of 100,000 Amended Non-Expiring Plan Options were exercised by outside consultants of the Company before the Reduced Price Deadline. 

 The Board also approved an extension to 2,375,000 options granted under the Plan to former directors and officers (the Former D&O Options) to May 31, 2017. The exercise price of the Former D&O Options was not reduced, and are exercisable at the exercise price set forth under the terms of their option grant. As of the date of filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, a total of 500,000 Former D&O Options have been exercised at a price of $0.05 per share.
 2017 Option Grants
The Board has also approved the grant of 8,070,000 non-qualified stock options under the Plan, exercisable at a price of $0.08 per share to directors, executive officers, employees and consultants. Directors and executive officers were granted the following options:

Competition
 We are a mineral resource exploration company. We compete with other mineral resource exploration and development companies for the acquisition of new mineral properties, the services of contractors, equipment and financing. Many of the mineral resource exploration and development companies with whom we compete may have greater access to a limited supply of qualified technical personnel and contractors and to specialized equipment needed in the exploration, development and operation of mineral properties. This could have an adverse effect on our ability to explore and develop our properties in a timely manner. In addition, because many of our competitors are more established and have a longer operating history than us, they may have greater access to promising mineral properties.
 In addition, many of our competitors have greater financial resources than us. Accordingly, these competitors may be able to spend greater amounts on acquisitions of mineral properties of merit, on exploration of their mineral properties and on development of their mineral properties. In addition, they may be able to afford greater geological expertise in the targeting and exploration of mineral properties. This may make our competitors more attractive to potential investors and could adversely impact our ability to obtain additional financing if and when needed.
 Government Regulations 
 The mining industry in the United States is highly regulated. We intend to secure all necessary permits for the exploration of the Columbus Project and, if development is warranted on the properties, will file final plans of operation prior to starting any mining operations. The consulting geologists that we hire are experienced in conducting mineral exploration activities and are familiar with the necessary governmental regulations and permits required to conduct such activities. As such, we expect that our consulting geologists will inform us of any government permits that we will be required to obtain prior to conducting any planned activities on the Columbus Project. We are not able to estimate the full costs of complying with environmental laws at this time since the full nature and extent of our proposed mining activities cannot be determined until we complete our exploration program.
 If we enter into the development or production stages of any mineral deposits found on our mineral properties, of which there are no assurances, the cost of complying with environment laws, regulations and permitting requirements will be substantially greater than in the exploration phases because the impact on the project area is greater. Permits and regulations will control all aspects of any mineral deposit development or production program if the project continues to those stages because of the potential impact on the environment. Examples of regulatory requirements include:

- | Water discharge will have to meet water standards; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- | Dust generation will have to be minimal or otherwise remediated; 
- | Dumping of material on the surface will have to be recontoured and revegetated; 
- | An assessment that all material to be left on the surface will need to be environmentally benign; 
- | Ground water will have to be monitored for any potential contaminants; 
- | The socio- economic impact of the project will have to be evaluated and if deemed negative, will have to be remediated; and 
- | There will have to be a report of the potential impact of the work on the local fauna and flora. 

Employees
 As of the date of this Annual Report, other than our officers and directors, we have seven full-time employees.
