Item 1. Business 
Overview
 We were originally incorporated on September 20, 2004, in the State of Delaware under the name “Blog8.” Since incorporation, we have changed our name numerous times and have been known as “Securiteyes,” “Medify Solutions Limited,” “Petel Incorporated” and “Gleeworks, Inc.” We amended our Certificate of Incorporation and changed our name to Capital Art, Inc. on April 28, 2011.
 We currently are engaged in the business of selling and managing classic and contemporary, limited edition photographic images and reproductions, with a focus on iconic celebrity images, by acquiring ownership or rights to collections of rare iconic negatives and photographs. We also make available images for publications and merchandizing by third parties. Our business is in its early stages and consequently our financial results are difficult to compare from one period to the next. We expect such period-to-period differences to continue to be significant over the next several quarters, until we have a number of full years of operations.
 Our objective is to become the largest repository of archival pop culture photography in the online world. To this end, we have been and continue to search for photographic archives. We have amassed our current inventory and rights to photographic images and reproductions from a series of acquisitions that started in 2011. These past few years of acquisitions have resulted in an impressive collection for our company, including the rights to the Frank Worth collection, and the rights or ownership over hundreds of thousands of photos and negatives. Archived and stored in our warehouse are boxes of never seen before negatives, one-of-a kind prints and other memorabilia. We have rare images of celebrity icons, such as Elvis Presley, James Dean, Marilyn Monroe, and many others, which have never been seen by the public.
 As part of increasing our product offerings, we plan to continue our search for photographic archives that are undervalued by the market. These archives may be acquired outright or we may enter into representation or consignment agreements with the owners of the archives. These opportunities are typically (1) aging photographers who are looking to monetize their archive while still alive via a single large transaction, or (2) media companies that have aggregated assets (or rights to assets) and are seeking to dispose of the archive or a partner who can help them grow cash flows related to the archive. These opportunities exist both in the United States and abroad and we continue to search for value wherever it may be geographically located.
 Our business is to monetize the value of our collection. We sell our photographic images and reproductions through auctions, third-party galleries, art consultants, interior decorators and directly to consumers. We reach our customers through diverse marketing channels, including our websites, events and interactive campaigns. We also reproduce mass quantities of different photographs from our collection, which are sold through third party on-line retailers. We are continually exploring these and other marketing possibilities and we expect to continue our efforts to pursue contracts and to diversify our revenues.
 Our principal place of business is located at 6445 South Tenaya Way, Suite B-130, Las Vegas, NV 89113. General information about us can be found at www.capitalart.com. The information contained on or connected to our website is not incorporated by reference into this Annual Report on Form 10-K and should not be considered part of this or any other report filed with the SEC.
 
Business Strategy
 
Our business is generated through operations of our three divisions, including:
 

§ | Sale of original vintage prints. On May 11, 2015 we entered into an exclusive marketing agreement with a distributor to distribute our vintage original fine art prints to fine art dealers and collector auction houses, as well as private third party collectors. Under the terms of the agreement the distributor receives 50% of the gross receipts from sales generated by it.

§ | Sale of open addition prints and other digital images. Currently, we offer these on 10 different independent websites.

§ | Licensing of images.

Sales, Marketing and Distribution
 
We do not have an in-house sales staff. We reach our customers through diverse marketing channels, including our website, events and interactive campaigns. Marketing activities aim to build awareness for our brands and drive revenue by promoting newly acquired images as well as images existing in our collection.
 
As of the date of this Report we are in the process of setting up individual divisions to target the Interior Design industry, the Fund Raising industry and the Hospitality industry. We have exhibited at the World Market Place tradeshow twice in the past three years. Currently only a small percentage of our revenues is associated with these divisions. However, while no assurances can be provided, we expect significant growth over the next 3-5 years through interactive campaigns conducted with up to 50 unaffiliated online retainers, including 1stdibs and other targeted niche websites like art.com, paddle8.com, artnet.com and others.
 
We sell our photographic images and reproductions through auctions, third-party galleries, art consultants, interior decorators and directly to consumers. We also reproduce mass quantities of different photographs from our collection, which are sold through third party on-line retailers.
 
We have several websites, each targeted to specific consumers including high-end fine art, and lower end open edition prints. We have identified over 50 third-party online retailers that we can sell through and give a percentage of sales to each of the online retailers. These percentages usually average around 20%. We have several programs currently in place with websites including 1st dibs, stylemined, Lumas, art net and others and expect to expand these sales over the first 2 quarters of 2017. We have been targeting these sales channels for the past 2 years.
 
We expect to continue to pursue contracts to diversify revenues, and to develop additional websites for retail clients to purchase our prints, but also as a portal for our interior decorator, third party gallery and charity partners. The downside is that there are a limited number of interior decorators, galleries and charity partners which produce higher revenues than on-line sales, and while we actively pursue such contracts, our success will depend upon our ability to obtain such contracts for sales and also upon our ability to acquire a larger depository.
 
In November 2014 we entered into an agreement with Fiero LLC (“Fiero”) to have Fiero build a website that will act not only as a site for retail clients to purchase our prints, but also as a portal for our interior decorator, third party gallery and charity partners. The agreement provided for Fiero to provide website design, development, content management systems, ecommerce and auction integration and administration that includes behavioral design infrastructure and data integration with our internal systems. The agreement also provided for post-production support, hosting service, site monitoring and reporting functions. The total cost was $193,000, including a cash payment of $40,000 and the issuance of 510,000 shares of our Common Stock. Fiero ceased operations in December 2016, prior to fulfilling their obligations under the agreement. As of December 31, 2015, 170,000 shares of these common shares had been issued. Subsequently, we issued an additional 229,300 shares, leaving 110,700 shares unissued. We subsequently retained High Touch Solutions to handle our website design work. They do not charge to develop websites, but charges a monthly fee of $80 once the website is set up and approved. This fee includes service and support and we feel individual niche websites are the way to go moving forward.
 
On January 1, 2015, we entered in a 12-month agreement for non-exclusive investment banking advisory services with Vista Partners for total consideration of 2,000,000 shares of our Common Stock. The agreement was subsequently extended an additional 6-months with no other changes or consideration to the terms of the original agreement. The shares were payable within 14 days of the effective date of the agreement and deemed earned in full upon execution of the agreement. The shares were issued in May 2015. The agreement may be renewed for an additional 12-month term whereby we, in our sole discretion, may elect to pay the investment banking advisor $400,000 cash or an equivalent amount in shares of our common stock based upon the thirty day volume weighted average price for thirty trading days prior to renewal. This agreement was not extended.

We are exploring the possibility of opening company-owned galleries in Las Vegas and other major cities like Los Angeles. However, as of the date of this report we have no definitive plans or arrangements with respect to operating galleries. We are adding relationships with third party galleries, websites and interior decorators that can sell our images to their clients. We are also creating a charity sales plan whereby charities can use our photos for fund raising activities. We intend to make over 3 million images available for publication on a world-wide basis for print and digital licensing where we would be paid royalties when our photographs are used. We are also exploring the possibility of forming partnerships with major companies who can sell our prints to their client base on a revenue-split basis. These companies include Art.com and other online and bricks and mortar companies. There are no assurances these efforts will be successful.
 
Competition 
 
Most of our competitors have substantially greater financial, technical and human resources than we have. The market for iconic photographic images and related services is highly competitive. We believe that the principal competitive factors include name recognition, company reputation, the quality, relevance and breadth of the content in a company’s collections and the quality of contributing photographers and other partners under contract with a company. Additionally, we also face competition in connection with factors relating to the business and our infrastructure such as effective use of current and emerging technology, customer service and customer relationships, pricing and licensing models, policies and practices and accessibility of content and speed and ease of search and fulfillment.
 
Some of our current and potential significant competitors include other general visual content providers such as Corbis Corporation. We also face significant competition from specialized visual content companies that are well established in their local, content or product-specific market segments such as Reuters Group, the Associated Press, and ZUMA Press, Inc.
 
There are also hundreds, if not thousands, of small photography agencies, image content aggregators and individual photographers throughout the world with whom we compete.
 
Our competition includes retail photography galleries and websites selling photography such as art.com, artspace.com and rockpaperphoto.com. We believe that we are highly competitive because we own our photographic negatives and do not have to split sales proceeds with photographers who own their intellectual property rights, which is the industry standard.
 
Intellectual Property
 
Most of our collection of iconic photographic images were acquired and are owned by us. A small percentage of the images in our collection are obtained through reproduction or licensing agreements, wherein we pay a royalty based on the percentage of revenues we receive from the use of the licensed images. As such, currently such agreements are limited and not material.
 
To this end, we have been and continue to search for photographic archives. Based upon our successes over the past 18 months, we believe that these archives can be monetized multiple ways, through our collectibles, licensing and retail divisions, depending upon the structure and content of each archive. These archives may be purchased outright or we may enter into reproduction or licensing agreements with the owners of the archives. These opportunities are typically (1) photographers who are looking to monetize their archives, or (2) media companies that are either seeking to dispose of the archive or seeking a method to derive revenues from the archive. These opportunities exist both in the United States and abroad and we continue to search for value wherever it may be geographically located.
 
Our management believes that the market is significantly undervaluing physical photographic assets for both individual photographers seeking to monetize their collections and media companies seeking to dispose of their archives because of the investment required to digitize and then monetize them. We have created an infrastructure and workflow process in order to digitize these assets at a low cost which we believe gives us a competitive advantage for purchasing from all sources.

We utilize the following criteria when evaluating archives:
 

§ | The age of the archives;
--+-------------------------


§ | How/If the archive is organized;
--+---------------------------------


§ | The type of media in the archive;
--+----------------------------------


§ | The subject matter of the archive;
--+-----------------------------------


§ | The rarity of the subject matter;
--+----------------------------------


§ | The photographer(s) represented in the archive; and
--+----------------------------------------------------


§ | The nature and the strength of the rights associated with the archive.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------

 
In this respect single photographer archives are desirable because copyrights are often easily ascertained to be owned by the photographer. We can market and build the reputation of the photographer to enhance the value of the archive. In addition, we believe we can better control the market for the works of individual photographers. Reproduction and licensing agreements are often more desirable because they typically require low or no upfront cash commitments. In these agreements content providers are usually paid mostly through royalties on sales. Owning copyright or having rights to copyrights significantly impact our gross margins. On the other hand, purchasing copyrights outright while reducing cash, increases intangible assets and generates higher gross margins. Reproduction and licensing agreements do not significantly impact our balance sheet but generate much lower gross margins.
 
Our ability to acquire such depository is dependent on our ability to raise additional capital in order to have funds to make such acquisitions.
 
Employees
 
As of December 31, 2016, we had 3 employees, all of which were full-time, including one CEO, one marketing, and a business development person. We also utilize consultants on an as needed basis. None of our employees are members of any union. We believe our relationship with our employees is excellent.
Government Regulations
 
We are not subject to any extraordinary governmental regulations.
