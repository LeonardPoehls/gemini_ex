Item 1. | Business

General 
Corporate Capital Trust, Inc. (which is referred to in this report as “we,” “our,” “us” and “our company”) is a non-diversified closed-end management investment company that has elected to be regulated as a business development company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, or the “1940 Act.” Formed as a Maryland corporation on June 9, 2010, we are externally managed by KKR, a investment adviser registered with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). KKR is responsible for sourcing potential investments, conducting due diligence on prospective investments, analyzing investment opportunities, structuring investments and monitoring our portfolio on an ongoing basis. KKR also provides the administrative services necessary for our company to operate. 
Through November 2017 we were externally managed by CNL Fund Advisors Company (“CNL”) and KKR. CNL, which was our investment adviser, and KKR, which was our investment sub-adviser, are referred to in this report as our “Advisers.” On November 14, 2017, shares of our common stock commenced trading on the New York Stock Exchange (the "NYSE") with the ticker symbol “CCT” (the “Listing”). Concurrent with the Listing, KKR acquired certain of CNL’s assets primarily used in its role as our investment adviser, and in connection with that transaction, KKR became our sole investment adviser. In connection with the Listing, we entered into a new administrative services agreement with KKR pursuant to which KKR replaced CNL as our administrator.
 Our Common Stock Offering and Listing
In October 2016, we closed our continuous public offering of shares of common stock (the "Offering") to new investors. Throughout the course of the Offering, we sold 143.09 million shares of common stock (as adjusted for our reverse stock split) for gross proceeds of $3.44 billion, including the reinvestment of distributions. Since the close of the Offering we have continued to issue shares of our common stock pursuant to our distribution reinvestment plan. The Listing accomplished our goal of providing liquidity to our shareholders. See Item 5. “Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Shareholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities” for information on our common stock, including our reverse stock split on October 31, 2017.
Proposed Transition of Investment Advisory Services
In December 2017, our board of directors (the "Board") approved the investment co-advisory agreements and the investment advisory agreements to be entered into between us, KKR and an affiliate of Franklin Square Holdings, L.P. (“FS Investments”) setting forth our proposed new advisory structure. In January 2018, we filed a definitive proxy statement soliciting shareholder approval of certain co-advisory agreements and the joint investment advisory agreement, each of which would replace the New Investment Advisory Agreement. The effectiveness of the investment co-advisory agreements and joint advisor investment advisory agreement is subject to various conditions, including shareholder approval thereof. If any of these 
1

conditions are not satisfied or (to the extent permitted) waived, the investment co-advisory agreements and/or the joint advisor investment advisory agreement may not go into effect.
Investment Objectives and Strategy
Our investment objective is to provide our shareholders with current income and, to a lesser extent, long-term capital appreciation. We pursue our investment objective by investing primarily in the debt of privately owned U.S. companies with a focus on originated transactions sourced through KKR's network. As of December 31, 2017, our investment portfolio, excluding our short term investments, totaled $3.97 billion and consisted primarily of senior and subordinated debt. As we continue to grow our investment portfolio we anticipate that a substantial portion of our portfolio will consist of senior and subordinated debt, which we believe offer opportunities for superior risk-adjusted returns and income generation. Our debt investments may take the form of corporate loans or bonds, may be secured or unsecured and may, in some cases, be accompanied by warrants, options, equity co-investments, or other forms of equity participation. We may separately purchase common or preferred equity interests in transactions. Our portfolio includes fixed-rate investments that generate absolute returns, as well as floating-rate investments that provide protection in rising interest rate and inflationary environments. 
We will seek to continue to build on KKR's strong investment expertise and sourcing networks and adhere to an investment approach that emphasizes strong fundamental credit analysis and rigorous portfolio monitoring. We intend to continue to be disciplined in selecting investments and focused on opportunities that we perceive offer favorable risk/reward characteristics and relative value. We believe the market for lending is currently characterized by significant demand for capital and that we will continue to have considerable opportunities as a provider of capital to achieve attractive pricing and terms on our investments. 
Throughout this report, we refer to the issuers of our debt and equity investments as portfolio companies. 
Our Investment Focus 
While we consider each investment opportunity independently, we generally focus on portfolio companies that share the following characteristics: 

• | Size. We seek to provide capital to medium- and large-sized private companies, which typically have more defensible market positions, stronger franchises and operations and better credit characteristics relative to their smaller peers. Although there are no strict lower or upper limits on the size of a company in which we may invest, we expect to focus on companies with EBITDAs (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) greater than $25 million.


• | Capital Structure. Our portfolio consists primarily of senior and subordinated debt, which may in some cases be accompanied by warrants, options, equity co-investments, or other forms of equity participation. We seek to invest in companies that generate free cash flow at the time of our investment and benefit from material investments from well-known equity investors.


• | Management Team. We seek to prioritize investing in portfolio companies with strong management teams that we believe have a clear strategic vision, long-standing experience in their industry and a successful operating track record. We favor companies in which management’s incentives appear to be closely aligned with the long-term performance of the business, such as through equity ownership.


• | Stage of Business Life Cycle. We seek mature, privately owned businesses that have long track records of stable, positive cash flow. We do not intend to invest in start-up companies or companies with speculative business plans. As a business development company, we generally must, under relevant SEC rules, invest at least 70% of our total assets in “qualifying assets,” which includes all private companies, companies whose securities are not listed on a national securities exchange, and certain public listed companies that have a market capitalization of less than $250 million.


• | Industry Focus. While we will consider opportunities within all industries, we seek to prioritize industries having, in our view, favorable characteristics from a lending perspective. For example, we seek companies in established industries with stable competitive and regulatory frameworks, where the main participants have enjoyed predictable, low-volatility earnings. We give less emphasis to industries that are frequently characterized by less predictable and more volatile earnings.


• | Geography. As a business development company under the 1940 Act, we focus on and invest at least 70% of our total assets in U.S. companies. To the extent we invest in foreign companies, we are required to do so in accordance with 1940 Act limitations and only in jurisdictions with established legal frameworks and a history of respecting creditor rights, including countries that are members of the European Union, as well as Canada, Australia and Japan.

While we believe the criteria listed above are important in identifying and investing in portfolio companies, we consider each investment on a case-by-case basis. It is possible that not all of these criteria will be met by each portfolio company in which we invest. There is no limit on the maturity or duration of any investment in our portfolio. Substantially all of the investments held in our portfolio have either a sub-investment grade rating by Moody’s Investors Service and/or 
2

Standard & Poor’s or are not rated by any rating agency. Investment sizes vary as our capital base changes and are ultimately at the discretion of KKR subject to oversight by the Board.
Except as restricted by the 1940 Act or by the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), we deem all of our investment policies to be non-fundamental, which means that they may be changed by our Board without shareholder approval.
Other Factors Affecting Portfolio Construction 
As a business development company under the 1940 Act that intends to continue to qualify annually as a regulated investment company (“RIC”) under the Code, our investment activities are subject to certain regulatory restrictions. These restrictions include (i) requirements under the 1940 Act that we invest our capital primarily in U.S. companies either that are privately owned or that are listed on a national securities exchange with a market capitalization of less than $250 million, and (ii) investment diversification and source of income criteria imposed by the Code. For a description of certain valuation risks associated with our investments in portfolio companies, see Item 1A. “Risk Factors - Risks Related to Our Business.” A significant portion of our Investment Portfolio (as defined below) is recorded at fair value as determined in good faith by our Board and, as a result, there is and will be uncertainty as to the value of our portfolio investments and uncertainty as to the accuracy of our net asset value. 
In addition, we generally are not permitted to co-invest alongside certain affiliates of KKR in privately negotiated transactions, absent an exemptive order from the SEC. On May 21, 2013, the SEC issued an order granting us exemptive relief that expands our ability to co-invest with certain of our affiliates in privately negotiated transactions. The exemptive order (as amended, the "SEC Exemptive Order") was amended by the SEC on June 19, 2017. Subject to the conditions specified in the SEC Exemptive Order, we are permitted to co-invest with those affiliates in certain additional investment opportunities, including investments originated and directly negotiated by KKR. 
Portfolio and Investment Activity 
Historically, our investment program consisted of two main components. First, since the inception of our investment activities, we have been engaged in the direct purchase of debt and equity securities, primarily issued by portfolio companies, through both direct lending and, to a lesser extent, secondary market transactions. We refer to this investment program component as our “Investment Portfolio” in this report. Second, beginning in November 2012 and until June 2017, we supplemented our economic exposure to portfolio companies by entering into total return swap arrangements (“TRS”) with a commercial bank counterparty and directing the creation of a portfolio of debt investments that served as reference assets under the TRS. We refer to this investment component as either our portfolio of TRS assets, or our “TRS Portfolio.” 
In the case of our TRS Portfolio, we received all: (i) realized income and fees and (ii) realized capital gains generated by the TRS assets. In return, we paid quarterly to the TRS counterparty a payment consisting of: (i) realized capital losses and (ii) financing costs that were based on (a) a floating financing rate and (b) the settled notional amount of the TRS assets. The settled notional amount of the TRS assets was the net aggregate cost of the TRS assets underlying the TRS Portfolio that were settled and owned by the counterparty. The total notional amount of TRS assets included the settled notional amount plus the effect of the purchase and sale of TRS assets where a TRS asset trade settlement, if any, was pending. We terminated the TRS on June 30, 2017, in connection with our ongoing transition towards directly originated private credit investments, as the TRS arrangements were primarily limited to the financing of traded investments. 
 As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, our Investment Portfolio consisted of debt and equity securities relating to 113 and 129 portfolio companies, respectively, diversified across 21 industry classifications as of each period. As of December 31, 2016, the TRS Portfolio consisted of debt securities relating to 43 portfolio companies, respectively, diversified across 16 industry classifications. 
Our investment program is not managed with any specific investment diversification or dispersion target goals. The table below summarizes the composition of our Investment Portfolio based on fair value as of December 31, 2017 and 2016 and TRS Portfolio as of December 31, 2016, excluding our short term investments.

Joint Venture
We also co-invest with Conway Capital, LLC (“Conway”), an affiliate of Guggenheim Life and Annuity Company and Delaware Life Insurance Company, through an unconsolidated limited liability company, Strategic Credit Opportunities Partners (“SCJV”). SCJV was formed in May 2016 to invest its capital in a range of investments, including senior secured loans (both first lien and second lien) to middle market companies, broadly syndicated loans, equity, warrants and other investments. We and Conway each have 50% voting control of SCJV and together are required to agree on all investment decisions as well as all other significant actions for SCJV. As of December 31, 2017, SCJV had total capital commitments of $500 million, $437.50 million of which was from us and the remaining $62.50 million of which was from Conway. As of December 31, 2017, we had funded approximately $294.03 million of our commitment. Additionally, SCJV has $250 million of borrowing capacity through a revolving credit facility with Goldman Sachs Bank (the "GS Credit Facility") with a maturity date of September 29, 2021. As of December 31, 2017, our investment in SCJV was approximately $300.65 million at fair value. We do not consolidate SCJV in our consolidated financial statements. 
For a further discussion of our investment activities and investment attributes of our Investment Portfolio as of December 31, 2017 and 2016 and TRS Portfolio as of December 31, 2016 and for the years then ended, see Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Portfolio and Investment Activity - Portfolio Investment Activity for the Years Ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015.” 
Competition 
As a business development company with a particular focus on lending activities, we experience competition from other business development companies, commercial banks, specialty finance companies, open-end and closed-end investment companies, opportunity funds, private equity funds and institutional investors, many of which may have greater financial resources than we do for the purposes of lending to U.S. businesses within our stated investment focus. These competitors may also have a lower cost of capital, may be subject to less regulatory oversight, and may have lower overall operating costs. The level of competition impacts both our ability to raise capital, find suitable corporate borrowers that meet our investment criteria and acquire and originate loans to corporate borrowers. We may also face competition from other funds that affiliates of KKR participate in or advise.

We believe we have the following potential competitive advantages over other capital providers that operate in the markets we target, which allow us to take advantage of the market opportunities we have identified: 

• | Proprietary Sourcing and Deal Origination. KKR, through its deep industry relationships and investment teams that actively source new investments, provides us with immediate access to an established source of proprietary investment opportunities. KKR has built leading franchises and deep relationships with major companies, financial institutions and other investment and advisory institutions for sourcing new investments. KKR’s investment professionals are also organized into industry groups that conduct their own primary research, develop views on industry themes and trends and proactively work to identify companies in which to invest, often on an exclusive basis. We believe that KKR's broad networks and the internal deal generation strategies of their investment teams create favorable opportunities to deploy capital across a broad range of originated transactions that have attractive investment characteristics.


• | Focus on Preserving Capital and Minimizing Losses. We believe that protecting principal and avoiding capital losses are critical to generating attractive risk-adjusted returns. Toward that end, our investment process is designed to: (i) utilize KKR’s proprietary knowledge and deep industry relationships to identify attractive prospective portfolio companies, (ii) conduct rigorous due diligence to evaluate the creditworthiness of, and potential returns from, credit investments in such portfolio companies, (iii) stress test prospective investments to assess the viability of potential portfolio companies in a downside scenario and their ability to repay principal and (iv) structure investments and design covenants and other rights that anticipate and mitigate issues identified through this process.


• | Experienced Management and Investment Expertise. Affiliates of KKR have more than 40 years of investment experience that spans a broad range of economic, market and financial conditions. We believe we benefit from KKR’s rigorous investment approach, industry expertise and experience investing throughout a company’s capital structure.


• | Disciplined Credit Analysis and Portfolio Monitoring. KKR provides us with immediate access to an established platform for evaluating investments, managing risk and focusing on opportunities that generate superior returns with appropriate levels of risk. Through KKR, we benefit from an investment infrastructure that allows for intensive due diligence to filter investment opportunities and helps select investments that offer favorable risk/reward characteristics.


• | Versatile Transaction Structuring and Flexible Capital. KKR has experience and expertise in evaluating and structuring investments at all levels of a company’s capital structure and with varying features, providing numerous tools to manage risk while preserving opportunities for income, capital preservation and, to a lesser extent, long-term capital appreciation. We seek to continue to capitalize on this expertise and build our Investment Portfolio that performs in a broad range of economic conditions while meeting the unique needs of a broad range of borrowers. Although we are subject to regulation as a business development company, we are not subject to many of the regulatory limitations that govern traditional lending institutions. As a result, we believe that we can be more flexible in selecting and structuring investments and adjusting investment criteria. We believe borrowers view this flexibility as a benefit, making us an attractive financing partner.


• | Long-Term Investment Horizon. We believe that our flexibility to make investments with a long-term perspective provides us with the opportunity to generate favorable returns on invested capital and expands the types of investments that we may consider. The long-term nature of our capital helps us avoid disposing of assets at unfavorable prices and we believe makes us a better financing partner for portfolio companies.

Business Development Company Requirements 
Business development companies are closed-end funds that elect to be treated as business development companies under the 1940 Act. As such, business development companies are subject to only certain provisions of the 1940 Act, as well as the Exchange Act. Business development companies are provided greater flexibility under the 1940 Act than other investment companies in dealing with their portfolio companies, issuing securities, and compensating their investment advisers. Business development companies can be internally or externally managed and may qualify to elect to be taxed as RICs for federal tax purposes. The 1940 Act contains prohibitions and restrictions relating to transactions between business development companies and their affiliates, principal underwriters, and affiliates of those affiliates or underwriters. The 1940 Act requires that a majority of a business development company’s directors be persons other than “interested persons,” as that term is defined in the 1940 Act. In addition, the 1940 Act provides that we may not change the nature of our business so as to cease to be, or withdraw our election as, a business development company unless approved by a majority of our outstanding voting securities. The 1940 Act defines “a majority of the outstanding voting securities” as the lesser of: (1) 67% or more of the voting securities present at a meeting if the holders of more than 50% of our outstanding voting securities are present or represented by proxy or (2) 50% of our outstanding voting securities.
We are generally unable to issue and sell our common stock at a price below net asset value per share. We may, however, sell our common stock, or warrants, options, or rights to acquire our common stock, at a price below the then-current net asset value of our common stock if our Board determines that such sale is in our best interests and the best interests of our 
5

shareholders, and our shareholders approve such sale. In addition, we may generally issue new shares of our common stock at a price below net asset value in rights offerings to existing shareholders, in payment of dividends, and in certain other limited circumstances. 
As a business development company, we are generally not permitted to invest in any portfolio company in which KKR or any of its affiliates currently have an investment, or to make any co-investments with KKR or any of its affiliates, without an exemptive order from the SEC. We may, however, invest alongside KKR and its affiliates’ other clients in certain circumstances where doing so is consistent with applicable law and SEC staff interpretations. For example, we may invest alongside such other clients’ accounts consistent with guidance promulgated by the SEC staff permitting us and such other clients’ accounts to purchase interests in a single class of privately placed securities so long as certain conditions are met, including that KKR, acting on our behalf or on behalf of other clients, does not negotiate any term other than price. We may also invest alongside KKR's other clients as otherwise permissible under regulatory guidance, applicable regulations and KKR's allocation policies. Subject to the conditions specified in the SEC Exemptive Order, we are permitted to co-invest with those affiliates in certain additional investment opportunities, including investments originated and directly negotiated by KKR.
 Financial Information About Industry Segments and Geographic Areas 
Our primary objectives include investing in and originating a portfolio of loans, bonds and equity investments to commercial businesses located throughout the United States. We presently do not evaluate our investments by industry segment but rather, we review performance on an individual basis. Accordingly, we do not report industry or geographic area segment information. 
Agreements for Investment Advisory Services and Administrative Services 
Prior to the Listing, we were party to an investment advisory agreement with CNL, (the "Former Investment Advisory Agreement") for the overall management of our company’s investment activities. Under the terms of the Former Investment Advisory Agreement, CNL earned a base management fee equal to two percent of our gross assets. Our company and CNL had also entered into a sub-advisory agreement with KKR under which KKR was responsible for the day-to-day management of our company’s investment portfolio. CNL compensated KKR for advisory services that it provided to our company with 50% of the fees that CNL received under the Former Investment Advisory Agreement. Concurrent with the Listing, the Company entered into an investment advisory agreement with KKR (the “New Investment Advisory Agreement”). Under the terms of the New Investment Advisory Agreement, KKR earns a base management fee equal to an annual rate of 1.5% of the Company’s average gross assets, computed using the same method as under the Former Investment Advisory Agreement.
For a further discussion of the New Investment Advisory, see Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Contractual Obligations - Investment Advisory Agreement.” 
Prior to the Listing, we were party to an administrative services agreement with CNL (the “Former Administrative Services Agreement”) whereby CNL performed, and oversaw the performance of, various administrative services on our behalf. Administrative services generally included investor services, general ledger accounting, fund accounting, maintaining required corporate and financial records, financial reporting for us and our subsidiaries, preparation of reports to our Board and lenders, calculating our net asset value, filing tax returns, preparing and filing SEC reports, preparing, printing and disseminating shareholder reports and proxy statements, overseeing the payment of our expenses and distributions on common stock, oversight of service providers and the performance of administrative and professional services rendered to our company by others. The Company reimbursed CNL for the professional services and expenses it incurred in performing its administrative obligations on behalf of the Company. In connection with the Listing, KKR replaced CNL as the sole investment adviser and entered into a new administrative services agreement with the Company with similar terms.
 CNL, certain CNL affiliates, and KKR receive or have received compensation and reimbursement of expenses and personnel time in connection with (i) the performance and supervision of administrative services on our behalf, and (ii) certain expenses associated with investment advisory activities. See Note 6. “Related Party Transactions” in Item 8. “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” for additional information on amounts paid to these related parties. 
Employees 
We are externally managed and as such we do not have any employees. 
Tax Status 
Beginning with our 2011 tax year, we have elected to be treated for federal income tax purposes, and intend to qualify annually, as a regulated investment company, or a RIC, under the Code. As a RIC, we generally will not be subject to federal income tax on distributed taxable income to the extent we distribute annually at least 90% of our taxable income (excluding capital gains) to our shareholders and meet other compliance requirements.
