OVERVIEW
 
We are a pharmaceutical company focused on acquiring, developing and commercializing drug candidates for diseases that are treated by specialist physicians, with an initial focus on addressing thrombocytopenia, a disorder characterized by a low blood platelet count. Our drug candidate, avatrombopag, which we acquired from Eisai, Inc., or Eisai, in March 2016, is an orally administered thrombopoietin receptor agonist, or TPO-RA, that we are developing for the treatment of thrombocytopenia. On September 21, 2017, we submitted a new drug application, or NDA, to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, for the treatment of thrombocytopenia in patients with chronic liver disease, or CLD, scheduled to undergo a procedure.  The NDA submission was supported by two identically designed pivotal Phase 3 clinical trials, both of which met the primary and secondary endpoints with high statistical significance.  The NDA was granted Priority Review by the FDA in November 2017 and the Prescription Drug User Fee Act goal date for an FDA decision is May 21, 2018.  We intend to build a hepatology-focused sales organization in the United States and have initiated commercial activities to support the launch of avatrombopag.
 
We also plan to submit a Supplemental New Drug Application, or sNDA, in the second half of 2018 for the treatment of patients with immune thrombocytopenic purpura, or ITP, which is chronic thrombocytopenia that requires continuous treatment.  To date, avatrombopag has been evaluated in one Phase 3 clinical trial and two Phase 2 clinical trials for the treatment of adults with chronic ITP.  In the Phase 3 trial, the primary efficacy endpoint was achieved with high statistical significance (p<0.0001).  Additionally, during the first quarter of 2018 we plan to initiate a Phase 3 clinical trial in patients with thrombocytopenia undergoing more invasive procedures that require platelet counts greater than or equal to 100,000 platelets per microliter of circulating blood, and in the second quarter, another Phase 3 trial in chemotherapy-induced thrombocytopenia, or CIT.
 
We believe that avatrombopags efficacy and safety profile in combination with its convenient oral dosing could provide advantages over other treatments for thrombocytopenia. To date, avatrombopag has been evaluated in more than 20 clinical trials involving more than 1,100 subjects and has been observed to be generally well tolerated. We believe that avatrombopag may have the potential to be used more broadly for patients with thrombocytopenia.
 
Overview of thrombocytopenia and current treatments
 
Thrombocytopenia is characterized by a deficiency of platelets that impairs blood clot formation and increases bleeding risk. Thrombocytopenia is defined as having less than 150,000 platelets per microliter of circulating blood and is diagnosed with a routine blood test. Thrombocytopenia can result in significant bleeding risk even in cases of minor injury. Platelet deficiency can also increase the risk of excessive, uncontrolled bleeding during or after a medical procedure.
 
Physicians determine how to treat thrombocytopenia, either in the acute setting or chronically, based on a number of factors, including the patients platelet count, etiology of the underlying cause of thrombocytopenia, duration of required platelet count elevation and the patients overall health profile. Acute prophylactic treatment of thrombocytopenia in patients with CLD currently involves platelet transfusion in advance of medical procedures or in connection with other medical treatments that reduce platelet counts, such as chemotherapy. Despite being the standard of care, platelet transfusions are associated with limitations that impact their use including variable efficacy, transfusion reactions, risk of antibody development in up to 50% of patients, short duration of effect of transfused platelets, limited supply and inconvenience of administration. There is no drug treatment approved by the FDA or the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, for thrombocytopenia in patients with CLD in the acute setting prior to a medical procedure.
 
Chronic treatment of thrombocytopenia involves continuous treatment of the disorder. The substantial majority of patients who require chronic treatment suffer from ITP. Treatments for chronic ITP target one of the following mechanisms: reduction of autoimmune activity that causes abnormal platelet destruction, surgical removal of the spleen to prevent trapping of platelets in the spleen or stimulation of platelet production. First-line therapy for ITP is typically focused on reducing autoimmune activity and consists of corticosteroids or intravenous immunoglobulin, or IVIG. Second line alternatives include rituximab, which is used off-label to reduce autoimmune activity, and splenectomy to address the trapping of the platelets in the spleen. Currently marketed TPO-RAs, which aim to stimulate platelet production, are also used in the second line treatment of chronic ITP. However, we believe these available treatments have limitations that impact their use, such as limited efficacy, risk to patient safety, patient non-compliance or inconvenience.
 
Because of the limitations of current therapies used for thrombocytopenia in the acute and chronic setting, we believe there remains a significant unmet need for a treatment that demonstrates reliable and predictable effectiveness and a favorable safety profile, that can be conveniently administrated and potentially reduce the bleeding risk for patients.
 
Our drug candidate
 
Our drug candidate, avatrombopag, is designed to mimic the effects of thrombopoietin, or TPO, in vitro and in vivo. TPO is a hormone produced in the liver and kidneys that binds to its receptor, c-Mpl (myeloproliferative leukemia protein). Following TPO receptor binding, intracellular signaling leads to megakaryocyte growth and maturation, which results in increased platelet production. TPO-RAs, like TPO, stimulate the activation, proliferation and maturation of megakaryocytes, resulting in an increase in circulating platelets.
 
1




Avatrombopag is a highly specific TPO-RA as it binds to the TPO receptor at a distinct site from native TPO, leaving the TPO receptor accessible to native TPO, enabling avatrombopag to have an additive effect to TPO on platelet production.
 
We believe avatrombopag has the potential to be a first-in-class treatment of thrombocytopenia in the acute setting and a best-in-class treatment of thrombocytopenia in the chronic setting. We believe avatrombopag addresses the shortcomings associated with standard of care platelet transfusions, including the risk of transfusion reactions, antibody development in up to 50% of patients, short duration of effect of transfused platelets, limited supply and inconvenience of administration. In addition, we believe avatrombopags efficacy and safety profiles and convenient once-daily oral dosing differentiate it from the TPO-RAs currently marketed for the chronic treatment of thrombocytopenia. We believe attributes specific to avatrombopag make it a compelling treatment option for patients with thrombocytopenia in both the acute and chronic settings.
 
We have completed two identically designed Phase 3 pivotal clinical trials, ADAPT 1 and ADAPT 2, involving an aggregate of 435 patients with CLD, in which all primary and secondary endpoints were met with high statistical significance. The primary endpoint for both studies was the percentage of patients with CLD and thrombocytopenia scheduled to undergo a procedure who did not require a platelet transfusion or any rescue procedure for bleeding at each of two doses of avatrombopag compared to placebo. In each trial, the percentage of subjects in each of the two avatrombopag dosing cohorts requiring a platelet transfusion or a rescue procedure for bleeding was statistically significantly lower compared to placebo (across all cohorts, p-values ranged from p<0.0001 to p=0.0006). We also observed a statistically significant improvement in the percentage of avatrombopag-treated subjects who achieved the target platelet count of greater than or equal to 50,000 platelets per microliter of circulating blood on the procedure day and in the magnitude of change in platelet counts from baseline to procedure day. We are initially developing avatrombopag for the acute treatment of thrombocytopenia in the population of patients with CLD scheduled to undergo a procedure.
 
There are an estimated 7.4 million CLD patients in the United States. Thrombocytopenia affects approximately 1.1 million of those patients and approximately 70,000 of those patients have a platelet count of less than 50,000 platelets per microliter of circulating blood. Based on a third-party survey of 155 community and academic physicians that we commissioned in 2017, approximately 60% of these patients are treated with platelet transfusions in order to raise their platelet counts prior to a procedure and a small percentage of these patients are treated with currently available TPO-RAs off-label. These patients generally undergo one to three medical procedures per year. Many of the CLD patients affected by thrombocytopenia are treated by one of the approximately 850 hepatologists, most of whom are working at one of the approximately 150 liver transplant centers in the United States.
 
In addition to ADAPT 1 and ADAPT 2, avatrombopag has also been evaluated in one Phase 3 trial in adults with chronic ITP, five Phase 2 trials in various thrombocytopenia patient populations, 15 Phase 1 trials and numerous preclinical studies, and has been observed to be generally well tolerated in over 1,100 subjects. During the first quarter of 2018, we are initiating a Phase 3 trial in pre-surgery thrombocytopenia, or PST, which will include patients with thrombocytopenia regardless of disease etiology undergoing surgeries that require a platelet count of more than 100,000 platelets per microliter of circulating blood prior to surgery. Additionally, based on the results of one Phase 3 trial and two Phase 2 trials evaluating the use of avatrombopag for the treatment of adults with chronic ITP and recent discussions with the FDA, we anticipate submitting an sNDA for avatrombopag in the second half of 2018 for this indication. We also plan to initiate a Phase 3 clinical trial in the second quarter of 2018 for the treatment of patients with CIT.
 
We believe that the total addressable market for avatrombopag is approximately $2.5 billion in the United States, with an approximately
 
2




$800 million addressable market for our first indication, the acute treatment of thrombocytopenia in patients with CLD scheduled to undergo a procedure, and an approximately $1.7 billion addressable market for our follow-on indications described above.  Furthermore, we believe that avatrombopag for the treatment of patients with chronic ITP alone has an approximately $600 million addressable market in the United States and an approximately $1.2 billion worldwide addressable market.
 
We hold the worldwide rights to avatrombopag for all current and future indications, which we acquired from Eisai in March 2016. Our intellectual property strategy aims to protect and control the development and commercialization of avatrombopag. Our owned and in-licensed patents provide us with composition of matter and method of use exclusivity with respect to avatrombopag in the United States, including a composition of matter patent that expires in 2025, with possible patent term extension up to 2029. We also hold patents and applications in major world markets with respect to avatrombopag, which are projected to expire between 2023 and 2027, excluding any extension of patent term that may be available in a particular country.

BACKGROUND OF THROMBOCYTOPENIA
 
Thrombocytopenia is a disorder characterized by a low blood platelet count. Platelets, also known as thrombocytes, are cells in the blood that help control bleeding both by clumping and forming a hemostatic plug and by activating other clotting mechanisms. Megakaryocytes, which are large cells found in the bone marrow, are the source of platelets that are released into the bloodstream. Platelet production is regulated by TPO, a hormone produced in the liver and kidney that binds to the c-Mpl receptor. Following TPO receptor binding, intracellular signaling leads to megakaryocyte growth and maturation, which results in increased platelet production. Platelets are continuously produced and their life span averages eight to 10 days.
 
Thrombocytopenia results from decreased production of platelets, increased destruction of platelets or trapping of platelets in the spleen, the causes of which can be inherited or acquired. Thrombocytopenia is characterized by a deficiency of platelets that impairs blood clot formation and increases bleeding risk. Thrombocytopenia is defined as having less than 150,000 platelets per microliter of circulating blood and is diagnosed with a routine blood test. An individual with normal platelet counts has platelets measured in the range of 150,000 to 450,000 platelets per microliter of circulating blood. Thrombocytopenia can result in significant bleeding risk even in cases of minor injury and can also increase the risk of excessive, uncontrolled bleeding during or after a medical procedure.
 
Physicians determine how best to treat thrombocytopenia, either acutely or chronically, based on a number of factors, including the patients platelet count, etiology of the underlying cause of thrombocytopenia, duration of required platelet count elevation and the patients overall health profile. Acute treatment of thrombocytopenia currently involves prophylactic platelet transfusion in advance of a medical procedure or in connection with other treatments that reduce platelet counts, such as chemotherapy. Chronic treatment of thrombocytopenia involves continuous treatment of the disorder.

AVATROMBOPAG
 
We believe our drug candidate, avatrombopag, has the potential to be a first-in-class drug treatment of thrombocytopenia in the acute setting and a best-in-class treatment of thrombocytopenia in the chronic setting. Avatrombopag is an orally administered, small molecule TPO-RA, which is intended to address the limitations of other existing treatments for thrombocytopenia. In the first quarter of 2017, we completed two identically designed Phase 3 pivotal clinical trials, ADAPT 1 and ADAPT 2, in which all primary and secondary endpoints were met with high statistical significance. The primary endpoint for both studies was the percentage of CLD patients with thrombocytopenia scheduled to undergo a procedure, who did not require a platelet transfusion or any rescue procedure for bleeding at each of two dose strengths of avatrombopag compared to placebo. In each trial, the percentage of subjects in each of the two avatrombopag dosing cohorts requiring a platelet transfusion or a rescue procedure for bleeding was statistically significantly lower compared to placebo (across all cohorts, p-values ranging from p<0.0001 to p=0.0006). We also observed a percentage of avatrombopag-treated subjects who achieved platelet counts of greater than 50,000 platelets per microliter of circulating blood on the procedure day and changes in platelet counts from baseline to procedure day, which were statistically significant improvements over placebo. We are initially developing avatrombopag for the acute treatment of thrombocytopenia in this population of patients with CLD scheduled to undergo a procedure.
 
Like native TPO and the currently marketed TPO-RAs, avatrombopag stimulates megakaryocyte growth and maturation leading to increased platelet production. Avatrombopag works in conjunction with the bodys native TPO by being active at the same TPO receptor. Importantly, however, avatrombopag binds to the TPO receptor at a distinct site from native TPO, leaving the TPO receptor accessible to native TPO, enabling avatrombopag to have an additive effect on the proliferation of megakaryocytes. Typically, the time required for megakaryocytes to complete platelet production is approximately five days. Avatrombopags onset of effect is seen in three to five days on average, with peak levels of platelet production observed 10 to 13 days after initiation of treatment. In both in vitro and in vivo studies on platelet function, avatrombopag was observed to lead to the production of healthy, functioning platelets.
 
The figure below describes the mechanism of action for avatrombopag.
 

AVATROMBOPAG CLINICAL DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM
 
In March 2016, we acquired the worldwide rights to avatrombopag from Eisai. Prior to our acquisition, avatrombopag had completed one Phase 3 trial, five Phase 2 trials and 15 Phase 1 trials, including single- and multiple-dose, dose-ranging and tolerability trials in normal volunteers and patients with thrombocytopenia and CLD, ITP and chronic hepatitis C in which it was observed to be generally well tolerated. Additionally, in the Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials, all primary endpoints were met with high statistical significance. Avatrombopag has also been evaluated in multiple preclinical, PK, safety and toxicology studies that we believe supports our NDA filing.
 
Following our acquisition of avatrombopag, we completed two identically designed Phase 3 pivotal clinical trials, ADAPT 1 and ADAPT 2, which were ongoing at the time of the acquisition, to evaluate its safety and efficacy compared to placebo for the treatment of thrombocytopenia in CLD patients scheduled to undergo a procedure. In these trials, avatrombopag was observed to achieve the primary and secondary efficacy endpoints with high statistical significance and was observed to be generally well tolerated.  A NDA was submitted to the FDA on September 21, 2017, that has been accepted for filing with Priority Review and a PDUFA date of May 21, 2018.
 
Eisai originally submitted an investigational new drug application, or IND, for avatrombopag in 2011 for CLD patients with thrombocytopenia undergoing an elective, or non-emergent, procedure. Eisai also submitted INDs for avatrombopag in 2009 for CIT, and in 2005 for ITP. These INDs have been transferred to Dova, and we expect Eisai to transfer the submitted avatrombopag NDA in the first quarter of 2018.
 
Avatrombopag for the treatment of thrombocytopenia in patients with CLD scheduled to undergo a procedure
 
Overview of chronic liver disease
 
We are initially focused on developing avatrombopag for the treatment of thrombocytopenia in CLD patients scheduled to undergo a

procedure. CLD involves the progressive destruction and regeneration of the liver over a period of more than six months. CLD results from a wide range of liver etiologies, including hepatitis, such as hepatitis B and hepatitis C viruses, and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, or NASH; liver cirrhosis; and hepatocellular carcinoma. There are an estimated 7.4 million CLD patients in the United States.
 
Patients with CLD often present with advanced liver fibrosis, or excessive accumulation of scar tissue resulting from ongoing inflammation and liver cell death. Patients with CLD can experience substantial fluid build-up in the abdomen, swelling, weakness and easy bruising. The buildup of scar tissue can disrupt the metabolic functions of the liver and blood flow through the portal vein. Because the production of TPO is dependent on functional liver cell mass, TPO production is reduced when liver cell mass becomes severely damaged. The resulting decrease in TPO production leads to a reduction in megakaryocytes and platelet production. Patients with CLD also have increased trapping of platelets in the spleen and thus even fewer platelets are present in circulating blood. For multiple reasons, these patients often develop thrombocytopenia, which often worsens with the severity of the liver disease. Thrombocytopenia affects approximately 1.1 million CLD patients in the United States and approximately 70,000 of those patients have a platelet count of less than 50,000 platelets per microliter of circulating blood.
 
Patients with CLD undergo numerous non-emergent medical procedures for the diagnosis and treatment of their disease, including liver biopsies, fluid removal, liver transplantation and endoscopy. These medically necessary procedures are scheduled in advance at a time selected by the patient and treating physician. Thrombocytopenia can complicate the treatment of patients with CLD who require multiple procedures as part of their routine clinical care because it reduces the ability of blood to clot efficiently, thus putting patients at risk for excessive bleeding either during or after a medical or surgical procedure. As a result, if a patient has thrombocytopenia, doctors may delay or even cancel these procedures until the patient is able to achieve a sufficient platelet count to adequately control bleeding during and following the procedure. For CLD patients with thrombocytopenia and platelet counts less than 50,000 platelets per microliter of circulating blood who are undergoing a non-emergent medical procedure, platelet transfusions are used as the standard of care to increase platelet counts prior to the procedure. Despite being the standard of care, platelet transfusions are associated with limitations that impact their use including variable efficacy, transfusion reactions, risk of antibody development in up to 50% of patients, short duration of effect of transfused platelets, limited supply and inconvenience of administration. We believe there remains a significant unmet need for a reliably effective and safe treatment of thrombocytopenia in patients with CLD scheduled to undergo a procedure.
 
There is no drug treatment approved by the FDA or EMA for thrombocytopenia in patients with CLD in the acute setting prior to a medical procedure. Further, the use of some TPO-RAs has been associated with increased risk of portal vein thrombosis, or PVT, in these patients, likely due to the excessively high increases in platelet counts that can give rise to further blockage of the portal vein. While an individual with normal platelet counts has between 150,000 to 450,000 platelets per microliter of circulating blood, platelet counts greater than 200,000 platelets per microliter of circulating blood can heighten the risk of PVT in a CLD patient. Therefore, physicians must carefully manage platelet counts in these patients so that platelet counts do not exceed 200,000 platelets per microliter of circulating blood.
 
Neither Promacta nor Nplate has been approved by the FDA or EMA for the acute treatment of thrombocytopenia in patients with CLD due, in part, to the risk of side effects, including PVT in the case of Promacta. We believe avatrombopag has the potential to provide an effective, predictable, convenient and safe alternative to platelet transfusions for increasing platelet counts in patients with CLD scheduled to undergo a procedure.
 
Clinical development
 
To date, avatrombopag has completed two Phase 2 clinical trials and two Phase 3 clinical trials in patients with thrombocytopenia associated with CLD scheduled to undergo a procedure. Based on the trial results for avatrombopag to date, an NDA was submitted to the FDA, for this initial indication on September 21, 2017.  The NDA was granted Priority Review by the FDA in November 2017 and the Prescription Drug User Fee Act goal date for an FDA decision is May 21, 2018. We also intend to submit a marketing authorization application, or MAA, to the EMA for this indication in the first half of 2018 for this same indication.
 
Phase 3 trials (ADAPT 1 and ADAPT 2)
 
Trial design
 
In the first half of 2017, we completed two identically designed Phase 3 pivotal clinical trials to evaluate the efficacy and safety of avatrombopag compared to placebo for the treatment of thrombocytopenia in CLD patients scheduled to undergo a procedure. These randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group trials were conducted in geographically overlapping regions in the United States and internationally.
 
Each trial consisted of three phases: pre-randomization, randomization and follow-up. The pre-randomization phase involved an initial screening visit that took place within two weeks prior to randomization. During the randomization phase, subjects were divided into two cohorts according to their mean baseline platelet count: 1) a lower platelet count cohort, which included those subjects with platelet count below 40,000 platelets per microliter of circulating blood and 2) a higher platelet count cohort, which included those subjects with platelet counts between 40,000 and less than 50,000 platelets per microliter of circulating blood. In both studies, subjects in both dosing cohorts were randomized on a 2-to-1 basis between avatrombopag and placebo. Subjects in the lower platelet count cohort received either a 60 mg per day dose of avatrombopag or placebo for five days, while subjects in the higher platelet count cohort received either
 
5




a 40 mg per day dose of avatrombopag or placebo for five days.
 
The procedure was performed between five and eight days following the last dose of study drug, which is the time of peak platelet count production with avatrombopag. Permitted surgical procedures included procedures with a low risk of bleeding, such as fluid removal or a gastrointestinal endoscopy, moderate risk of bleeding, such as a liver biopsy or a bronchoscopy, and high risk of bleeding, such as dental procedures.
 
During the follow-up phase, subjects were evaluated seven days after the procedure and 30 days following the last dose. The trial design of our two Phase 3 trials is shown in the figure below.
 

Endpoints
 
The primary efficacy endpoint for both trials was the percentage of subjects who did not require a platelet transfusion or any rescue procedure for bleeding after randomization and up to seven days following their procedure.
 
Secondary efficacy endpoints included:
 
·                  Percentage of subjects who achieved platelet counts of greater than or equal to 50,000 platelets per microliter of circulating blood on the day of the procedure (i.e., prior to receiving a platelet transfusion or undergoing the procedure).
 
·                  Change from baseline in platelet count on the day of the procedure (i.e., prior to receiving a platelet transfusion or undergoing the procedure).
 
The primary and secondary efficacy endpoints were powered to show statistical significance and superiority compared to placebo. We also evaluated the safety of avatrombopag in the trials.
 
ADAPT 1enrollment
 
A total of 231 subjects were enrolled in ADAPT 1 at 75 sites across 19 different countries. 158 subjects were male and 73 subjects were female. 128 subjects were Caucasian, 43 subjects were Korean, 24 subjects were Chinese, 22 subjects were from other Asian countries and 14 subjects were other ethnicities. Of the 231 subjects enrolled, 138 subjects had a platelet count below 40,000 platelets per microliter of circulating blood and 93 subjects had a platelet count of 40,000 to less than 50,000 platelets per microliter of circulating blood. In the lower platelet count cohort, 48 subjects received placebo, of whom 46 completed the trial, and 90 subjects received avatrombopag, of whom 85 subjects completed the trial. In the higher platelet count cohort, 34 subjects received placebo, 32 of whom completed the trial, and 59 subjects received avatrombopag, of whom 55 subjects completed the trial. Of the nine subjects who were discontinued from the trial, most did not complete the follow-up period or withdrew their consent, though one subject receiving a 60 mg per day dose of avatrombopag withdrew due to muscle pain and anemia.
 
ADAPT 1efficacy results
 
In ADAPT 1, avatrombopag was shown to be superior to placebo, as shown in the figure below, for the primary endpoint. We observed a statistically significant improvement in the percentage of subjects who did not require a platelet transfusion or any rescue procedure
 
6




for bleeding after randomization for both the 60 mg dose/day of avatrombopag and the 40 mg dose/day of avatrombopag compared to placebo in both the lower and higher platelet count cohorts, respectively. Of the subjects who completed the trial in the lower platelet count cohort, 65.6% of subjects who received avatrombopag did not require a platelet transfusion or any rescue procedure for bleeding, compared to 22.9% of subjects who received placebo (p<0.0001). Of the subjects who completed the trial in the higher platelet count cohort, 88.1% of subjects who received avatrombopag did not require a platelet transfusion or any rescue procedure for bleeding, compared to 38.2% of subjects who received placebo (p<0.0001). P-value is a conventional statistical method for measuring the statistical significance of clinical results. A p-value of 0.05 or less represents the standard statistical significance threshold in clinical trials, meaning that there is a less than 1-in-20 (i.e., 5%) likelihood that the observed results occurred by chance.
 

We also observed a statistically significant improvement in the percentage of subjects who achieved the target platelet counts of greater than or equal to 50,000 platelets per microliter of circulating blood on the day of the procedure. Of the subjects who completed the trial in the lower platelet count cohort, 68.9% of subjects who received avatrombopag achieved platelet counts of greater than or equal to 50,000 platelets per microliter of circulating blood on the day of the procedure, compared to 4.2% of subjects who received placebo (p<0.0001). Of the subjects who completed the trial in the higher platelet count cohort, 88.1% of subjects who received avatrombopag achieved platelet counts of greater than or equal to 50,000 platelets per microliter of circulating blood on the day of the procedure, compared to 20.6% of subjects who received placebo (p<0.0001).
 
Finally, we also observed a statistically significant improvement in the magnitude of the change from baseline in platelet count on the day of the procedure, as shown in the figure below. Of the subjects who completed the trial in the lower platelet count cohort, subjects who received avatrombopag increased their platelet count by an average of 32,000 platelets per microliter of circulating blood from baseline (or doubling), compared to an average increase of 800 platelets per microliter of circulating blood for subjects who received placebo (p<0.0001). Of the subjects who completed the trial in the higher platelet count cohort, subjects who received avatrombopag increased their platelet count by an average of 37,100 platelets per microliter of circulating blood from baseline (or doubling), compared to an average increase of 1,000 platelets per microliter of circulating blood for subjects who received placebo (p<0.0001). No subjects who received avatrombopag were observed to have a platelet count exceeding 200,000 platelets per microliter of circulating blood over the course of the study.

ADAPT 2enrollment
 
A total of 204 subjects were enrolled in ADAPT 2 at 74 sites across 16 different countries. 127 subjects were male and 77 subjects were female. 131 subjects were Caucasian, 50 subjects were Japanese and 23 subjects were other ethnicities. Of the 204 subjects enrolled, 113 subjects had a platelet count below 40,000 platelets per microliter of circulating blood and 91 subjects had a platelet count of 40,000 to less than 50,000 platelets per microliter of circulating blood. In the lower platelet count cohort, 43 subjects received placebo, of whom 37 completed the trial, and 70 subjects received avatrombopag, of whom 68 subjects completed the trial. In the higher platelet count cohort, 33 subjects received placebo, of whom 31 completed the trial, and 58 subjects received avatrombopag, of whom 55 subjects completed the trial. Of the 13 subjects who were discontinued from the trial, most did not complete the follow-up period or withdrew their consent, though one subject receiving placebo died during the trial.
 
ADAPT 2efficacy results
 
Consistent with ADAPT 1, in ADAPT 2, avatrombopag was again shown to be superior to placebo, for the primary endpoint. We also observed a statistically significant improvement in the percentage of subjects who did not require a platelet transfusion or any rescue procedure for bleeding after randomization for both the 60 mg dose/day of avatrombopag and the 40 mg dose/day of avatrombopag compared to placebo in both the lower and higher platelet count cohorts, respectively. Of the subjects who completed the trial in the lower platelet count cohort, 68.6% of subjects who received avatrombopag did not require a platelet transfusion or any rescue procedure for bleeding, compared to 34.9% of subjects who received placebo (p=0.0006). Of the subjects who completed the trial in the higher platelet count cohort, 87.9% of subjects who received avatrombopag did not require a platelet transfusion or any rescue procedure for bleeding, compared to 33.3% of subjects who received placebo (p<0.0001). These results are shown in the figure below.

We also observed a statistically significant improvement in the percentage of subjects who achieved the target platelet count of greater than or equal to 50,000 platelets per microliter of circulating blood on the day of the procedure. Of the subjects who completed the trial in the lower platelet count cohort, 67.1% of subjects who received avatrombopag achieved platelet counts of greater than or equal to 50,000 platelets per microliter of circulating blood on the day of the procedure, compared to 7.0% of subjects who received placebo (p<0.0001). Of the subjects who completed the trial in the higher platelet count cohort, 93.1% of subjects who received avatrombopag achieved platelet counts of greater than or equal to 50,000 platelets per microliter of circulating blood on the day of the procedure, compared to 39.4% of subjects who received placebo (p<0.0001).
 
Finally, we also observed a statistically significant improvement in the change from baseline in platelet count on the day of the procedure, as shown in the figure below. Of the subjects who completed the trial in the lower platelet count cohort, subjects who received avatrombopag increased their platelet count by an average of 31,300 platelets per microliter of circulating blood from baseline (or doubling), compared to an average increase of 3,000 platelets per microliter of circulating blood for subjects who received placebo (p<0.0001). Of the subjects who completed the trial in the higher platelet count cohort, subjects who received avatrombopag increased their platelet count by an average of 44,900 platelets per microliter of circulating blood from baseline (or doubling), compared to an average increase of 5,900 platelets per microliter of circulating blood for subjects who received placebo (p<0.0001). Of the subjects who received avatrombopag, three subjects had platelets counts exceeding 200,000 per microliter, during the course of the trial; one subject was observed to have a platelet count exceeding 200,000 platelets per microliter of circulating blood prior to the procedure day, one subject was observed to have a platelet count exceeding 200,000 platelets per microliter of circulating blood on the procedure day, and one subject was observed to have a platelet count exceeding 200,000 platelets per microliter of circulating blood after the procedure day. Despite these elevated platelet counts, none of these patients experienced a PVT.

Safety results for ADAPT 1 and ADAPT 2
 
In ADAPT 1 and ADAPT 2, avatrombopag was observed to be generally well tolerated at both the 40 mg and 60 mg dose. Treatment emergent adverse events, or TEAEs, including fever, nausea and abdominal pain, were similar in frequency in the avatrombopag and placebo groups. The incidence and severity of TEAEs, which were graded on the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, or CTCAE, scale, observed in avatrombopag-treated patients and in the placebo groups in the ADAPT 1 and ADAPT 2 clinical trials are summarized in the chart below.

In the higher baseline platelet count cohort of the ADAPT 1 trial, two subjects died more than 28 days after conclusion of treatment with avatrombopag and the deaths were considered not related to treatment. The half-life of avatrombopag was approximately 19 hours. These patients also suffered from numerous co-morbidities.  In the lower baseline platelet count cohort of ADAPT 1, one non-treatment emergent PVT was reported in an avatrombopag-treated subject following splenic artery embolization, 31 days after the last dose.  The subjects course was complicated by platelet transfusions, sepsis, and a platelet count of 178,000 per microliter of circulating blood, and the event was assessed as unrelated to the treatment with avatrombopag.
 
In the higher baseline platelet count cohort in the ADAPT 2 trial, one avatrombopag-treated subject experienced a treatment-emergent partial thrombosis of the right branch of the portal vein following an endoscopy with banding, 13 days after the last dose. The highest platelet count recorded for this subject after treatment was 77,000 platelets per microliter of circulating blood and, at the time of identification of the partial thrombosis, the subject was observed to have a platelet count of 61,000 platelets per microliter of circulating blood. The partial thrombosis was judged by the investigator to be non-serious and possibly related to treatment.
 
Phase 2 clinical trials
 
From 2009 to 2011, a Phase 2, randomized, multicenter, placebo-controlled, double-blind, parallel-group trial (Study 202) was conducted to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and population PK of once-daily oral avatrombopag tablets used up to seven days in subjects with CLD and thrombocytopenia scheduled to undergo a procedure. Subjects either received a 100 mg single dose of avatrombopag, followed by a 20, 40 or 80 mg dose of avatrombopag once a day for six days, or a 80 mg single dose of avatrombopag, followed by a 10 mg of avatrombopag once a day for six days or a 20 mg dose of avatrombopag once a day for three days. The results of this trial were published in the Journal of Hepatology in 2014. A total of 130 subjects were enrolled in the trial, which was conducted at 29 sites in the United States.
 
In Study 202 the primary endpoint was the percentage of responders, defined as subjects with a platelet increase from baseline of at least 20,000 platelets per microliter of circulating blood and an overall platelet count of at least 50,000 platelets per microliter of circulating blood at least once from Day 4 to Day 8. In the study, a statistically significant increase (p<0.0001) was observed for the primary endpoint for all subjects who received avatrombopag compared to subjects receiving placebo, with a responder rate of 48.4% and 8.1%, respectively.
 
Avatrombopag was also observed to be generally well tolerated in Study 202. There was an overall higher incidence of treatment emergent adverse events in the avatrombopag group (83.9%) compared to the placebo group (75.7%), although the incidence of treatment-related TEAEs was comparable (29.0% versus 29.7%, respectively). The overall incidence of serious treatment emergent adverse events was higher in the combined avatrombopag group (17.2%) compared to the combined placebo group (10.8%). One subject in the avatrombopag group died due to serious adverse events, though the cause of death was not confirmed via autopsy. In addition, one subject who received an initial 100 mg dose of avatrombopag, followed by 80 mg doses of avatrombopag once a day for six days, experienced a PVT 28 days after the last dose, with the highest platelet count of 199,000 per microliter. The subject was asymptomatic and the event was judged by the investigator to be not serious and possibly related to the trial drug, and one subject in the avatrombopag group discontinued from the trial due to nausea and vomiting. The commonly reported treatment emergent adverse events and serious treatment emergent adverse events were consistent with adverse events typically experienced by CLD patients with thrombocytopenia.
 
In addition, from 2014 to 2015, a second Phase 2, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group trial (Study 204) was conducted to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and PK of once-daily oral avatrombopag in Japanese subjects with CLD and thrombocytopenia.  Subjects were divided into two cohorts according to their mean baseline platelet count. Subjects with a lower baseline platelet count (below 40,000 platelets per microliter) received 20, 40 or 80 mg doses of avatrombopag or placebo once a day for five days. Subjects with a higher baseline platelet count cohort (40,000 to less than 50,000 per microliter) received 20 or 40 mg doses of
 
11




avatrombopag or placebo once a day for five days.  A total of 39 subjects were enrolled in the trial, which was conducted at 21 sites in Japan.
 
In Study 204, the primary endpoint was the percentage of responders, defined as subjects with a platelet increase from baseline of at least 20,000 platelets per microliter of circulating blood and an overall platelet count of at least 50,000 platelets per microliter of circulating blood at Visit 4, which occurred approximately 10 days after the initiation of treatment. In the study, a statistically significant increase was observed for the primary endpoint in subjects receiving both 40 mg per day (63.3%) and 60 mg per day (40.0%) doses of avatrombopag compared to subjects receiving placebo (9.1%), with p= 0.004 and 0.024, respectively. Avatrombopag was also observed to be generally well tolerated in Study 204 with a lower overall incidence of TEAEs in the combined avatrombopag treatment group (53.6%) compared to the placebo group (72.7%), although the incidence of treatment-related TEAEs was higher in the avatrombopag treatment group (14.3% versus 0%, respectively) for each of the 20 mg, 40 mg and 60 mg avatrombopag dose groups. No deaths, serious adverse events or thromboembolicevents were reported.
 
Avatrombopag for the acute treatment of thrombocytopenia patients, including patients without CLD
 
In addition to developing avatrombopag for the treatment of thrombocytopenia in CLD patients scheduled to undergo a procedure, we believe avatrombopag may be effective in a broader population of patients with thrombocytopenia regardless of disease etiology undergoing a broader set of medical procedures, including, for example, joint replacements. We also believe it may have the potential for use to reduce the development thrombocytopenia in patients receiving specific types of chemotherapy.
 
·                  Pre-Surgery Thrombocytopenia, (PST).  In addition to our initial focus on the treatment of thrombocytopenia in CLD patients scheduled to undergo a procedure, we intend to explore avatrombopag for the treatment of patients with thrombocytopenia in broader patient populations scheduled to undergo surgery. This PST clinical trial will include patients with thrombocytopenia, regardless of etiology, undergoing surgeries that require a platelet count prior to surgery of 100,000 or more platelets per microliter of circulating blood. There are approximately 125,000 platelet transfusions performed prior to surgery in the United States each year in patients with thrombocytopenia. For patients with thrombocytopenia undergoing surgery, in particular, we believe avatrombopag has the potential to increase platelet counts above 100,000 platelets per microliter of circulating blood, thereby enabling the surgeon to conduct the planned procedure.
 
We intend to initiate an open-label Phase 3 clinical trial in the first quarter of 2018 to evaluate avatrombopag for the treatment of a broader population of patients with thrombocytopenia undergoing surgery. We intend to enroll 60 to 90 subjects in this clinical trial. The primary endpoint of the trial will be the percentage of subjects who achieve platelet counts of greater than or equal to 100,000 platelets per microliter of circulating blood on the day of the procedure (i.e., prior to receiving a platelet transfusion or undergoing the procedure). Secondary endpoints will include the change from baseline in platelet count on the day of the procedure and the percentage of subjects without platelet transfusion or any other treatment for bleeding after the baseline visit and for up to seven days following the procedure. We do not anticipate seeking a labeled indication based on this clinical trial.
 
·                  Patients with chemotherapy-induced thrombocytopenia (CIT).  CIT is a common complication in cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy treatment. Clinicians responses to thrombocytopenia in a cancer patient vary and commonly include a reduction in the dose intensity of chemotherapy, delay in planned treatment cycles, avoidance of more effective regimens with thrombocytopenic toxicity and treatment may even be precluded. Platelet transfusions are often the only treatment; however, platelet transfusions create the additional risk of transfusion reactions or infections, and may lead to the development of platelet refractoriness with repeated platelet transfusions. Changes in treatment dosing and timing can compromise chemotherapy treatment and lead to sub-optimal outcomes in cancer patients. Approximately 400,000 patients with solid tumors in the United States are treated with chemotherapy each year, of which approximately 175,000 patients develop CIT. We intend to initiate a Phase 3 clinical trial to evaluate avatrombopag for the treatment of patients who have developed CIT as a strategy to prevent the development of CIT in subsequent chemotherapy cycles in the second quarter of 2018. We expect to enroll approximately 120 subjects with active non-hematological cancers who have previously developed CIT in this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. The primary objective of the trial will be to evaluate the efficacy of avatrombopag in increasing platelet counts and therefore preventing the need for a platelet transfusion, chemotherapy dose reduction, or chemotherapy cycle delay.
 
Avatrombopag for the chronic treatment of thrombocytopenia in adults with chronic ITP
 
Based on a discussion with the FDA in December 2017, we are also planning to submit a sNDA for avatrombopag for the treatment of adults with chronic ITP based on results from Phase 2 and Phase 3 trials in this patient population. We estimate that chronic ITP affects approximately 60,000 adults in the United States, of which up to 27,000 may require continuous treatment beyond corticosteroids and IVIG.  We believe avatrombopag has several potential advantages over the other TPO-RAs in terms of safety, convenience and dosing.
 
To date, avatrombopag has been evaluated in one Phase 3 clinical trial and two Phase 2 clinical trials for the treatment of adults with chronic ITP, in which an aggregate of 128 subjects received avatrombopag with a median duration of treatment of seven months. In the Phase 3 trial, the primary efficacy endpoint was met with high statistical significance (p < 0.0001) and avatrombopag was observed to have a favorable safety profile with chronic administration. The results of these trials have previously
 
12




been submitted to the FDA, and we had a meeting in December 2017 to discuss the results and a potential regulatory filing. Success in these previous trials does not ensure that we will be able to adequately demonstrate the efficacy and safety of avatrombopag to the FDA to support approval. However, based on these results and recent discussions with FDA, we anticipate submitting an sNDA for the treatment of chronic ITP in the second half of 2018.
 
MANUFACTURING
 
We do not have any manufacturing facilities. We rely on Eisai, acting as our contract manufacturer, for the production of avatrombopag for clinical trials and commercial supply, and expect to continue to rely on Eisai for the commercial manufacture of avatrombopag if it receives marketing approval. We have entered into a long-term supply agreement with Eisai to govern this manufacturing support. We believe commercial manufacture will occur at the same facilities at which pre-commercial manufacturing and analytical testing was performed.
 
Eisais manufacturing facilities have produced avatrombopag tablets and executed analytical testing on multiple development batches and six batches at commercial scale since 2010, employing routine methods and equipment that are commonly used in the pharmaceutical industry for oral solid dosage processing. The facility that synthesizes the API has successfully completed process validation. In addition, process validation has also been completed at the drug product manufacturing facility. All analytical test methods for both the API as well as the drug product have been successfully validated at these facilities.
 
We believe Eisais manufacturing processes are in compliance with guidance from global regulatory authorities such that the drug should meet the manufacturing requirements for world-wide distribution pending appropriate regulatory clearance in the applicable jurisdiction. There is an active stability program designed to ensure the safety and efficacy of the drug while in distribution. We anticipate that avatrombopag finished product will have a shelf life of at least 48 months at the time of launch.
 
COMMERCIALIZATION
 
Our intent is to initially build a hepatology-focused sales organization in the United States. We intend to target the approximately 850 hepatologists, most of whom are working at one of the approximately 150 liver transplant centers in the United States. In addition to the sales force, we intend to support the launch of avatrombopag with a dedicated team of reimbursement support case managers as well as a network of specialty pharmacy service providers that will distribute the drug directly to the patients home.  As we expand the indications for avatrombopag, we also intend to broaden our sales force to target hematologists and oncologists while leveraging the existing reimbursement and distribution infrastructure we created for our initial indication. We have begun to execute on this strategy by hiring key executives with extensive U.S. commercial launch experience.
 
We may pursue collaborations with third parties to commercialize our drug candidates outside the United States, either through territorial licenses or distributor relationships. In the future, we also may selectively partner with leading companies that we believe can contribute additional resources and know-how for the development and commercialization of avatrombopag for additional indications and geographic regions, further enhancing the value of our drug candidate.
 
We believe that it is imperative to keep the patient at the center of our focus, and we intend to work with and listen closely to key stakeholders, including patient advocacy groups, healthcare professionals, key opinion leaders and academic institutions, to ensure that we clearly understand their issues, insights and recommendations. The feedback from and collaboration with these groups will inform our key strategies.
 
COMPETITION
 
The pharmaceutical industry is characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition and a strong emphasis on proprietary drugs. We face potential competition from many different sources, including major pharmaceutical, specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions, governmental agencies and public and private research institutions. Any drug candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize will compete with existing treatments and new treatments that may become available in the future.
 
The key competitive factors affecting the success of avatrombopag, if approved, are likely to be its efficacy, safety, convenience, pricing and durability.
 
With respect to avatrombopag for the treatment of thrombocytopenia in patients with CLD scheduled to undergo a procedure, we will be initially competing with platelet transfusions, since neither of the approved TPO-RAs are FDA-approved for this indication. However, we also anticipate some competition from TPO-RAs being used off-label. In addition, Shionogi is developing lusutrombopag, another TPO-RA, for the treatment of thrombocytopenia in patients with CLD undergoing planned invasive surgical procedures, which has previously been approved in Japan and has recently completed one global Phase 3 clinical trial with approximately 200 patients that successfully met primary and secondary endpoints and has been granted fast track designation by the FDA. Shionogi has reportedly submitted a NDA to the FDA in December 2017 and a MAA to the EMA in January 2018 for lusutrombopag for the treatment of thrombocytopenia in patients with CLD undergoing planned invasive surgical procedures.
 
13




With respect to avatrombopag for the treatment of thrombocytopenia in patients with ITP, we anticipate competing directly with the currently marketed TPO-RAs Promacta and Nplate. In addition, we are aware that Rigel Pharmaceuticals, Inc., argenx N.V., Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, Shire PLC, Immunomedics Inc., Protalex Inc. and others are developing drugs that may have utility for the treatment of ITP.
 
We are also aware of several other drug candidates in earlier stages of development as potential treatments for the indications that we intend to target.
 
Our commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize drugs that are safer, more effective, more convenient, less expensive or with a more favorable label than avatrombopag or any other drug that we may develop. Our competitors also may obtain FDA or other regulatory approvals for their drugs more rapidly than we may obtain approval for our drug, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market. Many of the companies against which we are competing, or against which we may compete in the future, have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing approved drugs than we do. Mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. These competitors will also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel and establishing clinical trial sites and subject registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or that may be necessary for, our programs.
 
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
 
Our commercial success depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain proprietary protection for avatrombopag and any of our future drug candidates, novel discoveries, drug development technologies and know-how; to operate without infringing on or otherwise violating the proprietary rights of others; and to prevent others from infringing or otherwise violating our proprietary rights. Our policy is to seek to protect our proprietary position by, among other methods, filing or in-licensing U.S. and foreign patents and patent applications related to our drug candidate and other proprietary technology, inventions and improvements that are important to the development and implementation of our business. We also rely on trademarks, trade secrets, know-how, continuing technological innovation and potential in-licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our proprietary position.
 
While we seek broad coverage under our pending patent applications, there is always a risk that a modification of the manufacturing process may allow a competitor to avoid infringement claims. In addition, patents, if granted, expire and we cannot provide any assurance that any patents will be issued from our pending or any future applications or that any issued patents will adequately protect our drugs or drug candidates.
 
As of January 17, 2018, we own 25 foreign patents and one foreign patent application related to avatrombopag, and we license from Astellas three granted U.S. patents, 74 foreign patents and two foreign patent applications related to avatrombopag. Our patent portfolio for avatrombopag includes a patent family directed to the avatrombopag composition of matter and methods of using avatrombopag, which is expected to expire between 2023 and 2029, including available patent term adjustment and patent term extension. Our patent portfolio for avatrombopag also includes a European patent directed to the crystalline avatrombopag compound, which is expected to expire in 2032, excluding any patent term extension and patent term adjustment that may be available.
 
Individual patents extend for varying periods depending on the date of filing of the patent application or the date of patent issuance and the legal term of patents in the countries in which they are obtained. Generally, patents issued from regularly filed applications in the United States are granted a term of 20 years from the earliest effective filing date. In addition, in certain instances, a patent term can be adjusted to recapture a portion of the United States Patent and Trademark Office, or the USPTO, delay in issuing the patent, and extended to recapture a portion of the patent term effectively lost as a result of the FDA regulatory review period of the drug covered by the patent. However, as to the FDA component, the restoration period cannot be longer than five years, the total patent term including the restoration period must not exceed 14 years following FDA approval of the drug, and the extension may only apply to one patent that covers the approved drug (and to only those patent claims covering the approved drug, a method for using it, or a method for manufacturing it). There can be no assurance that any such patent term adjustment or extension will be obtained. The duration of foreign patents varies in accordance with provisions of applicable local law, but typically is also 20 years from the earliest effective filing date. However, the actual protection afforded by a patent varies on a product-by-product basis, from country to country and depends upon many factors, including the type of patent, the scope of its coverage, the availability of regulatory-related extensions, the availability of legal remedies in a particular country and the validity and enforceability of the patent.
 
Furthermore, we rely upon trade secrets, know-how and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position. We seek to protect our proprietary information, in part, using confidentiality agreements with our commercial partners, collaborators, employees and consultants and invention assignment agreements with our employees. We also have confidentiality agreements or invention assignment agreements with our commercial partners and selected consultants. These agreements are designed to protect our proprietary information and, in the case of the invention assignment agreements, to grant us ownership of technologies that are developed through a relationship with a third party. These agreements may be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any such breach. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors. To the
 
14




extent that our commercial partners, collaborators, employees and consultants use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting know-how and inventions.
 
Our commercial success will also depend in part on not infringing upon or otherwise violating the intellectual property and proprietary rights of third parties. If we are found to infringe a third partys intellectual property rights, we could be required to obtain a license from such third party to continue developing and marketing our drugs and technology. However, we may not be able to obtain any required license on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Even if we were able to obtain a license, it could be non-exclusive, thereby giving our competitors access to the same technologies licensed to us. We could also be forced, including by court order, to cease commercializing the infringing technology or drug. In addition, we could be found liable for monetary damages, including treble damages and attorneys fees if we are found to have willfully infringed a patent. A finding of infringement could prevent us from commercializing our drug candidates or force us to cease some of our business operations. For more information regarding these risks, please see Risk FactorsRisks related to our intellectual property.
 
Agreements with Eisai
 
We acquired worldwide rights to avatrombopag from Eisai in March 2016 pursuant to a stock purchase agreement, or the Eisai stock purchase agreement. Under the Eisai stock purchase agreement, we acquired all of the shares of our wholly-owned subsidiary AkaRx, Inc., or AkaRx. Pursuant to the Eisai stock purchase agreement, Eisai received an upfront payment of $5.0 million and we are obligated to pay Eisai aggregate milestone payments up to $135.0 million based on annual net sales of avatrombopag, which would be calculated on an annual basis after commercialization. The rights to avatrombopag, including any associated intellectual property and regulatory rights, are subject to a right of reversion in the event we fail to make any required milestone payment or in the event we elect to discontinue the avatrombopag program. Until we pay Eisai all of the milestone payments contemplated under the Eisai stock purchase agreement, we must use commercially reasonable efforts to commercialize and sell avatrombopag. Eisai has a right of first negotiation if we should seek to grant a third party the right to market avatrombopag in Japan, China, South Korea or Taiwan.
 
In March 2016, in connection with the acquisition of the global rights to avatrombopag from Eisai, AkaRx entered into a transition services agreement with Eisai, or the TSA. Pursuant to the TSA, Eisai has agreed to continue as sponsor of the ongoing clinical trials for avatrombopag and to provide certain clinical, project management, pharmacovigilance, medical writing, regulatory and CMC services for us related to the avatrombopag program.
 
Under the terms of the TSA and the Eisai stock purchase agreement, Eisai agreed to oversee and manage the ongoing clinical trials and continue to hold and maintain the INDs for avatrombopag. Pursuant to the Eisai stock purchase agreement, we have the right to have the INDs transferred to us at any time. We are obligated to pay Eisai for services provided by Eisai personnel based on a fixed payment schedule. To the extent that service fees and out-of-pocket costs payable by us to Eisai under the TSA exceed $51.0 million, our obligation to pay milestone payments under the Eisai stock purchase agreement will be reduced. We may terminate the services provided under the TSA on a service-by-service basis or the agreement in its entirety upon 60-days written notice. The TSA may also be terminated (i) by mutual consent, (ii) by either party upon 60-days written notice if the other party materially breaches the agreement, (iii) by either party in the event of the other partys bankruptcy, insolvency or certain similar occurrences and (iv) by either party in the event that such party is unable to perform its obligations under the agreement as a result of events outside of its reasonable control.
 
At the time that AkaRx entered into the TSA, it also issued the Eisai note to Eisai. Under the terms of the Eisai note, the principal consists solely of the unpaid out-of-pocket costs and service fees due under the TSA. The Eisai note matures on March 30, 2018 and bears interest at a rate of 5% per annum. As of December 31, 2017, we had outstanding borrowings of $30.2 million under this Eisai note, additional TSA expenses of $1.0 million included in accrued expenses and we owed Eisai $1.0 million of accrued interest. A single interest-only payment of $0.4 million was paid in March 2017. The Eisai note is secured by a blanket security interest on all of the assets of AkaRx, including the worldwide rights to avatrombopag. Payments due pursuant to the Eisai note are currently guaranteed by PBM Capital Investments, LLC.  We intend to enter into a commercial debt facility with one or more third party lenders to refinance some or all of the borrowings under the Eisai note and maintain our liquidity position. The terms of any such facility may result in increased fixed payment obligations and certain restrictive covenants, such as limitations on our ability to incur additional debt or other operating restrictions.  However, there can be no assurances that we will be able to secure such funding on terms that are commercially reasonable and acceptable to us.
 
In June 2017, we entered into a supply agreement with Eisai, pursuant to which we agreed to purchase finished drug product for avatrombopag from Eisai and Eisai agreed to supply finished drug product for avatrombopag to us. The initial term of the agreement will terminate on the later of March 30, 2021 and the third anniversary of our first commercial sale of avatrombopag. After the initial term, the supply agreement may be renewed by mutual agreement of the parties. During the initial term, Eisai is our exclusive supplier of finished drug product, except that we have the right to terminate the exclusivity early by payment to Eisai of a fee calculated based on our forecasted purchases of avatrombopag during the remainder of the initial term. In addition, in the event that Eisai fails to deliver substantially all of the finished drug product due to us under the agreement, we may elect to seek alternative supply arrangements so long as such failure remains uncured, subject to certain exceptions. The aggregate payments to Eisai under the supply agreement for finished drug product will be the greater of a fixed payment per tablet and a payment calculated in the mid-single digit percentages of net sales of avatrombopag. Under the terms of the agreement, Eisai is required to assist us with transferring the technology associated with manufacturing avatrombopag to a new manufacturer at our request and to transfer or license to us any rights necessary to manufacture finished drug product, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions set forth in the supply agreement. In addition, at our
 
15




request, Eisai is required to supply us with starting materials, active pharmaceutical ingredients or bulk product for avatrombopag, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions set forth in the supply agreement.  However, there can be no assurances that we will be able to secure a new manufacturing facility on terms that are commercially reasonable and acceptable to us.
 
License agreement with Astellas
 
The primary intellectual property related to avatrombopag is licensed to us from Astellas on an exclusive, worldwide basis under the terms of a license agreement we acquired from Eisai in connection with our acquisition of the rights to avatrombopag from Eisai. Under the terms of the license agreement, we are required to make payments upon the achievement of certain milestones. On September 21, 2017, upon the submission of the NDA, we became obligated to make a milestone payment of $1.0 million within 30 days.  This payment was made in October 2017.  We will be required to make additional aggregate milestone payments of up to $4.0 million to Astellas if certain other regulatory milestones are achieved. In addition, we will be required to pay Astellas tiered royalties in the mid to high single-digit percentages on net sales of avatrombopag. No amounts have been accrued for any potential future milestone payments as such payments have not been deemed probable.  See Note 3 The purchase agreement and related transactions in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report for additional information.

The AkaRx services agreement is terminable at will by either party with or without notice.
 
GOVERNMENT REGULATION
 
FDA drug approval process
 
In the United States, drugs are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, and other federal and state statutes and regulations, govern, among other things, the research, development, clinical and preclinical testing, manufacture, storage, recordkeeping, approval, labeling, promotion and marketing, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, sampling and import and export of drugs. The processes for obtaining regulatory approvals in the United States and in foreign countries and jurisdictions, along with subsequent compliance with applicable statutes and regulations and other regulatory authorities, require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the drug development process may subject a company to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as FDA refusal to approve pending NDAs warning or untitled letters, imposition of a clinical hold, withdrawal of approval, drug recalls, drug seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, civil penalties and criminal prosecution.
 
We cannot market a drug candidate in the United States until the drug has received FDA approval.
 
The steps required before a drug may be marketed in the United States generally include the following:
 
·                  completion of extensive pre-clinical laboratory tests, animal studies, and formulation studies in accordance with the FDAs Good Laboratory Practice, or GLP, regulations;
 
·                  submission to the FDA of an IND for human clinical testing, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;
 
·                  approval by an independent institutional review board, or IRB, at each clinical site or a central IRB serving multiple client sites before each trial may be initiated;
 
·                  performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with GCP requirements to establish the safety and efficacy of the drug for each proposed indication;
 
·                  submission to the FDA of an NDA after completion of all pivotal clinical trials;
 
·                  satisfactory completion of an FDA advisory committee review, if applicable;
 
16




·                  satisfactory completion of an FDA study site and/or sponsor inspections;
 
·                  satisfactory completion of an FDA pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the active pharmaceutical ingredient, or API, and finished drug are produced and tested to assess compliance with cGMP requirements; and
 
·                  FDA review and approval of the NDA prior to any commercial marketing or sale of the drug in the United States and review and approval of any supplemental NDA prior to any commercial marketing for additional clinical use indications.
 
Satisfaction of FDA pre-market approval requirements typically takes many years and the actual time required may vary substantially based upon the type, complexity and novelty of the drug or disease.
 
Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluation of drug chemistry, formulation and toxicity, as well as animal trials to assess the characteristics and potential safety and efficacy of the drug. The conduct of the preclinical tests must comply with federal regulations and requirements, including GLP. An IND sponsor must submit the results of preclinical testing to the FDA as part of an IND along with other information, including information about drug chemistry, manufacturing and controls and a proposed clinical trial protocol. Long-term preclinical tests, such as animal tests of reproductive toxicity and carcinogenicity, may continue after the IND is submitted.
 
A 30-day waiting period after the submission of each IND is required prior to the commencement of clinical testing in humans. If the FDA has neither commented on nor questioned the IND within this 30-day period, the clinical trial proposed in the IND may begin. If the FDA raises concerns or questions about the conduct of the trial, such as whether human research subjects will be exposed to an unreasonable health risk, the FDA may require that the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding FDA concerns or questions before clinical trials can proceed.
 
Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational new drug to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of a qualified investigator. Clinical trials must be conducted in compliance with federal regulations, including GCP requirements, which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent in writing for their participation in any clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing the objectives of the trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. Each protocol and subsequent protocol amendment must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND.
 
The FDA may order the temporary, or permanent, discontinuation of a clinical trial at any time, or impose other sanctions, if it believes that the clinical trial either is not being conducted in accordance with FDA requirements or presents an unacceptable risk to the clinical trial patients. The study protocol and informed consent information for patients in clinical trials must also be submitted to an IRB, for approval for each site at which the clinical trial will be conducted. An IRB may also require the clinical trial at the site to be halted, either temporarily or permanently, for failure to comply with the IRBs requirements, or may impose other conditions. Information about certain clinical trials must be submitted within specific timeframes to the National Institutes of Health, or NIH, for public dissemination on their www.clinicaltrials.gov website.
 
Clinical trials to support NDAs for marketing approval are typically conducted in three sequential phases, but the phases may overlap. In Phase 1, the initial introduction of the drug into a small number (between 20 and 100) of healthy human subjects or patients, the drug is tested to assess pharmacological actions, side effects associated with increasing doses and, if possible, early evidence on effectiveness. Phase 2 usually involves trials in a larger patient population (up to several hundred) to determine metabolism, PK, the effectiveness of the drug for a particular indication, dosage tolerance and optimum dosage, and to identify common adverse effects and safety risks. If a compound demonstrates evidence of effectiveness and an acceptable safety profile in Phase 2 evaluations, Phase 3 clinical trials are undertaken to obtain the additional information about clinical efficacy and safety in a larger number of patients (between 300 and 3,000), typically at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites, to permit the FDA to evaluate the overall benefit-risk relationship of the drug and to provide adequate information for the labeling of the drug. In most cases, the FDA requires two adequate and well controlled Phase 3 clinical trials to demonstrate the efficacy of the drug. A single Phase 3 clinical trial with other confirmatory evidence may be sufficient in some instances where the study is a large multicenter trial demonstrating internal consistency and a statistically very persuasive finding of a clinically meaningful effect on mortality, reversible morbidity or prevention of a disease with a potentially serious outcome, when confirmation of the result in a second trial would be practically or ethically impossible.
 
The FDA and an IND sponsor may agree in writing on the design and size of clinical studies intended to form the primary basis of a claim of effectiveness in an NDA. This process is known as a Special Protocol Assessment, or SPA. An SPA agreement is not a guarantee of drug approval by the FDA or approval of any permissible claims about the drug, but does establish some agreements with the FDA regarding key features of the study design and analysis, including, for example, the primary endpoint, number of subjects and statistical methodology. The FDA retains significant latitude and discretion in interpreting the terms of the SPA agreement and the data and results from any study that is the subject of a SPA agreement. In particular, a SPA agreement is not binding on the FDA if previously unrecognized public health concerns later come to light, other new scientific concerns regarding drug safety or efficacy arise, clinical
 
17




treatment standards change with the approval of other new drugs the IND sponsor fails to comply with the protocol agreed upon, or the relevant data, assumptions, or information provided by the IND sponsor when requesting an SPA agreement change, are found to be false statements or misstatements, or are found to omit relevant facts. An SPA agreement may not be changed by the sponsor or the FDA after the trial begins except with the written agreement of the sponsor and the FDA, or if the FDA determines that a substantial scientific issue essential to determining the safety or effectiveness of the drug was identified after the testing began.
 
Clinical studies at each phase of development may not be completed successfully within any specified period, or at all. Furthermore, the FDA, an IRB, the sponsor or the data monitoring committee, if applicable, may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. The FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP and the integrity of the clinical data submitted, as well as the sponsors offices, if appropriate.
 
After completion of the required clinical testing, an NDA is prepared and submitted to the FDA. FDA approval of the NDA is required before marketing of the drug may begin in the United States. The NDA must include the results of all preclinical, clinical and other testing and a compilation of data relating to the drugs pharmacology, chemistry, manufacture and controls. In addition, under the Pediatric Research Equity Act, or PREA, an NDA must contain data to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the drug is safe and effective. The cost of preparing and submitting an NDA is substantial. The submission of most NDAs is additionally subject to a substantial application user fee, and the manufacturer and sponsor under an approved NDA are also subject to annual program user fees. These fees are typically increased annually. Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, guidelines that are currently in effect, the FDA has a goal of ten months from the date of filing of a standard NDA for a new molecular entity to review and act on the submission. This review typically takes 12 months from the date the NDA is submitted to FDA because the FDA has 60 days from its receipt of an NDA to determine whether the application will be accepted for filing based on the agencys threshold determination that it is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review.
 
Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review. The FDA may request additional information rather than accept an NDA for filing. In this event, the application must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application is also subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review. The FDA reviews an NDA to determine, among other things, whether the drug is safe and effective, whether the data are consistent and reliable and whether the facility in which it is manufactured, processed, packaged or held meets industry and regulatory standards designed to assure the drugs continued safety, quality and purity.
 
The FDA may also refer applications for a novel drug, or drug that presents difficult questions of safety or efficacy, to an advisory committeetypically a panel that includes clinicians and other expertsfor review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, but it generally follows such recommendations. Additionally, the FDA will inspect the facility or the facilities at which the drug is manufactured. The FDA will not approve the drug unless compliance with cGMPs is satisfactory and the NDA contains data that provide substantial evidence that the drug is safe and effective in the indication studied.
 
After the FDA evaluates the NDA and the manufacturing facilities, it issues either an approval letter or a complete response letter. A complete response letter generally outlines the deficiencies in the submission and may require substantial additional testing, or information, in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. If, or when, those deficiencies have been addressed to the FDAs satisfaction in a resubmission of the NDA and the FDA has determined that the drug is safe and effective and provides clinical benefit, the FDA will issue an approval letter. The FDA has committed to reviewing such resubmissions in two or six months depending on the type and complexity of information included.
 
An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications, i.e., the label. Even if the FDA approves a drug, it may limit the approved indications for use of the drug, require that contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the drug labeling, require that post-approval studies, including Phase 4 clinical trials, be conducted to further assess a drugs safety after approval, require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the drug after commercialization, or impose other conditions, including distribution and use restrictions or other risk management mechanisms under a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, or REMS, to ensure that the benefits of the drug outweigh the potential risks. A REMS can include a medication guide, a communication plan for healthcare professionals and elements to assure safe use, such as special training and certification requirements for individuals who prescribe or dispense the drug, requirements that patients enroll in a registry and other measures that the FDA deems necessary to assure the safe use of the drug. The requirement for a REMS can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the drug. The FDA may prevent or limit further marketing of a drug based on the results of post-marketing studies or surveillance programs. Once granted, drug approvals may be withdrawn if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or problems are identified following initial marketing.
 
Changes to some of the conditions established in an approved application, including changes in indications, labeling, or manufacturing processes or facilities, require submission and FDA approval of a new NDA or NDA supplement before the change can be implemented. An NDA supplement for a new indication typically requires clinical data similar to that in the original application, and the FDA uses the same procedures and actions in reviewing NDA supplements as it does in reviewing NDAs. Such supplements are typically reviewed
 
18




within 10 months of receipt.
 
Post-approval requirements
 
At the time an NDA is approved, a drug may be subject to certain post-approval requirements, which may include additional clinical trials. In addition, the FDA closely regulates the post-approval marketing and promotion of drugs, including standards and regulations for direct-to-consumer advertising, off-label promotion, industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities and promotional activities involving the internet and social media. Drugs may be marketed and promoted only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved labeling.
 
Post-marketing pharmacovigilance activities, adverse event reporting and submission of periodic reports are required following FDA approval of an NDA. The FDA also routinely conducts inspections of the sponsor or delegated vendors to ensure compliance with quality systems, appropriate oversight, collection and review of safety data and product complaints. The FDA also may require post-marketing testing, known as Phase 4 testing, REMS, surveillance to monitor the effects of an approved drug, or restrictions on the distribution or use of the drug. In addition, quality- control, drug manufacture, packaging and labeling procedures must continue to conform to cGMPs after approval. Drug manufacturers and certain of their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies. Registration with the FDA subjects entities to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA, during which the agency inspects manufacturing facilities to assess compliance with cGMPs. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the areas of production and quality-control to maintain compliance with cGMPs. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a drug, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in mandatory revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information, imposition of post-market studies or clinical trials to assess new safety risks or imposition of distribution or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things:
 
·                  restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the drug, complete withdrawal of the drug from the market or drug recalls;
 
·                  fines, warning letters or holds on post-approval clinical trials;
 
·                  refusal of the FDA to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications, or suspension or revocation of drug approvals;
 
·                  barring individuals from continued involvement in the pharmaceutical industry;
 
·                  drug seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of drugs; or
 
·                  injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.
 
The FDA strictly regulates marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of drugs that are placed on the market. Drugs may be promoted only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA and other agencies actively monitor compliance and enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability.
 
Foreign regulation
 
In order to market any drug outside of the United States, we need to comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements of other countries and jurisdictions regarding quality, safety and efficacy and governing, among other things, clinical trials, marketing authorization, commercial sales and distribution of our drugs. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a drug, we would need to also obtain the necessary approvals by the comparable foreign regulatory authorities before we can commence clinical trials or marketing of the drug in foreign countries and jurisdictions. Although many of the issues discussed above with respect to the United States apply similarly in the context of the European Union, the approval process varies between countries and jurisdictions and can involve additional drug testing, clinical trials and additional administrative review periods. The time required to obtain approval in other countries and jurisdictions might differ from and be longer than that required to obtain FDA approval. Regulatory approval in one country or jurisdiction does not ensure regulatory approval in another, but a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one country or jurisdiction may negatively impact the regulatory process in others.
 
Other healthcare laws
 
Although we currently do not have any drugs on the market, our current and future business operations may be subject to additional healthcare regulation and enforcement by the federal government and by authorities in the states and foreign jurisdictions in which we conduct our business. Such laws include, without limitation, state and federal anti-kickback, fraud and abuse, false claims, privacy and security, price reporting and physician sunshine laws. Some of our pre-commercial activities are subject to some of these laws.
 
The federal Anti-Kickback Statute makes it illegal for any person or entity, including a prescription drug manufacturer or a party acting
 
19




on its behalf to knowingly and willfully, directly or indirectly, solicit, receive, offer, or pay any remuneration that is intended to induce the referral of business, including the purchase, order, lease of any good, facility, item or service for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program, such as Medicare or Medicaid. The term remuneration has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value. The Anti-Kickback Statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on one hand and prescribers, purchasers, formulary managers, and beneficiaries on the other.
 
Although there are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting some common activities from prosecution, the exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly. Practices that involve remuneration that may be alleged to be intended to induce prescribing, purchases or recommendations may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exception or safe harbor. Failure to meet all of the requirements of a particular applicable statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor does not make the conduct per se illegal under the Anti-Kickback Statute. Instead, the legality of the arrangement will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis based on a cumulative review of all its facts and circumstances. Several courts have interpreted the statutes intent requirement to mean that if any one purpose of an arrangement involving remuneration is to induce referrals of federal healthcare covered business, the Anti-Kickback Statute has been violated. In addition, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. Violations of this law are punishable by up to five years in prison, and can also result in criminal fines, civil money penalties and exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs.
 
Moreover, a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal civil False Claims Act.
 
The federal civil False Claims Act prohibits, among other things, any person or entity from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, for payment to, or approval by, federal programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, claims for items or services, including drugs, that are false or fraudulent or not provided as claimed. Persons and entities can be held liable under these laws if they are deemed to cause the submission of false or fraudulent claims by, for example, providing inaccurate billing or coding information to customers or promoting a drug off-label. In addition, our future activities relating to the reporting of wholesaler or estimated retail prices for our drugs, the reporting of prices used to calculate Medicaid rebate information and other information affecting federal, state and third-party reimbursement for our drugs, and the sale and marketing of our drugs, are subject to scrutiny under this law. Penalties for federal civil False Claims Act violations may include up to three times the actual damages sustained by the government, plus mandatory civil penalties of between $10,781.40 and $21,562.80 for each separate false claim, the potential for exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs, and, although the federal False Claims Act is a civil statute, False Claims Act violations may also implicate various federal criminal statutes.
 
HIPAA created new federal criminal statutes that prohibit among other actions, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors, knowingly and willfully embezzling or stealing from a healthcare benefit program, willfully obstructing a criminal investigation of a healthcare offense, and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. Like the federal Anti-Kickback Statute a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation.
 
The civil monetary penalties statute imposes penalties against any person or entity that, among other things, is determined to have presented or caused to be presented a claim to a federal health program that the person knows or should know is for an item or service that was not provided as claimed or is false or fraudulent.
 
Also, many states have similar fraud and abuse statutes or regulations that may be broader in scope and may apply regardless of payor, in addition to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs.
 
Additionally, to the extent that any of our drugs are sold in a foreign country, we may be subject to similar foreign laws.
 
HIPAA, as amended by HITECH, and their implementing regulations, including the final omnibus rule published on January 25, 2013, mandate, among other things, the adoption of uniform standards for the electronic exchange of information in common healthcare transactions, as well as standards relating to the privacy and security of individually identifiable health information, which require the adoption of administrative, physical and technical safeguards to protect such information. Among other things, HITECH makes HIPAAs security standards directly applicable to business associates, defined as independent contractors or agents of covered entities that create, receive or obtain protected health information in connection with providing a service for or on behalf of a covered entity. HITECH also increased the civil and criminal penalties that may be imposed against covered entities and business associates, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorneys fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. In addition, certain state laws govern the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, some of which are more stringent than HIPAA and many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts. Failure to comply with these laws, where applicable, can result in the imposition of significant civil and criminal penalties.
 
The Physician Payments Sunshine Act, which was created under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, or collectively the Affordable Care Act, imposes, among other things, annual reporting requirements for covered manufacturers for certain payments and other transfers of value provided to physicians and teaching hospitals,
 
20




as well as certain ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. Failure to submit timely, accurately and completely the required information for all payments, transfers of value and ownership or investment interests may result in civil monetary penalties of up to an aggregate of $150,000 per year and up to an aggregate of $1 million per year for knowing failures. Certain states also mandate implementation of compliance programs, impose restrictions on drug manufacturer marketing practices or require the tracking and reporting of gifts, compensation or other remuneration to physicians.
 
Because we intend to commercialize drugs that could be reimbursed under a federal healthcare program and other governmental healthcare programs, we intend to develop a comprehensive compliance program that establishes internal control to facilitate adherence to the rules and program requirements to which we will or may become subject. Although the development and implementation of compliance programs designed to establish internal control and facilitate compliance can mitigate the risk of investigation, prosecution, and penalties assessed for violations of these laws, the risks cannot be entirely eliminated.
 
If our operations are found to be in violation of any of such laws or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including, without limitation, administrative, civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, additional reporting requirements and oversight if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or similar agreement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws, the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs and individual imprisonment, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results.
 
Health reform
 
In the United States and foreign jurisdictions, there have been a number of legislative and regulatory changes to the healthcare system that could affect our future results of operations. There have been and continue to be a number of initiatives at the United States federal and state levels that seek to reduce healthcare costs.
 
In particular, the Affordable Care Act has had a significant impact on the healthcare industry. The Affordable Care Act was designed to expand coverage for the uninsured while at the same time containing overall healthcare costs. With regard to drugs, among other things, the Affordable Care Act revised the definition of average manufacturer price for calculating and reporting Medicaid drug rebates on outpatient prescription drug prices and imposed a significant annual fee on companies that manufacture or import certain branded prescription drugs. Substantial new provisions affecting compliance have also been enacted, which may require us to modify our business practices with healthcare providers and entities, and certain provisions are not yet, or have only recently become, effective.
 
In addition, there have been judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the Affordable Care Act. As a result, there have been delays in the implementation of, and action taken to repeal or replace, certain aspects of the Affordable Care Act. Since January 2017, President Trump has signed two executive orders and other directives designed to delay, circumvent, or loosen certain requirements mandated by the Affordable Care Act. Concurrently, Congress has considered legislation that would repeal or repeal and replace all or part of the Affordable Care Act. While Congress has not passed repeal legislation, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 includes a provision repealing, effective January 1, 2019, the tax-based shared responsibility payment imposed by the Affordable Care Act on certain individuals who fail to maintain qualifying health coverage for all or part of a year that is commonly referred to as the individual mandate. Additionally, on January 22, 2018, President Trump signed a continuing resolution on appropriations for fiscal year 2018 that delayed the implementation of certain ACA-mandated fees, including the so-called Cadillac tax on certain high cost employer-sponsored insurance plans, the annual fee imposed on certain health insurance providers based on market share, and the medical device excise tax on non-exempt medical devices. Congress may consider other legislation to repeal or replace elements of the Affordable Care Act. Although we cannot predict the ultimate content, timing or effect of any changes to the Affordable Care Act or other federal and state reform efforts, we continue to evaluate the effect that the Affordable Care Act, as amended or replaced, will have on our business. In the coming years, additional legislative and regulatory changes could be made to governmental health programs that could significantly impact pharmaceutical companies and the success of our drug candidate.
 
In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the Affordable Care Act was enacted. In August 2011, the President signed into law the Budget Control Act of 2011, which, among other things, created the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction to recommend to Congress proposals in spending reductions. The Joint Select Committee did not achieve a targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for the years 2013 through 2021, triggering the legislations automatic reduction to several government programs. These included reductions to Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect on April 1, 2013 and, due to subsequent legislative amendments to the statute, will stay in effect through 2025 unless additional Congressional action is taken. Additionally, in January 2013, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 was signed into law, which, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several providers and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years.
 
In addition, there has been heightened governmental scrutiny recently over the manner in which drug manufacturers set prices for their marketed drugs, which have resulted in several Congressional inquiries and proposed federal and proposed and enacted state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, reduce the cost of drugs under Medicare, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drugs. At the federal level, Congress and the Trump administration have each indicated that it will continue to seek new legislative and/or administrative measures to control drug costs. At the state level, legislatures have become increasingly aggressive in passing legislation
 
21




and implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing.
 
Moreover, the Drug Supply Chain Security Act, imposes new obligations on manufacturers of drugs, among others, related to drug tracking and tracing, which will be phased in over several years beginning in 2016. Among the requirements of this legislation, manufacturers will be required to provide certain information regarding the drug to individuals and entities to which drug ownership is transferred, label drug with a drug identifier, and keep certain records regarding the drug. The transfer of information to subsequent drug owners by manufacturers will eventually be required to be done electronically. Manufacturers will also be required to verify that purchasers of the manufacturers drugs are appropriately licensed. Further, under this new legislation, manufacturers will have drug investigation, quarantine, disposition, and notification responsibilities related to counterfeit, diverted, stolen, and intentionally adulterated drugs, as well as drugs that are the subject of fraudulent transactions or which are otherwise unfit for distribution such that they would be reasonably likely to result in serious health consequences or death.
 
Coverage and reimbursement
 
Sales of our drug candidates, once approved, will depend, in part, on the extent to which the costs of our drugs will be covered by third-party payors, such as government health programs, private health insurers and managed care organizations. Third-party payors generally decide which drugs they will cover and establish certain reimbursement levels for such drugs. In particular, in the U.S., private health insurers and other third-party payors often provide reimbursement for drugs and services based on the level at which the government (through the Medicare or Medicaid programs) provides reimbursement for such treatments. Patients who are prescribed treatments for their conditions and providers performing the prescribed services generally rely on third-party payors to reimburse all or part of the associated healthcare costs. Patients are unlikely to use our drugs unless coverage is provided and reimbursement is adequate to cover a significant portion of the cost of our drugs. Sales of our drug candidate, and any future drug candidates, will therefore depend substantially on the extent to which the costs of our drug candidate, and any future drug candidates, will be paid by third-party payors. Additionally, the market for our drug candidate, and any future drug candidates, will depend significantly on type access to third-party payors formularies, prior authorization, step therapy, or other limitations such as approved lists of treatments for which third-party payors provide coverage and reimbursement. Additionally, coverage and reimbursement for therapeutic drugs can differ significantly from payor to payor. One third-party payors decision to cover a particular drug or service does not ensure that other payors will also provide coverage for the drug or service, or will provide coverage at an adequate reimbursement rate. As a result, the coverage determination process will require us to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of our drugs to each payor separately and will be a time-consuming process.
 
Third-party payors are developing increasingly sophisticated methods of controlling healthcare costs and increasingly challenging the prices charged for drugs and services. If these third-party payors do not consider our drugs to be cost-effective compared to other therapies, they may not cover our drugs once approved as a benefit under their plans or, if they do, the level of reimbursement may not be sufficient to allow us to sell our drugs on a profitable basis. Decreases in third-party reimbursement for our drugs once approved or a decision by a third-party payor to not cover our drugs could reduce or eliminate utilization of our drugs and have an adverse effect on our sales, results of operations and financial condition. Additionally, the containment of healthcare costs has become a priority of federal and state governments and the prices of drugs have been a focus in this effort. The U.S. government, state legislatures and foreign governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls and transparency requirements, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic drugs. Adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could limit our net revenue and results. In addition, state and federal healthcare reform measures have been and will be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for drugs and services, which could result in reduced demand for our drugs once approved or additional pricing pressures.
 
Additional regulation
 
In addition to the foregoing, state and federal laws regarding environmental protection and hazardous substances, including the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act and the Toxic Substances Control Act, affect our business. These and other laws govern the use, handling and disposal of various biologic, chemical and radioactive substances used in, and wastes generated by, operations. If our operations result in contamination of the environment or expose individuals to hazardous substances, we could be liable for damages and governmental fines. Equivalent laws have been adopted in third countries that impose similar obligations.
 
U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act
 
The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, prohibits U.S. corporations and individuals from engaging in certain activities to obtain or retain business abroad or to influence a person working in an official capacity. It is illegal to pay, offer to pay or authorize the payment of anything of value to any foreign government official, government staff member, political party or political candidate in an attempt to obtain or retain business or to otherwise influence a person working in an official capacity. The scope of the FCPA includes interactions with certain healthcare professionals in many countries. Equivalent laws have been adopted in other foreign countries that impose similar obligations.
