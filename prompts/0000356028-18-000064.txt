Item 1. Business.
Overview
CA Technologies is a global leader in software solutions that simplify complex enterprise environments. Our solutions enable customers to plan, develop, automate, manage and secure applications across mobile, cloud, distributed and mainframe platforms. Many of the largest companies in the world, including most of the Fortune 500 and many government agencies, rely on CA software to help manage and secure their hybrid cloud environments.
Our mission is to eliminate the barriers between ideas and business outcomes. To achieve this, we have built a portfolio of solutions that enable customers to leverage the benefits of agility, automation, insights and security in managing business processes and technology investments. Customers are transforming their businesses to better manage the market demands for speed, exceptional customer experience and rich analytics. We believe this journey, broadly referred to as digital transformation, is fueled by software.
Operating Segments
In fiscal 2018, our business was organized in three distinct but highly complementary operating segments: Enterprise Solutions, Mainframe Solutions and Services. These also represented the operating segments used by our Chief Executive Officer for evaluating our performance and allocating resources.

• | Our Enterprise Solutions segment includes a broad range of software planning, development, and management tools. More specifically, our solutions help customers with secure application development, infrastructure management, automation, and identity-centric security solutions. These products are designed for mobile, cloud, and distributed computing environments and run on industry standard servers.


• | Our Mainframe Solutions segment includes solutions for the IBM z Systems® platform, which runs many of our largest customers’ mission critical business applications. Our Mainframe Solutions help customers improve economics by increasing throughput and lowering cost per transaction, increasing business agility through DevOps tooling and processes, increasing reliability and availability of operations through machine intelligence and automation solutions, and protecting enterprise data with security and compliance.


• | Our Services segment helps customers reach their information technology (“IT”) and business goals primarily by enabling the rapid implementation and adoption of our software solutions. Our Services team consists of experienced professionals who provide a variety of services, such as consulting, implementation, application management services, education and support services, to both commercial and government customers. With approximately 900 certified consultants, architects, project managers and advisors located in 31 countries and an extensive partner ecosystem, CA Services works with customers to navigate complex business and technology challenges.

Our segments strengthen each other in several ways. Our customers benefit from the ability of CA solutions to span their entire infrastructure stack, across mobile, cloud, distributed, and mainframe. This is critical as customers focus on their end users’ experiences on their apps and the underlying transactions that traverse their heterogeneous environments. CA is one of the few companies positioned to deliver solutions that span mobile, cloud, open systems and mainframe environments. This hybrid cloud capability helps customers remove the barriers between ideas and business outcomes. We are able to bidirectionally leverage our core strengths and development efforts in our products within the Enterprise Solutions segment to bring new innovations to the Mainframe Solutions segment and vice versa. Our strong market position enables our investment in development, innovation and support of the mainframe platform to be among the largest in the industry, which sustains ongoing customer commitment to our Mainframe Solutions. We leverage our core strengths and development efforts across platforms, allowing customers to apply automation that improves quality and efficiency while enabling flexibility to optimize their technology assets. Our solutions help customers bridge their historical investments to the frameworks and architectures they are building for the future. Our Services segment leverages our expertise across our Mainframe Solutions and Enterprise Solutions segments and helps customers deploy and maintain our solutions. Refer to Note 16, “Segment and Geographic Information,” in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for financial data pertaining to our segment and geographic operations.
Focus of Our Business
The focus of our business is aligned around three strategic pillars: Agile, DevOps and Security, each of which contain portfolios of solutions spanning the continuum of platforms, from mobile to mainframe.
4

Agile
Our Agile portfolio defines how work is planned, executed and serviced to deliver rapid value to our customers, and enables customers to plan, deliver, manage and optimize application development and project management. Our capabilities within Agile include:

• | Agile Planning helps customers transform their development practices from traditional to modern agile methodologies. Agile development utilizes an iterative work cadence with a feedback loop that decreases time-to-market, increases product quality and, most importantly, maintains a focus on generating rapid business value. CA’s cloud-based solutions in this space help customers to collaboratively plan, prioritize and track agile software development at scale.


• | Project & Portfolio Management, which is highly complementary to Agile Planning, enables customers to collect, prioritize, plan and deliver products, services and customer experiences. CA’s solutions improve decision making processes and resource optimizations, and decrease project execution risk.

DevOps
Our DevOps portfolio accelerates software delivery and enables customers to more efficiently deliver and manage applications and infrastructure. The portfolio empowers developers with a rich set of tools that help simplify, automate, and make their processes and applications more robust. They enable better experiences for developers and for the end users of their higher quality applications. Our DevOps portfolio strategy is platform agnostic, providing customers the flexibility to optimize workloads across mobile, cloud, on-premise, and mainframe environments. Our capabilities within DevOps include:

• | Continuous Delivery optimizes the application development processes by automating the deployment of applications across all stages of their lifecycles. Continuous delivery is key to transforming the technical aspects of software delivery. Our solutions enable the development, testing and release teams to work concurrently and continuously to remove the excess overhead and delays that come with traditional software development.


• | Automation solutions help customers transform business processes. They automate, orchestrate and accelerate the entire application delivery process. Our unified platform provides end-to-end automation capabilities that cover service orchestration, workload automation and release automation capabilities.


• | Agile Operations helps customers correlate end-user, application and infrastructure data from cloud-hosted containers to mainframes. Our solutions help customers see application dependencies and provide intelligent analytics, comprehensive coverage, and an open, extensible architecture that improves end-user experience.


• | API (Application Programming Interface) Management facilitates the creation, security and management of APIs through their lifecycle, enabling customers to connect more directly with end-users via mobile apps, cloud platforms and “Internet of Things” devices.

Security
Our Security portfolio provides customers, employees and partners seamless access to the right data, regardless of the underlying platform. Our Security portfolio is designed to minimize the risk of data breaches and alleviate the increased pressures faced by chief information security officers. Our capabilities within Security include:

• | Application Security offers a holistic and scalable way to manage security risk across an application lifecycle. Through our acquisition of Veracode, we provide a wide range of security testing and threat mitigation techniques. Our solution is hosted on a unified application security testing platform and integrates into existing development toolchains. This enables users to quickly identify and remediate security flaws earlier in the development process and supports the development of high-quality, secure code.


• | Identity & Access Management provides enterprise-grade identity management and governance capabilities, including broad provisioning support for on-premises and cloud-based applications, extensibility and flexibility to integrate with other IT systems and consumer-grade scale.


• | Privileged Access Management enables organizations to control and monitor the access and activity of privileged users, or users with elevated access or administrator rights. Our solutions help detect and prevent the threat of internal and external attacks leveraging both network and host-based controls for the enterprise and hybrid cloud.


• | Payment Security is a software as a service (“SaaS”)-based payment authentication service to help banks protect against fraud and ensure a hassle-free online shopping experience for their customers.

Figure 1 - Portfolio and Platform Overview
Business Strategy
Our goal is to be the world’s leading independent enterprise software provider that helps organizations and enterprises plan, develop, manage, and secure modern software environments, across mainframe, distributed, cloud and mobile platforms. To accomplish this, key elements of our strategy include:

• | Drive organic innovation. Our product development strategy is built around key growth areas, where we are focused on innovating and delivering differentiated products and solutions across both distributed and mainframe platforms. We are focused on developing solutions that are easy to use, easy to implement and have a low total cost of ownership. A key element of our organic innovation approach is the broad adoption of the Agile methodology to govern our software development process, which we believe improves our product development time-to-market, quality and relevance, and supports our customer success initiatives.


• | Incubate technology for next generation products. We are researching and dedicating resources to the development of emerging technologies that are logical extensions of our core areas of focus. We are working on opportunities in areas such as containers, data analytics, big data, artificial intelligence, machine learning and open source, some of which may enhance or extend our current product portfolio and others of which may evolve into new product categories.


• | Pursue new business models and expanded routes to market. While our traditional on-premise software delivery remains relevant to many enterprise customers, we see cloud-based and try-and-buy models as attractive to both our existing and potential customers. These models simplify decision-making and accelerate the value customers can derive from new solution investments. New delivery models allow us to extend our market reach, speed adoption of our solutions, improve our efficiencies and compete more effectively for a larger number of customers globally. As such, our new product development is focused on our customers’ need for solutions that are simple and cost-effective to buy, install, deploy, manage and secure.


• | Expand relationships with our global customer base and address opportunities with new and underserved customers. We are focused on maintaining and expanding the strong relationships with our established customer base, and will proactively target growth with other potential customers that we do not currently serve. In parallel, we seek to broaden our customer base to new buyers in geographic regions we have underserved. The emerging roles of chief information security officers and chief development officers impact who and where IT environment purchasing decisions are made within our customers. This shift aligns with the product portfolio decisions we are making across our solutions set to meet our customers’ accelerating need for speed and agility. We are refining our sales, services, marketing and customer success resources to reach beyond the customers’ chief information officer and IT department to serve these new customer roles and respond to changes in customer buying behaviors.

• | Execute strategic and disciplined technology acquisitions. We intend to supplement our organic innovation efforts with key technology acquisitions that are within or adjacent to our core areas of focus. We conduct a thorough acquisition process, which includes build vs. buy analysis and opportunity identification, detailed business case modeling, rigorous due diligence and extensive integration, to fully realize the value of our acquisitions. We also focus on organically developing nascent technologies from companies we have acquired to provide them with the necessary interoperability, resilience and security to operate at scale in the large, heterogeneous IT environments utilized by our customers.

Fiscal 2018 Developments and Highlights
The following are significant developments and highlights relating to our business during fiscal 2018:

• | In November 2017, we held our user conference, CA World ‘17. This event showcased the most extensive list of products in recent Company history, with more than 20 new offerings and enhancements designed to help customers leverage agile practices, intelligent automation, data insights and end-to-end security for better and faster business outcomes.


• | In February 2018, Jean M. Hobby was elected as a member of the Company’s Board of Directors.


• | In February 2018, Ethisphere Institute named CA Technologies one of the World’s Most Ethical Companies.


• | In fiscal 2018, CA Technologies was recognized as a leader in 20 industry analyst reports.

Organizational Update
Effective May 3, 2018, Adam Elster no longer serves as our President, Global Field Operations. Mr. Elster will remain employed through August 17, 2018 in order to be available to assist with an orderly transition. We have inserted interim leadership as an external search for Mr. Elster’s replacement is underway.
Seasonality
Some of our business results are seasonally weighted toward the second half of our fiscal year, including cash flow from operations and total bookings. However, these business results may not always follow this pattern during a fiscal year. Given the varying durations and dollar amounts of the contracts being renewed, year-over-year comparisons of total bookings and collections associated with these bookings, financial results are not always indicative of the overall total bookings trend.
Customers
We currently serve customers across most major industries worldwide, including banks, insurance companies, other financial services providers, government agencies, global IT service providers, telecommunication providers, transportation companies, manufacturers, technology companies, retailers, educational organizations and health care institutions. Our traditional customers generally consist of large enterprises that have computing environments from multiple vendors and are highly complex. As the emergence of cloud computing has democratized the technology landscape, we have increased our focus on addressing a broader customer set.
No single customer accounted for 10% or more of our total revenue for fiscal 2018, 2017 or 2016. Approximately 7% and 6% of our total revenue backlog at March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, is associated with multi-year contracts signed with the U.S. federal government and other U.S. state and local government agencies, which are generally subject to annual fiscal funding approval and/or renegotiation or termination at the discretion of the government.
Sales and Marketing
We offer our solutions through our direct and digital sales forces as well as indirectly through our partners. We remain focused on strengthening relationships and increasing penetration within our core customers and partners - approximately our top 2,000 accounts. We refer to this key group of customers as “Enterprise” accounts. We believe maintaining and expanding our relationships within our traditional customer base of large enterprises with multi-year agreements will continue to drive renewals and provide opportunities to increase account penetration to help drive revenue growth. We address our “Commercial” account opportunities through partners and our digital sales efforts. We believe this group of customers and potential customers represents an opportunity for us to leverage a cost-effective distribution network to sell to net new customers and increase our share of wallet at customers where we have lower levels of penetration.
We are working to accelerate the velocity of our sales transactions and are implementing initiatives to drive consistent improvement in sales execution. We are continuing to shift to a more solutions-driven sales approach, using real-time data and intelligence to drive on-going evolution of our go-to-market strategy towards the highest potential and highest-yielding opportunities. We continue to increase investment in our digital sales and marketing organization to drive additional new land and expand opportunities. This enables us to cost effectively scale our reach to a broader set of buyers.
7

Our sales organization operates globally, with groups serving the North America (“NA”), Europe, the Middle East and Africa (“EMEA”), Latin America (“LA”), and Asia Pacific and Japan (“APJ”) geographies. We operate through branches, subsidiaries and partners around the world. Approximately 37% and 36% of our revenue in fiscal 2018 and 2017, respectively, was from operations outside of the United States. At March 31, 2018 and 2017, we had approximately 2,800 and 3,000, respectively, of sales and sales support personnel.
Marketing has played a key role in the ongoing transformation of our Company. It has helped to reshape perceptions of CA and to build capability that enables us to better serve our customers’ digital transformation. The critical role we play in enabling companies to compete and service customers in a software-defined era is now better understood and is driving interest in our offerings. The concept of the “Modern Software Factory” is resonating with customers and helps to reinforce the value proposition of CA’s portfolio of solutions. Operationally, to accelerate the role marketing plays in creating demand, we have sharpened our talent, tools and processes to better reach new customers to drive a higher velocity of opportunity creation for sales via digital marketing. Our marketing and sales organizations utilize common systems and analytics to initiate and respond to market opportunities, optimize resources, maximize efficiency and drive awareness and consideration of our brand and portfolio capabilities across our broad base of customers and prospects.
Partners
Our partners represent a foundational component of our go-to-market strategy. Our objective is to leverage our solutions and our partners’ strengths to deliver exceptional customer experiences, create greater value for our customers, and drive profitable and sustainable growth for both us and our partners. At the core of our global partner strategy, we aim to align our products, routes to market, customer segments and our strategic partners. Our data-driven approach of aligning our global partner strategy with market opportunities, channel trends and dynamic changes in the industry enables us to match our offerings and investments to specific markets.
We jointly build business with our partners in all our geographic regions through five key routes to market:

• | Resellers derive revenue primarily from the resale of third-party products. We work with a number of key strategic national and regional reseller partners to expand our global reach.


• | Global Service Providers provide a platform for application infrastructure or cloud-based service offerings. We seek to establish long-term partnerships, usually via outsourcing arrangements, to support the development of innovative, differentiated service offerings.


• | Global System Integrators offer our software within their business practices, leveraging their process design, planning, and vertical expertise to provide holistic solutions and implementation services to our joint customers.


• | Managed Service Providers leverage our solutions to power their subscription-based IT services. We work together to deliver differentiated, high-value managed services.


• | Global Technology Partners (including Independent Software Vendors and Infrastructure and Public Cloud Vendors) offer an opportunity for joint solutions, innovative business models, and CA brand awareness.

Global Customer Success
The Global Customer Success (“GCS”) organization is made up of customer experience designers, customer advocates, technical support engineers, community managers and an advanced customer data analytics team that share a common goal to deliver a superior end-to-end customer experience that creates and sustains satisfaction and loyalty, and serves as a source of competitive advantage for CA.
The Customer Success team within GCS works with customers to understand their unique business challenges to help maximize the value of their investments in our solutions. The Customer Success team aligns with members from education, support, services, partners and development to drive customer adoption, facilitate product expansion and to provide maximum return in minimal time.
CA Support engineers within GCS work with customers during trials and after the sale to assist in migration and upgrades, resolve issues 24/7, create self-help knowledge documentation, and proactively mitigate risks to prevent issues before they occur. CA Support operates in 42 locations worldwide, providing assistance in 16 languages while consistently earning industry-leading customer satisfaction ratings.
Throughout the customer experience, customers are encouraged to join online communities to interact and engage with their peers, partners, and our CA experts. We have more than 61,000 community members in our 50 most active communities who network, ask and answer questions, and share knowledge about our solutions.
Research and Development
We have approximately 5,100 employees globally who design, develop, and support our software. We operate principal research and development centers across the United States, including California, Colorado, Illinois, Massachusetts, New York, Pennsylvania, and Texas. Internationally, we have principal centers in Austria, Canada, Czech Republic, India, and Israel.

In fiscal 2018, research and development continued to focus on developing solutions that are easy for customers to buy, install, use and maintain, and improving the quality and stability in our broadly deployed products which allows us to focus investment towards innovation initiatives.
We are advancing our Agile, DevOps and Security solutions while endeavoring to build a common technology stack across several of our product lines. We are making strides towards this shared component approach to make it easier, faster and more efficient for new solutions to be built.
We are also accelerating innovation with our CA Accelerator, which uses an incubator model to apply lean start-up best practices to grow new businesses. We are interested in areas of increasing importance to enterprises, such as big data, analytics, containerization, developer productivity, security and the “Internet of Things”. This model helps ensure we are making appropriate investments and building technology that customers value, using a small-batch, cost-efficient approach. We are also utilizing university partnerships to support and advance development.
Our research and development activities include a number of efforts to support our technical community in its pursuit of creating leading solutions for customers. We continue to use our Office of the Chief Technology Officer Research and Open Source and Open Standards initiatives to strengthen our relationships with research communities by working with academia, professional associations, industry standards bodies, customers and partners to explore novel products and emerging technologies. We also engage with universities to conduct product-focused research to create solutions for emerging opportunities.
We have charged to operations $642 million, $586 million, and $560 million in fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively, for product development and enhancements.
Our product offerings and go-to-market strategy continue to evolve to include solutions that may be delivered either on-premise or via SaaS or cloud platforms. We expect our product offerings to continue to become available to customers at more frequent intervals than our historical release cycles. Over the last few years, we have continued to leverage Agile development methodologies, which are characterized by a dynamic development process with more frequent revisions to a product release’s features and functions as the software is being developed. In addition, we have implemented a holistic product strategy and portfolio management process, which has improved transparency and efficiency across the portfolio through a quarterly cadence of business reviews.
Intellectual Property
Our products and technology are generally proprietary. We rely on U.S. and foreign intellectual property laws, including patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws, to protect our proprietary rights. However, the extent and duration of protection given to different types of intellectual property rights vary under different countries' legal systems. In some countries, full-scale intellectual property protection for our products and technology may be unavailable, and the laws of other jurisdictions may not protect our proprietary technology rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. We also maintain contractual restrictions in our agreements with customers, employees and others to protect our intellectual property rights. These restrictions generally bind our customers and employees to confidentiality regarding our intellectual property and limit our customers’ use of our software and prohibit certain disclosures to third parties.
We regularly license software and technology from third parties, including some competitors, and incorporate them into our own software products. We include third-party technology in our products in accordance with contractual relationships that specify our rights.
We believe that our patent portfolio differentiates our products and services from those of our competitors, enhances our ability to access third-party technology and helps protect our investment in research and development. We continue to enhance our internal patent program to increase our ability to capture patents, strengthen their quality and increase the pace at which we are able to move our innovations through the patent process. At March 31, 2018, our patent portfolio included more than 1,500 issued patents and more than 950 pending applications in the United States and abroad. The patents generally expire at various times over the next 20 years. Although the durations and geographic intellectual property protection coverage for our patents may vary, we believe our patent portfolio adequately protects our interests. Although we have a number of patents and pending applications that may be of value to various aspects of our products and technology, we are not aware of any single patent that is essential to us or to any of our reportable segments.
The source code for our products is protected both as trade secrets and as copyrighted works. Our customers do not generally have access to the source code for our products. Rather, on-premise customers typically access only the executable code for our products, and SaaS customers access only the functionality of our SaaS offerings. Under certain contingent circumstances, some of our customers are beneficiaries of a source code escrow arrangement that enables them to obtain a limited right to access our source code.
We continue to be engaged in efforts to more fully employ our intellectual property by strategically licensing and/or assigning selected assets within our portfolio. This effort is intended to better position us in the marketplace and allow us the flexibility to reinvest in improving our overall business.

Licensing and Engagements with Customers
For traditional, on-premise licensing, we typically license to customers either perpetually or on a subscription basis for a specified term. Our customers also purchase maintenance and support services that provide technical support and any general product enhancements released during the maintenance period.
Under a perpetual license, the customer has the right to use the licensed program for an indefinite period of time, typically upon payment of a one-time license fee. If the customer wants to receive maintenance, the customer is required to pay an additional annual maintenance fee.
Under a subscription license, the customer has the right to usage and maintenance of the licensed products during the term of the agreement. Under our licensing terms, customers can license our software products under multi-year licenses, with most customers choosing one to five-year terms, although some large customers may negotiate longer terms. Thereafter, the license generally renews for the same period of time on the same terms and conditions.
Within these license categories, our contracts provide customers with the right to use our products under a variety of models including, but not limited to:

• | A typical designated central processing unit (“CPU”) license, under which the customer may use the licensed product on a single, designated CPU.


• | A license based on millions of instructions per second (“MIPS”), which allows the customer to use the licensed product on one or more CPUs, limited by the aggregate MIPS rating of the CPUs covered by the license.


• | A user-based license, under which the customer may use the licensed product by or for the agreed number of licensed users.


• | A designated server license, under which the customer may use a certain distributed product on a single, designated server. The licensed products must be licensed for use with a specific operating system.

Customers can obtain licenses to our products through individual discrete purchases to meet their immediate needs or through the adoption of enterprise license agreements. Enterprise license agreements are comprehensive licenses that cover multiple products and also provide for maintenance and support.
For our mainframe solutions, the majority of our licenses provide customers with the right to use one or more of our products up to a specific license capacity, generally measured in MIPS. For these products, customers may acquire additional capacity during the term of a license by paying us an additional license fee and maintenance fee. For our enterprise solutions, our licenses may provide customers with the right to use one or more of our products limited to a number of servers, users or copies, among other things. Customers may license these products for additional servers, users or copies, etc., during the term of a license by paying us an additional license fee and maintenance fee.
Our services are typically delivered on a time-and-materials basis, but alternative pay arrangements, such as fixed fee or staff augmentations, could be offered as well.
SaaS is another delivery model we offer for certain products when a customer prefers to use our technology off-premises with little or no infrastructure required. Our SaaS offerings are typically licensed for a designated term using a subscription fee. Some of our SaaS business is transaction or usage-based. Our SaaS products, which are becoming a larger part of our Enterprise Solutions portfolio, typically have a shorter average duration and smaller initial contract values compared to the more traditional on-premise delivery model.
Competition
Our industry is extremely competitive and characterized by: continually changing customer needs, rapid technological change; frequent emergence of new companies and products; evolving industry standards, computing platforms, go-to-market approaches and business models.
Our competition can generally be categorized into the following groups:

• | A broad set of point product vendors in a number of our markets, many of which lack near-term profit expectations;


• | Larger, vertically integrated technology companies that can bundle software to generate other revenue capture tied to hardware, platform, and services offerings;


• | Continued expansion of cloud service provider offerings from Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform embedded with management and security capabilities; and


• | Increasing adoption of open source solutions that may substitute for commercial spend.

Among the companies with which we compete are: AppDynamics, Inc. (acquired by Cisco); Atlassian Corporation, Plc; BMC Software Inc.; BeyondTrust; Compuware Corporation; CyberArk Software, Ltd.; International Business Machines Corporation; Micro Focus; Microsoft Corporation; MuleSoft, Inc. (acquired by Salesforce.com, Inc. in May 2018); New Relic, Oracle Corporation; SailPoint, Inc.; ServiceNow, Inc.; SolarWinds, Inc.; Splunk, Inc.; and VMware, Inc.
10

We believe the combination of our breadth of portfolio of enterprise management tools, our platform and hardware independence, and our deep customer relationships set us apart from other established competitors in the market. Further, we believe we are differentiated from emerging point-product providers by our global reach, breadth and synergy of offerings, deep industry experience, and strong balance sheet.
Employees
We believe that innovation and invention are the by-products of an inclusive and diverse workplace. Diversity of perspective, experience and thought are key to driving creativity, innovation, and results. We are committed to providing equitable opportunities and giving employees avenues for success - both personally and professionally. We believe that workforce diversity is an important topic in the technology sector, and we are dedicated to moving the conversation on diversity forward.
We had approximately 11,300 and 11,800 employees at March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
