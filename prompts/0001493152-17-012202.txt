ITEM 1. BUSINESS
General
 
We were organized under the laws of the State of Oregon on July 27, 1992 as Sky Technologies, Inc. On August 1, 1994, our name was officially changed by a vote of a majority of our shareholders to REGI U.S., Inc.
 
On September 16, 2016, REGI entered into an asset purchase agreement (the “APA”) with Reg Technologies Inc. (“Reg Tech”), a British Columbia public company whose common stock was listed on TSX Venture Exchange to purchase all of the assets of Reg Tech, a company with a common director and CEO with REGI. An aggregate of 51,757,119 unregistered common shares of our company were issued as consideration for the asset purchase. The transaction was closed on February 17, 2017 upon TSX Venture Exchange approval.
 
Prior to the APA, REGI and Reg Tech had been engaged in the business of developing and commercially exploiting an improved axial vane type rotary engine known as the Rand Cam/Direct Charge Engine (the “RC/DC Engine”) with the marketing and intellectual rights in the U.S. held by REGI and the worldwide marketing and intellectual rights, other than in the U.S., held by Reg Tech. Upon closing the APA, REGI owns the worldwide rights to the technologies.

We will need to raise additional capital in the future beyond any amount currently on hand and which may become available as a result of debt and/or equity financing, including the exercise of options which are currently outstanding, in order to fully implement our intended plan of operations.
 
Business of the Company
 
Overview and History
 
We are engaged in the business of developing and building improved axial vane-type rotary devices for civilian, commercial and government applications. The Company owns the worldwide intellectual and marketing rights to the RadMax® technology. Our vision is to develop advanced devices that reduce carbon footprint, reduce device size, weight and parts count, and increase fuel and manufacturing efficiencies. We intend to develop and market these devices in cooperation with industry and government partners. We are focused on creating new, disruptive technologies that are more efficient, compact and cost-effective than those currently available.
 
On July 27th, 2016, REGI undertook a reorganization, naming its wholly owned subsidiary, RadMax Technologies, Inc. (“RadMax”) as its DBA for marketing and technology image.
 
From our headquarters in Spokane, WA, we are working with engineering consultants around North America to develop these devices. Our goal is to license RadMax technology and/or participate in joint ventures to manufacture RadMax products for specific applications. Examples of market segments that could benefit from our technology include (but are not limited to) transportation, aerospace, air conditioning and refrigeration, oil and gas production and distribution, power generation, marine, and military markets.
 
Based upon work performed on concept test stands and prototype models, we believe that the RadMax® technology holds significant potential in a number of applications ranging from improving the efficiency of air conditioning and natural gas distribution systems to transportation locomotion and power generation. In addition to its potential use as prime mover, the RadMax® technology design is being employed in the development of several types of compressors, pumps, and gas expanders.
 
To date, several prototypes of different RadMax® devices have been tested, Additional prototype development and testing is continuing. We believe that such work will continue until commercially feasible designs are completed. However, there is no assurance at this time that such commercially feasible designs will ever be perfected, or will become profitable. If a commercially feasible design is perfected, we expect to derive revenues from licensing the RadMax® technology. Howerver, there is no assurance at this time that revenues will ever be received from licensing the technology even if it does prove to be commercially feasible.
 
We believe that multi-markets exist for practical rotary devices which can be produced at competitive prices, and can provide a good combination of energy utilization efficiency, power density and flexibility.
 
Based on market potential, we believe RadMax® technology is well suited for application to both internal and external combustion engines, pumps, compressors and gas expanders. RadMax® technology can be scaled to most size requirements. This flexibility allows us to consider applications in many large industries and markets.

Products and Projects
 
RadMax® Engine
 
We believe that the RadMax® internal combustion engine can achieve improved fuel and mechanical efficiencies when compared to other types of internal combustion engines based on the inherit efficient design and thermodynamic characteristics of the engine. A higher expansion than compression ratio is possible with the RadMax® internal combustion engine resulting in better fuel efficiency.
 
Various prototype RadMax® engines for both compression-ignition (diesel) and spark-ignition (gasoline) configurations have been built ranging from 10 to over 300 horsepower. Characterized by high torque, compact size, and a high horsepower-to-weight ratio, RadMax® engines are well suited as a prime mover for various transportation, and power generation applications.
 
Long service life, low power-to-weight ratio, and increasing environmental concerns and regulations are prompting a second look at the viability of gas turbine engines for more mainstream applications. A gas turbine engine’s optimized combustion produces fewer total emissions than internal-combustion engines. However, their lower operating efficiencies and higher operating and capital costs are impediments to their increased use.
 
A RadMax® external combustion turbine engine incorporating RadMax®’s higher efficiency, positive displacement compressors and gas expanders, coupled with an optimized external combustor, can significantly improve fuel and energy extraction efficiency over existing gas turbine engines. Having true “any fuel” capability, the RadMax® turbine engine would be well suited for hybrid engine and power generation applications.
 
To bring RadMax® engines from concept to reality, a considerable number of expensive steps and milestones must be achieved before market acceptance. These steps included concepual drawings, prototype development, and testing for critical mechanical, fuel efficiency, and emissions performance. These steps are currently beyond our resource and expertise capabilities, and we are actively seeking co-development partners to move further engine development forward.
 
RadMax® Pump
 
The RadMax® positive-displacement pump is an extraordinarily energy efficient pump that pairs the high volume capacity of a positive-displacement pump with the simplicity and cost advantages of a centrifugal pump. Because of its efficient, high-volume output, the RadMax® pump is well suited for fire protection; water and flood control; irrigation; marine; water treatment; oil and gas industry down hole and subsea; industrial processes; heavy industry and construction; and portable pump applications.
 
The Company has actively pursued the development of the RadMax® pump for various applications with industry manufacturers. Commercialization requires tooling to significantly reduce the cost of the pump in a production environment. Further development of the RadMax® pump is currently on hold until additional end user interest is established.
 
RadMax® Compressor
 
The RadMax® positive-displacement compressor acts as both a positive-displacement and a centrifugal compressor, incorporating the advantages of each. Because of its unique design, a RadMax compressor is able to utilize the volumetric energy of a positive-displacement compressor and the kinetic energy of a centrifugal compressor to pressurize a gas. This results in an exceptionally energy efficient device.

Several RadMax® compressor prototype designs have been tested in the past for various automotive air conditioning and commercial applications. Because RadMax® technology allows for efficient higher compression ratios, a new compressor prototype is being designed and built for the next generation of low density refrigerants. Commercialization requires tooling to significantly reduce the cost of the compressor in a production environment. We are currently seeking a co-development partner to further the development of he compressor for specific applications.
 
RadMax® Rotary Gas Expander
 
The RadMax® gas expander is a positive-displacement device that is uniquely able to capture both kinetic and pressure-volume energy and convert it to rotational power in gas pressure differential applications. This power can then be used to drive other devices such as compressors and electrical generators. Additional efficiency can be gained by incorporating electric power generation directly into the gas expander.
 
The RadMax® gas expander is primarily being developed to replace less efficient devices such as air conditioning system free gas expansion valves and mechanical throttling valves which are not able to capture available pressure energy. The RadMax® gas expander is also used as the turbine component in the RadMax® turbine engine.
 
We are currently designing and building prototype devices targeted for the natural gas distribution and air conditioning industries which can significantly reduce electric power requirements. We will be actively soliciting co-development industry partners later this year to further develop and commercialize these products.

The asset purchase also resulted in our ownership of 26% of the issued and outstanding common shares of Minewest Silver and Gold Inc. (“Minewest”), a British Columbia company engaged in the business of acquisition and exploration of mineral properties. Minewest owns a 70% interest subject to a 10% Net Profits Interest in mining property in British Columbia. As at the date the asset purchase and the date of this report, Minewest is inactive due to lack of funding.
 
We have engaged the services of a Spokane, WA patent law firm to assist us manage our growing patent and trademark applications. In addition to our active patents, we are seeking re-assignment to the company of three inactive patents previously miss-assigned, filing two full new patents, multiple provisional patents and working on the basis for others as we ramp up our engineering development program.
 
The Company’s 375 diesel engine prototype has gone through extensive testing with mechanical and compression results proving the basis of our technology and gives us a high rate of confidence going forward.
 
We have completed the mechanical design of a demonstration gas expander. Currently we are part way through the assemblage and testing commenced in June 2017. This device will incorporate multiple new engineering designs, mechanisms and improvements resulting from our diesel engine testing program.
 
Our prototype low density refrigerant compressor has also finished mechanical design with preliminary technical drawings underway. We are awaiting completion of our Expander and funding before further prototype development.
 
Preliminary design work has been done on a 50 (+-) hp gas engine, however, engineering time and funding are needed before further development.
 
We have built and successfully tested a miniature fluid pump. Our goal was to test the time, effort and expense of building small scale prototypes in 3-D printed composites. From start of design to finished testing was less than one month.
 
Other devices are conceptually laid out, but additional engineering and funding are required to move forward.
 
An additional step up in our prototype development has been the addition of multiple 3-D composite printers, a Vertical C&C metal Milling machine, and access to a full metal machine shop owned by one of our engineers. Producing multiple prototype components as the same time has improved our build time and material component selections.
 
Our marketing and business development to date has received interest from aerospace companies, international refrigeration manufacturers, major natural gas distribution and utility companies, oil and natural gas service business and others eager to learn of our technology and business opportunities. To date, we have no signed agreements, although we are conducting ongoing discussions with them.
 
During the year ended April 30, 2017, we constructed our web site http://www.radmaxtech.com, focusing on our new business model and detailing our RadMax Technology and how it applies to multiple industrial demands for efficiency, size, weight, and performance output.
 
In order to finance the expanded research and development and increasing administrative support, the company has established a Senior Secured Convertible Loan Program. As at April 30, 2017 we have raised $781,635 and settled old debt of $741,941 at a loss of $13,244 with the issuance of the convertible loans. From April 30, 2017 to the date of the report we raised another $757,852 with the issuance of the convertible loans.

Competition and Alternative Technologies
 
We currently face and will continue to face competition in the future from established companies engaged in the business of developing, manufacturing and marketing related products to our RadMax technology devices. While not a highly competitive businesses in terms of numbers of competitors with comparable devices, the business of developing new technology and attempting to either license or produce them is nonetheless difficult because most existing producers are large, well financed companies which are very concerned about maintaining their market position. Such competitors are already well established in the market and have substantially greater resources than us. For these reasons we are more inclined to licenses our technology rather than be directly engaged in manufacturing. The development of our business and its ability to maintain its competitive and technical position will continue to depend upon our ability to attract and retain qualified scientific, engineering, and managerial personnel.
 
Our guiding marketing strategy is to develop RadMax® technology products for applications that are either looking for a solution, or where our product offers significant advantages over existing products. We do not wish to develop “me too” products that that will automatically face substantial acceptance and pricing pressure in the marketplace. This strategy implies that our co-development industry partners will most likely be new or smaller, less dominant players in a particular market looking for new products to strengthen their position, rather than a dominant market player.
 
The RadMax® internal combustion engine faces more competitive obstacles than the RadMax® pump, compressor, and gas expander due to both the size of the market and strength of competing companies, and consumer expectations for reliability, performance, regulation compliance, and low cost. This infers that the technical and economic advantages threshold for RadMax® engines is high and must be met for the engine technology to be successful in the market place.
 
Except for the Wankel rotary engine built by Mazda of Japan, no competitor, that we are aware of, presently produces in a commercial quantity any rotary engine similar to the engines we are developing. The Wankel rotary engine is similar only in that it is a rotary engine rather than a reciprocating piston engine. Even though RadMax® internal engines may be more fuel efficient, smaller, quieter, and cost less to produce than existing engines, without substantially greater financial resources than is currently available to us. It is very possible that we may not be able to adequately compete in the engine business.
 
We also believe that strong competition can be expected in the engine market with new patents being taken out by competitors on a continuous basis, and that we may have a time advantage over some of the products in niche markets we may enter. However, there is no way to accurately determine or predict whether this situation is or will continue to be true.
 
To a somewhat lesser extent, similar competition also exists in the pump, compressor, and gas expander markets which may utilize RadMax® technology in their products. Like engine manufacturers, many of these companies have substantially greater resources for research, development and manufacturing than us. It is possible that our competitors may succeed in developing technologies and products that are more effective or commercially acceptable. However, we believe there are potentially more opportunities in these markets for RadMax®’s technical and efficiency advantages to provide unique and superior solutions for specific applications.

Technology development is taking place on many fronts and competitors may have, unknown to us, a product or products under development which may be technologically superior to ours which may be more acceptable to the market.
 
Environmental Matters
 
Laws and regulations relating to protection of the environment have not had a material impact on our business.
 
Availability of Raw Materials
 
Since we are not in production and there are no plans at this time for us to enter the actual manufacturing business, raw materials are not of present concern. At this time, however, there does not appear to be any foreseeable problem with obtaining any materials or components, which may be required in the manufacture of its potential products.
Marketing Strategy
 
We intend to pursue the development of our RadMax® Technology by entering into licensing and/or joint venture arrangements with other larger companies, which have the financial resources to maximize the potential of the technology. We have no current plans to become actively involved in either manufacturing or marketing any device which may ultimately develop to the point of becoming a commercial product.
 
Our current objective is to complete and test the RadMax® Expander and Compressor. Based on successful testing, the prototypes will be used for presentation purposes to potential license and joint venture partners.
 
Based on successful testing of the RadMax® prototypes, we expect to have joint venture or license agreements finalized, which would result in royalties to us. However, there is no assurance that the tests will be successful or that we will ever receive any such royalties.
 
Dependence on Certain Commercial Agreements
 
We do not have any material agreements upon which we are dependent.
 
Royalty Payments
 
No royalties have been awarded in relationship to our currently active patents.
 
Research and Development
 
We contract with individuals to perform the research and development work.
 
Employees
 
During the year ended April 30, 2017 we did not have any employees; engineering and administrative functions were performed by contractors.
