Our products are also used by surgeons and radiation oncologists to perform stereotactic radiosurgery. Our software products are also used in medical oncology departments to manage chemotherapy treatments. Our software products help improve physician engagement and clinical knowledge-sharing, patient care management and clinical practice management. Our worldwide customers include university research and community hospitals, private and government institutions, healthcare agencies, physicians’ offices, medical oncology practices, radiotherapy centers and cancer care clinics.
Proton Solutions 
Our Proton Solutions business develops, designs, manufactures, sells and services products and systems for delivering proton therapy, another form of external beam therapy using proton beams, for the treatment of cancer. Although proton therapy has been in clinical use for more than four decades, it has not been widely deployed due to high capital cost. Our current focus is bringing our expertise in X-ray beam radiation therapy to proton therapy to improve its clinical utility and to reduce its cost of treatment per patient, so that it is more widely accepted and deployed.
Radiation Therapy and the Cancer Care Market
Radiotherapy is the use of certain types of focused energy to kill cancer cells, shrink tumors, and provide palliative treatment for symptoms such as pain. Occasionally, radiation can also be used to treat non-cancerous conditions such as arterio- venous malformations, keloids, or trigeminal neuralgia. Radiotherapy is commonly used either alone or in combination with surgery, chemotherapy or targeted drugs. One important advantage is that radiation has its greatest effect on replicating cells. Simply stated, radiation damages cellular genetic material (chromosomes), which interrupts cell replication and results in eventual cellular death. Since the need for replication is particularly critical to the survival of a cancer and since normal tissues are better able to repair such damage, radiation tends to disproportionately kill cancer cells. The clinical goal in radiation oncology is to deliver the highest possible radiation dose directly to the tumor to kill the cancerous cells while minimizing radiation exposure to surrounding healthy tissue in order to limit or avoid complications, side effects and secondary effects caused by the treatment. This goal has been the driving force in clinical care advancements in radiation oncology over the past two decades, from conventional radiotherapy to advanced forms of treatment such as IMRT, IGRT, VMAT, SRS, SBRT and proton therapy. With the advent of radiosurgery and stereotactic body radiotherapy, other mechanism of killing cells are also being explored, including how radiation may stimulate the immune response to fight cancer growth. 
The process for delivering radiotherapy typically consists of examining the patient, planning the treatment, simulating and verifying the treatment plan, providing quality assurance for the equipment and software, carefully positioning the patient, delivering the treatment, verifying that the treatment was delivered correctly and recording the history and results of the treatment. The team responsible for delivering the radiotherapy treatment generally is comprised of a physician specializing in radiation oncology, a medical physicist or dosimetrist for planning patient treatments, a medical physicist for conducting appropriate quality assurance procedures and a radiation therapist for positioning the patients for treatment and operating the machines.

The most common form of radiation oncology involves delivering X-ray beams from outside of the patient’s body, a process sometimes referred to as external beam radiotherapy. A device called a medical linear accelerator generates the high-energy X-ray beams and delivers the radiation to the patient lying on a treatment couch. The linear accelerator rotates around a patient delivering the radiation beam that is conformed to the tumor shape from different angles. This concentrates radiation at the tumor while at the same time minimizing the dose delivered to the surrounding healthy tissue. Conventional radiotherapy typically involves multiple, or fractionated, treatments of a tumor in up to 50 treatment sessions. The linear accelerator may also deliver electron beams for the treatment of diseases closer to the body surface. 
IMRT is an advanced form of external beam radiotherapy in which the shape and intensity of the radiation beams are varied optimally (modulated) across the target region. IMRT allows the radiation dose to be more precisely conformed to the volume of the tumor, allowing physicians to deliver higher doses of radiation to the tumor than conventional radiation treatments, while limiting radiation dose to nearby healthy tissue. In this way, clinicians can design and administer an individualized treatment plan for each patient, targeting the tumor within millimeters. IMRT can be used to treat head and neck, breast, prostate, pancreatic, lung, liver, gynecological and central nervous system cancers. IMRT has become a well-accepted standard of treatment for cancer, and every year additional treatment centers, from university hospitals to local community clinics, adopt IMRT for their treatments. We are a leading global provider of products that enable IMRT for the treatment of cancer.
VMAT is a significant further advancement in IMRT that allows physicians to control three parameters simultaneously: (i) the rate at which the linear accelerator gantry rotates around the patient, (ii) the beam-shaping aperture and (iii) the rate at which the radiation dose is delivered to the patient. This creates a finely-shaped IMRT dose distribution that more closely matches the size and shape of the tumor, with faster treatment times. Our RapidArc® radiotherapy products plan and deliver VMAT treatments.
Physicians, hospitals and clinics place additional value on radiotherapy equipment and treatments, such as VMAT, that enable shorter treatment times and greater patient throughput. From the patient’s standpoint, reduced treatment times means that the patient is immobilized on the treatment couch for a shorter time period. Shorter treatment sessions decrease waiting times and, since treatments are delivered in fractions over the course of many days, can mean fewer disruptions to a patient’s daily routine. From the physicians’ and hospitals’ standpoint, shorter treatment times can lessen the chance of tumors moving during treatment and can increase patient throughput. Shorter treatment times and increased patient throughput can increase the number of treatments per day (which is a particular concern in countries with lower numbers of treatment machines per capita), and, as a result, can decrease the cost per treatment which in turn can mean greater access to advanced care for more patients.
IGRT is another advanced form of external beam radiotherapy complementing IMRT to enhance treatments. While IMRT helps physicians more precisely conform the beam to the tumor, IGRT allows physicians to see how a tumor and normal tissue move or change during a course of treatment, thereby improving treatment accuracy. This allows clinicians to tighten the margin of certainty around the tumor and spare more of the surrounding healthy tissue, potentially improving outcomes. We believe IGRT has become an accepted standard for treatment in the radiation oncology community. Varian's latest state-of-the-art linear accelerator mandates that all fractions of radiation delivered have IGRT before the treatment is delivered. 
SRS and SBRT, often collectively referred to as radiosurgery, are advanced ablative radiation treatment procedures performed in a small number of treatment sessions with high doses of radiation. Radiosurgery typically incorporates advanced image-guidance to focus many small beams of radiation from many orientations precisely on the target and to minimize the dose to surrounding normal tissues. Radiation oncologists, surgeons and other oncology specialists increasingly recognize radiosurgery as a useful tool to treat cancerous and non-cancerous lesions anywhere in the body.
An alternative to external beam radiotherapy, brachytherapy involves the insertion of radioactive seeds, wires or ribbons directly into a tumor or body cavity near the tumor. These techniques tend to irradiate much less surrounding healthy tissue so that physicians can prescribe a higher total dose of radiation, typically over a shorter period of time. Brachytherapy is often used for cancers of the head and neck, breast, uterus, cervix, soft tissue, skin and prostate.
Proton therapy is another form of external beam radiotherapy that uses proton particles beams generated with a cyclotron rather than X-ray beams from a linear accelerator. A proton beam’s signature energy distribution curve, known as the “Bragg peak,” allows for greater precision in targeting tumor cells with an even lower dose to nearby healthy tissue than may be delivered with X-ray beams from a linear accelerator. This makes proton therapy a preferred option for treating certain cancers, particularly cancers in children and tumors near critical structures such as the optic nerve. Pencil-beam scanning capability, which is an advanced way of delivering the proton beam, allows for greater sparing of healthy tissue compared to fan-beam scanning of the proton beam. Although proton therapy has been in clinical use for more than four decades, it has not been widely deployed due to its high capital cost and the market is still developing. We believe we can apply our experience in X-ray beam radiotherapy to proton therapy, reducing the cost of treatment per patient for existing clinical applications and expanding 
3

the use of proton therapy into a broader array of cancer types. We believe that proton therapy will over time become a more widely accepted method of treatment.
The radiation oncology market is growing globally due to a number of factors. According to the American Institute of Cancer Research, there will be an estimated 18 million cancer cases diagnosed globally. Worldwide, the number of new cancer cases diagnosed annually is projected to increase from approximately 14 million in 2012 to almost 25 million by 2030, with most of the increase coming from low- and middle-income countries such as China and India, according to the September 2015 Lancet Oncology report compiled by the Global Task Force on Radiotherapy for Cancer Control. In addition, technological advancements have helped to improve the precision and applicability of radiotherapy and radiosurgery, potentially expanding the use of radiotherapy and radiosurgery equipment to treat a broader range of cases. Technological advances in hardware and software are also creating a market for replacing an aging installed base of machines that are unable to deliver new, higher standards of care.
The rise in cancer cases, together with the increase in sophistication of new treatment protocols, have created demand for more automated products that can be integrated into clinically practical systems to make treatments more rapid and cost effective. Technology advances leading to improvements in patient care, the availability of more advanced, automated and efficient clinical tools in radiation therapy, the advent of more precise forms of radiotherapy treatment (such as IMRT, IGRT, VMAT, SRS, SBRT, brachytherapy and proton therapy), and innovative new technology and equipment (such as EDGE™ and TrueBeam™) that enable treatments that reduce treatment times and increase patient throughput should drive the demand for our radiation therapy products and services.
International markets, in particular, are under-equipped to address the growing cancer incidence. Patients in many foreign countries must frequently endure long waits for radiotherapy. According to a peer-reviewed publication in the International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology and Physics in 2014, radiotherapy is required in more than half of new cancer patients, particularly in low- and middle-income countries, and according to an article published in Seminars in Radiation Oncology in 2017, it is estimated that more than 12,000 additional treatment machines will be required by 2035 in these countries alone. For example, China, India and Brazil are estimated to require over 3,800, 1,200 and 400 additional machines, respectively, by 2035. The ever-increasing incidences of cancer and the demand for additional treatment machines in these regions represent additional drivers for our continued growth in international markets.

Medical linear accelerators are the core device for delivering conventional external beam radiotherapy, IMRT, IGRT, VMAT, SRS and SBRT, and we produce versions of these devices to suit various clinical requirements. In May 2017, we introduced our Halcyon™ treatment system, our newest device for cancer treatment. We received a CE mark for the Halcyon system in May 2017 and FDA 510(k) clearance in June 2017. The Halcyon system has been designed on a platform of next generation technology including a full field ring gantry design that rotates at four times per minute, an innovative stacked and staggered multi-leaf collimator design, virtually silent magnetic drive motors and solid-state modulators. This new platform is the smallest footprint linear accelerator in our portfolio, uses less energy, and has been designed with a human centered user experience concept that benefits the patient and the health care practitioner for simplicity of treatment and use. At the high end of our accelerator product line portfolio, the TrueBeam and EDGE systems for image-guided radiotherapy and radiosurgery are fully-integrated high-energy systems designed from the ground up to treat a moving target with higher speed and accuracy. The Clinac® iX linear accelerators deliver high-energy X-ray beams and are designed for more streamlined and advanced treatment processes, including IMRT and IGRT. We also produce the Trilogy™ linear accelerator, designed to be a versatile, cost-effective, precise high-energy device with a faster dose delivery rate and more precise isocenter compared to the Clinac iX. Our UNIQUE™ medical linear accelerator is a low-energy linear accelerator for the more price sensitive emerging markets, designed to meet the evolving needs of our IMRT and IGRT customers in these markets. 
Our Millennium™ series of multi-leaf collimators and High Definition 120 (“HD 120”) multi-leaf collimators are used with a linear accelerator to define the size, shape and intensity of the generated beams. PortalVision™, our electronic portal-imager, is used to verify a patient’s position while on the treatment couch, which is critical for accurate treatments and simplifies quality assurance of individual treatment plans. We also offer an innovative real-time patient position monitoring product, the RPM™ respiratory gating system, which allows the linear accelerator to be synchronized with patient breathing to help compensate for tumor motion during treatment. In addition, we manufacture the Calypso® system (some features not approved for use in all markets), which can continuously track and monitor the position of implanted or surface-attached Beacon® transponders. This technology allows the clinician to easily locate the position of the tumor and aim the treatment beam precisely to deliver the full, prescribed dose to the tumor, and minimize exposure of surrounding healthy tissues. 
We also offer the EDGE radiosurgery suite, a combination of products for performing advanced radiosurgery using new real-time tumor tracking technology and motion management capabilities. The EDGE radiosurgery suite includes the EDGE radiosurgery accelerator and the Calypso System with Dynamic Edge™ Gating, and the PerfectPitch™ Couch with six degrees of freedom to accurately and precisely align the patient position. Our IGRT accessories include the On-Board Imager® (“OBI”) hardware accessory affixed to the linear accelerator that allows dynamic, real-time imaging of tumors while the patient is on the treatment couch and offers cone-beam computerized tomography (“CBCT”) imaging software capability to allow patient positioning based on soft-tissue anatomy. Using sophisticated image analysis tools, the CBCT scan can be compared with a reference CT scan taken previously to determine how the treatment couch should be adjusted to fine-tune and verify the patient’s treatment setup and positioning prior to delivery of the radiation. To deliver the most advanced forms of IGRT, our accelerators would typically have an OBI, CBCT, PortalVision and other IGRT-related hardware and software as accessories. 
Our RapidArc radiotherapy products are a proprietary implementation of VMAT that coordinate beam shaping, dose rate and gantry speed to deliver a highly conformal dose distribution to the target tumor. RapidArc products enable the planning and delivery of image-guided IMRT in a single continuous rotation of up to 360 degrees rather than as a series of fixed fields. Our RapidArc products enable faster delivery of radiation treatment with the possibility of reduced opportunity for tumor movement during treatment, as well as greater patient throughput and lower cost per patient for the hospital or clinic. We believe RapidArc represents a significant advancement in IMRT cancer treatment.
Our HyperArcTM High-Definition Radiotherapy product is designed to simplify, automate and improve the quality of intracranial SRS, making SRS accessible to more clinics and patients around the world. HyperArc received a CE mark in August 2017 and FDA 510(k) clearance in September 2017 and is currently available for sale in the United States and other global markets where a CE mark is applicable. We expect that HyperArc will significantly improve the quality and efficiency of sophisticated SRS procedures. HyperArc is available only on the TrueBeam and Edge platforms.  
During fiscal year 2018, we further expanded our product offerings through business acquisitions. We purchased Mobius Medical Systems ("Mobius") in February 2018. Mobius markets and sells quality assurance products to radiation oncology departments around the globe. We will continue to sell those products while expanding and integrating the technology for current and future applications. In July 2018, we acquired humediQ GmbH, which markets and sells the IDENTIFY ™ products that enable patient and accessory verification, patient setup position, and motion monitoring for radiation oncology treatments. We will continue to market and sell these product as we expand the regulatory clearance footprint around the globe and enhance and integrate the technology for current and future applications.

Our software products enhance and enable the delivery of advanced radiotherapy treatments, from the initial treatment planning and plan quality assurance verification to the post-treatment recording of data and storing of patient information, as well as help improve physician engagement and clinical knowledge-sharing, patient care management and clinical practice management of cancer clinics, radiotherapy centers and oncology practices for better performance. Prior to any treatment, physicians must prescribe, or plan, the course of radiation delivery for the patient. We offer a range of treatment planning products that assist physicians in designing this treatment plan. Our Eclipse™ treatment planning system provides physicians with 3D image viewing, treatment simulation, radiation dosage calculation and verification and other tools for generating treatment delivery plans for the patient. The Eclipse software utilizes a sophisticated technique known as inverse planning to enable physicians to rapidly develop optimal treatment plans based on a desired radiation dose outcome to the tumor and surrounding tissue. Our RapidPlan™ Knowledge-based Planning tool creates a new category for artificial intelligence applied to treatment planning systems in which machine learned statistical models can be used to predict the achievable quality of an IMRT treatment from a patient’s anatomy. RapidPlan is designed to streamline the planning process by using shared clinical knowledge embedded in its statistical plan models. Clinics may use plan models included with Eclipse or can create models based on their own treatment methods and protocols. 
We continue to enhance our treatment planning software products and have integrated multi-criteria optimization radiotherapy treatment planning algorithms licensed from the Fraunhofer Institute that enable clinicians to quickly navigate solution space to find the ideal treatment plan for each patient. We have incorporated this technology along with other treatment planning software tools to enhance both treatment planning efficiency and quality. 
Our software product offerings also include Varian Treatment™, which connects ARIA® Oncology Information Management System (“ARIA”) to third party linear accelerators and expands our software support of third party manufacturers. The ARIA information system is a comprehensive real-time information management system and database that records and verifies radiotherapy treatments carried out on the linear accelerator, records and stores patient data relating to radiation therapy treatments (as well as chemotherapy treatment which may be also prescribed by a physician), performs patient charting and manages patient information and patient image data. This gives clinics and hospitals the ability to manage treatment and patient information across radiation oncology and medical oncology procedures. Also, because ARIA is an electronic medical record, it can enable users to operate filmless and paperless oncology departments and cancer clinics. ARIA is a (ONC-Health IT) 2015 Edition Health IT Module and supports the ICD-10 billing codes. Our FullScale™ oncology-specific information technology solutions take advantage of virtualization or cloud technologies to deploy our ARIA oncology information and Eclipse treatment planning systems in a way that enables treatment centers to take advantage of economies of scale. We have from time to time entered into agreements with a variety of companies to increase the capabilities of our ARIA Information Systems software. 
Our Insightive™ analytics software solution aggregates clinical and operational data and allows for improved decision making and practice management. Insightive enables oncology administrators and clinicians to use real-time information to discover patterns and trends through interactive dashboards and visualizations. We also created an interactive online group on the OncoPeer™ platform for clinicians to share knowledge-based cancer treatment models that can improve the efficiency and quality of cancer care across multiple institutions. The OncoPeer cloud community is a platform where oncologists, clinicians and other oncology professionals can publish knowledge, share data, exchange treatment techniques and discuss best practices within a professional oncology network. 
Our Velocity™ software provides solutions at the clinical process level to aggregate unstructured treatment and imaging data from diverse systems. It allows for a more comprehensive view of a patient’s diagnostic imaging and treatment history and helps clinicians make more informed treatment decisions. 
360 Oncology™ is a care management platform designed to integrate and coordinate key elements of cancer care, so patients and their cancer teams can collaborate on achieving the best outcomes. In a single platform, 360 Oncology brings together radiation, medical and surgical oncology, social services, primary care physicians, as well as the patient, to facilitate true collaborative and coordinated care. It enables tumor boards to more effectively coordinate patient care among the numerous specialists involved in cancer treatment. With Varian 360 Oncology care management, a clinic’s data, records and patient information are connected through a single platform, enabling the entire cancer-fighting team to coordinate care.
Qumulate™ is our cloud-based software technology that collects and analyzes machine performance data in a radiation therapy department and allows users to compare their machine performance data and trends against a community of users’ data.
In addition to offering our own suite of equipment and software products for planning and delivering radiotherapy treatments, we have partnered with selected leaders in certain segments of the radiation therapy and radiosurgery market. In October 2016, we established a three-year strategic agreement with McKesson to supply its US Oncology Network and Vantage Oncology 
6

affiliated sites of care with treatment delivery systems and planning, service and radiotherapy information system solutions. Under the agreement, we are collaborating with McKesson to establish interoperability between our Aria product and McKesson IT solutions which we anticipate will facilitate access to Aria, Eclipse and Velocity at its sites that do not currently utilize these solutions. We have a partnership agreement with Siemens AG (“Siemens”) through which, among other things, we represent Siemens diagnostic imaging products to radiation oncology clinics in the US and agreed upon countries, and Siemens, represents our equipment and software products for radiotherapy and radiosurgery to its healthcare customers in agreed upon countries. Furthermore, we and Siemens have developed interfaces to enable ARIA and Eclipse to connect with Siemens linear accelerators and imaging systems, and are exploring opportunities to co-develop new imaging and treatment solutions. We have equity investments which include Grail, Inc., a life sciences company developing blood tests for early-stage cancer detection and Fusion Pharmaceuticals Inc., a clinical stage company focused on developing targeted alpha-particle radiotherapeutics for the treatment of cancer. 
Our brachytherapy operations design, manufacture, sell and service advanced brachytherapy products, including VariSource™ HDR afterloaders and GammaMed™ HDR/PDR afterloaders, BrachyVision™ brachytherapy treatment planning system, applicators and accessories. Brachytherapy also develops and markets the VariSeed™ LDR prostate treatment planning system and the Vitesse™ software for real-time treatment planning for HDR prostate brachytherapy.
In October 2018, we introduced a new brachytherapy afterloader system, Bravos™. We received CE mark for Bravos in July 2018 and FDA 510(k) clearance in October 2018, and Bravos is currently available for shipment in 86 CE mark countries. Varian has filed for the Sealed Source Device registration required in the United States before shipment may ensue. Bravos is an integrated system designed to improve the patient and clinic experience by simplifying brachytherapy treatment and providing greater workflow efficiency. It is compatible with our full range of applicators and integrates with our Brachyvision for treatment planning. The ARIA oncology information system coordinates care from end to end, scheduling appointments, orchestrating the clinical workflow, delivering the plan to the afterloader, updating the patient's electronic record, and capturing clinical data for analytics.

Proton Solutions
Our Proton Solutions business develops, designs, manufactures, sells and services products and systems for delivering proton therapy, another form of external beam therapy using proton beams, for the treatment of cancer. Our ProBeam® system is capable of delivering precise intensity modulated proton therapy (“IMPT”) using pencil beam scanning technology. ProBeam Compact is our lower cost, single room proton therapy product launched in fiscal year 2014. During fiscal year 2016, we booked our first ProBeam Compact order. In October 2018, we introduced ProBeam 360°, our new single-room proton therapy system, with 30 percent smaller footprint and 25 percent lower vault construction costs as compared to ProBeam Compact. The new system has a 360-degree rotating gantry, iterative cone-beam CT imaging and high-definition pencil-beam scanning technology. The system can also provide a viable path to potential next generation treatments. Proton therapy is a preferred option for treating certain cancers, particularly tumors near critical structures such as the optic nerve and pediatric cancers. Although proton therapy has been in clinical use for more than four decades, it has not been widely deployed due to high capital cost. Proton therapy facilities are large-scale construction projects that are time consuming, involve significant customer investment and often complex project financing. Our proton therapy systems are currently in operation in ten sites worldwide.
During fiscal years 2018, 2017 and 2016, we recorded two, six and two proton therapy orders, respectively.
In limited cases, we participate, along with other investors and at market terms, in the financing of proton therapy centers. See Note 16, "Proton Solutions Loans and Investment" of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on our Proton Solutions financing arrangements.

Marketing and Sales
We employ a combination of direct sales forces and independent distributors or resellers for the marketing and sales of our products worldwide. Our gross orders and revenues reflect a growing percentage coming from international regions and particularly emerging markets. As a U.S.-based company, the competitiveness of our product pricing is influenced by the fluctuation of the U.S. Dollar against other currencies. A stronger U.S. Dollar against foreign currencies would make our 
7

product pricing more expensive and less competitive compared to products sold in non-U.S. Dollar currencies. A stronger U.S. Dollar against foreign currencies would also lower our international revenues and gross orders when measured in U.S. Dollars. These conditions affected our business and demand for our products in the first half of fiscal year 2016. In fiscal years 2018, 2017 and 2016, we did not have a single customer that represented 10% or more of our total revenues.
Oncology Systems 
Our Oncology Systems business sells direct in the United States and Canada and uses a combination of direct sales and independent distributors in international regions. 
Through our strategic global partnership with Siemens, we represent Siemens diagnostic imaging products to radiation oncology clinics in most global markets. Siemens represents our equipment and software products for radiotherapy and radiosurgery to its healthcare customers in agreed upon countries. We sell our Oncology Systems products primarily to university research and community hospitals, private and governmental institutions, healthcare agencies, physicians’ offices and cancer care clinics worldwide. These hospitals, institutes, agencies, physicians’ offices and clinics replace equipment and upgrade treatment capability as technology evolves. Sales cycles for our external beam radiotherapy products typically can be quite lengthy since many of them are considered capital equipment and are affected by budgeting cycles. Our customers frequently fix capital budgets one or more years in advance. In recent years, we have seen the purchasing cycle lengthen as a result of the more complex decision-making process associated with larger dollar value transactions for more sophisticated IGRT and surgical equipment, and other technical advances.
During an economic downturn, we would expect to see customers’ decision-making process further complicated and lengthened, which may cause hospitals, clinics and research institutions to more closely scrutinize and prioritize their capital spending in light of tightened capital budgets, tougher credit requirements, the general constriction in credit availability, and consolidation of providers. In addition, the last economic downturn caused customers to delay requested delivery dates, increasing the average order to revenue conversion cycle. Historically, this conversion cycle has been longer when new products are introduced or when we sell more products internationally. The lengthening of our order to revenue conversion cycle could reduce our revenues and margins. In addition, the same factors impacting the order to revenue conversion cycle may extend the receivables collection cycle and potentially increase bad debts.
Over the last few years, we have seen a greater percentage of Oncology Systems gross orders and revenues come from international markets, within which certain emerging markets often have lower gross margins and longer installation cycles since many of these purchases are for new sites where treatment vaults need to be constructed. We have also seen an increased portion of gross orders and revenues coming from services and software licenses, both of which have higher gross margin percentages than our hardware products. We have also been investing a higher portion of our Oncology Systems research and development expenses in software and software-related products. 
The radiation oncology market in North America is largely characterized by replacements of older machines, with periodic increases in demand driven by the introduction of new technologies. Reimbursement rates in the United States have generally supported a favorable return on investment for the purchase of new radiotherapy equipment and technologies. While we believe that improved product functionality, greater cost-effectiveness and prospects for better clinical outcomes with new capabilities such as IMRT, IGRT and VMAT tend to drive demand for radiotherapy products, large changes in reimbursement rates or reimbursement structure can affect customer demand and cause market shifts. We believe that growth of the radiation oncology market in the United States could be impacted as customers’ decision-making processes are complicated by the uncertainties surrounding the medical device excise tax, as defined below under "Medicare and Medicaid Reimbursement," and reimbursement rates for radiotherapy and radiosurgery, and that this uncertainty will likely continue in future fiscal years. We believe this uncertainty could impact transaction size, timing and purchasing processes, and also contribute to increased quarterly business variability.

Proton Solutions
Our Proton Solutions business primarily uses direct sales specialists who collaborate with our Oncology Systems sales group globally on customer projects. Potential customers are government-sponsored hospitals and research institutions and research universities, which typically purchase products through public tenders, as well as private hospitals, clinics and private developers. While this market is still developing and can be highly variable, there has been significant growth in this market over the last several years and we believe that growth in this business will continue in the major metropolitan areas in the 
8

United States and abroad, driven by institutions that wish to expand their clinical offerings and increase their profile in their respective communities. We are investing substantial resources to grow this business. Proton therapy facilities are large-scale construction projects that are time consuming and involve significant customer investment and often complex project financing. Consequently, this business is vulnerable to general economic and market conditions, as well as reimbursement rates. Customer decision-making cycles tend to be very long, and orders generally involve many contingencies. While credit markets have improved in recent years, the funding environment for large capital projects, such as proton therapy projects, remains constrained. 
Backlog
Backlog is the accumulation of all gross orders for which revenues have not been recognized but are still considered valid. Backlog is stated at historical foreign currency exchange rates and revenue is released from backlog at current exchange rates, with any difference recorded as a backlog adjustment. Orders may be revised or canceled, as customers’ needs change and as our new products become available; consequently, it is difficult to predict with certainty the amount and timing of when backlog will result in revenues. Our backlog at the end of fiscal year 2018 was $3.2 billion, of which we expect to recognize approximately 45% as revenues in fiscal year 2019. Our backlog at the end of fiscal year 2017, was $3.1 billion, of which approximately $1.5 billion was recognized as revenues in fiscal year 2018. Our Oncology Systems backlog represented 93% and 90% of the total backlog at the end of fiscal years 2018 and 2017, respectively.
Gross orders are defined as new orders recorded during the period and revisions to previously recorded orders. New orders are recorded for the total contractual amount, excluding certain pass-through items and service items which are recognized as the revenue is recognized, once a written agreement for the delivery of goods or provision of services is in place and, other than Proton Solutions, when shipment of the product is expected to occur within two years, so long as any contingencies are deemed perfunctory. For our Proton Solutions business, we record orders when construction of the related proton therapy treatment center is reasonably expected to start within two years, but only if any contingencies are deemed perfunctory. We will not record Proton Solutions orders if there are major financing contingencies, if a substantial portion of the financing for the project is not reasonably assured or if customer board approval contingencies are pending. We perform a quarterly review to verify that outstanding orders remain valid. Aged orders that are not expected to ultimately convert to revenues are deemed dormant and are reflected as a reduction in the backlog amounts in the period identified. If an order is no longer expected to be converted to revenue, we record a backlog adjustment which reduces backlog but does not impact gross orders for the period. 
Backlog adjustments are comprised of dormancies, cancellations, foreign currency exchange rate adjustments, backlog acquired from our acquisitions, and other adjustments. Gross orders do not include backlog adjustments. In fiscal years 2018, 2017 and 2016, our backlog adjustments were a reduction of $152.8 million, $154.5 million and $189.8 million, respectively.
Competition
The markets for cancer treatment are characterized by rapidly evolving technology, intense competition and pricing pressure. We compete with companies worldwide, some of whom may have greater financial, marketing and other resources. Large amounts of resources are being invested in the research and development of new therapies for cancer. The successful development of alternative therapies for cancer, for example, immunotherapy, increased efficacy of new therapies or existing products, pricing decisions by competitors and the rate of market penetration by competitive products may render our products obsolete or noncompetitive. 
Our smaller competitors could be acquired by companies with greater financial strength, which could enable them to compete more aggressively. Some of our suppliers or distributors could also be acquired by competitors, which could disrupt these supply or distribution arrangements and result in less predictable and reduced revenues. New competitors and new technologies, such as radiosurgery, VMAT, MR-Linac and proton therapy, will compete directly with our products or will compete for customer budget allocation. We have directed substantial product development efforts into (i) increasing the interconnectivity of our products for more seamless operation within a system, (ii) enhancing the ease of use of our software products and (iii) reducing setup and treatment times and increasing patient throughput. We have also maintained an “open systems” approach that allows customers to “mix and match” our various individual products, incorporate products from other manufacturers, share information with other systems or products and use the equipment for offering various methods of radiation therapy treatment. We have done this based on our belief that such interconnectivity will increase the acceptance and adoption of IMRT, IGRT and VMAT and will stimulate demand for our products. There are competitive “closed-ended” dedicated-use systems, however, that place simplicity of use ahead of flexibility. If we have misjudged the importance to our customers of maintaining an “open systems” approach, or if we are unsuccessful in our efforts to sustain interconnectivity, enhance ease-of-use and reduce setup and treatment times, our revenues could suffer.

Our Oncology Systems customers’ equipment purchase considerations typically include: reliability, servicing, patient throughput, precision, price, payment terms, connectivity, clinical features, the ability to track patient referral patterns, long-term relationship and capabilities of customers’ existing equipment. We believe we compete favorably with our competitors based upon our strategy of providing a complete package solution of products and services in the field of radiation oncology and our continued commitment to global distribution and customer services, value-added manufacturing, technological leadership and new product innovation. To compete successfully, we must provide technically superior, clinically proven products that deliver more precise, cost effective, high quality clinical outcomes, together in a complete package of products and services, and do so ahead of our competitors. Since our Oncology Systems products are generally sold on a basis of total value to the customer, our business may suffer when purchase decisions are based solely upon price, which can happen if hospitals and clinics give purchasing decision authority to group purchasing organizations. Further, competitors may delay customer purchasing decisions as customers evaluate competitive product offerings, potentially extending our sales cycle and adversely affecting our gross orders.
We are the leading provider of medical linear accelerators and related accessories. In radiotherapy and radiosurgery markets, we compete primarily with Elekta AB and Accuray Incorporated. Additionally, Elekta AB and ViewRay Incorporated have announced the introduction of MR-Linac devices that also compete with us for hospital budget allocations. Sun Nuclear Corporation and Standard Imaging have QA products that compete with our Mobius and Qumulate offerings. Vision RT, Brainlab and C-RAD have competing products with our humediQ product line in the areas of patient monitoring and tracking during therapy. With our information and image management, simulation, treatment planning and radiosurgery products, we also compete with a variety of companies, such as Philips Medical Systems, RaySearch Laboratories AB, Brainlab AG and Best Theratronics, Ltd. We also encounter some competition from providers of enterprise hospital information systems. With respect to our brachytherapy solutions, our competitors are Elekta AB, MIM Software Inc. and Eckert & Ziegler BEBIG GmbH. In our Oncology Systems service and maintenance business, we compete with independent service organizations and our customers’ internal service organizations.
In addition, as a radiotherapy and radiosurgery equipment provider, we also face competition from other cancer treatment alternatives, such as traditional surgery, chemotherapy, robotic surgery and drug therapies, among others. To compete successfully, we need to demonstrate and convince our customers and cancer patients of the advantages of radiation therapy over or in addition to other cancer treatment alternatives. This may involve funding and, in some instances, sponsoring clinical research and studies relating to the efficacy, comparative effectiveness and safety of radiation therapy as compared to such other alternative treatments.
In our 360 Oncology business for Oncology Systems segment, we compete with Elekta AB and large EMR companies such as EPIC and CERNER, as well as multiple new competing products from established companies such as Roche (Navify and Flatiron), Philips etc., and emerging competitors such as Carevive and Syapse. 
The market for proton therapy products is still developing and is characterized by rapidly evolving technology, high competition and pricing pressure. Our ability to compete successfully depends, in part, on our ability to lower our product costs, and develop and provide technically superior, clinically proven products that deliver more precise, cost-effective, high quality clinical outcomes, including integration of IGRT technologies such as integrated volumetric imaging. In the proton therapy market, we compete principally with Hitachi Heavy Industries, Ion Beam Applications S.A., and Mevion Medical Systems, Inc. There are a number of smaller competitors that are also developing proton therapy products. We are the only established company in the field of radiation therapy to enter the particle therapy market directly.
Customer Services and Support
We warrant most of our Oncology Systems products for parts and labor for 12 months, and we offer a variety of post-warranty equipment service contracts and software support contracts to suit customers’ requirements. Our domestic service centers are in Atlanta, Georgia; Las Vegas, Nevada; and Milpitas, California. Our international service centers are in Australia, Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, China, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Hungary, India, Italy, Japan, Malaysia, the Netherlands, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, South Korea, Spain, Switzerland, Thailand, United Arab Emirates, and the United Kingdom. We also have field service personnel throughout the world for Oncology Systems customer support services. Key Oncology Systems education operations are located in Beijing, China; Cham, Switzerland; Las Vegas, Nevada; Mumbai, India; and Tokyo, Japan; Montreal, Canada. Our network of service engineers and customer support specialists provide installation, warranty, repair, training and support services, project management, site planning, and professional services. We also have a distributed service parts network of regional hubs and forward-stocking locations across all major geographic areas. We generate service revenues by providing our customers with time-and-materials services, replacement part sales, post-warranty equipment service contracts and software support contracts. Most of the field service engineers are our employees, but our 
10

products are serviced by employees of distributors and/or agents in a few foreign countries. Customers can access our extensive service network by calling any of our service centers.
We believe customer service and support are an integral part of our Oncology Systems competitive strategy. Growth in our service revenues has resulted from the increasing customer adoption of service contracts as the sophistication and installed base of our products increase. We also believe superior service plays an important role in marketing and selling medical products and systems, particularly as the products become more complex. Nevertheless, some of our customers use their own internal biomedical engineering organizations and/or independent service organizations to service equipment after the warranty period expires and therefore do not enter into agreements with us for extended service.
In the Proton Solutions business, we sell our proton therapy equipment generally with a 12-month warranty. Upon transfer of a treatment room to a customer, we generally begin generating service revenues by providing on-site proton therapy system technical operation and maintenance support services, which typically are for relatively long-term periods (e.g., a five-year term or longer). We believe customer service and support are an integral part of our Proton Solutions competitive strategy.
Manufacturing and Supplies
We manufacture our medical linear accelerators in Palo Alto, California, and Beijing, China. We manufacture some of our accessory products in Crawley, United Kingdom; Baden, Switzerland; Helsinki, Finland; Toulouse, France; and Winnipeg, Canada. We manufacture our high dose rate brachytherapy systems in Haan, Germany and our brachytherapy treatment planning products in Charlottesville, Virginia. We manufacture IDENTIFY in Germany. We manufacture Calypso components in Seattle, Washington. We manufacture components and sub-systems for our proton therapy products and systems in Troisdorf, Germany. These facilities employ state-of-the-art manufacturing techniques, and several have been honored by the press, governments and trade organizations for their commitment to quality improvement. These manufacturing facilities are certified by International Standards Organization (“ISO”) under ISO 13485 (for medical devices).
Manufacturing processes at our various facilities include machining, fabrication, subassembly, system assembly and final testing. We have invested in various automated and semi-automated equipment for the fabrication and machining of the parts and assemblies that we incorporate into our products. We may, from time to time, invest further in such equipment. Our quality assurance program includes various quality control measures from inspection of raw materials, purchased parts and assemblies through online inspection. We outsource the manufacturing of many major subassemblies and perform system design, assembly and testing in house. We believe outsourcing enables us to reduce or maintain fixed costs and capital expenditures, while also providing us with the flexibility to increase production capacity. We purchase material and components from various suppliers that are either standard products or customized to our specifications. We obtain some of the components included in our products from a limited group of suppliers or from a single source supplier, such as: the radioactive sources for high dose afterloaders; klystrons for linear accelerators; and radiofrequency components, magnets, patient positioning systems and gantry hardware for proton therapy systems. We require certain raw materials such as tungsten, lead and copper for Oncology Systems; and high-grade steel, high-grade copper and iron for the Proton Solutions business. Worldwide demand, availability and pricing of these raw materials have been volatile, and we expect that availability and pricing will continue to fluctuate in the future.
Research and Development
Developing products, systems and services based on advanced technology is essential to our ability to compete effectively in the marketplace. We maintain a research and development and engineering staff responsible for product design and engineering. 
Within Oncology Systems, our development efforts focus on enhancing the reliability and performance of existing products and developing new products. This development is conducted primarily in the United States, Switzerland, Canada, England, Finland, Germany, India and China. In addition, we support research and development programs at selected hospitals and clinics. Current areas for development within Oncology Systems include linear accelerator systems and accessories for medical applications, information systems, radiation treatment planning software, image processing software, imaging devices, patient positioning and equipment diagnosis and maintenance tools. Development for our high-energy linear accelerators is focused on improvements in accelerator technology, size, and mobility to address the needs of our customers in the market. Within Oncology Systems, we also have an Applied Research group, which focuses on disruptive technologies and new capability incubation.
Within Proton Solutions, our development efforts focus on integrating patient set-up, motion management and clinical workflow solutions originally developed in Oncology Systems as well as reducing the size of our proton therapy system. We 
11

expect that, in order to realize the full potential of the Proton Solutions business, we will need to continue to invest substantial resources to continue to develop proton therapy technology.
Product and Other Liabilities
Our business exposes us to potential product liability claims that are inherent in the manufacture, sale, installation, servicing and support of medical devices and other devices that deliver radiation. Because our products are involved in the intentional delivery of radiation to the human body and other situations where people may come in contact with radiation, the collection and storage of patient treatment data for medical analysis and treatment delivery, the planning of radiation treatment and diagnostic imaging of the human body, and the diagnosis of medical problems, the possibility for significant injury and/or death exists. 
Our medical products operate within our customers’ facilities and network systems, and under quality assurance procedures established by the facilities that ultimately deliver radiation to patients. Human and other errors or accidents may arise from the operation of our products in complex environments, particularly with products from other vendors, where interoperability or data sharing protocol may not be optimized even though the equipment or system operates according to specifications. As a result, we may face substantial liability to patients, our customers and others for damages resulting from the faulty, or allegedly faulty, design, manufacture, installation, servicing, support, testing or interoperability of our products with other products, or their misuse or failure, as well as liability related to the loss or misuse of private patient data, including resulting from unauthorized intrusion into our products. We may also be subject to claims for property damages or economic loss related to or resulting from any errors or defects in our products, or the installation, servicing and support of our products. Any accident or mistreatment could subject us to legal costs, litigation, adverse publicity and damage to our reputation, whether or not our products or services were a factor. In addition, if a product we design or manufacture were defective (whether due to design, labeling or manufacturing defects, improper use of the product or other reasons), or found to be so by a competent regulatory authority, we may be required to correct or recall the product and notify other regulatory authorities. We maintain limited product liability insurance coverage and currently do not maintain professional liability/errors and omissions insurance.
Government Regulation
U.S. Regulations
Laws governing marketing a medical device. In the United States, our products and operations are subject to extensive regulation by federal governmental authorities, such as the FDA, Nuclear Regulatory Commission (“NRC”), and state and local regulatory agencies, such as the State of California, to ensure the devices are safe and effective and comply with laws governing products which emit, produce or control radiation. Similar international regulations apply overseas. These regulations, which include the U.S. Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (the “FDC Act”) and regulations promulgated by the FDA, govern, among other things, the design, development, testing, manufacturing, packaging, labeling, distribution, import/export, sale and marketing and disposal of medical devices, post market surveillance and reporting of serious injuries and death, repairs, replacements, recalls and other matters relating to medical devices, radiation emitting devices and devices utilizing radioactive by-product material. State regulations are extensive and vary from state to state. Our Oncology Systems equipment and software, as well as proton therapy systems offered by our Proton Solutions business, constitute medical devices subject to these regulations. Under the FDC Act, each medical device manufacturer must comply with quality system regulations that are strictly enforced by the FDA.
Unless an exception applies, the FDA requires that the manufacturer of a new medical device or a new indication for use of, or other significant change in, existing currently marketed medical device obtain either 510(k) pre-market notification clearance or pre-market approval (“PMA”) before it can market or sell those products in the United States. We do not manufacture any Class III medical devices, which require PMA. Certain of our products, like our radiation delivery systems manufactured by our Oncology Systems business and proton therapy systems manufactured by our Proton Solutions business, are Class II medical devices that require 510(k) clearance, while our other products are exempt from 510(k) clearance. Modifications or enhancements to a product that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, or that would constitute a major change in the intended use of the device, technology, materials, labeling, packaging, or manufacturing process may also require a new 510(k) clearance. Manufacturers make the initial determination whether a change to a cleared device requires a new 510(k) clearance, but the FDA can review any such decision. If the FDA disagrees with the manufacturer’s decision not to seek a new 510(k) clearance or PMA approval for a change, it may retroactively require the manufacturer to seek 510(k) clearance or PMA approval. The FDA can also require the manufacturer to cease marketing and selling the product in the United States and/or recall the product until 510(k) clearance or PMA approval is obtained. 
The FDA has issued draft guidance that, if finalized and implemented, will result in manufacturers needing to seek a significant number of new clearances for changes made to legally marketed devices. If we cannot establish that, as a result of proposed 
12

changes to a current product, the modified product is substantially equivalent to a legally marketed device, we must seek pre-market approval through a PMA application. Under the PMA process, the applicant submits extensive supporting data, including, in most cases, data from clinical studies, in the PMA application to establish reasonable evidence of the safety and effectiveness of the product. This process typically takes at least one to two years from the date the PMA is accepted for filing, but can take significantly longer for the FDA to review. 
Quality systems. Our manufacturing operations for medical devices, and those of our third-party suppliers, are required to comply with the FDA’s Quality System Regulation (“QSR”), as well as other federal and state regulations for medical devices and radiation emitting products. The QSR requires that each manufacturer establish a quality systems program by which the manufacturer monitors the manufacturing process and maintains records that show compliance with FDA regulations and the manufacturer’s written specifications and procedures relating to the devices. QSR compliance is necessary to receive and maintain FDA clearance or approval to market new and existing products. The FDA makes announced and unannounced periodic and on-going inspections of medical device manufacturers to determine compliance with the QSR. If in connection with these inspections, the FDA believes the manufacturer has failed to comply with applicable regulations and/or procedures, it may issue observations that would necessitate prompt corrective action. If FDA inspection observations are not addressed and/or corrective action taken in a timely manner and to the FDA’s satisfaction, the FDA may issue a Warning Letter (which would similarly necessitate prompt corrective action) and/or proceed directly to other forms of enforcement action. Failure to respond timely to FDA inspection observations, a Warning Letter or other notice of noncompliance and to promptly come into compliance could result in the FDA bringing enforcement action against us, which could include the total shutdown of our production facilities, denial of importation rights to the United States for products manufactured in overseas locations and denial of export rights for U.S. products and criminal and civil fines.
Regulations on Advertising and Promotions; Interactions with Healthcare Providers. The FDA and the Federal Trade Commission also regulate advertising and promotion of our products to ensure that the claims we make are consistent with our regulatory clearances, that there are adequate and reasonable scientific data to substantiate the claims and that our promotional labeling and advertising is neither false nor misleading. We may not promote or advertise our products for uses not within the scope of our intended use statement in our clearances or approvals or make unsupported safety and effectiveness claims.
Additionally, we are members of AdvaMed, a global trade association of companies that develop, produce, manufacture and market Medical Technologies.  Varian subscribes to the AdvaMed Code of Ethics on Interactions with U.S. Health Care Professionals.  The Advamed Code provides companies with guidance on ethical interactions and relationships with Health Care Professionals. Also, we are subject to the Physician Payments Sunshine Act which requires medical product manufacturers to disclose annually any payments or other transfers of value made to U.S. physicians or teaching hospitals.
Electrical Safety and Environmental Regulations. It is also important that our products comply with electrical safety and environmental standards, such as those of Underwriters Laboratories, the Canadian Standards Association, and the International Electrotechnical Commission. In addition, the manufacture and distribution of medical devices utilizing radioactive material requires a specific radioactive material license. For the United States, manufacture and distribution of these radioactive sources and devices also must be in accordance with a model specific certificate issued by either the NRC or by a state regulatory authority. In essentially every country and state, installation and service of these products must be in accordance with a specific radioactive materials license issued by the applicable radiation control agency. We are also subject to a variety of additional environmental laws regulating our manufacturing operations and the handling, storage, transport and disposal of hazardous materials, and which impose liability for the cleanup of any contamination from these materials. For a further discussion of these laws and regulations, see “Critical Accounting Estimates” in MD&A, and Note 10, "Commitments and Contingencies" of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.”
Data Privacy Laws. As a participant in the healthcare industry, we are subject to extensive laws and regulations protecting the privacy and integrity of patient medical information that we receive, including the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, “fraud and abuse” laws and regulations, including, physician self-referral prohibitions, and false claims laws. From time to time, these laws and regulations may be revised or interpreted in ways that could make it more difficult for our customers to conduct their businesses, such as recent proposed revisions to the laws prohibiting physician self-referrals, and such revisions could have an adverse effect on the demand for our products, and therefore our business and results of operations.
Federal and state governments also continue to adopt new, or modify existing laws and regulations addressing data privacy generally and the collection, processing, storage, transfer and use of personal data and we cannot predict what effect, if any, changes to these laws and regulations may have on our business.
13

Medicare and Medicaid Reimbursement
The federal and state governments of the United States establish guidelines and pay reimbursements to hospitals and free-standing clinics for diagnostic examinations and therapeutic procedures under Medicare at the federal level and Medicaid at the state level. Private insurers often establish payment levels and policies based on reimbursement rates and guidelines established by the government.
The federal government and the Congress review and adjust rates annually, and from time to time consider various Medicare and other healthcare reform proposals that could significantly affect both private and public reimbursement for healthcare services, including radiotherapy and radiosurgery, in hospitals and free-standing clinics. State government reimbursement for services is determined pursuant to each state’s Medicaid plan, which is established by state law and regulations, subject to requirements of federal law and regulations. In the past, we have seen our customers’ decision-making process complicated by the uncertainties surrounding reimbursement rates for radiotherapy and radiosurgery in the United States.
The provisions of the Affordable Care Act went into effect in 2012. Specifically, one of the components of the law is a 2.3% excise tax on sales of most medical devices, which include our Oncology Systems products, which started on January 1, 2013. In January 2018, President Trump signed into law a spending package that included a two-year moratorium on the medical device excise tax starting January 1, 2018 and ending December 31, 2019. This tax has had, and may continue to have, a negative impact on our gross margin when the moratorium expires. 
In April 2015, MACRA was signed into law, which made numerous changes to Medicare, Medicaid, and other healthcare related programs. These changes include new systems for establishing the annual updates to payment rates for physicians’ services in Medicare as well as certain electronic health record reporting requirements for providers. MACRA was effective beginning January 1, 2017. Our business may be significantly and negatively affected by MACRA and any changes in reimbursement policies and other legislative initiatives aimed at or having the effect of reducing healthcare costs associated with Medicare and other government healthcare programs.
Various healthcare reform proposals have also emerged at the state level, and we are unable to predict which, if any of these proposals will be enacted. We believe that the uncertainty created by healthcare reform in the United States has complicated our customers’ decision-making process and impacted our Oncology Systems and Proton Solutions businesses, and may continue to do so.
The sale of medical devices including radiotherapy products, the referral of patients for diagnostic examinations and treatments utilizing such devices, and the submission of claims to third-party payors (including Medicare and Medicaid) seeking reimbursement for such services, are subject to various federal and state laws pertaining to healthcare “fraud and abuse.” These laws include physician self-referral prohibitions, anti-kickback laws and false claims laws. Subject to enumerated exceptions, the federal physician self-referral law, also known as Stark II, prohibits a physician from referring Medicare or Medicaid patients to an entity with which the physician (or a family member) has a financial relationship, if the referral is for a “designated health service,” which is defined explicitly to include radiology and radiation therapy services. Anti-kickback laws make it illegal to solicit, induce, offer, receive or pay any remuneration in exchange for the referral of business, including the purchase of medical devices from a particular manufacturer or the referral of patients to a particular supplier of diagnostic services utilizing such devices. False claims laws prohibit anyone from knowingly and willfully presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment to third-party payors (including Medicare and Medicaid) that are false or fraudulent, for services not provided as claimed, or for medically unnecessary services. The Office of the Inspector General prosecutes violations of fraud and abuse laws and any violation may result in criminal and/or civil sanctions including, in some instances, imprisonment and exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. Varian needs to comply with all applicable laws related to federal healthcare programs in transactions with health care professionals.
Foreign Regulations
Our operations, sales and service of our products outside the United States are subject to regulatory requirements that vary from country to country and may differ significantly from those in the United States. In general, our products are regulated outside the United States as medical devices by foreign governmental agencies similar to the FDA.
Marketing a medical device internationally. In order for us to market our products internationally, we must obtain clearances or approvals for products and product modifications. We are required to affix the CE mark to our products in order to sell them in member countries of the European Economic Area (“EEA”). The CE mark is an international symbol of adherence to certain essential principles of safety and effectiveness, which once affixed enables a product to be sold in member countries of the EEA. The CE mark is also recognized in many countries outside the EEA, such as Switzerland and Australia, and can assist in the clearance process. In order to receive permission to affix the CE mark to our products, we must obtain Quality System 
14

certification, e.g., ISO 13485, and must otherwise have a quality management system that complies with the EU Medical Device Directive. The ISO promulgates standards for certification of quality assurance operations. We are certified as complying with the ISO 9001 for our security and inspection products and ISO 13485 for our medical devices. Several Asian countries, including Japan and China, have adopted regulatory schemes that are comparable, and in some cases more stringent, than the EU scheme. To import medical devices into Japan, the requirements of Japan’s New Medical Device Regulation must be met and a “shonin,” the approval to sell medical products in Japan, must be obtained. Similarly, in China a registration certification issued by the State Food and Drug Administration and a China Compulsory Certification mark for certain products are required to sell medical devices in that country. Obtaining such certifications on our products can be time-consuming and burdensome and can cause us to delay marketing or sales of certain products in such countries. Similarly, prior to selling a device in Canada, manufacturers of Class II, III and IV devices must obtain a medical device license. We sell Class II and Class III devices in Canada. Additionally, many countries have laws and regulations relating to radiation and radiation safety that also apply to our products. In most countries, radiological regulatory agencies require some form of licensing or registration by the facility prior to acquisition and operation of an X-ray generating device or a radiation source. The handling, transportation and the recycling of radioactive metals and source materials are also highly regulated.
A number of countries, including the members of the EU, have implemented or are implementing regulations that would require manufacturers to dispose, or bear certain disposal costs, of products at the end of a product’s useful life and restrict the use of some hazardous substances in certain products sold in those countries. 
Manufacturing and selling a device internationally. We are also subject to laws and regulations outside the United States applicable to manufacturers of radiation-producing devices and products utilizing radioactive materials, and laws and regulations of general applicability relating to matters such as environmental protection, safe working conditions, manufacturing practices and other matters, in each case that are often comparable to, if not more stringent than, regulations in the United States. In addition, our sales of products in foreign countries are also subject to regulation of matters such as product standards, packaging requirements, labeling requirements, import restrictions, environmental and product recycling requirements, trade regulations, duties and tax requirements. In some countries, we rely on our foreign distributors and agents to assist us in complying with foreign regulatory requirements.
Data Privacy Laws. The EU General Data Protection Regulation ("GDPR") took effect in May 2018. The compliance and other burdens imposed by GDPR and similar privacy laws and regulations may be substantial since they are subject to differing interpretations and implementation among jurisdictions. The restrictions imposed by such laws and regulations may limit the use and adoption of our services, reduce overall demand for our services, require us to modify our data handling practices and impose additional costs and burdens. In addition, non-compliance could result in proceedings against us by governmental entities or others, significant fines, and may otherwise adversely impact our business, financial condition and operating results. Particularly within Europe, data protection legislation is comprehensive and complex and there has been a recent trend toward more stringent enforcement of requirements regarding protection and confidentiality of personal data.
Other applicable international regulations. We are also subject to international “fraud and abuse” laws and regulations, as well as false claims and misleading advertisement laws. 
Anti-Corruption Laws and Regulations
We are subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and anti-corruption laws, and similar laws in foreign countries, such as the U.K. Bribery Act of 2010 and the Law “On the Fundamentals of Health Protection in the Russian Federation.” In general, there is a worldwide trend to strengthen anticorruption laws and their enforcement, and the healthcare industry and medical equipment manufacturers have been particular targets of these investigation and enforcement efforts. Any violation of these laws by us or our agents or distributors could create a substantial liability for us, subject our officers and directors to personal liability and also cause a loss of reputation in the market. 
Transparency International’s 2016 Corruption Perceptions Index measured the degree to which public sector corruption is perceived to exist in 176 countries/territories around the world, and found that approximately sixty-nine percent of the countries in the index, including many that we consider to be high growth areas for our products, such as China, India, Russia and Brazil, scored below 50, on a scale from 100 (very clean) to 0 (highly corrupt). We currently operate in many countries where the public sector is perceived as being more or highly corrupt and our strategic business plans include expanding our business in regions and countries that are rated as higher risk for corruption activity by Transparency International. 
Increased business in higher risk countries could subject us and our officers and directors to increased scrutiny and increased liability. In addition, becoming familiar with and implementing the infrastructure necessary to comply with laws, rules and regulations applicable to new business activities and mitigating and protecting against corruption risks could be quite costly. 
15

Failure by us or our agents or distributors to comply with these laws, rules and regulations could delay our expansion into high-growth markets and could adversely affect our business. 
Patent and Other Proprietary Rights
We place considerable importance on obtaining and maintaining patent, copyright and trade secret protection for significant new technologies, products and processes, because of the length of time and expense associated with bringing new products through the development process and to the marketplace.
We generally rely upon a combination of patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade secret and other laws, and contractual restrictions on disclosure, copying and transferring title, including confidentiality agreements with vendors, strategic partners, co-developers, employees, consultants and other third parties, to protect our proprietary rights in the developments, improvements and inventions that we have originated and which are incorporated in our products or that fall within our fields of interest. As of September 28, 2018, we owned 423 patents issued in the United States and 325 patents issued throughout the rest of the world and had 448 patent applications on file with various patent agencies worldwide. We intend to file additional patent applications as appropriate. We have trademarks, both registered and unregistered, that are maintained and enforced to provide customer recognition for our products in the marketplace. We also have agreements with third parties that provide for licensing of patented or proprietary technology, including royalty bearing licenses and technology cross licenses.
Environmental Matters
For a discussion of environmental matters, see “Critical Accounting Estimates” in MD&A and Note 10, "Commitments and Contingencies" of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, which discussions are incorporated herein by reference.
Financial Information about Geographic Areas
We do business globally with manufacturing, engineering, and development in the United States, Europe, China, India and Canada with sales and service operations and customers throughout the world. More than half of our revenues are generated from our international regions. In addition to the potentially adverse impact of foreign regulations, see “Government Regulation—Foreign Regulations,” we also may be affected by other factors related to our international sales such as: trade barriers, tariffs, restraints and other restrictions, foreign currency exchange controls, lower average selling prices and profit margins; longer time periods from shipment to revenue recognition (which increases revenue recognition deferrals and time in backlog); and longer time periods from shipment to cash collection (which increases days sales outstanding (“DSO”)). To the extent that the geographic distribution of our sales continues to shift more towards international regions, our overall revenues and margins may suffer. We sell our products internationally predominantly in local currencies, but our cost structure is weighted towards the U.S. Dollar. Accordingly, there may be adverse consequences from strengthening of the U.S. Dollar against foreign currencies, which may affect both the affordability and competitiveness of our products and our profit margins. We engage in currency hedging strategies to offset the effect of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, but the protection offered by these hedges depends upon the timing of transactions, the effectiveness of the hedges, the number of transactions that are hedged and forecast volatility.
We are also exposed to other economic, political and other risks inherent in doing business globally. For an additional discussion of these risks, see Item 1A, “Risk Factors.”
For a discussion of financial information about geographic areas, see Note 17, "Segment Information" of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements and MD&A, which discussions are incorporated herein by reference.
Tariff Measures
On July 6, 2018, the Trump Administration imposed 25% tariffs on a variety of imports from China, including Varian’s radiotherapy systems manufactured in China and certain components imported into the U.S. for our manufacturing and service activities. The Administration subsequently imposed tariffs on two additional lists of products from China; the first of these additional lists involves 25% tariffs and the second list imposes 10% tariffs increasing to 25% on January 1, 2019. We expect our imports into the U.S. to be impacted less by these two tariff lists than by the initial tariff list. 
China responded to the multiple U.S. tariffs lists by announcing several lists of products from the U.S. that are subject to additional tariffs upon import to China. The first round of Chinese retaliatory tariffs went into effect on July 6, 2018. Our products are not impacted by these tariffs. Our exports of U.S. manufactured radiotherapy systems to China are impacted by the second Chinese list, implemented on August 23, 2018, which is subject to a 25% tariff. A third group of items, including certain 
16

of our manufacturing inputs and services, is subject to 5 to 10% tariffs, which went into effect on September 24, 2018. Any tariffs imposed by the United States and China that include Varian technology could increase the cost of our products and adversely impact the competitiveness of our products and/or our operational results in the future. 
We are participating in the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative process to consider product-specific exclusions from these tariffs. While we are uncertain of the outcome of these exclusion discussions, if we are successful, certain Varian products could be provided relief from these tariffs retroactive to the date of their enactment. In addition, we continue to engage in ongoing planning in and optimization of our global manufacturing and supply chain operations both in light of the long-term uncertainty of these tariff measures and to have a more flexible business disruption and continuity plan.
Employees
As of September 28, 2018, we had approximately 7,174 full-time and part-time employees worldwide, including approximately 3,076 in the United States and approximately 4,098 in international locations. . None of our employees based in the United States are unionized or subject to collective bargaining agreements. Employees based in some other countries may, from time to time, be represented by works councils or unions or subject to collective bargaining agreements. We consider our relations with our employees to be good.
