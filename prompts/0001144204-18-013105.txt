Overview
 
We are a biopharmaceutical company with product candidates in pre-clinical and clinical development. Neurotrope BioScience began operations in October 2012. We are principally focused on developing a product platform based upon a drug candidate called bryostatin for the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease (“AD”), which is in the clinical testing stage. We are also developing bryostatin for other neurodegenerative or cognitive diseases and dysfunctions, such as Fragile X and Niemann-Pick Type C, which are in pre-clinical testing.  Neurotrope has been a party to a technology license and services agreement with the original Blanchette Rockefeller Neurosciences Institute (“BRNI”) (which has been known as Cognitive Research Enterprises, Inc. (“CRE”) since October 2016), and its affiliate NRV II, LLC, which we collectively refer to herein as “CRE,” pursuant to which we have an exclusive non-transferable license to certain patents and technologies required to develop our proposed products.  Neurotrope BioScience was formed for the primary purpose of commercializing the technologies initially developed originally by BRNI for therapeutic applications for AD or other cognitive dysfunctions. These technologies have been under development by BRNI since 1999 and, until March 2013, had been financed through funding from a variety of non-investor sources (which include not-for-profit foundations, the National Institutes of Health, which is part of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, and individual philanthropists). From March 2013 forward, development of the licensed technology has been funded principally through Neurotrope BioScience in collaboration with CRE.
 
According to the Alzheimer’s Association, an estimated 47 million people worldwide had AD or another form of dementia, in 2017. The prevalence of AD is independent of race, ethnicity, geography, life style and, to a large extent, genetics. The most common cause of developing AD is old age. In developing countries, where the median age of death is less than 65 years old, AD is rarely recognized or diagnosed. In the U.S., an estimated 5.5 million people were estimated to have AD in 2017, and over 96% of these people were older than 65 years of age.
 
Researchers have explored and continue to explore a wide range of drug mechanisms in hopes of developing drugs to combat AD. We believe that our approach, which involves the activation of an enzyme called protein kinase C epsilon (“PKCε”), represents a novel mechanism in potential AD drug therapies. Bryostatin-1, our lead PKC epsilon activator, has in animal studies demonstrated potential for multi-modal efficacies: prevention of neuronal death, generation of new synaptic networks, anti-amyloid oligomers and plaques, anti-tau and neurofibrillary tangles, and cognitive enhancement.
 
CRE conducted an expanded access program, formerly known as compassionate use, of bryostatin-1 in patients with advanced AD. Five patients were treated, four of which were treated under an Investigational New Drug Application (“IND”), cleared by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”). The IND was initially held by CRE and was transferred to Neurotrope on February 4, 2015. One of these patients, who had familial AD, died, but the death was not drug-related. Treatment of another one of these patients concluded after almost one year on the protocol. We have provided limited funding, study drug, and personnel support under the terms of our agreement with CRE for the expansion of our clinical effort in AD during the 2017 timeframe.
 
Results of Phase 2 Clinical Trial
 
On May 1, 2017, we reported certain relevant top-line results from our Phase 2 exploratory clinical trial based on a preliminary analysis of a limited portion of the complete data set generated. A total of 147 patients were enrolled into the study; 135 patients in the mITT population and 113 in the Completer population. This study was the first repeat dose study of bryostatin-1 in patients with late stage AD (defined as a Mini Mental State Exam 2 (“MMSE-2”) of 4-15), in which two dose levels of bryostatin-1 were compared with placebo to assess safety and preliminary efficacy (p < 0.1, one-tailed) after 12 weeks of treatment. The pre-specified primary endpoint, the Severe Impairment Battery (the “SIB”) (used to evaluate cognition in severe dementia), compared each dose of bryostatin-1 with placebo at Week 13 in two sets of patients: (1) the modified intent-to-treat (the “mITT”) population, consisting of all patients who received study drug and had at least one efficacy/safety evaluation, and (2) the Completer population, consisting of those patients within the mITT population who completed the 13-week dosing protocol and cognitive assessments.

These announced top-line results indicated that the 20 µg dose, administered after two weekly 20 µg doses during the first two weeks and every other week thereafter, met the pre-specified primary endpoint in the Completer population, but not in the mITT population. Among the patients who completed the protocol (n = 113), the patients on the 20 µg dose at 13 weeks showed a mean increase on the SIB of 1.5 vs. a decrease in the placebo group of -1.1 (net improvement of 2.6, p < 0.07), whereas, in the mITT population, the 20 µg group had a mean increase on the SIB of 1.2 vs. a decrease in the placebo group of -0.8 (net improvement of 2.0, p < 0.134). At the pre-specified 5 week secondary endpoint, the Completer patients in the 20 µg group showed a net improvement of 4.0 SIB (p < 016), and the mITT population showed a net improvement of 3.0 (p< ,056).Unlike the 20 µg dose, there was no therapeutic signal observed with the 40 µg dose.
 
The Alzheimer Disease Cooperative Study Activities of Daily Living Inventory Severe Impairment version (ADCS-ADL-SIV) was another pre-specified secondary endpoint. The p values for the comparisons between 20 µg and placebo for the ADCS-ADL endpoint at 13 weeks were 0.082 for the Completers and 0.104, for the mITT population.
 
Together, these initial results after preliminary analysis of this exploratory trial, indicated that bryostatin-1, at the 20 µg dose, caused sustained improvement in important functions that are impaired in patients with moderate to severe Alzheimer’s disease i.e., cognition and the ability to care for oneself. Since most of the patients in this study were already taking donepezil and/or memantine, the efficacy of bryostatin-1 was evaluated in the Top Line results over and above the standard of care therapeutics.
 
The safety profile of bryostatin-1 20 µg was minimally different from the placebo group except for a higher incidence of diarrhea and infusion reactions (11% versus 2% for diarrhea and 17% versus 6% for infusion reactions). Fewer adverse events were reported in patients in the 20 µg group, compared to the 40 µg group. Patients dosed with 20 µg had a dropout rate less than or identical to placebo, while patients dosed at 40 µg experienced poorer safety and tolerability, and had a higher dropout rate. Treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were mostly mild or moderate in severity. TEAEs, including serious adverse events, were more common in the 40 µg group, as compared to the 20 µg and placebo groups. The mean age of patients in the study was 72 years and similar across all three treatment groups.
 
Following presentation of the top line results in July 2017 at the Alzheimer’s Association International Conference in London, a much more extensive analysis of a more complete set of the Phase 2 trial data was conducted.
 
On January 5, 2018, we announced that a post-hoc analysis of a comprehensive data set from our recent Phase 2 trial in patients with advanced Alzheimer’s disease (AD) found evidence of sustained improvement in cognition in patients receiving the 20 μg bryostatin regimen. In addition, patients who did not receive memantine, an approved AD treatment, as background therapy showed greater SIB improvement. These findings suggested that this investigational drug could potentially treat Alzheimer’s disease itself and help reduce and/or reverse the progression of AD, rather than only alleviate its symptoms.
 
The comprehensive follow-on analysis found that patients in the 20 μg treatment arm showed a sustained improvement in cognition over baseline compared to the placebo group at week 15 (30 days after last dose at week 11). These data were observed in the study population as a whole.
 
The follow-on analysis of the data evaluated SIB scores of patients at 15 weeks, 30 days after all dosing had been completed – a pre-specified exploratory endpoint. For the 20 μg group, patients in the mITT population (n=34) showed an overall improvement compared to controls (n=33) of 3.59 (p=0.0503) and in the Completers population (n=34) showed an overall improvement compared to controls (n=33) of 4.09 (p=0.0293). In summary, patients on the 20 μg dose showed a persistent SIB improvement 30 days after all dosing had been completed. These p-values and those below are one-tailed.

Additional analyses compared 20 µg dose patients who were on baseline therapy of Aricept vs. patients off Aricept. No significant differences were observed. Another analysis compared the 20 µg dose patients who were on or off baseline therapy of memantine. Post-hoc analysis comparing SIB scores in non-memantine versus memantine patients found the following:
 

· | At week 15, non-memantine patients in the mITT Group treated with 20 μg (n=14) showed an SIB improvement of 5.88, while the placebo patients (n=11) showed a decline in their SIB scores of -0.05 for an overall treatment Δ of 5.93 from baseline (p=0.0576).
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | At week 15, non-memantine patients in the Completers Group treated with 20 μg (n=14) showed an SIB improvement of 6.24, while the placebo patients (n=11) showed a decline in their SIB scores of -0.12 for an overall treatment Δ of 6.36 from baseline (p=0.0488).
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Patients taking memantine as background therapy in the 20 μg (n=20) and control (n=22) groups showed no improvement in SIB scores.

Memantine, an NMDA receptor antagonist, is marketed under the brand names Namenda®, Namenda® XR, and Namzaric® (a combination of memantine and donepezil) for the treatment of dementia in patients with moderate-to-severe AD. It has been shown to delay cognitive decline and help reduce disease symptoms. 
 
Neurotrope is planning a replication trial for the safe, effective 20 μg dose protocol for advanced AD patients not taking memantine as background therapy to evaluate improvements in SIB scores with an increased number of patients. We are in discussions with investigators at leading academic institutions to collaborate on the design and conduct of the next trial, which is expected to begin in the first half of 2018.
 
To the extent resources permit, we intend to pursue development of selected technology platforms with indications – such as Fragile X disease - related to the treatment of AD and other neurodegenerative disorders based on our current licensed technology and / or technologies available from third party licensors or collaborators.

In connection with the November 2016 Private Placement, on November 17, 2016, we filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Nevada an Amendment to our Certificate of Designations, Preferences and Rights of Series B Preferred Stock (the “Series B COD Amendment”), originally filed November 13, 2015 with the Secretary of State of the State of Nevada, as corrected by the Certificate of Correction filed November 19, 2015 with the Secretary of State of the State of Nevada (as so corrected, the “Certificate of Designation”). The Series B COD Amendment (i) provided that the Company’s entry into a binding securities purchase agreement, by and among the Company and the investors signatory thereto, in connection with a private placement of the Company’s common stock and warrants, that results in at least $8,000,000 of aggregate gross proceeds to the Company (a “Private Placement”), shall result in the automatic conversion of the Company’s Series B Stock into shares of the Company’s common stock at a conversion price of $18.56 immediately prior to the initial closing of the Private Placement with aggregate gross proceeds to the Company of at least $8,000,000 and (ii) amended the definition of “Excluded Securities” to include the issuance of the Company’s common stock and warrants issued in any Private Placement. As a result of the November 2016 Private Placement, all of the issued and outstanding shares of Series B Stock were converted into an aggregate of 825,962 shares of our common stock on November 17, 2016. The Series B COD Amendment was approved by the “Required Holders” as defined in the Certificate of Designation. As a result of the mandatory conversion of the Series B Stock, the anti-dilution protection for dilutive issuances in the Series A Warrants, the Series C Warrants and the Series E Warrants ceased to be effective pursuant to the terms of such warrants.
 
Pursuant to the purchase agreement entered into in connection with November 2016 Private Placement, we agreed to reduce the exercise prices of certain of our outstanding warrants to purchase shares of common stock that were issued in connection with the November 2015 Private Placement. Effective as of November 18, 2016, the exercise price of each of the Series A Warrants and the Series C Warrants was reduced to $0.32 per share and the exercise price of the Series E Warrants was reduced to $32.00 per share, in each case subject to adjustment as provided in such Warrants.
 
In connection with the November 2016 Private Placement, pursuant to a Placement Agency Agreement, dated October 13, 2016 (the “Placement Agency Agreement”), among the Company, Katalyst Securities LLC (“Katalyst”) and GP Nurmenkari Inc. (“GP Nurmenkari,” and, together with Katalyst, the “Placement Agents”), we agreed to pay the Placement Agents (i) a cash fee at each closing under the purchase agreement equal to ten percent (10%) of each closing’s gross proceeds and (ii) warrants to purchase shares of common stock at each closing under the purchase agreement equal to ten percent (10%) of the number of shares of common stock sold in each closing, with an exercise price of $6.40 per share and a five-year term (the “Broker Warrants”). Such Warrants became exercisable when our stockholders approved an amendment to our Articles of Incorporation to increase the number of authorized shares and such amendment was filed in Nevada, which occurred on February 24, 2017.
 
Under the Placement Agency Agreement, we agreed to amend certain warrants previously issued to the Placement Agents. Immediately following the receipt of at least $8,000,000 of gross proceeds as part of the November 2016 Private Placement, the exercise price of the 70,119 unexercised placement agent Series B Warrants and/or broker warrants issued by the Company as placement agent compensation to Katalyst, their registered representatives and designees, assignees or successors in interest, in connection with the Company’s completed financing in November 2015 (collectively, the “Series B Broker Warrants”), was reduced to $0.32 per share of common stock, provided that the Series B Broker Warrants that have their exercise price reduced shall not be exercisable for six months from the date of the initial closing under the purchase agreement. Additionally, immediately following the receipt of at least $10,000,000 of gross proceeds as part of the November 2016 Private Placement, the exercise price of the 41,416 unexercised placement agent Series A Warrants and/or broker warrants issued by the Company as placement agent compensation to EDI Financial, Inc., Katalyst, their registered representatives and designees, assignees or successors in interest, in connection with the Company’s completed financings in 2013 (collectively, the “Series A Broker Warrants”) shall be reduced to $0.32 per share of common stock, provided that the Series A Broker Warrants that have their exercise price reduced shall not be exercisable for one year from the date of the initial closing under the purchase agreement. Accordingly, the exercise price of the Series A Broker Warrants and the Series B Broker Warrants has been reduced to $0.32 per share of common stock as of November 23, 2016.

Organizational History
 
We were incorporated as BlueFlash Communications, Inc. in Florida on January 11, 2011. Prior to the Reverse Merger (as defined below) and Split-Off (as defined below), our business was to provide software solutions to deliver geo-location targeted coupon advertising to mobile internet devices.
 
On August 9, 2013, we reincorporated in the State of Nevada by merging into a newly-formed special-purpose subsidiary, Neurotrope, Inc., which was incorporated on June 13, 2013, and was the surviving corporation in such reincorporation merger, or the Reincorporation Merger. As a result of the Reincorporation Merger, (i) we changed our name to Neurotrope, Inc. and (ii) we changed our jurisdiction of incorporation from Florida to Nevada.
 
On August 23, 2013, our wholly-owned subsidiary, Neurotrope Acquisition, Inc., or Acquisition Sub, a corporation formed in the State of Nevada on August 15, 2013 merged with and into Neurotrope BioScience, a corporation incorporated in the State of Delaware on October 31, 2012. Neurotrope BioScience was the surviving corporation in the merger, or the Reverse Merger, and became our wholly-owned subsidiary. All of the outstanding shares of Neurotrope BioScience common stock, (“Neurotrope BioScience Common Stock”), were converted into shares of our common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, and all of the outstanding shares of Neurotrope BioScience Series A Stock were converted into shares of our Series A Stock, in each case on a one-for-one basis.
 
In connection with the Reverse Merger and pursuant to a split-off agreement (the “Split-Off”), we transferred our pre-Reverse Merger business to Marissa Watson, our pre-Reverse Merger majority stockholder, in exchange for the surrender and cancellation of certain shares of our common stock owned by her.
 
As a result of the Reverse Merger and Split-Off, we discontinued our pre-Reverse Merger business and acquired the business of Neurotrope BioScience. Following the Reverse Merger and Split-Off, we have undertaken the business operations of Neurotrope BioScience as a publicly-traded company under the name Neurotrope, Inc., through Neurotrope BioScience, which is now our wholly-owned subsidiary.
 
In accordance with “reverse merger” accounting treatment, our historical financial statements as of period ends, and for periods ended, prior to the Reverse Merger were replaced with the historical financial statements of Neurotrope BioScience prior to the Reverse Merger in all applicable filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”).
 
On January 11, 2017, we effected a 1-for-32 reverse stock split of our shares of common stock. As a result of the reverse stock split, every thirty-two (32) shares of our pre-reverse split common stock was combined and reclassified into one share of common stock. All references to common shares have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the reverse stock split. In addition, our pre-reverse split 400,000,000 authorized shares of common stock was proportionately reduced to 12,500,000 authorized shares of common stock as a result of the reverse stock split.
 
On February 24, 2017, we increased our authorized common stock to 150,000,000 shares.
 
AD and the Potential Market for our Products
 
The Epidemic of AD
 
According to the Alzheimer’s Association, it has been estimated that 47 million people worldwide had AD, or other forms of dementia, in 2017. The prevalence of AD is independent of race, ethnicity, geography, lifestyle and, to a large extent, genetics. The most common cause of developing AD is living a long life. In developing countries where the median age of death is less than 65 years old, AD is rarely recognized or diagnosed. In the United States in 2017, 5.5 million people are estimated to have AD, and approximately 96% of these people are older than 65 years of age.
 
Researchers continue to explore a wide range of drug mechanisms in hopes of developing drugs to combat this disease. Figure 1 illustrates the range of mechanisms under consideration. Our approach, which involves the activation of the enzyme PKCε, represents a novel mechanism in the armamentarium of potential AD drug therapies.

Figure 1. Different Pharmacologic Targets being pursued for the Treatment of AD1
 


It has been shown that, during several years preceding the diagnosis of dementia associated with AD, there can be gradual cognition decline, which at first may have rather benign characteristics. At this stage, known as mild cognitive impairment (“MCI”), 60% of these patients will convert to early AD. In MCI, there can already be significant loss of synapses (the junctions between nerve cells) and compromised release of the chemical messengers onto their post-synaptic targets1. MCI, therefore, can transition into mild, moderate and, finally, severe stages of Alzheimer’s disease that are characterized by greater systemic loss of neurons and synapses in the brain tissue. Multiple failures in acetylcholine and glutamate neurotransmitter systems (neurotransmitters) may cause some of the symptoms of early AD, and thus these systems have become targets for pharmacologic intervention.
 
In MCI and early AD, the amyloid load in the brain may or may not increase while the symptoms of early AD begin to occur. Loss of neurons and synaptic networks can be accompanied by abnormal processing of β amyloid (“Aβ”) peptide, causing elevation of the soluble Aβ oligomers, eventually leading to the formation of Aβ plaques (protein deposits) in the brain.
 
The conventional amyloid cascade hypothesis holds that amyloid pathology leads to hyperphosphorylated tau proteins (a protein found in nerve cells) being deposited within neurons in the form of insoluble tangles, excitotoxicity (overstimulation of nerve cells by neurotransmitters), inflammation and finally synaptic depletion and neuronal death. Other hypotheses suggest that AD begins earlier with dysfunctional tau metabolism – independent of amyloid levels. However, the majority of drug development efforts during the past two decades have focused on stopping the production of Aβ or its fragments, and the elimination of these peptides from either intracellular or extracellular locations has represented the preponderance of drug design efforts to halt the progression of AD. However, these efforts have been largely unsuccessful.
 
We believe the current failures of therapies clearing formed amyloid plaques come from an incomplete view of the process. In our view, amyloid plaques and the tau-based neurofibrillary tangles are pathologic hallmarks of AD, but cognitive deficits and synaptic loss can often occur in AD patients in the absence of amyloid plaques. We believe the appearance of these plaques and tangles is not necessarily linked to the death of neurons or synapses, and that the elimination of the plaques does not restore cognitive function as already demonstrated in extensive clinical testing with pathologic correlates. However, we believe that the soluble amyloid pre-plaque oligomers, through their toxicity to synapses and neurons, are important in the progression of the disease.

In animal studies, the scientific team led by our Chief Scientific Officer, Dr. Alkon, at the Blanchette Rockefeller Neurosciences Institute, or BRNI (now known CRE) found that PKCε activation in neurons targets the loss of synapses in the brains of animals with AD, and can delay or temporarily arrest other elements of the disease, i.e. the elevation of the toxic Aβ peptide, the loss of neurons, the appearance of plaques and tangles, and the loss of cognitive function.
 
Potential Market for Our Products
 
According to an article titled “Progress in AD” published in The Journal of Neurology in 2012, there has been a dearth of new product introductions in the last 20 years either for the treatment of AD symptoms or its definitive diagnosis in patients who begin exhibiting the memory and cognitive disorders associated with the disease. According to the Alzheimer’s Association, all of the products introduced to date for the treatment of AD have yielded negative or marginal results with no long-term effect on the progression of AD and no improvement in the memory or cognitive performance of the patients receiving these therapies. With 36 million people worldwide estimated to have had AD in 2015, there is significant commercial potential for a new therapeutic that is effective in delaying the progression of the disease.
 
We believe the markets for drugs or therapies to treat the underlying pathology of AD exist largely, but not exclusively, in the developed world and principally comprise the North American, European and Japanese markets. The aggregate AD market is subdivided into four distinct segments, which are shown in Figure 2, as are the compounded annual growth rates (“CAGRs”) for these segments over the 2013-2023 timeframe.
 
Sales of the major drug therapies available only by prescription are reported and projected in Figure 2. These drugs are approved for the symptomatic treatment of the cognitive aspects of AD, but have no meaningful effect on disease progression, causing only temporary improvement in cognitive decline. Despite their limited efficacy, this group of drugs had collective worldwide sales in 2013 in excess of approximately $5 billion, according to GlobalData, Pharma eTrack.

Neurotrope’s Proposed Products
 
Challenges in Treating AD
 
One of the challenges in treating AD is that its symptoms become manifest only years after the disease process can be definitely diagnosed. Treatment strategies attempting to intervene once symptoms become more apparent are focused on stimulating the neurotransmitter activity of still healthy neurons, or removing the amyloid plaque deposited in the brain. All drug development efforts to date that have targeted the removal of beta-amyloid or tau protein as their therapeutic mechanism of action have failed, and drugs approved for stimulating neurotransmitter activity offer short-lived, palliative results for AD patients. As such, these strategies have yielded negative or marginal results with no effect on the progression of AD and no improvement in the memory or cognitive performance of the patients receiving these therapies.

Dying neurons and synapses have, to date, not been therapeutic targets for restoration, and many in the AD field currently believe that stemming the progression of the disease may only be possible with very early stage intervention. The FDA is encouraging the pharmaceutical industry to increase efforts to investigate such early stage interventional treatments by recommending that modified clinical endpoints, both functional and cognitive, be established to monitor the efficacy of drug prototypes being tested in early stage AD patients, according to an article published in The New England Journal of Medicine.3
 
In contrast, we believe that our data from various preclinical animal models and compassionate use trials demonstrates that activation of PKCε in central nervous system neurons improves neuronal vitality and function in areas of the brain damaged by AD, potentially resulting in the improvement of memory and cognition.
 
Synaptogenesis
 
We believe that deficient activity or low concentrations of PKCε in aging subjects is one of the main causes of the neurodegeneration seen in AD. The schematic in Figure 3 illustrates only a portion of the changes mediated by PKCε, and how it may help reverse the neuronal damage and loss central to the pathogenic process in AD.

Activation of PKCε has been achieved with drug prototypes that mimic the activity of diacylglycerol and phosphatidylserine, which are the natural binding targets for this enzyme. In addition, a variety of in vitro and in vivo animal models have demonstrated that these drug prototypes are effective in restoring the structure and function of neuronal synapses. Our first clinical application of the PKCε activators is focused on the treatment of AD, but a number of other neurodegenerative diseases may be amenable to similar treatment. A list of these potential future drug targets is shown in Figure 4.

Treatment of AD by Stimulating Synaptic Regeneration and Prevention of Neuronal Death
 
Dr. Alkon’s team at BRNI (now known as CRE) conducted research in synaptic regeneration and the prevention of neuronal death, outside the conventional wisdom that has dominated research efforts in the industry. The pathology of AD likely has multiple layers in its development, in addition to the presence of tau phosphorylated tangles and Aβ oligomers. However, once this process presents clinical manifestations of AD, restoring synaptic function thus far has not been effectively achieved by removing Aβ plaques with experimental drug interventions. Once neurons undergo toxic changes with soluble Aβ oligomers, the loss of function to the patient has been irreversible.
 
CRE’s and Neurotrope’s approach has been to restore general viability and hence synaptic function in still-functioning neurons by stimulating the regeneration and growth of the dendritic branches, spines, and pre-synaptic terminals on these neurons. (Dendrites are the branched projections of a neuron that act to propagate the electrochemical stimulation received from other neural cells.) This process can be visualized with serial sections visualized by the electron microscope in the brains of rats whose neurons and synapses have been damaged by ischemic shock (depriving oxygen) or traumatic injury to the brain. The morphology of the damaged neurons in these animal models looks strikingly different after they are treated with experimental drugs that activate PKCε. The new growth of dendritic trees on the damaged neurons creates a multiplicity of new synaptic connections, basically re-wiring the damaged neurons and restoring their function. Earlier therapeutic intervention with a PKCε activator produces markedly improved outcomes in tests measuring restored animal cognitive function.

PKCε Activation Stimulates the Formation of New Synaptic Connections
 
The new synaptic connections formed from the damaged neurons revitalized by PKCε in rats can be demonstrated in various behavioral models for the animals that are used to measure memory functions. Treatment with bryostatin, for 12 weeks in genetically modified rodents pre-disposed to develop an AD-type of pathology showed that bryostatin promoted the growth of new synapses and preserved the existing synapses. In addition, this drug also reversed the decrease of PKCε and the reciprocal increase of soluble amyloid.4
 
In cell tissue cultures, there is a difference in morphology between neurons damaged by the application of ASPD (soluble oligomers of Aβ) as compared to synapses rejuvenated by the application of bryostatin. Treatment with bryostatin, through PKCε activation, stimulates the revitalization of neurons and the formation of new synaptic connections. 
 
The Central Role of PKCε in Maintaining Neuron Structure and Function
 
Upon activation, PKCε migrates from the intraneuronal cytoplasm to the cell membrane, where it activates signal-regulating enzymes (specifically the m-RNA stabilizing protein, HUD, and downstream growth factors such as BDNF, NGF, IGF, etc.; MAP kinases Erk1/2; the BCl-2 apoptosis cascade; and NF-κβ), causing a series of changes leading to increased DNA transcription, synaptic maturation, a consequent increase in levels of growth factor proteins (such as nerve growth factor and brain-derived neurotrophic factor), an inhibition of programmed cell-death and a reduction of β amyloid, and hyperphosphorylated tau.
 
This myriad of events is orchestrated by PKCε, and prompts a number of secondary events occurring in both the pre- and post-synaptic portions of the neuron. Cellular visualization of this effect shows an increase in the number of pre-synaptic vesicles in the neurons, an increase in pre-synaptic levels of PKCε and an increase in the number of mushroom spines associated with individual synaptic boutons (knoblike enlargements at the end of a nerve fiber, where it forms a synapse). Their genesis in these neurons is responsible for the formation of new synapses during associative learning and memory, and for regeneration of synaptic networks in pre-clinical models of Alzheimer’s disease, stroke, traumatic brain injury, and Fragile X mental retardation.
 
The central role of PKCε activation in these dynamic events expands the amyloid and tau hypotheses for AD by including pathways to restore the synaptic networks lost during neurodegeneration and to prevent further loss. This mechanistic framework offers new targets for therapeutic intervention which not only prevent the formation of tangles and plaque, but also prevents neuronal death, and promotes the induction of new, mature synaptic networks.
 
Decreased amyloid formation from PKCε activation results from an increase in the rate of Aβ degradation by ECE (endothelin converting enzyme) and induction of α-secretase cleavage of amyloid precursor protein (the precursor molecule to Aβ) through phosphorylation of an enzyme known as Erk. In rodent models genetically predisposed to forming large amounts of amyloid deposits in their brains, PKCε activation was found to interrupt the ongoing formation of amyloid, suggesting that this approach may delay the progression of AD.
 
The key to CRE’s innovation in this area has been in identifying highly potent drug prototypes that at low concentrations cause the specific and transient activation of PKCε, without interacting with the other isozyme variants of PKC whose inactivation would negate the synaptogenic properties of the e isoform.
 
Testing PKCε Activation in Humans
 
The basic drug mechanism invoking PKCε activation for neuronal rejuvenation and synaptic regeneration has never been evaluated in humans for any drug class or therapeutic application. We believe that the pre-clinical and clinical research in this field as described above is an ideal platform for testing this approach in human subjects.

We have licensed a body of biomedical research from CRE, formerly known as the Blanchette Rockefeller Neurosciences Institute, or BRNI, that is comprised of new methods and drug prototypes designed to stimulate neuronal regeneration. For additional information, see “Business – Intellectual Property – Technology License and Services Agreement.” We believe the commercial application of this technology has potential to impact AD as well as traumatic brain injury, ischemic stroke, post-traumatic stress syndrome and learning disorders.
 
Drug Prototypes That Treat AD through Regeneration
 
CRE has developed a new chemical family of polyunsaturated fatty acid (“PUFA”) analogs, which appear to be effective in the activation of PKCε. Representative structures of bryostatin and a lead PUFA analog are shown in Figure 5. 
 
Figure 5. Structures of Bryostatin 1 and a PUFA Analog Effective in the Activation of PKCε5
 


Ki values = effective concentration of the drug in achieving 50% activation of PKCε
 
These molecules activate PKCε by binding to two different and distinct active sites on the enzyme. The natural ligands that bind to these sites are diacylglycerol and phosphatidylserine. Bryostatin acts as a mimetic (mimic) for diacylglycerol by binding to the diacylglycerol site and, similarly, the PUFA analogs act as mimetics for phosphatidylserine by binding to the phosphatidylserine site.
 
Part of the hierarchal array of in vitro and in vivo tests useful in optimizing the potency of our potential drug prototypes is displayed in Figure 6.

Figure 6. Optimization of PKCε Activation Effects in Lead Drug Candidates: Array of in vitro and in vivo Test Models
 

Bryostatin
 
Our lead product candidate is bryostatin. Bryostatin is a natural product isolated from a marine invertebrate organism, a bryozoan called Bugula neritina. Several total syntheses of this complex molecule have been achieved in recent years in various academic chemistry laboratories, and these approaches represent a possible alternative source of this drug. Importantly, we have now obtained an exclusive license for neurologic disorders to a new, accelerated synthesis of bryostatin-1 recently developed at Stanford University by Dr. Paul Wender and his team. Bryostatin is a PKCα and e activator that was originally developed as a potential anticancer drug. According to Clinical Cancer Research, this drug candidate was previously evaluated in 63 clinical studies involving more than 1,400 patients at the National Cancer Institute (“NCI”) for the treatment of various forms of cancer. While having failed these studies as an experimental anti-cancer therapy, much useful information on the safety, pharmacodynamics and toxicity of the drug was obtained from these in-human trials. In general, bryostatin-1 was considered to be “well-tolerated” in these anti-cancer trials.
 
It was discovered that at doses at the lower levels than those used in these anticancer trials, bryostatin is a potent activator of PKCε and may have efficacy in treating AD. As described above, activation of PKCε has now been shown to partially restore synaptic function in neurons damaged by AD in in vitro and in vivo animal models.
 
The NCI has entered into a material transfer agreement with CRE to provide the bryostatin required for pre-clinical research as well as the Phase 2 clinical trials planned by the Company. The clinical material transfer agreement specifies that CRE retains all of the bryostatin intellectual property. Our license agreement with CRE (see “Business – Intellectual Property – Technology License and Services Agreement”) permits our access to new bryostatin clinical trial data and information held by the NCI, as well as past clinical, safety and toxicity data compiled by the NCI during the time this drug was being evaluated for its anticancer properties. See Item 1A, “Risk Factors—We are partly dependent upon the NCI to supply bryostatin for our clinical trials.”

CRE previously conducted an exploratory evaluation of bryostatin on a compassionate use basis in AD patients who have an inherited form of AD, frequently called familial AD, under an FDA-approved study protocol. Familial AD results from one of four major mutations in the genome, and this mutation is passed on from generation to generation within a family that carries the defective gene. The tragic consequence of familial AD is that it strikes its victims at an early age, often while they are in their twenties. The aggressive progression of familial AD can render these patients in the terminal stages of AD in their late 30s and early 40s.
 
Bryologs
 
On May 12, 2014, we entered into a license agreement (the “Stanford License”) with The Board of Trustees of the Leland Stanford Junior University (“Stanford”) pursuant to which Stanford has granted to us a revenue-bearing, world-wide right and exclusive license, with the right to grant sublicenses (on certain conditions), under three issued U.S. patents and one pending U.S. patent and related technology for the use of bryostatin structural derivatives, known as “bryologs,” for use in the treatment of central nervous system disorders, lysosomal storage diseases, stroke, cardioprotection and traumatic brain injury, collectively referred to as the Licensed Field of Use, for the life of the licensed patents. As mentioned above, in January 2017, we entered into an additional license agreement with Stanford relating to an accelerated synthesis of bryostatin-1.
 
Also as mentioned above, our initial drug candidate, bryostatin, is a natural product isolated from a marine invertebrate organism, a bryozoan called Bugula neritina. However, it takes large quantities of biomass harvested from the oceans to produce even small quantities of bryostatin, and supply is limited.
 
Stanford researchers have synthesized a large family of bryologs over a number of years as part of a research program to define the essential molecular features critical to bryostatin’s biological activity. The bryologs are easier to produce than bryostatin due to their less complex chemical structures. They represent a collection of potential drug candidates, some of which we expect to advance to clinical trials for the treatment of several neurodegenerative diseases such as ischemic stroke, Fragile X Syndrome, traumatic brain injury and AD, although there can be no assurance that we will be successful in doing so.
 
We are required by the Stanford License to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop, manufacture, and sell products (“Licensed Products”) in the Licensed Field of Use (as defined in the Stanford License). In addition, we must meet specific diligence milestones, and upon meeting such milestones, make specified milestone payments to Stanford. We will also pay Stanford royalties on net sales, if any, of Licensed Products (as defined in the Stanford License).
 
Stanford retains the right, on behalf of itself and all other non-profit research institutions, to practice the licensed patents and use the licensed technology for any non-profit purpose, including sponsored research and collaborations. The license is also subject to Title 35, Sections 200-204, of the United States Code, which governs patent rights in inventions made with U.S. government assistance. Among other things, these provisions provide the United States government with nonexclusive rights in the licensed patents. They also impose the obligation that products based on the licensed patents sold or produced in the United States be “manufactured substantially in the United States.”
 
PUFA Analogs
 
Several other drug prototypes termed the PUFA analogs have been synthesized at CRE and evaluated for their PKCε activating properties in models of AD. The PUFA analogs are not structurally related to bryostatin and activate PKCε at a different site. We believe the PUFA analogs represent a potential source for follow-on drug candidates. PKCε activators from the PUFA family of drug prototypes have demonstrated neuroregeneration efficacy roughly equivalent to and, in some cases, potentially superior to that of bryostatin. If the PUFA analogs show adequate potency in preclinical models of AD, we would plan to advance a drug prototype from this chemical family.
 
Other Potential Products
 
We may acquire, by license or otherwise, other development stage products that are consistent with our product portfolio objectives and commercialization strategy.

Discontinued Research

We had planned to develop two other lines of research related to learning and memory disorders: (i) drug prototypes that activate or inhibit the enzyme carbonic anhydrase to modulate the attention status of animals, which may have had applications for attention deficit disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder, and (ii) generalizing the application of a blood-brain-barrier delivery system to a variety of drugs through a contract research service to be offered to other pharmaceutical companies seeking to improve the penetration of their drug prototypes into the brain.
 
We have decided, however, to focus our efforts on neurodegenerative diseases, which are the most advanced programs in our portfolio, and therefore will not be pursuing either the drug candidate for activating carbonic anhydrase or the blood-brain-barrier delivery system.
 
We also relinquished rights to the AD diagnostic system under the terms of the February 2015 SOW (see below).
 
February 2015 SOW and November 2015 SOW
 
Effective November 13, 2013, we agreed to a statement of work with CRE pursuant to which we contracted for the further development of our potential therapeutic product. Pursuant to this statement of work, we paid CRE $251,939 for related personnel and research services. CRE completed the services pursuant to this statement of work in 2014. As of March 12, 2014, we entered into a statement of work with CRE to continue pre-clinical activities relating to the commercialization of our therapeutic product. We paid CRE the entire total pursuant to this statement of work of approximately $465,000 during the year ended December 31, 2014. CRE completed the services pursuant to this statement of work in 2014.
 
On February 4, 2015, we entered into a Statement of Work and Account Satisfaction Agreement with CRE (the “February 2015 SOW”), which was effective as of October 1, 2014 and continued until September 30, 2015.
 
Pursuant to the February 2015 SOW, we agreed, among other things, to pay CRE $20,000 in quarterly payments during the twelve months from the date of the February 2015 SOW in exchange for advising and consulting services by CRE’s Scientific Director (our Chief Scientific Officer Dr. Dan Alkon), regarding our contract with Icahn School of Medicine at Mt. Sinai Hospital for the use of bryostatin in the treatment of Niemann-Pick Type C disease.
 
Under the February 2015 SOW, Neurotrope BioScience also agreed to pay CRE $2,400,000 in service fees and other amounts payable at a rate of $200,000 per month for each month from October 1, 2014 through September 30, 2015. The parties agreed that the first $600,000 of payments satisfy certain outstanding amounts owed to CRE. In consideration for the February 2015 SOW, in addition to the terms described above, CRE also agreed to (a) use commercially reasonable efforts to enroll, at no cost to Neurotrope BioScience, at least four additional compassionate use or expanded access patients, in trials of CRE’s Alzheimer’s therapeutic drug platform during the term of the February 2015 SOW, (b) perform certain services requested by Neurotrope BioScience for the further development of CRE’s Alzheimer’s therapeutic drug platform, (c) perform certain services for the further development of CRE’s Alzheimer’s diagnostic test, (d) to the extent permitted by applicable law, transfer all of its rights and regulatory obligations, except for those relating to the compassionate use expanded access trials, associated with CRE’s IND 71,276 to Neurotrope BioScience, (e) conduct initial research on the application of its PKCε platform to treat Fragile X disease, along with various other terms and conditions, (f) conduct initial research on PUFA derivatives for the purpose of developing a commercially usable PKCε activator and (g) provide assistance, advice and other similar services to us regarding our analysis of bryologs pursuant to our agreement with Stanford University, for the purpose of developing a commercially usable PKCε activator. Furthermore, CRE agreed to transfer a certain amount of bryostatin drug substance and bryostatin kits containing drug substance for non-human use to a third-party for storage. In order for CRE to perform certain of the services described in (c) above, Neurotrope BioScience reimbursed a third party for services CRE received from such third party in the amount of $150,000 in connection with CRE’s former diagnostic trial program with such third party.

Neurotrope Bioscience entered into a new Statement of Work Agreement on November 12, 2015 (the “November 2015 SOW Agreement”). The November 2015 SOW Agreement replaced the February 2015 SOW Agreement, which was effective as of October 1, 2014 and expired on September 30, 2015. Pursuant to the November 2015 SOW Agreement, Neurotrope Bioscience agreed to pay CRE $1,166,666 in service fees payable in the amount of $83,333 per month for each month from November 1, 2015 through December 31, 2016. The payments under the November 2015 SOW Agreement satisfied Neurotrope Bioscience’s obligations to reimburse CRE pursuant to Section 5.6 of the CRE License for any and all attorneys’ fees, translation costs, filing fees, maintenance fees, and other costs and expenses related to applying for, filing, prosecuting, and maintaining patents and applications for the licensed intellectual property incurred by CRE during the term of the November 2015 SOW Agreement (but, for the avoidance of doubt, such payments shall not satisfy any attorneys’ fees, translation costs, filing fees, maintenance fees, or other costs or expenses related to applying for, filing, prosecuting, and maintaining patents and applications for the licensed intellectual property incurred by CRE after the expiration or termination of the November 2015 SOW Agreement term), as well as any litigation costs which CRE may incur related to any of the licensed intellectual property during the November 2015 SOW Agreement term. CRE shall not commence any litigation to enforce the licensed intellectual property without the consent of Neurotrope (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed, or denied).
 
In consideration for the payments made pursuant to the November 2015 SOW Agreement, CRE agreed to perform the services requested by Neurotrope Bioscience for the further development of Neurotrope’s bryostatin drug platform. Thus far, four patients have been treated, three of which were treated under an IND cleared by the FDA. The payments set forth above satisfied any and all of Neurotrope Bioscience’s obligation whatsoever to CRE or to any other third party for costs incurred or to be incurred by CRE relating to such trials. Neurotrope Bioscience and CRE shall jointly review protocols which shall be established to the parties’ mutual satisfaction and contain appropriate safety measures to be employed by the treating physician. No additional compassionate use or expanded access patients will be enrolled by CRE without the consent of Neurotrope Bioscience.
 
Services Agreement
 
On October 9, 2015, Neurotrope BioScience, our wholly-owned subsidiary, executed a Services Agreement with Worldwide Clinical Trials, Inc. (“WCT”), effective as of August 31, 2015. The Services Agreement relates to services for Neurotrope BioScience’s Phase 2 clinical study assessing the safety, tolerability and efficacy of bryostatin in the treatment of moderately severe to severe AD (the “Study”). Pursuant to the terms of the Services Agreement, WCT agreed to provide services to enroll approximately 150 study subjects at approximately 30 sites across the United States. We began enrollment at the initial sites at the end of 2015, completed enrollment in November 2016 and announced top-line results in May 2017 as described in this report.
 
On July 27, 2016, we received approval of the institutional review board (“IRB”) for our amended protocol submitted on July 21, 2016 to the FDA relating to the Phase 2 clinical trial of our lead drug candidate, bryostatin-1, for the treatment of advanced AD, which amended protocol eliminates the second, exploratory, study period following the first 12 weeks of treatment. The primary objective is the assessment of safety and tolerability of bryostatin to occur at 13 weeks, which has not been changed with this amendment. The secondary objective is to assess efficacy, also at week 13. Such amendment, to cut the exploratory part of the study, was made for business reasons in order to provide earlier completion of the study and for the planning of future studies. The changes to the study design were not due to any safety concerns. In the study, two doses of bryostatin, 20 μg or 40 μg, were compared to placebo. Study subjects receive a total of 7 doses of the study drug over 12 weeks of treatment, followed by safety and efficacy assessments at week 13 and a final study visit at week 16. There will be no second randomization for additional treatment. Subjects who have already entered into the second study period will be discontinued and evaluated 30 days following last treatment for their final study visit.
 
Results of Phase 2 Clinical Trial
 
On May 1, 2017, we reported certain relevant top-line results from our Phase 2 exploratory clinical trial based on a preliminary analysis of a limited portion of the complete data set generated. A total of 147 patients were enrolled into the study; 135 patients in the mITT population and 113 in the Completer population. This study was the first repeat dose study of bryostatin-1 in patients with late stage AD (defined as a Mini Mental State Exam 2 (“MMSE-2”) of 4-15), in which two dose levels of bryostatin-1 were compared with placebo to assess safety and preliminary efficacy (p < 0.1, one-tailed) after 12 weeks of treatment. The pre-specified primary endpoint, the Severe Impairment Battery (the “SIB”) (used to evaluate cognition in severe dementia), compared each dose of bryostatin-1 with placebo at Week 13 in two sets of patients: (1) the modified intent-to-treat (the “mITT”) population, consisting of all patients who received study drug and had at least one efficacy/safety evaluation, and (2) the Completer population, consisting of those patients within the mITT population who completed the 13-week dosing protocol and cognitive assessments.

These announced top-line results indicated that the 20 µg dose, administered after two weekly 24 µg doses during the first two weeks and every other week thereafter, met the pre-specified primary endpoint in the Completer population, but not in the mITT population. Among the patients who completed the protocol (n = 113), the patients on the 20 µg dose at 13 weeks showed a mean increase on the SIB of 1.5 vs. a decrease in the placebo group of -1.1 (net improvement of 2.6, p < 0.07), whereas, in the mITT population, the 20 µg group had a mean increase on the SIB of 1.2 vs. a decrease in the placebo group of -0.8 (net improvement of 2.0, p < 0.134). At the pre-specified 5 week secondary endpoint, the Completer patients in the 20 µg group showed a net improvement of 4.0 SIB (p < 016), and the mITT population showed a net improvement of 3.0 (p< ,056).Unlike the 20 µg dose, there was no therapeutic signal observed with the 40 µg dose.
 
The Alzheimer Disease Cooperative Study Activities of Daily Living Inventory Severe Impairment version (ADCS-ADL-SIV) was another pre-specified secondary endpoint. The p values for the comparisons between 20 µg and placebo for the ADCS-ADL endpoint at 13 weeks were 0.082 for the Completers and 0.104, for the mITT population.
 
Together, these initial results after preliminary analysis of this exploratory trial, indicated that bryostatin-1, at the 20 µg dose, caused sustained improvement in important functions that are impaired in patients with moderate to severe Alzheimer’s disease i.e., cognition and the ability to care for oneself. Since most of the patients in this study were already taking donepezil and/or memantine, the efficacy of bryostatin-1 was evaluated in the Top Line results over and above the standard of care therapeutics.
 
The safety profile of bryostatin-1 20 µg was minimally different from the placebo group except for a higher incidence of diarrhea and infusion reactions (11% versus 2% for diarrhea and 17% versus 6% for infusion reactions). Fewer adverse events were reported in patients in the 20 µg group, compared to the 40 µg group. Patients dosed with 20 µg had a dropout rate less than or identical to placebo, while patients dosed at 40 µg experienced poorer safety and tolerability, and had a higher dropout rate. Treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were mostly mild or moderate in severity. TEAEs, including serious adverse events, were more common in the 40 µg group, as compared to the 20 µg and placebo groups. The mean age of patients in the study was 72 years and similar across all three treatment groups.
 
Following presentation of the top line results in July 2017 at the Alzheimer’s Association International Conference in London, a much more extensive analysis of a more complete set of the Phase 2 trial data was conducted.
 
On January 5, 2018, we announced that a post-hoc analysis of a comprehensive data set from our recent Phase 2 trial in patients with advanced Alzheimer’s disease (AD) found evidence of sustained improvement in cognition in patients receiving the 20 μg bryostatin regimen. In addition, patients who did not receive memantine, an approved AD treatment, as background therapy showed greater SIB improvement. These findings suggested that this investigational drug could potentially treat Alzheimer’s disease itself and help reduce and/or reverse the progression of AD, rather than only alleviate its symptoms.
 
The comprehensive follow-on analysis found that patients in the 20 μg treatment arm showed a sustained improvement in cognition over baseline compared to the placebo group at week 15 (30 days after last dose at week 11). These data were observed in the study population as a whole.
 
The follow-on analysis of the data evaluated SIB scores of patients at 15 weeks, 30 days after all dosing had been completed – a pre-specified exploratory endpoint. For the 20 μg group, patients in the mITT population (n=34) showed an overall improvement compared to controls (n=33) of 3.59 (p=0.0503) and in the Completers population (n=34) showed an overall improvement compared to controls (n=33) of 4.09 (p=0.0293). In summary, patients on the 20 μg dose showed a persistent SIB improvement 30 days after all dosing had been completed. These p-values and those below are one-tailed.
 
Additional analyses compared 20 µg dose patients who were on baseline therapy of Aricept vs. patients off Aricept. No significant differences were observed. Another analysis compared the 20 µg dose patients who were on or off baseline therapy of memantine. Post-hoc analysis comparing SIB scores in non-memantine versus memantine patients found the following:

Memantine, an NMDA receptor antagonist, is marketed under the brand names Namenda®, Namenda® XR, and Namzaric® (a combination of memantine and donepezil) for the treatment of dementia in patients with moderate-to-severe AD. It has been shown to delay cognitive decline and help reduce disease symptoms. 
 
Neurotrope is planning a replication trial for the safe, effective 20 μg dose protocol for advanced AD patients not taking memantine as background therapy to evaluate improvements in SIB scores with an increased number of patients. We are in discussions with investigators at leading academic institutions to collaborate on the design and conduct of the next trial, which is expected to begin in the first half of 2018.
 
To the extent resources permit, we intend to pursue development of selected technology platforms with indications – such as Fragile X disease - related to the treatment of AD and other neurodegenerative disorders based on our current licensed technology and / or technologies available from third party licensors or collaborators.
 
Intellectual Property
 
Technology License and Services Agreement
 
On February 4, 2015, Neurotrope BioScience, CRE and NRV II, LLC entered into an Amended and Restated Technology License and Services Agreement (the “CRE License”), which further amended and restated the Technology License and Services Agreement dated as of October 31, 2012, as amended by Amendment No. 1 dated as of August 21, 2013.
 
Pursuant to the CRE License, Neurotrope BioScience maintained its exclusive (except as described below), non-transferable (except pursuant to the CRE License’s assignment provision), world-wide, royalty-bearing right, with a right to sublicense (in accordance with the terms and conditions described below), under CRE’s and NRV II’s respective right, title and interest in and to certain patents and technology owned by CRE or licensed to NRV II, LLC by CRE as of or subsequent to October 31, 2012 to develop, use, manufacture, market, offer for sale, sell, distribute, import and export certain products or services for therapeutic applications for AD and other cognitive dysfunctions in humans or animals (the “Field of Use”). Additionally, the CRE License specifies that all patents that issue from a certain patent application, shall constitute licensed patents and all trade secrets, know-how and other confidential information claimed by such patents constitute licensed technology under the CRE License. Furthermore, on July 10, 2015, under the terms of the Statement of Work and Account Satisfaction Agreement dated February 4, 2015, Neurotrope BioScience’s rights relating to an in vitro diagnostic test system reverted back to CRE and, accordingly, Neurotrope BioScience no longer has any rights under the CRE License for diagnostic applications using the CRE patent portfolio or technology.
 
Notwithstanding the above license terms, CRE and its affiliates retain rights to use the licensed intellectual property in the Field of Use to engage in research and development and other non-commercial activities and to provide services to Neurotrope BioScience or to perform other activities in connection with the CRE License.
 
Under the CRE License, CRE and Neurotrope BioScience may not enter into sublicense agreements with third parties except with CRE’s prior written consent, which consent shall not be commercially unreasonably withheld. Furthermore, the CRE License dated February 4, 2015 revises the agreement that was entered into as of October 31, 2012 and amended on August 21, 2013, in that it provides that any intellectual property developed, conceived or created in connection with a sublicense agreement that Neurotrope BioScience entered into with a third party pursuant to the terms of the CRE License will be licensed to CRE and its affiliates for any and all non-commercial purposes, on a worldwide, perpetual, non-exclusive, irrevocable, non-terminable, fully paid-up, royalty-free, transferable basis, with the right to freely sublicense such intellectual property. Previously, the agreement had provided that such intellectual property would be assigned to CRE.

Pursuant to the terms of the November 12, 2015 amendment to the CRE License, we paid an aggregate of approximately $348,000 to CRE following the closings of the Series B private placement, which constituted an advance royalty payment to CRE and will be offset (with no interest) against the amount of future royalty obligations payable until such time that the amount of such future royalty obligations equals in full the amount of the advance royalty payments made. Neurotrope Bioscience shall be subtracted from the gross proceeds to determine the “Post-PA Fee Proceeds.”
 
Under the CRE License, CRE and Neurotrope BioScience will jointly own data, reports and information that is generated on or after February 28, 2013, pursuant to the license agreement dated October 31, 2012 and amended on August 21, 2013, by Neurotrope BioScience, on behalf of Neurotrope BioScience by a third party or by CRE pursuant to a statement of work that the parties enter into pursuant to the CRE License, in each case to the extent not constituting or containing any data, reports or information generated prior to such date or by CRE not pursuant to a statement of work (the “Jointly Owned Data”). CRE has agreed not to use the Jointly Owned Data inside or outside the Field of Use for any commercial purpose during the term of the CRE License or following any expiration of the CRE License other than an expiration that is the result of a breach by Neurotrope BioScience of the CRE License that caused any licensed patent to expire, become abandoned or be declared unenforceable or invalid or caused any licensed technology to enter the public domain (a “Natural Expiration”) provided, however, CRE may use the Jointly Owned Data inside or outside the Field of Use for any commercial purpose following any termination of the CRE License. Also, CRE granted Neurotrope BioScience a license during the term and following any Natural Expiration, to use certain CRE data in the Field of Use for any commercial purposes falling within the scope of the license granted to Neurotrope BioScience under the CRE License.
 
The CRE License further requires us to pay CRE (i) a fixed research fee equal to a pro rata amount of $1 million in the year during which we close on a Series B Preferred Stock financing resulting in proceeds of at least $25 million, (ii) a fixed research fee of $1 million per year for each of the five calendar years following the completion of such financing and (iii) an annual fixed research fee in an amount to be negotiated and agreed upon no later than 90 days prior to the end of the fifth calendar year following the completion of such financing to be paid with respect to each remaining calendar year during the term of the CRE License. This fixed research fee is not yet due.
 
Our Licensed Intellectual Property
 
We have licensed from CRE an extensive intellectual property portfolio that includes issued patents, pending patent applications and provisional patent applications, in the U.S. and elsewhere, which, we believe, together cover these key pharmaceutical markets. A method of use patent has been issued to CRE that covers the use of the PUFA family of molecules for the same therapeutic applications.
 
We believe the CRE License provides us rights to the patents and technologies required to develop our proposed products. The patents and technologies licensed to us pursuant to the CRE License include, without limitation, the following:
 

· | therapies based on bryostatin and PUFA chemical families; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------


· | methods for treating AD.
--+-------------------------

 
A number of CRE’s patent applications for treatment of neurological disorders have been under active prosecution for many years and have been the subject of multiple rejections for anticipation and/or obviousness based on prior art. There are no guarantees that CRE’s pending patent applications will issue into commercially meaningful patents. If these patent applications are not approved or successfully prosecuted, then we will attempt to seek other means of protecting its proprietary position including, but not limited to, trade secrets, proprietary formulations and methods, etc.

A substantial amount of in-human data exists that was generated by the NCI that involves the earlier evaluation of bryostatin as an anticancer agent. The NCI also holds the existing inventory of the bryostatin drug product which is suitable for use in man. Our use of the substantial data package generated by the NCI on bryostatin, as well as access to the clinical supply of this substance, is permitted under a material transfer agreements entered into and between the NCI and CRE.
 
There are no known patent conflicts or freedom to operate issues at this time which could encumber our ability to commercialize the PKCε activators for the treatment of cognition and memory disorders. However, we cannot provide any assurance that such conflicts will not arise in the future. See the Risk Factors captioned “Our commercial success will depend, in part, on our ability, and the ability of our licensors, to obtain and maintain patent protection. Our licensors’ failure to obtain and maintain patent protection for our products may have a material adverse effect on our business.” and “Our licensed patented technologies may infringe on other patents, which may expose us to costly litigation.” under “Risk Factors.”
 
We also have the right to re-license certain patents and patent applications in certain jurisdictions that we had licensed under the CRE License but had previously elected to relinquish. In the event that we decide to re-license any of such patents and/or patent applications, then we are required to reimburse CRE for all of the attorneys’ fees, translation costs, filing fees, maintenance fees, and other costs and expenses related to such patents and/or patent applications that have been incurred since we elected to relinquish them under the CRE License.
Additional Intellectual Property
 
We have a granted U.S. Patent (US 9,724,328 B2) directed to treating lipid storage disorders (e.g., Niemann-Pick Type C disease) with naturally occurring bryostatins and analogs thereof, i.e., “bryologs.” This patent will expire no earlier than April 14, 2035. Foreign counterpart applications of this granted patent are pending in Canada, China, Europe, Hong Kong, Israel, Japan, Mexico, and Korea. Each of these applications, if granted as a patent, would also expire no earlier than April 14, 2035.
 
We also have an international application (PCT/US17/31144) directed to activating a synaptic growth factor in a patient suffering from Rett Syndrome with a PKC activator (e.g., bryostatins, bryologs, PUFA, and others), wherein the activation results in a corrective and/or normalizing effect on brain development and an increase in the protein levels of synaptic growth factors. National phase entry applications filed from this international application, if granted as a patent, would expire no earlier than May 4, 2037.
 
Governmental Regulation and Product Approval 
 
The manufacturing and marketing of our potential products and our ongoing research and development activities are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA and comparable regulatory agencies in state and local jurisdictions and in foreign countries.
United States Regulation of Drugs
 
In the United States, the FDA approves and regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and implementing regulations. Before any drug product can be marketed in the United States, it must receive approval from the FDA. To receive this approval, any drug we develop must undergo rigorous preclinical testing and clinical trials that demonstrate the product candidate’s safety and effectiveness for each indicated use. This extensive regulatory process controls, among other things, the development, testing, manufacture, safety, efficacy, record keeping, labeling, storage, approval, advertising, promotion, sale, and distribution of pharmaceutical products. The failure to comply with requirements under the FDCA and other applicable laws at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval may subject an applicant and/or sponsor to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, including refusal by the FDA to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, imposition of a clinical hold, issuance of warning letters and other types of letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement of profits or civil or criminal investigations and penalties brought by the FDA and the Department of Justice or other governmental entities.

In general, before any new pharmaceutical product can be marketed in the United States, the process typically required by the FDA includes:
 

· | preclinical laboratory and animal tests in compliance with the FDA’s good laboratory practice, or GLP, regulations;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | submission of an IND, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | approval by an independent institutional review board, or IRB, representing each clinical site before each clinical trial may be initiated;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug for its intended use, conducted in accordance with good clinical practices, or GCP;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | satisfactory completion of one or more FDA inspections of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the product, or components thereof, are produced to assess compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMP, requirements and to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the product’s identity, strength, quality and purity;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | preparation and submission to the FDA of a new drug application, or NDA, requesting marketing for one or more proposed indications;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | review by an FDA advisory committee, where appropriate or if applicable;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Payment of user fees and securing FDA approval of an NDA or an NDA supplement (for subsequent indications or other modifications, including a change in location of the manufacturing facility); and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | compliance with any post-approval requirements, including the potential requirement to implement a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, and the potential requirement to conduct post-approval studies.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Preclinical Testing
 
In the United States, drug candidates are tested in animals until adequate proof of safety and efficacy is established. These preclinical studies generally evaluate the mechanism of action and pharmacology of the product and assess the potential safety and efficacy of the product. Tested compounds must be produced according to applicable current good manufacturing practice requirements and preclinical safety tests must be conducted in compliance with FDA and international regulations regarding good laboratory practices. The results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information and analytical data, are generally submitted to the FDA as part of an IND, which must become effective before human clinical trials may commence. The IND will automatically become effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless before that time the FDA requests an extension or raises concerns about the conduct of the clinical trials as outlined in the application. If the FDA has any concerns, the sponsor of the IND and the FDA must resolve the concerns before clinical trials can begin. Regulatory authorities may require additional preclinical data before allowing the clinical studies to commence or proceed from one phase to another, and could demand that the studies be discontinued or suspended at any time if there are significant safety issues. Some long-term preclinical testing, such as animal tests of reproductive adverse events and carcinogenicity, may continue after the IND is submitted.
 
Furthermore, an independent institutional review board for each medical center proposing to participate in the conduct of the clinical trial must review and approve the clinical protocol and patient informed consent form before commencement of the study at the respective medical center. An IRB must operate in compliance with FDA regulations.

Clinical Trials
 
Human clinical trials are typically conducted in four sequential phases, which may overlap or be combined:
 

· | Phase 1. The drug is initially introduced into healthy human subjects or, in certain indications such as cancer, patients with the target disease or condition and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution, excretion and, if possible, to gain an early indication of its effectiveness and to determine optimal dosage.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Phase 2. The drug is administered to a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to evaluate preliminarily the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Phase 3. The drug is administered to an expanded patient population, generally at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites, in well-controlled clinical trials to generate enough data to evaluate statistically the efficacy and safety of the product for approval, to establish the overall risk-benefit profile of the product and to provide adequate information for the labeling of the product.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Phase 4. Post-approval studies may be conducted after initial marketing approval. These studies are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
During all clinical trials, physicians will monitor patients to determine effectiveness of the drug candidate and to observe and report any reactions or safety risks that may result from use of the drug candidate. The FDA, the trial sites institutional review board or the sponsor may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk.
 
Information about certain clinical trials must be submitted within specific timeframes to the National Institutes of Health for public dissemination on their ClinicalTrials.gov website.
 
Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and more frequently if serious adverse events occur. In addition, IND safety reports must be submitted to the FDA for any of the following: serious and unexpected suspected adverse reactions; findings from other studies or animal or in vitro testing that suggest a significant risk in humans exposed to the drug; and any clinically important increase in the case of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure. The FDA, the sponsor or the data monitoring committee may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution, or an institution it represents, if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the drug has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients. The FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP and the integrity of the clinical data submitted.
 
Review of the NDA by FDA
 
The data from the clinical trials, together with preclinical data and other supporting information that establishes a drug candidate’s profile, are submitted to the FDA in the form of an NDA or NDA supplement (for approval of a new indication if the product candidate is already approved for another indication). Under federal law, the submission of most NDAs is additionally subject to an application user fee, currently exceeding $2.3 million, and the sponsor of an approved NDA is subject to annual product and establishment user fees, currently exceeding $114,000 per product and $585,000 per establishment. These fees typically increase annually. Certain exceptions and waivers are available for some of these fees, such as an exception from the application fee for drugs with orphan designation and a waiver for certain small businesses.

Under applicable laws and FDA regulations, each NDA submitted for FDA approval is usually given an internal administrative review within 45 to 60 days following submission of the NDA. If deemed complete, the FDA will “file” the NDA, thereby triggering substantive review of the application. The FDA can refuse to file any NDA that it deems incomplete or not properly reviewable. The FDA has established internal substantive review goals of six months for priority NDAs (for drugs addressing serious or life threatening conditions for which there is an unmet medical need) and ten months for regular NDAs. The FDA, however, is not legally required to complete its review within these periods, and these performance goals may change over time. Moreover, the outcome of the review, even if generally favorable, is not typically an actual approval, but an “action letter” that describes additional work that must be done before the NDA can be approved. The FDA’s review of an NDA may involve review and recommendations by an independent FDA advisory committee. The FDA may deny approval of an NDA or an NDA supplement if the applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied, or it may require additional clinical data and/or an additional pivotal phase 3 clinical trial. Even if such data are submitted, the FDA may ultimately decide that the NDA or NDA supplement does not satisfy the criteria for approval.
 
Before approving an NDA, the FDA typically will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is or will be manufactured. These pre-approval inspections may cover all facilities associated with an NDA submission, including drug component manufacturing (e.g., active pharmaceutical ingredients), finished drug product manufacturing and control testing laboratories. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities comply with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving an NDA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP.
 
In addition, as a condition of approval, the FDA may require an applicant to develop a REMS. REMS use risk minimization strategies beyond the professional labeling to ensure that the benefits of the product outweigh the potential risks. To determine whether a REMS is needed, the FDA will consider the size of the population likely to use the product, seriousness of the disease, expected benefit of the product, expected duration of treatment, seriousness of known or potential adverse events and whether the product is a new molecular entity. REMS can include medication guides, physician communication plans for healthcare professionals and elements to assure safe use, or ETASU. ETASU may include, but are not limited to, special training or certification for prescribing or dispensing, dispensing only under certain circumstances, special monitoring and using of patient registries. The FDA may require a REMS before approval or post-approval if it becomes aware of a serious risk associated with use of the product. The requirement for a REMS can materially affect the potential market and profitability of a product.
 
The FDA is required to refer an application for a novel drug to an advisory committee or explain why such referral was not made. Typically, an advisory committee is a panel of independent experts, including clinicians and other scientific experts, that reviews, evaluates and provides a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions.
 
Data Review and Approval
 
Substantial financial resources are necessary to fund the research, clinical trials and related activities necessary to satisfy FDA requirements or similar requirements of state, local and foreign regulatory agencies. It normally takes many years to satisfy these various regulatory requirements, assuming they are satisfied. Information generated in this process is susceptible to varying interpretations that could delay, limit, or prevent regulatory approval at any stage of the process. Accordingly, the actual time and expense required to bring a product to market may vary substantially. We cannot assure you that we will submit applications for required authorizations to manufacture and/or market potential products or that any such application will be reviewed and approved by the appropriate regulatory authorities in a timely manner, if at all. Data obtained from clinical activities is not always conclusive and may be susceptible to varying interpretations, which could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval. Success in early stage clinical trials does not ensure success in later stage clinical trials. Even if a product candidate receives regulatory approval, the approval may be significantly limited to specific disease states, patient populations and dosages, or have conditions placed on them that restrict the commercial applications, advertising, promotion or distribution of these products. 
Orphan Drug Designation and Exclusivity
 
Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan drug designation to drugs intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an NDA. After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process. If a product that has orphan drug designation subsequently receives FDA approval for the disease for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan product exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug for the same disease, except in very limited circumstances, for seven years. These very limited circumstances are (i) an inability to supply the drug in sufficient quantities or (ii) a situation in which a new formulation of the drug has shown superior safety or efficacy. This exclusivity, however, also could block the approval of our product for seven years if a competitor obtains earlier approval of the same drug for the same indication.

Fast Track, Breakthrough Therapy and Priority Review Designations 
 
The FDA is authorized to designate certain products for expedited review if the product is intended to address an unmet medical need in the treatment of a serious or life-threatening disease or condition. These programs are fast track designation, breakthrough therapy designation and priority review designation.
 Specifically, the FDA may designate a product for fast track review if the product is intended, whether alone or in combination with one or more other products, for the treatment of a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, and it demonstrates the potential to address unmet medical needs for such a disease or condition. For fast track products, sponsors may have greater interactions with the FDA and the FDA may initiate review of sections of a fast track product’s application before the application is complete. This rolling review may be available if the FDA determines, after preliminary evaluation of clinical data submitted by the sponsor, that a fast track product may be effective. The sponsor must also provide, and the FDA must approve, a schedule for the submission of the remaining information and the sponsor must pay applicable user fees. However, the FDA’s time period goal for reviewing a fast track application does not begin until the last section of the application is submitted. In addition, the FDA may withdraw the fast track designation if the FDA believes that the designation is no longer supported by data emerging in the clinical trial process.
 
Second, in 2012, Congress enacted the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act, or FDASIA. This law established a new regulatory scheme allowing for expedited review of products designated as “breakthrough therapies.” A product may be designated as a breakthrough therapy if it is intended, either alone or in combination with one or more other products, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. The FDA may take certain actions with respect to breakthrough therapies, including holding meetings with the sponsor throughout the development process; providing timely advice to the product sponsor regarding development and approval; involving more senior staff in the review process; assigning a cross-disciplinary project lead for the review team; and taking other steps to design the clinical trials in an efficient manner.
 
Third, the FDA may designate a product for priority review if it is a product designed to treat a serious condition and, if approved, would provide a significant improvement in safety or effectiveness. The FDA determines, on a case-by-case basis, whether the proposed product represents a significant improvement when compared with other available therapies. Significant improvement may be illustrated by evidence of increased effectiveness in the treatment of a condition, elimination or substantial reduction of a treatment-limiting product reaction, documented enhancement of patient compliance that may lead to improvement in serious outcomes and evidence of safety and effectiveness in a new subpopulation. A priority review designation is intended to direct overall attention and resources to the evaluation of such applications, and to shorten the FDA’s goal for taking action on a marketing application from ten months to six months.
 
Accelerated Approval Pathway 
 
The FDA may grant accelerated approval to a product for a serious or life-threatening condition that provides meaningful therapeutic advantage to patients over existing treatments based upon a determination that the product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit. The FDA may also grant accelerated approval for such a condition when the product has an effect on an intermediate clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality, or IMM, and that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. Products granted accelerated approval must meet the same statutory standards for safety and effectiveness as those granted traditional approval.

24
--

 

For the purposes of accelerated approval, a surrogate endpoint is a marker, such as a laboratory measurement, radiographic image, physical sign or other measure that is thought to predict clinical benefit, but is not itself a measure of clinical benefit. Surrogate endpoints can often be measured more easily or more rapidly than clinical endpoints. An intermediate clinical endpoint is a measurement of a therapeutic effect that is considered reasonably likely to predict the clinical benefit of a product, such as an effect on IMM. The FDA has limited experience with accelerated approvals based on intermediate clinical endpoints, but has indicated that such endpoints generally may support accelerated approval where the therapeutic effect measured by the endpoint is not itself a clinical benefit and basis for traditional approval, if there is a basis for concluding that the therapeutic effect is reasonably likely to predict the ultimate clinical benefit of a product.
 
The accelerated approval pathway is most often used in settings in which the course of a disease is long and an extended period of time is required to measure the intended clinical benefit of a product, even if the effect on the surrogate or intermediate clinical endpoint occurs rapidly. Thus, accelerated approval has been used extensively in the development and approval of products for treatment of a variety of cancers in which the goal of therapy is generally to improve survival or decrease morbidity and the duration of the typical disease course requires lengthy and sometimes large trials to demonstrate a clinical or survival benefit.
 
The accelerated approval pathway is usually contingent on a sponsor’s agreement to conduct, in a diligent manner, additional post-approval confirmatory studies to verify and describe the product’s clinical benefit. As a result, a product candidate approved on this basis is subject to rigorous post-marketing compliance requirements, including the completion of Phase 4 or post-approval clinical trials to confirm the effect on the clinical endpoint. Failure to conduct required post-approval studies, or confirm a clinical benefit during post-marketing studies, would allow the FDA to withdraw the product from the market on an expedited basis. All promotional materials for product candidates approved under accelerated regulations are subject to prior review by the FDA.
 
The FDA’s Decision on an NDA 
 
Based on the FDA’s evaluation of an NDA and accompanying information, including the results of the inspection of the manufacturing facilities, the FDA may issue an approval letter or a complete response letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the product with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A complete response letter generally outlines the deficiencies in the submission and may require substantial additional testing or information in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. If and when those deficiencies have been addressed to the FDA’s satisfaction in a resubmission of an NDA, the FDA will issue an approval letter. The FDA has committed to reviewing such resubmissions in two or six months depending on the type of information included. Even with submission of this additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval.
 
If the FDA approves a product, it may limit the approved indications for use for the product, require that contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling, require that post-approval studies, including Phase 4 clinical trials, be conducted to further assess the drug’s safety after approval, require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the product after commercialization, or impose other conditions, including distribution restrictions or other risk management mechanisms, including REMS, which can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the product. The FDA may prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of post-market studies or surveillance programs. After approval, many types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes and additional labeling claims, are subject to further testing requirements and FDA review and approval.
 
Post-Approval Requirements 
 
Drugs manufactured or distributed pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to recordkeeping, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, advertising and promotion and reporting of adverse experiences with the product. After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims, are subject to prior FDA review and approval. There also are continuing, annual user fee requirements for any marketed products and the establishments at which such products are manufactured, as well as new application fees for supplemental applications with clinical data.
 

25
--

 

In addition, drug manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are required to register their establishments with the FDA and state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and these state agencies for compliance with cGMP requirements. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated and often require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon the sponsor and any third-party manufacturers that the sponsor may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance.
 
Once an approval is granted, the FDA may withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market studies or clinical trials to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things:
 

· | restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, suspension of the approval, or complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | fines, warning letters or holds on post-approval clinical trials;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------


· | refusal of the FDA to approve pending NDAs or supplements to approved NDAs;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; or
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties
--+-------------------------------------------------------------

 
The FDA strictly regulates marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of products that are placed on the market. Drugs may be promoted only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability.
 
In addition, the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical products is subject to the Prescription Drug Marketing Act, or PDMA, and its implementing regulations, as well as the Drug Supply Chain Security Act, or DSCA, which regulate the distribution and tracing of prescription drugs and prescription drug samples at the federal level, and set minimum standards for the regulation of drug distributors by the states. The PDMA, its implementing regulations and state laws limit the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical product samples, and the DSCA imposes requirements to ensure accountability in distribution and to identify and remove counterfeit and other illegitimate products from the market.
 
Patent Term Restoration and Extension 
 
A patent claiming a new drug product may be eligible for a limited patent term extension, also known as patent term restoration, under the Hatch-Waxman Act, which permits a patent restoration of up to five years for patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review. Patent term extension is generally available only for drug products whose active ingredient has not previously been approved by the FDA. The restoration period granted is typically one-half the time between the effective date of an IND and the submission date of an NDA, plus the time between the submission date of an NDA and the ultimate approval date. Patent term extension cannot be used to extend the remaining term of a patent past a total of 14 years from the product’s approval date. Only one patent applicable to an approved drug product is eligible for the extension, and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent in question. A patent that covers multiple drugs for which approval is sought can only be extended in connection with one of the approvals. The United States PTO reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension in consultation with the FDA.

Foreign Regulation
 
In addition to regulations in the United States, we will be subject to a variety of foreign regulations governing clinical trials and commercial sales and distribution of our products in foreign countries. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we must obtain approval of a product by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries before we can commence clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries. The approval process varies from country to country, and the time may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval. The requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary greatly from country to country.
 
Under European Union regulatory systems, we may submit marketing authorization applications either under a centralized or decentralized procedure. The centralized procedure, which is available for medicines produced by biotechnology or which are highly innovative, provides for the grant of a single marketing authorization that is valid for all EU member states. This authorization is a marketing authorization application. The decentralized procedure provides for mutual recognition of national approval decisions. Under this procedure, the holder of a national marketing authorization may submit an application to the remaining member states. Within 90 days of receiving the applications and assessment report, each member state must decide whether to recognize approval. This procedure is referred to as the mutual recognition procedure.
 
The policies of the FDA and foreign regulatory authorities may change and additional government regulations may be enacted which could prevent or delay regulatory approval of our products and could also increase the cost of regulatory compliance. We cannot predict the likelihood, nature or extent of adverse governmental regulation that might arise from future legislative or administrative action, either in the United States or abroad.
 
Other Government Regulation
 
Our research and development activities use biological and hazardous materials that are dangerous to human health and safety or the environment. We are subject to a variety of federal, state and local laws and regulations governing the use, generation, manufacture, storage, handling and disposal of these materials and wastes resulting from these materials. We are also subject to regulation by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration and federal and state environmental protection agencies and to regulation under the Toxic Substances Control Act.
 
In addition, once our products are marketed commercially, we will have to comply with the various laws relating to the Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs. These federal laws include, by way of example, the following:

Sanctions for violating these federal laws include criminal and civil penalties that range from punitive sanctions, damage assessments, money penalties, imprisonment, denial of Medicare and Medicaid payments, or exclusion from the Medicare and Medicaid programs, or both. These laws also impose an affirmative duty on those receiving Medicare or Medicaid funding to ensure that they do not employ or contract with persons excluded from the Medicare and other government programs. Additionally, many states have laws and regulations that contain prohibitions that are similar to, and in many cases broader than, these federal laws and once our products are marketed commercially, we will have to comply with these various state laws as well.
 
Some state laws require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government in addition to requiring drug manufacturers to report information related to payments to physicians and other health care providers or marketing expenditures. State and foreign laws also govern the privacy and security of health information in some circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts.
 
Competition
 
We compete with many companies, research institutes, hospitals, governments and universities that are working to develop products and processes to treat AD. Many of these entities have substantially greater financial, technical, manufacturing, marketing, distribution and other resources than we do. However, there has been a dearth of new product introductions in the last 20 years for the treatment of AD symptoms in patients who begin exhibiting the memory and cognitive disorders associated with the disease. All of the products introduced to date for the treatment of AD have yielded negative or marginal results with little effect on the progression of AD and no improvement in the memory or cognitive performance of the patients receiving these therapies. We believe we are the only company currently pursuing PKCε activation (with consequent prevention of neuronal death and induction synaptic network growth) as a mechanism to treat AD and neurodegenerative disease. Although we believe that we have no direct competitors working in this same field at the present time, we cannot provide assurance that our competitors will not discover compounds or processes that may be competitive with our products and introduce such products or processes before us.
