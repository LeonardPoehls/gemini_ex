Overview
Black Box Corporation ("Black Box," "we," the "Company," "our" or "us"), founded in 1976, is a leading digital solutions provider dedicated to helping customers design, build, manage, and secure their IT infrastructure. Offerings under our services platform ("Services") include unified communications, data infrastructure and managed services. Offerings under our products platform ("Products") include IT infrastructure, specialty networking, multimedia and keyboard/video/mouse ("KVM") switching. We employed 3,488 and 3,631 employees as of March 31, 2017 and March 31, 2016, respectively.
We participate in the worldwide communications, network infrastructure and managed services markets. The offerings of our Services platform are distributed to these markets primarily through value-added resellers, manufacturers, large system integrators and other technical services companies. The offerings of our Products platform are sold by manufacturers and integrators and are distributed through value-added resellers, direct marketing manufacturers, mass merchandisers, web retailers and others. We believe that we compete well in our markets on the basis of our solution features, technical capabilities, service levels and price. 
We conduct business globally and manage our business on a geographic-service type basis consisting of four operating segments which are (i) North America Products, (ii) North America Services, (iii) International Products and (iv) International Services. Revenues within our North America segments are primarily attributed to the United States while revenues within our International segments are attributed to countries in Europe, the Pacific Rim and Latin America. For revenues and other information (including large customers) regarding these reporting segments, see Note 15 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. For information regarding backlog, see Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
Services and Products Platforms
We have built robust operating platforms that allow us to identify customer needs and then design, source, implement and support the appropriate solutions. Our two platforms for serving customers and generating growth are as follows:
Services Platform
Services is comprised of engineering and design, project management, field service management, network operations centers, our national technology team, national and international sales teams and technology solutions centers which include dedicated sales and engineering resources. The primary services offered through this platform include managed services, infrastructure services (including wired and wireless network solutions, structured cabling and video/AV services), communications lifecycle services, unified communications and data center services.
The Company generates revenues in its Services business from the design, sale and/or installation of new communications and network infrastructure systems, the support of existing systems and moves, adds and changes ("MAC work"). We periodically generate revenues from contracts performed over time that may result in an asset on our balance sheet for multiple periods constituting part of our working capital. We have not experienced significant collectability issues related to such contracts. For the sale and implementation of new communications systems or other major projects, most significant orders are subject to competitive bidding processes and, generally, competition can be significant for such new orders. The Company is continually bidding on new projects for service revenues. Projects account for the majority of Services revenues and are primarily driven by the overall economic environment and information technology capital spending. The Company also serves government clients whose revenues are not as dependent on the overall economic environment as commercial clients but are subject to governmental budgetary constraints.
The Company routinely competes against original equipment manufacturers, large system integrators and local or regional manufacturer-specific channel partners in the Services markets for enterprise clients. The Company believes that it favorably differentiates against this competition through its technology-independent approach which draws the appropriate product from our portfolio of different partner solutions, broad geographic footprint and deep industry and technical expertise. Through its network of operational centers and network operations centers, the Company can provide clients with both on-site and remote services.

Products Platform
Under Products, we provide networking solutions through the sale of products for KVM switching, IT infrastructure, specialty networking and multimedia. 
Our Products' revenues are generated from sales to key channel partners and system integrators and through a global distribution network. Products sells through a direct sales team as well as through its internet site and catalogs. In order to meet client demand, we keep a moderate level of inventory which consumes part of our working capital. The market for these products is a highly fragmented and competitive. The Company has participated in this market for 40+ years and has earned a reputation for providing high quality products, rapid order fulfillment and free 24/7/365 technical support. The Company's Products revenue is driven both by general information technology spending and capital budgets.
In order to procure our products, we utilize a network of original equipment manufacturers ("OEMs") and suppliers throughout the world. Each supplier is monitored for quality, delivery performance and cost through a well-established certification program. This network has manufacturing and engineering capabilities to customize products for specialized applications. Black Box operates its own manufacturing and assembly operation at its Lawrence, Pennsylvania location. The Company chooses to manufacture certain products in-house when outside sourcing is not economical. Sourcing decisions of in-house versus third-party suppliers are based upon a balance of quality, performance, delivery and cost factors.
Key Differentiators
Our platforms introduce scale, flexibility and leverage to the business, and provide the following competitive advantages:
A diversified client base: We have built a diversified client base that ranges from small organizations to many of the world's largest corporations and institutions. Black Box clients participate in many industries, including government, healthcare, business services, manufacturing, retail, technology and banking, among others. Revenues from our clients are segmented with 60% from large companies (i.e., revenues greater than $1 billion, including federal governments), 20% from medium-sized companies (i.e., revenues between $50 million and $1 billion, including state governments) and 20% from small companies (i.e., revenues less than $50 million, including local governments). We strive to develop extensive and long-term relationships with high-quality clients as we believe that satisfied clients will demand quality services and product offerings even in economic downturns. Also, we believe that our distinctive portfolio of products and services will allow us to leverage the relationship and introduce additional offerings to satisfied clients.
Key relationships with leading technology partners: We have built long-term relationships with all major communications equipment manufacturers and we are a top partner with the market leaders.
Broad geographic footprint: We have built a global footprint with offices throughout the world.
