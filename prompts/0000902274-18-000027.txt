Item 1. Business
General
Libbey Inc. (Libbey or the Company) is a global leader in the design, production and sale of tableware and other products. We manufacture glass tableware and related products at our two plants in the United States as well as our plants located in Mexico (Libbey Mexico), the Netherlands (Libbey Holland), Portugal (Libbey Portugal) and China (Libbey China). We believe that our glass tableware manufacturing, distribution and service network is the largest in the Western Hemisphere and is among the largest in the world. We also source glass tableware, ceramic dinnerware, metal flatware, hollowware and serveware products globally. We sell our products in more than 100 countries across the globe. Our extensive line of tabletop and other products are sold globally under the Libbey®, Libbey Signature®, Master's Reserve®, World® Tableware, Syracuse® China, Crisa®, Royal Leerdam®, Crisal Glass® and other brand names primarily in the foodservice, retail and business-to-business channels. See note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for segment and geographic information.
Libbey was originally founded as the New England Glass Company in 1818. Operations were moved to Toledo, Ohio in 1888, and the Company was incorporated in Delaware in 1987. Our rich heritage now spans 200 years.

Strategic Initiatives
Our strategy is focused on the following three key areas that we believe are critical to achieving sustainable, profitable growth across all our market segments: 

• | Profitable growth with innovative new products and world class e-commerce capabilities;


• | Operational Excellence through improved utilization of our global network, extending asset life and continuous improvement; and


• | Organizational Excellence that develops our talent and culture to the level required to create sustainable value.

In order to improve our capabilities to drive growth through innovation, we have augmented our marketing organization to drive enhanced market insight and established improved new product development capabilities.
In the U.S. and Canada we believe we have competitive advantages, including leading market share and best-in-class service in the foodservice channel. We expect to extend these advantages by enhancing customer focus and introducing differentiated new products as we seek to increase our share in existing product categories, such as ceramicware and metalware, and to extend our presence to an even broader range of foodservice venues than we have served historically. We are also an established foodservice supplier in the regions of Latin America; Europe, the Middle East and Africa (EMEA); and Asia Pacific. We expect all of these areas to benefit from our enhanced customer focus, new products and adjacencies tailored to increase share.
3

We made significant investments in 2017 to establish new capabilities to support e-commerce in our retail channel in the U.S. In 2018, we will continue to build on these capabilities to better support our customers as we expand these efforts to other channels and geographic regions. In addition, we are beginning to upgrade our internal processes and systems infrastructure to simplify business processes and improve capabilities across many functional areas.
In 2017, we made good progress in consolidating our manufacturing footprint in Europe by reducing the number of furnaces in our Libbey Holland production facility, which enabled us to sell more selectively and improve margins. As a glass manufacturer, we have a capital-intensive business, with our investments in our furnaces being long-term in nature. Over time we will continue to seek opportunities to optimize our manufacturing footprint globally in order to serve profitable sectors of our markets. We intend to continue to invest in technologies that can extend the useful lives of some assets to deliver improved overall returns.
We are on a mission to become more market-driven as we seek to become one of the most innovative tabletop companies. In 2018, we intend to create momentum executing on our growth and operational and organizational excellence strategies.
Products
Our products include glassware products that we produce at our six manufacturing facilities globally, as well as glass tableware, ceramicware, metalware and other tabletop products that we source globally. Glass tableware products include products such as tumblers, stemware, mugs, bowls, vases, salt and pepper shakers, shot glasses, canisters, candleholders and other items. Other glass products include storageware, serveware, bakeware, handmade glass tableware and components sold to original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), such as blender jars and mixing bowls. We also offer a wide range of ceramic dinnerware products. These include plates, bowls, platters, cups, saucers and other tabletop accessories. In addition, we offer an extensive selection of metal flatware, including knives, forks, spoons and serving utensils, and metal hollowware, which includes such items as serving trays, pitchers and other metal tabletop accessories.
In recent years, we have invested in proprietary ClearFire® technology at our Shreveport, Louisiana, facility to manufacture premium glass tableware suitable for fine dining, household and consumer use. We sell these products in the foodservice channel under the Master's Reserve® brand and in retail under the Libbey Signature® brand.
We have developed a complete premium tabletop offering called the Artistry Collection™ that is targeted to serve fine dining establishments and event venues in the foodservice channel. It combines our Master's Reserve® brand glassware with other leading brands of fine tabletop products sourced through the following exclusive distribution agreements:

• | Spiegelau and Nachtmann glassware and serveware products in the U.S. foodservice channel. Spiegelau is known for its fine stemware and other drinkware assortments. Nachtmann offers a variety of upscale serveware, decorative products, stemware and drinkware for finer dining establishments.


• | Schönwald dinnerware products in the U.S. and Canada. Schönwald is one of the world's leading providers of high-end porcelain and bone china for food service.


• | Reed & Barton flatware products in the U.S. and Canada. Reed & Barton is one of the oldest and largest privately held tabletop and giftware companies.


• | VIVA Scandinavia offers high-trend teaware that is designed in Denmark and handcrafted in China. The VIVA Scandinavia collection includes tea pots, cups, saucers and infusers featuring combinations of shock-resistant, tempered glass, stainless steel and porcelain.

Customers 
We believe that our regional market segment organization allows us to better understand and serve our customers' needs.
In the U.S. and Canada, customers for our tableware products include approximately 400 foodservice distributors in the United States and Canada and around the world who sell primarily to restaurants, bars, hotels and other foodservice venues. In retail, we sell to mass merchants, department stores, pure play e-commerce retailers or marketers, retail distributors, national retail chains and specialty housewares stores. Additionally, in the business-to-business channel, we sell to a variety of customers, including companies using glass in candle, floral and other OEM applications.
4

In Latin America, we sell to retail customers including mass merchants and wholesale distributors; to a wide variety of business-to-business customers who use glass products in promotions, catalogues, candles, food packing and various OEM uses; and to foodservice distributors.
In EMEA, we sell glass tableware to retailers, distributors and decorators that service the retail, foodservice and business-to-business channels, including large breweries and distilleries decorating products with company logos for promotional and resale purposes.
We also sell glass tableware products in the Asia Pacific region primarily to distributors and wholesalers.
No single customer accounts for 10 percent or more of our sales, although the loss of any of our major customers could have a meaningful impact on us.
Competition
The markets for our products are highly competitive in all our geographic segments. Our competitors include other glass tableware manufacturers, including large multinational companies such as Arc International (a French company) and Paşabahçe (a unit of Şişecam Holdings, a Turkish company), The Oneida Group (a U.S. company), AnHui DeLi Glassware Co., Ltd. (a Chinese company), Vidrieria Y Cristaleria De Lamiaco, S.A.- VICRILA (a Spanish company) and various other manufacturers in Europe, Asia Pacific and the Americas; ceramic dinnerware and metalware manufacturers throughout the world, including Homer Laughlin, The Oneida Group, Steelite and others; and a variety of sourcing or marketing companies. In addition, other products such as plastic and melamine compete with our glass and ceramic tabletop products. Our principal competitive advantages are our installed base, customer service, price, product quality, new product development, brand name, responsiveness, delivery time and breadth of product offerings.

Throughout much of 2017, we continued to experience softer global demand and broad scale industry overcapacity among glass tableware manufacturers, with conditions improving somewhat later in the year. In the U.S., the relative strength of the dollar versus other world currencies has improved the ease with which foreign manufacturers can sell products into the U.S. at competitive prices.
Sales, Marketing and Distribution

In 2017, approximately 76 percent of our sales were to customers located in North America (U.S., Canada and Mexico), and approximately 24 percent of our sales were to customers in other countries. We sell our products in over 100 countries around the world. We employ our own sales force to call on customers and distributors. In addition, we occasionally retain the services of manufacturer's representative organizations to assist in selling our products. We have marketing staff located at our corporate headquarters in Toledo, Ohio, as well as in Mexico, Portugal, the Netherlands and China.
We operate distribution centers located at or near each of our manufacturing facilities (see “Properties” below). In addition, we operate a distribution center in Laredo, Texas, and one in West Chicago, Illinois, and we have contracts with third-party logistics providers to service our on-line customers and consumers. Our warehouse and distribution centers are strategically located to enable us to supply significant quantities of our product to customers on a timely and cost effective basis.
The majority of our sales are in the foodservice, retail and business-to-business channels, which are further detailed below.
Foodservice
We have, according to our estimates, the leading market share in glass tableware sales in the U.S. and Canadian foodservice channel, placing us among the leading glass tableware suppliers around the globe. A majority of our sales of tabletop products to foodservice establishments are made through a network of foodservice distributors. Our strong foodservice distributor network and in-house sales force provide broad coverage of a wide variety of foodservice establishments, including restaurants, bars, hotels and other travel and tourism venues.
Retail
Our primary customers in the retail channel include mass merchants, specialty housewares stores, pure play e-commerce retailers and value-oriented retailers in the U.S. and around the globe. Based on data from the Beverageware Consumer Tracking Services of NPD Group, management estimates that we maintain the leading share of the U.S. retail market for glass beverageware. We believe that our established relationships with major retailers, particularly in the U.S. and Canada, Latin 
5

America and EMEA regions, position us to successfully introduce differentiated new retail products to pursue increased share and profitability. We also operate outlet stores in the U.S. and Mexico and make sales via internet retailers.
Business-to-Business
We supply glass tableware to the business-to-business channel of distribution. Our customers for products sold in the business-to-business channel in the U.S. and Canada and Latin America include drink companies and custom decorators of glassware for promotional purposes and resale. In addition, sales of our products in the business-to-business channel in the U.S. and Canada include sales of products for candle and floral applications, as well as blender jars in Latin America. The craft industries and gourmet food-packing companies are also among our business-to-business glassware customers. In Europe, our customers in the business-to-business channel include marketers who decorate our glassware with company logos and resell these products to large breweries and distilleries, which redistribute the glassware for promotional purposes and resale. 
Seasonality
Our sales and operating income tend to be stronger in the last three quarters of each year and weaker in the first quarter of each year, primarily due to the impact of consumer buying patterns and production activity. This seasonal pattern causes accounts receivable to be higher in the second half of the year and lower during the first half of the year.
We typically build inventory during the first half of the year to allow for optimum customer service and timely delivery in the second half of the year, a higher demand period when orders may exceed short-term production capabilities. We also build inventory to service customers during periods of planned downtime for furnace rebuilds or maintenance, as well as maintaining an appropriate level of safety stock of items that we source primarily from the Asia Pacific region and that, as a result, require longer lead times. Accounts payable do not generally fluctuate significantly on a seasonal basis.
Although little information with respect to our competitors is publicly available, we believe that our experience with working capital is generally consistent with the experience of the industry as a whole.
Backlog
As of December 31, 2017, our backlog was approximately $116.9 million, compared to approximately $89.7 million at December 31, 2016. The increase was primarily due to a rise in customer orders, currency translation effects and timing of order fulfillment. Backlog includes orders confirmed with a purchase order for products scheduled to be shipped to customers in a future period. Since orders may be changed and/or canceled, we do not believe our backlog is necessarily indicative of actual sales for any future period and expect that the majority of these orders will be fulfilled within the current year.
Manufacturing and Sourcing
In North America, we currently own and operate three glass tableware manufacturing plants, two of which are located in the United States (one in Toledo, Ohio, and one in Shreveport, Louisiana) and one of which is located in Monterrey, Mexico. In Europe, we own and operate two glass tableware manufacturing plants, one of which is located in Leerdam, the Netherlands, and the other of which is located in Marinha Grande, Portugal. In Asia, we own and operate a glass tableware production facility in Langfang, China.
The manufacture of our tableware products involves the use of automated processes and technologies, as well as manual production. We design much of our glass tableware production machinery, and we continuously refine it to incorporate technological advances to create a competitive advantage. We believe that our production machinery and equipment will continue to be adequate for our needs for the foreseeable future, but we continue to invest to further improve our products, gain production efficiencies and reduce our cost profile.
Our glass tableware products generally are produced using one of two manufacturing methods, commonly referred to as "blown" or "pressed". In the case of certain stemware, we may use a combination of these methods. Most of our tumblers, stemware and other glass tableware products are "blown", meaning that they are produced by forming molten glass in molds with the use of compressed air. Our other glass tableware products and the stems of certain stemware are “pressed”, meaning that they are produced by pressing molten glass into the desired product shape.
To assist in the manufacturing process, we employ a team of engineers whose responsibilities include efforts to improve and upgrade our manufacturing facilities, equipment and processes. In addition, they provide engineering required to manufacture 
6

new products and implement the large number of innovative changes continuously being made to our product designs, sizes and shapes. See “Research and Development” below for additional information.
Ceramic dinnerware and metal flatware and hollowware are sourced primarily from the Asia Pacific region.
Materials
Our primary materials are sand, lime, soda ash, corrugated packaging and colorants. Historically, these materials have been available in adequate supply from multiple sources. However, there may be temporary shortages of certain materials due to weather or other factors, including disruptions in supply caused by material transportation or production delays. Such shortages have not had, and are not expected in the future to have, a material adverse effect on our operations. Natural gas is the primary source of energy in our production processes, and periodic variability in the price for natural gas has had and could continue to have an impact on our profitability. Historically, we have used natural gas hedging for a portion of our expected purchases to partially mitigate this impact in North America and Europe. We also experience fluctuations in the freight cost to deliver materials due primarily to the cost of diesel fuel and trucking capacity, and such changes may affect our earnings and cash flow.
Research and Development 
Our research and development efforts focus on developing new, differentiated and innovative products to meet customers' and consumers’ needs. Our product development efforts begin with consumer insights, and we have been investing to strengthen these capabilities. Our focus is to increase the quality of our products and develop innovative new consumer solutions and product offerings that enhance the profitability of our business through research and development, including adjacent technology, safety and risk mitigation techniques. We will continue to invest in strategic research and development projects that will further enhance our ability to compete in our core business.
In addition, our core competencies include our glass engineering excellence and world-class manufacturing development techniques. We employ a team of engineers, in addition to external consultants and university collaboration studies in sciences, to conduct research and development. Our expenditures on research and development activities related to new and/or improved products and processes were $3.0 million, $4.3 million and $6.1 million in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. These costs were expensed as incurred.
Patents, Trademarks and Licenses
Based upon market research and surveys, we believe that our trade names and trademarks, as well as our product shapes and styles, enjoy a high degree of consumer recognition and are valuable assets. We believe that the Libbey®, Libbey Signature®, Master's Reserve®, Syracuse® China, World® Tableware, Crisa®, Royal Leerdam® and Crisal Glass® trade names and trademarks are material to our business.
We have rights under a number of patents that relate to a variety of products and processes. However, we do not consider that any patent or group of patents relating to a particular product or process is of material importance to our business as a whole.
Environmental Matters
Our operations, in common with those of industry generally, are subject to numerous existing laws and governmental regulations designed to protect the environment, particularly regarding plant waste, emissions and solid waste disposal and remediation of contaminated sites. We believe that we are in material compliance with applicable environmental laws, and we are not aware of any regulatory initiatives that we expect will have a material effect on our products or operations. See “Risk Factors-We are subject to various environmental legal requirements and may be subject to new legal requirements in the future; these requirements could have a material adverse effect on our operations.”
We have shipped, and we continue to ship, waste materials for off-site disposal. However, we are not named as a potentially responsible party with respect to any waste disposal site matters pending prior to June 24, 1993, the date of Libbey's initial public offering and separation from Owens-Illinois, Inc. (Owens-Illinois). Owens-Illinois has been named as a potentially responsible party or other participant in connection with certain waste disposal sites to which we also may have shipped wastes prior to June 24, 1993. We may bear some responsibility in connection with those shipments. Pursuant to an indemnification agreement between Owens-Illinois and Libbey, Owens-Illinois agreed to defend and hold us harmless against any costs or liabilities we may incur in connection with any such matters identified and pending as of June 24, 1993, and to indemnify us for any liability that results from these matters in excess of $3.0 million.

Syracuse China Environmental Matters
On October 10, 1995, pursuant to an Asset Purchase Agreement, or APA, Syracuse China Company, our wholly-owned subsidiary, acquired from The Pfaltzgraff Co. (now known as TPC York, Inc., which we refer to as "TPC York") and certain of its subsidiary corporations, the assets operated by them as Syracuse China.
By letter dated October 31, 2008, the New York Department of Environmental Conservation, which we refer to as the DEC, and U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, which we refer to as the EPA, made a demand upon Syracuse China and several other potentially responsible parties, or "PRPs," for recovery of approximately $12.5 million of direct and indirect costs allegedly expended by the DEC and EPA in connection with the lake bottom subsite (which we refer to as the Onondaga Lake Bottom subsite) of the Onondaga Lake Superfund Site. In February 2013, Syracuse China, TPC York and Honeywell International Inc., which we refer to as Honeywell, entered into an agreement to settle certain claims relating to the Onondaga Lake Bottom subsite, which Honeywell previously undertook to remediate. Under that Settlement Agreement, Honeywell has agreed to indemnify Syracuse China with respect to certain claims that may be made by any government or third party with respect to the Onondaga Lake Bottom subsite.

By letter dated October 30, 2009, the EPA notified Syracuse China and several other PRPs of potential liability for response costs in connection with the Lower Ley Creek subsite ("Ley Creek Subsite") of the Onondaga Lake Superfund Site. Since that date, the EPA has completed its Remedial Investigation (RI), Feasibility Study (FS), Risk Assessment (RA) and Proposed Remedial Action Plan (PRAP). The EPA issued its Record of Decision (RoD) on September 30, 2014. The RoD indicates that the EPA's estimate of the undiscounted cost of remediation ranges between approximately $17.0 million (assuming local disposal of contaminated sediments is feasible) and approximately $24.8 million (assuming local disposal is not feasible). However, the RoD acknowledges that the final cost of the cleanup will depend upon the actual volume of contaminated material, the degree to which it is contaminated, and where the excavated soil and sediment is properly disposed. In connection with the General Motors Corporation bankruptcy, the EPA recovered $22.0 million (which we refer to as the "GM Settlement Funds") from Motors Liquidation Company ("MLC"), the successor to General Motors Corporation. If the cleanup costs do not exceed the amount recovered by the EPA from MLC, Syracuse China may suffer no loss. If and to the extent the cleanup costs exceed the amount recovered by the EPA from MLC, it is not yet known whether other PRPs will be added to the current group of PRPs or how any excess costs may be allocated among the PRPs. 
On March 3, 2015, the EPA issued to the PRPs notices and requests to negotiate performance of the remedial design (RD), work. The notices contemplate that any agreement to perform the RD work would be memorialized in an Administrative Order on Consent (AOC). On July 14, 2016, the PRPs entered into an AOC to perform the RD work. The EPA and PRPs anticipate that the RD work will produce additional information from which the feasibility of a local disposal option and the cleanup costs can be better determined. The EPA has declined to advance the GM Settlement Funds for the RD work, instead conditioning use of those funds to reimburse for the RD work upon the successful completion of the RD work and the finalization of an AOC to perform the remedial action work.
To the extent Syracuse China is liable for any costs in connection with the remediation of the Ley Creek Subsite, including without limitation costs to fund the RD work, and to the extent such costs are not reimbursed from the GM Settlement Funds, then pursuant to the APA Syracuse China and TPC York will share such costs up to an aggregate of $7.5 million. We believe that collection of the amounts for which TPC York is liable under that indemnification is probable.
In connection with the above proceedings, an estimated environmental liability of $0.8 million and a recoverable amount of $0.4 million in other assets have been recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2017. An estimated liability of $0.9 million and a recoverable amount of $0.5 million in other assets have been recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2016. Immaterial amounts have been recorded in cost of sales in the Consolidated Statements of Operations for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, and $0.2 million was recorded for the year ended December 31, 2015. Although we cannot predict the ultimate outcome of this proceeding, we believe that it will not have a material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.
Other
We regularly review the facts and circumstances of the various environmental matters affecting us, including those covered by indemnification. Although not free of uncertainties, we do not expect, based upon the number of parties involved at the sites and the estimated cost, based upon known technology and the experience of others, of undisputed work necessary for remediation, to incur material loss for new matters in the future. There can be no assurance, however, that indemnification agreements will be performed in accordance with their terms. We believe that any future expenditures for environmental matters will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations.

Although we continue to modify our manufacturing processes and technologies in an effort to reduce our emissions and increase energy efficiency, capital expenditures for property, plant and equipment specifically for environmental control purposes were not material during 2017. In 2016 we spent $2.1 million on environmental control equipment for our China facility. Such expenditures are not expected to be material in 2018.
Employees
We employed 6,230 persons at December 31, 2017. Approximately 71 percent of our employees are employed outside the U.S. The majority of our employees are paid hourly and covered by collective bargaining agreements. The total number of employees under a collective bargaining agreement expiring within one year is approximately 44 percent of Libbey's total workforce. Our collective bargaining agreement with our unionized employees in the Netherlands is scheduled to expire on June 30, 2019; our collective bargaining agreements with our unionized employees in Toledo, Ohio, are scheduled to expire on September 30, 2019; and our collective bargaining agreement with our unionized employees in Shreveport, Louisiana, is scheduled to expire on December 15, 2020. Under our collective bargaining agreements covering our unionized employees in Mexico, we negotiate wages annually and negotiate benefits every other year. In Portugal and China, we have no written collective bargaining agreement with our unionized employees; however, there are consultations with the unions on various matters, including annual negotiations regarding wages. We believe that our relations with our employees are good.
