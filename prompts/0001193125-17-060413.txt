Item 1. Business 
 GENERAL
Dominion, headquartered in Richmond, Virginia and incorporated in Virginia in 1983, is one of the nations largest producers and transporters of energy. Dominions strategy is to be a leading provider of electricity, natural gas and related services to customers primarily in the eastern and Rocky Mountain regions of the U.S. As of December 31, 2016, Dominions portfolio of assets includes approximately 26,400 MW of generating capacity, 6,600 miles of electric transmission lines, 57,600 miles of electric distribution lines, 14,900 miles of natural gas transmission, gathering and storage pipeline and 51,300 miles of gas distribution pipeline, exclusive of service lines. As of December 31, 2016, Dominion serves over 6 million utility and retail energy customers and operates one of the nations largest underground natural gas storage systems, with approximately 1 trillion cubic feet of storage capacity. 
 In September 2016, Dominion completed the Dominion Questar Combination for total consideration of $4.4 billion and Dominion Questar became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Dominion. Dominion Questar is a Rockies-based integrated natural gas company. Questar Gas, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Dominion Questar, is consolidated by Dominion, and is a voluntary SEC filer. However, its Form 10-K is filed separately and is not combined herein. 
 In March 2014, Dominion formed Dominion Midstream, an MLP designed to grow a portfolio of natural gas terminaling, processing, storage, transportation and related assets. In October 2014, Dominion Midstream launched its initial public offering and issued 20,125,000 common units representing limited partner interests. Dominion has recently and may continue to investigate opportunities to acquire assets that meet its strategic objective for Dominion Midstream. At December 31, 2016, Dominion owns the general partner, 50.9% of the common and subordinated units and 37.5% of the convertible preferred interests in Dominion Midstream, which owns a preferred equity interest and the general partner interest in Cove Point, DCG, Questar Pipeline and a 25.93% noncontrolling partnership interest in Iroquois. Dominion Midstream is consolidated by Dominion, and is an SEC registrant. However, its Form 10-K is filed separately and is not combined herein. 
 Dominion is focused on expanding its investment in regulated electric generation, transmission and distribution and regulated natural gas transmission and distribution infrastructure. Dominion expects 80% to 90% of earnings from its primary operating segments to come from regulated and long-term contracted businesses. 
 Dominion continues to expand and improve its regulated and long-term contracted electric and natural gas businesses, in accordance with its existing five-year capital investment program. A major impetus for this program is to meet the anticipated increase in demand in its electric utility service territory. Other drivers for the capital investment program include the construction of infrastructure to handle the increase in natural gas production from the Marcellus and Utica Shale formations, to upgrade Dominions gas and electric transmission and distribution networks, and to meet environmental requirements and standards set by various regulatory bodies. Investments in utility-

  scale solar generation are expected to be a focus in meeting such environmental requirements, particularly in Virginia. In September 2014, Dominion announced the formation of Atlantic Coast Pipeline. Atlantic Coast Pipeline is focused on constructing an approximately 600-mile natural gas pipeline running from West Virginia through Virginia to North Carolina, to increase natural gas supplies in the region. 
 Dominion has transitioned to a more regulated, less volatile earnings mix as evidenced by its capital investments in regulated infrastructure, including the Dominion Questar Combination, and in infrastructure whose output is sold under long-term purchase agreements as well as the sale of the electric retail energy marketing business in March 2014. Dominions nonregulated operations include merchant generation, energy marketing and price risk management activities and natural gas retail energy marketing operations. Dominions operations are conducted through various subsidiaries, including Virginia Power and Dominion Gas. 
 Virginia Power, headquartered in Richmond, Virginia and incorporated in Virginia in 1909 as a Virginia public service corporation, is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Dominion and a regulated public utility that generates, transmits and distributes electricity for sale in Virginia and North Carolina. In Virginia, Virginia Power conducts business under the name Dominion Virginia Power and primarily serves retail customers. In North Carolina, it conducts business under the name Dominion North Carolina Power and serves retail customers located in the northeastern region of the state, excluding certain municipalities. In addition, Virginia Power sells electricity at wholesale prices to rural electric cooperatives, municipalities and into wholesale electricity markets. All of Virginia Powers stock is owned by Dominion. 
 Dominion Gas, a limited liability company formed in September 2013, is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Dominion and a holding company. It serves as the intermediate parent company for certain of Dominions regulated natural gas operating subsidiaries, which conduct business activities through a regulated interstate natural gas transmission pipeline and underground storage system in the Northeast, mid-Atlantic and Midwest states, regulated gas transportation and distribution operations in Ohio, and gas gathering and processing activities primarily in West Virginia, Ohio and Pennsylvania. Dominion Gas principal wholly-owned subsidiaries are DTI, East Ohio, DGP and Dominion Iroquois. DTI is an interstate natural gas transmission pipeline company serving a broad mix of customers such as local gas distribution companies, marketers, interstate and intrastate pipelines, electric power generators and natural gas producers. The DTI system links to other major pipelines and markets in the mid-Atlantic, Northeast, and Midwest including Dominions Cove Point pipeline. DTI also operates one of the largest underground natural gas storage systems in the U.S. In August 2016, DTI transferred its gathering and processing facilities to DGP. East Ohio is a regulated natural gas distribution operation serving residential, commercial and industrial gas sales and transportation customers. Its service territory includes Cleveland, Akron, Canton, Youngstown and other eastern and western Ohio communities. In May 2016, Dominion Gas sold 0.65% of the noncontrolling partnership interest in Iroquois, a FERC-regulated interstate natural gas pipeline in New York and Connecticut, to TransCanada. At December 31, 2016, Dominion Gas holds a

 For additional financial information on operating segments, including revenues from external customers, see Note 25 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. For additional information on operating revenue related to the Companies principal products and services, see Notes 2 and 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, which information is incorporated herein by reference. 
 DVP 
 The DVP Operating Segment of Dominion and Virginia Power includes Virginia Powers regulated electric transmission and distribution (including customer service) operations, which serve approximately 2.6 million residential, commercial, industrial and governmental customers in Virginia and North Carolina. 
 DVPs existing five-year investment plan includes spending approximately $8.4 billion from 2017 through 2021 to upgrade or add new transmission and distribution lines, substations and other facilities to meet growing electricity demand within its service territory and maintain reliability and regulatory compliance. The proposed electric delivery infrastructure projects are intended to address both continued customer growth and increases in electricity consumption by the typical consumer. In addition, data centers continue to contribute to anticipated demand growth. 
 Revenue provided by electric distribution operations is based primarily on rates established by state regulatory authorities and state law. Variability in earnings is driven primarily by changes in rates, weather, customer growth and other factors impacting consumption such as the economy and energy conservation, in addition to operating and maintenance expenditures. Operationally, electric distribution continues to focus on improving service levels while striving to reduce costs and link investments to operational results. SAIDI performance results, excluding major events, were 137 minutes at the end of 2016, which is higher compared to the three-year average of 123 minutes, due to storm-related outages across all seasons. Virginia Powers overall customer satisfaction, however, improved year over year when compared to 2015 J.D. Power and Associates scoring. In the future, safety, electric service reliability and customer service will remain key focus areas for electric distribution. 

 Revenue provided by Virginia Powers electric transmission operations is based primarily on rates approved by FERC. The profitability of this business is dependent on its ability, through the rates it is permitted to charge, to recover costs and earn a reasonable return on its capital investments. Variability in earnings primarily results from changes in rates and the timing of property additions, retirements and depreciation. 
 Virginia Power is a member of PJM, a RTO, and its electric transmission facilities are integrated into PJM wholesale electricity markets. Consistent with the increased authority given to NERC by EPACT, Virginia Powers electric transmission operations are committed to meeting NERC standards, modernizing its infrastructure and maintaining superior system reliability. Virginia Powers electric transmission operations will continue to focus on safety, operational performance, NERC compliance and execution of PJMs RTEP. 
 COMPETITION
DVP Operating SegmentDominion and Virginia Power 
 There is no competition for electric distribution service within Virginia Powers service territory in Virginia and North Carolina and no such competition is currently permitted. Historically, since its electric transmission facilities are integrated into PJM and electric transmission services are administered by PJM, there was no competition in relation to transmission service provided to customers within the PJM region. However, competition from non-incumbent PJM transmission owners for development, construction and ownership of certain transmission facilities in Virginia Powers service territory is now permitted pursuant to FERC Order 1000, subject to state and local siting and permitting approvals. This could result in additional competition to build and own transmission infrastructure in Virginia Powers service area in the future and could allow Dominion to seek opportunities to build and own facilities in other service territories. 
 REGULATION
DVP Operating SegmentDominion and Virginia Power 
 Virginia Powers electric distribution service, including the rates it may charge to jurisdictional customers, is subject to regulation by the Virginia and North Carolina Commissions. Virginia Powers wholesale electric transmission rates, tariffs and terms of service are subject to regulation by FERC. Electric transmission siting authority remains the jurisdiction of the Virginia and North Carolina Commissions. However, EPACT provides FERC with certain backstop authority for transmission siting. See State Regulations and Federal Regulations in Regulation and Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. 
 PROPERTIES
DVP Operating SegmentDominion and Virginia Power 
 Virginia Power has approximately 6,600 miles of electric transmission lines of 69 kV or more located in North Carolina, Virginia and West Virginia. Portions of Virginia Powers electric transmission lines cross national parks and forests under permits entitling the federal government to use, at specified charges, any surplus capacity that may exist in these lines. While Virginia Power owns and maintains its electric transmission facili-


11

 



  ties, they are a part of PJM, which coordinates the planning, operation, emergency assistance and exchange of capacity and energy for such facilities. 
 As a part of PJMs RTEP process, PJM authorized the following material reliability projects (including Virginia Powers estimated cost): 
 
 | Surry-to-Skiffes Creek-to-Whealton ($280 million);
--+---------------------------------------------------


 | Mt. Storm-to-Dooms ($240 million);
--+-----------------------------------


 | Idylwood substation ($110 million);
--+------------------------------------


 | Dooms-to-Lexington ($130 million);
--+-----------------------------------


 | Cunningham-to-Elmont ($110 million);
--+-------------------------------------


 | Landstown voltage regulation ($70 million);
--+--------------------------------------------


 | Warrenton (including Remington CT-to-Warrenton, Vint Hill-to-Wheeler-to-Gainesville, and Vint Hill and Wheeler switching stations) ($110 million);
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Remington/Gordonsville/Pratts Area Improvement (including Remington-to-Gordonsville, and new Gordonsville substation transformer) ($110 million);
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Gainesville-to-Haymarket ($55 million);
--+----------------------------------------


 | Kings Dominion-to-Fredericksburg ($50 million);
--+------------------------------------------------


 | Loudoun-Brambleton line-to-Poland Road Substation ($60 million);
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------


 | Cunningham-to-Dooms ($60 million);
--+-----------------------------------


 | Carson-to-Rogers Road ($55 million);
--+-------------------------------------


 | Dooms-Valley rebuild ($60 million); and
--+----------------------------------------


 | Mt. Storm-Valley rebuild ($225 million).
--+-----------------------------------------

 Virginia Power plans to increase transmission substation physical security and expects to invest $300 million-$400 million through 2022 to strengthen its electrical system to better protect critical equipment, enhance its spare equipment process and create multiple levels of security. 
 In addition, Virginia Powers electric distribution network includes approximately 57,600 miles of distribution lines, exclusive of service level lines, in Virginia and North Carolina. The grants for most of its electric lines contain rights-of-way that have been obtained from the apparent owners of real estate, but underlying titles have not been examined. Where rights-of-way have not been obtained, they could be acquired from private owners by condemnation, if necessary. Many electric lines are on publicly-owned property, where permission to operate can be revoked. 
 Virginia legislation in 2014 provides for the recovery of costs, subject to approval by the Virginia Commission, for Virginia Power to move approximately 4,000 miles of electric distribution lines underground. The program is designed to reduce restoration outage time by moving its most outage-prone overhead distribution lines underground, has an annual investment cap of approximately $175 million and is expected to be implemented over the next decade. In August 2016, the Virginia Commission approved the first phase of the program encompassing approximately 400 miles of converted lines and $140 million in capital spending (with approximately $123 million recoverable through Rider U). In December 2016, Virginia Power filed its application with the Virginia Commission to recover costs associated with the first and second phases of this program. The second phase will convert an estimated 244 miles at a cost of $110 million. 

 SOURCES OF ENERGY SUPPLY
DVP Operating SegmentDominion and Virginia Power 
 DVPs supply of electricity to serve Virginia Power customers is produced or procured by Dominion Generation. See Dominion Generation for additional information. 
 SEASONALITY
DVP Operating SegmentDominion and Virginia Power 
 DVPs earnings vary seasonally as a result of the impact of changes in temperature, the impact of storms and other catastrophic weather events, and the availability of alternative sources for heating on demand by residential and commercial customers. Generally, the demand for electricity peaks during the summer and winter months to meet cooling and heating needs. An increase in heating degree days for DVPs electric utility-related operations does not produce the same increase in revenue as an increase in cooling degree days, due to seasonal pricing differentials and because alternative heating sources are more readily available. 
Dominion Generation 
 The Dominion Generation Operating Segment of Virginia Power includes the generation operations of the Virginia Power regulated electric utility and its related energy supply operations. Virginia Powers utility generation operations primarily serve the supply requirements for the DVP segments utility customers. The Dominion Generation Operating Segment of Dominion includes Virginia Powers generation facilities and its related energy supply operations as well as the generation operations of Dominions merchant fleet and energy marketing and price risk management activities for these assets. 
 Dominion Generations existing five-year investment plan includes spending approximately $8.0 billion from 2017 through 2021 to construct new generation capacity to meet growing electricity demand within its service territory and maintain reliability. The most significant project currently under construction is Greensville County, which is estimated to cost approximately $1.3 billion, excluding financing costs. See Properties and Environmental Strategy for additional information on this and other utility projects. 
 In addition, Dominions merchant fleet includes numerous renewable generation facilities, which include a fuel cell generation facility in Connecticut and solar generation facilities in operation or development in nine states, including Virginia. The output of these facilities is sold under long-term power purchase agreements with terms generally ranging from 15 to 25 years. See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding certain solar projects. 
 Earnings for the Dominion Generation Operating Segment of Virginia Power primarily result from the sale of electricity generated by its utility fleet. Revenue is based primarily on rates established by state regulatory authorities and state law. Approximately 82% of revenue comes from serving Virginia jurisdictional customers. Base rates for the Virginia jurisdiction are set using a modified cost-of-service rate model, and are generally designed to allow an opportunity to recover the cost of providing utility service and earn a reasonable return on investments used to provide that service. Earnings variability may arise when revenues are impacted by factors not reflected in current rates, such as the 



 
12

 



  impact of weather on customers demand for services. Likewise, earnings may reflect variations in the timing or nature of expenses as compared to those contemplated in current rates, such as labor and benefit costs, capacity expenses, and the timing, duration and costs of scheduled and unscheduled outages. The cost of fuel and purchased power is generally collected through fuel cost-recovery mechanisms established by regulators and does not materially impact net income. The cost of new generation facilities is generally recovered through rate adjustment clauses in Virginia. Variability in earnings from rate adjustment clauses reflects changes in the authorized ROE and the carrying amount of these facilities, which are largely driven by the timing and amount of capital investments, as well as depreciation. See Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. 
 The Dominion Generation Operating Segment of Dominion derives its earnings primarily from the sale of electricity generated by Virginia Powers utility and Dominions merchant generation assets, as well as from associated capacity and ancillary services. Variability in earnings provided by Dominions nonrenewable merchant fleet relates to changes in market-based prices received for electricity and capacity. Market-based prices for electricity are largely dependent on commodity prices, primarily natural gas, and the demand for electricity, which is primarily dependent upon weather. Capacity prices are dependent upon resource requirements in relation to the supply available (both existing and new) in the forward capacity auctions, which are held approximately three years in advance of the associated delivery year. Dominion manages the electric price volatility of its merchant fleet by hedging a substantial portion of its expected near-term energy sales with derivative instruments. Variability also results from changes in the cost of fuel consumed, labor and benefits and the timing, duration and costs of scheduled and unscheduled outages. Variability in earnings provided by Dominions renewable merchant fleet is primarily driven by weather. 
 COMPETITION
Dominion Generation Operating SegmentDominion and Virginia Power 
 Virginia Powers generation operations are not subject to significant competition as only a limited number of its Virginia jurisdictional electric utility customers have retail choice. See Electric under State Regulations in Regulation for more information. Currently, North Carolina does not offer retail choice to electric customers. 
 Dominion Generation Operating SegmentDominion 
 Dominion Generations recently acquired and developed renewable generation projects are not currently subject to significant competition as the output from these facilities is primarily sold under long-term power purchase agreements with terms generally lasting between 15 and 25 years. Competition for the nonrenewable merchant fleet is impacted by electricity and fuel prices, new market entrants, construction by others of generating assets and transmission capacity, technological advances in power generation, the actions of environmental and other regulatory authorities and other factors. These competitive factors may negatively impact the merchant fleets ability to profit from the sale of electricity and related products and services. 

 Unlike Dominion Generations regulated generation fleet, its nonrenewable merchant generation fleet is dependent on its ability to operate in a competitive environment and does not have a predetermined rate structure that provides for a rate of return on its capital investments. Dominion Generations nonrenewable merchant assets operate within functioning RTOs and primarily compete on the basis of price. Competitors include other generating assets bidding to operate within the RTOs. Dominion Generations nonrenewable merchant units compete in the wholesale market with other generators to sell a variety of products including energy, capacity and ancillary services. It is difficult to compare various types of generation given the wide range of fuels, fuel procurement strategies, efficiencies and operating characteristics of the fleet within any given RTO. However, Dominion applies its expertise in operations, dispatch and risk management to maximize the degree to which its nonrenewable merchant fleet is competitive compared to similar assets within the region. 
 REGULATION
Dominion Generation Operating SegmentDominion and Virginia Power 
 Virginia Powers utility generation fleet and Dominions merchant generation fleet are subject to regulation by FERC, the NRC, the EPA, the DOE, the Army Corps of Engineers and other federal, state and local authorities. Virginia Powers utility generation fleet is also subject to regulation by the Virginia and North Carolina Commissions. See Regulation, Future Issues and Other Matters in Item 7. MD&A and Notes 13 and 22 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information. 
 The Clean Power Plan and related proposed rules discussed represent a significant regulatory development affecting this segment. See Future Issues and Other Matters in Item 7. MD&A.

 SOURCES OF ENERGY SUPPLY
Dominion Generation Operating SegmentDominion and Virginia Power 
 Dominion Generation uses a variety of fuels to power its electric generation and purchases power for utility system load requirements and to satisfy physical forward sale requirements, as 

  described below. Some of these agreements have fixed commitments and are included as contractual obligations in Future Cash Payments for Contractual Obligations and Planned Capital Expenditures in Item 7. MD&A. 
 Nuclear FuelDominion Generation primarily utilizes long-term contracts to support its nuclear fuel requirements. Worldwide market conditions are continuously evaluated to ensure a range of supply options at reasonable prices which are dependent on the market environment. Current agreements, inventories and spot market availability are expected to support current and planned fuel supply needs. Additional fuel is purchased as required to ensure optimal cost and inventory levels. 
 Fossil FuelDominion Generation primarily utilizes natural gas and coal in its fossil fuel plants. All recent fossil fuel plant construction for Dominion Generation, with the exception of the Virginia City Hybrid Energy Center, involves natural gas generation. 
 Dominion Generations natural gas and oil supply is obtained from various sources including purchases from major and independent producers in the Mid-Continent and Gulf Coast regions, purchases from local producers in the Appalachian area and Marcellus and Utica regions, purchases from gas marketers and withdrawals from underground storage fields owned by Dominion or third parties. Dominion Generation manages a portfolio of natural gas transportation contracts (capacity) that provides for reliable natural gas deliveries to its gas turbine fleet, while minimizing costs. 
 Dominion Generations coal supply is obtained through long-term contracts and short-term spot agreements from domestic suppliers. 
 BiomassDominion Generations biomass supply is obtained through long-term contracts and short-term spot agreements from local suppliers. 
 Purchased PowerDominion Generation purchases electricity from the PJM spot market and through power purchase agreements with other suppliers to provide for utility system load requirements. 
 Dominion Generation also occasionally purchases electricity from the PJM and ISO-NE spot markets to satisfy physical forward sale requirements as part of its merchant generation operations.

 SEASONALITY
Dominion Generation Operating SegmentDominion and Virginia Power 
 Sales of electricity for Dominion Generation typically vary seasonally as a result of the impact of changes in temperature and the availability of alternative sources for heating on demand by residential and commercial customers. See DVP-Seasonality above for additional considerations that also apply to Dominion Generation. 
 NUCLEAR DECOMMISSIONING
Dominion Generation Operating SegmentDominion and Virginia Power 
 Virginia Power has a total of four licensed, operating nuclear reactors at Surry and North Anna in Virginia. 
 Decommissioning involves the decontamination and removal of radioactive contaminants from a nuclear power station once operations have ceased, in accordance with standards established by the NRC. Amounts collected from ratepayers are placed into trusts and are invested to fund the expected future costs of decommissioning the Surry and North Anna units. 
 Virginia Power believes that the decommissioning funds and their expected earnings for the Surry and North Anna units will be sufficient to cover expected decommissioning costs, particularly when combined with future ratepayer collections and contributions to these decommissioning trusts, if such future collections and contributions are required. This reflects the long-term investment horizon, since the units will not be decommissioned for decades, and a positive long-term outlook for trust fund investment returns. Virginia Power will continue to monitor these trusts to ensure they meet the NRC minimum financial assurance requirements, which may include, if needed, the use of parent company guarantees, surety bonding or other financial instruments recognized by the NRC. 
 The estimated cost to decommission Virginia Powers four nuclear units is reflected in the table below and is primarily based upon site-specific studies completed in 2014. These cost studies are generally completed every four to five years. The current cost estimates assume decommissioning activities will begin shortly after cessation of operations, which will occur when the operating licenses expire. 
 Under the current operating licenses, Virginia Power is scheduled to decommission the Surry and North Anna units during the period 2032 to 2078. NRC regulations allow licensees to apply for extension of an operating license in up to 20-year increments. Virginia Power has announced its intention to apply for an operating life extension for Surry, and may for North Anna as well. 
 Dominion Generation Operating SegmentDominion 
 In addition to the four nuclear units discussed above, Dominion has two licensed, operating nuclear reactors at Millstone in Connecticut. A third Millstone unit ceased operations before Dominion acquired the power station. In May 2013, Dominion ceased operations at its single Kewaunee unit in Wisconsin and commenced decommissioning activities using the SAFSTOR methodology. The planned decommissioning completion date is 2073, which is within the NRC allowed 60-year window. 
 As part of Dominions acquisition of both Millstone and Kewaunee, it acquired decommissioning funds for the related 

  units. Any funds remaining in Kewaunees trust after decommissioning is completed are required to be refunded to Wisconsin ratepayers. Dominion believes that the amounts currently available in the decommissioning trusts and their expected earnings will be sufficient to cover expected decommissioning costs for the Millstone and Kewaunee units. Dominion will continue to monitor these trusts to ensure they meet the NRC minimum financial assurance requirements, which may include, if needed, the use of parent company guarantees, surety bonding or other financial instruments recognized by the NRC. The estimated cost to decommission Dominions eight units is reflected in the table below and is primarily based upon site-specific studies completed for Surry, North Anna and Millstone in 2014 and for Kewaunee in 2013. 
 The estimated decommissioning costs and license expiration dates for the nuclear units owned by Dominion and Virginia Power are shown in the following table: 
 

 | NRC license expiration year | | Most recent cost estimate (2016 dollars)(1) | | | Funds in trusts at December 31, 2016 | | 2016 contributions to trusts

Dominion Energy 
 The Dominion Energy Operating Segment of Dominion Gas includes certain of Dominions regulated natural gas operations. DTI, the gas transmission pipeline and storage business, serves gas distribution businesses and other customers in the Northeast, mid-Atlantic and Midwest. DGP conducts gas gathering and processing activities, which include the sale of extracted products at market rates, primarily in West Virginia, Ohio and Pennsylvania. East Ohio, the primary gas distribution business of Dominion, serves residential, commercial and industrial gas sales, transportation and gathering service customers primarily in Ohio. Dominion Iroquois holds a 24.07% noncontrolling partnership interest in Iroquois, which provides service to local gas distribution companies, electric utilities and electric power generators, as well as marketers and other end users, through interconnecting pipelines and exchanges primarily in New York. 
 Earnings for the Dominion Energy Operating Segment of Dominion Gas primarily result from rates established by FERC and the Ohio Commission. The profitability of this business is dependent on Dominion Gas ability, through the rates it is permitted to charge, to recover costs and earn a reasonable return on its capital investments. Variability in earnings results from changes in operating and maintenance expenditures, as well as changes in rates and the demand for services, which are dependent on weather, changes in commodity prices and the economy. 
 Approximately 96% of the transmission capacity under contract on DTIs pipeline is subscribed with long-term contracts (two years or greater). The remaining 4% is contracted on a year-to-year basis. Less than 1% of firm transportation capacity is currently unsubscribed. Less than 1% of storage services are unsubscribed. All contracted storage is subscribed with long-term contracts. 
 Revenue from processing and fractionation operations largely results from the sale of commodities at market prices. For DGPs processing plants, Dominion Gas receives the wet gas product from producers and may retain the extracted NGLs as compensation for its services. This exposes Dominion Gas to commodity price risk for the value of the spread between the NGL products and natural gas. In addition, Dominion Gas has volumetric risk as the majority of customers receiving these services are not required to deliver minimum quantities of gas. 
 East Ohio utilizes a straight-fixed-variable rate design for a majority of its customers. Under this rate design, East Ohio recovers a large portion of its fixed operating costs through a flat monthly charge accompanied by a reduced volumetric base delivery rate. Accordingly, East Ohios revenue is less impacted by weather-related fluctuations in natural gas consumption than under the traditional rate design. 
 In addition to the operations of Dominion Gas, 
the Dominion Energy Operating Segment of Dominion also includes LNG operations, Dominion Questar operations, Hopes gas distribution operations in West Virginia, and nonregulated retail natural gas marketing, as well as Dominions investments in the Blue Racer joint venture, Atlantic Coast Pipeline and Dominion Midstream. See Properties and Investments below for additional information regarding the Blue Racer and Atlantic Coast Pipeline investments. Dominions LNG operations involve the import and storage of LNG at Cove Point and the transportation of regasified LNG to 

  the interstate pipeline grid and mid-Atlantic and Northeast markets. Dominion has received DOE and FERC approval to export LNG from Cove Point and has begun construction on a bi-directional facility, which will be able to import LNG and regasify it as natural gas and liquefy natural gas and export it as LNG. See Note 22 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information. 
 In September 2016, Dominion completed the Dominion Questar Combination and Dominion Questar became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Dominion. Dominion Questar, a Rockies-based integrated natural gas company, included Questar Gas, Wexpro and Questar Pipeline at closing. Questar Gas regulated gas distribution operations in Utah, southwestern Wyoming and southeastern Idaho includes 29,200 miles of gas distribution pipeline. Wexpro develops and produces natural gas from reserves supplied to Questar Gas under a cost-of-service framework. Questar Pipeline provides FERC-regulated interstate natural gas transportation and storage services in Utah, Wyoming and western Colorado through 2,200 miles of gas transmission pipeline and 56 bcf of working gas storage. See Acquisitions and Dispositions above and Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of the Dominion Questar Combination. 
 In 2014, Dominion formed Dominion Midstream, an MLP initially consisting of a preferred equity interest in Cove Point. See General above for more information. Also see Acquisitions and Dispositions above and Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of Dominions contribution of Questar Pipeline to Dominion Midstream in December 2016 as well as Dominions acquisition of DCG, which Dominion contributed to Dominion Midstream in April 2015, and Dominion Midstreams acquisition of a 25.93% noncontrolling partnership interest in Iroquois in September 2015. DCG provides FERC-regulated interstate natural gas transportation services in South Carolina and southeastern Georgia through 1,500 miles of gas transmission pipeline. 
 Dominion Energys existing five-year investment plan includes spending approximately $8.0 billion from 2017 through 2021 to upgrade existing or add new infrastructure to meet growing energy needs within its service territory and maintain reliability. Demand for natural gas is expected to continue to grow as initiatives to transition to gas from more carbon-intensive fuels are implemented. This plan includes Dominions portion of spending for the Atlantic Coast Pipeline Project. 
 In addition to the earnings drivers noted above for Dominion Gas, earnings for the Dominion Energy Operating Segment of Dominion primarily include the results of rates established by FERC and the West Virginia, Utah, Wyoming and Idaho Commissions. Additionally, Dominion Energy receives revenue from firm fee-based contractual arrangements, including negotiated rates, for certain LNG storage and regasification services. Questar Pipelines and DCGs revenues are primarily derived from reservation charges for firm transportation and storage services as provided for in their FERC-approved tariffs. Revenue provided by Questar Gas operations is based primarily on rates established by the Utah and Wyoming Commissions. The Idaho Commission has contracted with the Utah Commission for rate oversight of Questar Gas operations in a small area of southeastern Idaho. Hopes gas distribution operations in West Virginia serve residential, commercial, sale for resale and 



 
16

 



  industrial gas sales, transportation and gathering service customers. Revenue provided by Hopes operations is based primarily on rates established by the West Virginia Commission. The profitability of these businesses is dependent on their ability, through the rates they are permitted to charge, to recover costs and earn a reasonable return on their capital investments. Variability in earnings results from changes in operating and maintenance expenditures, as well as changes in rates and the demand for services, which are dependent on weather, changes in commodity prices and the economy. 
 Dominions retail energy marketing operations compete in nonregulated energy markets. In March 2014, Dominion completed the sale of its electric retail energy marketing business; however, it still participates in the retail natural gas and energy-related products and services businesses. The remaining customer base includes approximately 1.4 million customer accounts in 17 states. Dominion has a heavy concentration of natural gas customers in markets where utilities have a long-standing commitment to customer choice, primarily in the states of Ohio and Pennsylvania. 
 COMPETITION
Dominion Energy Operating SegmentDominion and Dominion Gas 
 Dominion Gas natural gas transmission operations compete with domestic and Canadian pipeline companies. Dominion Gas also competes with gas marketers seeking to provide or arrange transportation, storage and other services. Alternative energy sources, such as oil or coal, provide another level of competition. Although competition is based primarily on price, the array of services that can be provided to customers is also an important factor. The combination of capacity rights held on certain long-line pipelines, a large storage capability and the availability of numerous receipt and delivery points along its own pipeline system enable Dominion to tailor its services to meet the needs of individual customers. 
 DGPs processing and fractionation operations face competition in obtaining natural gas supplies for its processing and related services. Numerous factors impact any given customers choice of processing services provider, including the location of the facilities, efficiency and reliability of operations, and the pricing arrangements offered. 
 In Ohio, there has been no legislation enacted to require supplier choice for natural gas distribution consumers. However, East Ohio has offered an Energy Choice program to residential and commercial customers since October 2000. East Ohio has since taken various steps approved by the Ohio Commission toward exiting the merchant function, including restructuring its commodity service and placing Energy Choice-eligible customers in a direct retail relationship with participating suppliers. Further, in April 2013, East Ohio fully exited the merchant function for its nonresidential customers, which are now required to choose a retail supplier or be assigned to one at a monthly variable rate set by the supplier. At December 31, 2016, approximately 1 million of East Ohios 1.2 million Ohio customers were participating in the Energy Choice program. 
 Dominion Energy Operating SegmentDominion 
 Questar Gas and Hope do not currently face direct competition from other distributors of natural gas for residential and commer-

  cial customers in their service territories as state regulations in Utah, Wyoming and Idaho for Questar Gas, and West Virginia for Hope, do not allow customers to choose their provider at this time. See 
State Regulations in Regulation for additional information. 
 Cove Points gas transportation, LNG import and storage operations, as well as the Liquefaction Projects capacity are contracted primarily under long-term fixed reservation fee agreements. However, in the future Cove Point may compete with other independent terminal operators as well as major oil and gas companies on the basis of terminal location, services provided and price. Competition from terminal operators primarily comes from refiners and distribution companies with marketing and trading arms. 
 Questar Pipelines and DCGs pipeline systems generate a substantial portion of their revenue from long-term firm contracts for transportation services and are therefore insulated from competitive factors during the terms of the contracts. When these long-term contracts expire, Questar Pipelines pipeline system faces competitive pressures from similar facilities that serve the Rocky Mountain region and DCGs pipeline system faces competitive pressures from similar facilities that serve the South Carolina and southeastern Georgia area in terms of location, rates, terms of service, and flexibility and reliability of service. 
 Dominions retail energy marketing operations compete against incumbent utilities and other energy marketers in nonregulated energy markets for natural gas. Customers in these markets have the right to select a retail marketer and typically do so based upon price savings or price stability; however, incumbent utilities have the advantage of long-standing relationships with their customers and greater name recognition in their markets. 
 REGULATION
Dominion Energy Operating SegmentDominion and Dominion Gas 
 Dominion Gas natural gas transmission and storage operations are regulated primarily by FERC. East Ohios gas distribution operations, including the rates that it may charge to customers, are regulated by the Ohio Commission.

17

 



 In September 2014, DTI announced its intent to construct and operate the Supply Header project which is expected to cost approximately $500 million and provide 1,500,000 Dths per day of firm transportation service to various customers. In October 2014, DTI requested authorization to use FERCs pre-filing process. The application to request FERC authorization to construct and operate the project facilities was filed in September 2015, with the facilities expected to be in service in late 2019. In December 2014, DTI entered into a precedent agreement with Atlantic Coast Pipeline for the Supply Header project. 
 In June 2014, DTI executed binding precedent agreements with two power generators for the Leidy South Project. In November 2014, one of the power generators assigned a portion of its capacity to an affiliate, bringing the total number of project customers to three. The project is expected to cost approximately $210 million. In August 2016, DTI received FERC authorization to construct and operate the Leidy South Project facilities. Service under the 20-year contracts is expected to commence in late 2017. 
 In September 2013, DTI executed binding precedent agreements with several local distribution company customers for the New Market project. The project is expected to cost approximately $180 million and provide 112,000 Dths per day of firm transportation service from Leidy, Pennsylvania to interconnects with Iroquois and Niagara Mohawk Power Corporations distribution system in the Albany, New York market. In April 2016, DTI received FERC authorization to construct, operate and maintain the project facilities, which are expected to be in service in late 2017. 
 In March 2016, East Ohio executed a binding precedent agreement with a power generator for the Lordstown Project. In January 2017, East Ohio commenced construction of the project, with an in-service date expected in the third quarter of 2017 at a total estimated cost of approximately $35 million. 
 In 2008, East Ohio began PIR, aimed at replacing approximately 4,100 miles of its pipeline system at a cost of $2.7 billion. In 2011, approval was obtained to include an additional 1,450 miles and to increase annual capital investment to meet the program goal. The program will replace approximately 25% of the pipeline system and is anticipated to take place over a total of 25 years. In March 2015, East Ohio filed an application with the Ohio Commission requesting approval to extend the PIR program for an additional five years and to increase the annual capital investment, with corresponding increases in the annual rate-increase caps. In September 2016, the Ohio Commission approved a stipulation filed jointly by East Ohio and the Staff of the Ohio Commission to settle East Ohios pending application. As requested, the PIR Program and associated cost recovery will continue for another five-year term, calendar years 2017 through 2021, and East Ohio will be permitted to increase its annual capital expenditures to $200 million by 2018 and 3% per year thereafter subject to the cost recovery rate increase caps proposed by East Ohio. Costs associated with calendar year 2016 investment will be recovered under the existing terms. 
 Dominion Energy Operating SegmentDominion 
 Dominion has the following significant projects under construction or development. 
 Cove PointDominion is pursuing the Liquefaction Project, which would enable Cove Point to liquefy domestically-produced 

  natural gas for export as LNG. The DOE previously authorized Dominion to export LNG to countries with free trade agreements. In September 2013, the DOE authorized Dominion to export LNG from Cove Point to non-free trade agreement countries. 
 In May 2014, the FERC staff issued its EA for the Liquefaction Project. In the EA, the FERC staff addressed a variety of topics related to the proposed construction and development of the Liquefaction Project and its potential impact to the environment, and determined that with the implementation of appropriate mitigation measures, the Liquefaction Project can be built and operated safely with no significant impact to the environment. In September 2014, Cove Point received the FERC order authorizing the Liquefaction Project with certain conditions. The conditions regarding the Liquefaction Project set forth in the FERC order largely incorporate the mitigation measures proposed in the EA. In October 2014, Cove Point commenced construction of the Liquefaction Project, with an in-service date anticipated in late 2017 at a total estimated cost of approximately $4.0 billion, excluding financing costs. The Cove Point facility is authorized to export at a rate of 770 million cubic feet of natural gas per day for a period of 20 years. 
 In April 2013, Dominion announced it had fully subscribed the capacity of the project with 20-year terminal service agreements. ST Cove Point, LLC, a joint venture of Sumitomo Corporation, a Japanese corporation that is one of the worlds leading trading companies, and Tokyo Gas Co., Ltd., a Japanese corporation that is the largest natural gas utility in Japan, and GAIL Global (USA) LNG LLC, a wholly-owned indirect U.S. subsidiary of GAIL (India) Ltd., have each contracted for half of the capacity. Following completion of the front-end engineering and design work, Dominion also announced it had awarded its engineering, procurement and construction contract for new liquefaction facilities to IHI/Kiewit Cove Point, a joint venture between IHI E&C International Corporation and Kiewit Energy Company. 
 Cove Point has historically operated as an LNG import facility under various long-term import contracts. Since 2010, Dominion has renegotiated certain existing LNG import contracts in a manner that will result in a significant reduction in pipeline and storage capacity utilization and associated anticipated revenues during the period from 2017 through 2028. Such amendments created the opportunity for Dominion to explore the Liquefaction Project, which, assuming it becomes operational, will extend the economic life of Cove Point and contribute to Dominions overall growth plan. In total, these renegotiations reduced Cove Points expected annual revenues from the import-related contracts by approximately $150 million from 2017 through 2028, partially offset by approximately $50 million of additional revenues in the years 2013 through 2017. 
 In October 2015, Cove Point received FERC authorization to construct the approximately $40 million Keys Energy Project. Construction on the project commenced in December 2015, and the project facilities are expected to be placed into service in March 2017. 
 In November 2016, Cove Point filed an application to request FERC authorization to construct the approximately $150 million Eastern Market Access Project. Construction on the project is expected to begin in the fourth quarter of 2017, and the project facilities are expected to be placed into service in late 2018. 



 
18

 DCGIn 2014, DCG executed binding precedent agreements with three customers for the Charleston project. The project is expected to cost approximately $120 million, and provide 80,000 Dths per day of firm transportation service from an existing interconnect with Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line, LLC in Spartanburg County, South Carolina to customers in Dillon, Marlboro, Sumter, Charleston, Lexington and Richland counties, South Carolina. In February 2017, DCG received FERC approval to construct and operate the project facilities, which are expected to be placed into service in the fourth quarter of 2017. 
 Questar GasIn 2010, Questar Gas began replacing aging high pressure infrastructure under a cost-tracking mechanism that allows it to place into rate base and earn a return on capital expenditures associated with a multi-year natural gas infrastructure-replacement program upon the completion of each project. At that time, the commission-allowed annual spending in the replacement program was approximately $55 million. 
 In its 2014 Utah general rate case Questar Gas received approval to include intermediate high pressure infrastructure in the replacement program and increase the annual spending limit to approximately $65 million, adjusted annually using a gross domestic product inflation factor. At that time, 420 miles of high pressure pipe and 70 miles of intermediate high pressure pipe were identified to be replaced in the program over a 17-year period. Questar Gas has spent about $65 million each year through 2016 under this program. The program is evaluated in each Utah general rate case. The next Utah general rate case is anticipated to occur in 2019. 
 Dominion Energy Equity Method InvestmentsIn September 2015, Dominion, through Dominion Midstream, acquired an additional 25.93% interest in Iroquois. Dominion Gas holds a 24.07% interest with TransCanada holding a 50% interest. Iroquois owns and operates a 416-mile FERC regulated interstate natural gas pipeline providing service to local gas distribution companies, electric utilities and electric power generators, as well as marketers and other end users, through interconnecting pipelines and exchanges. Iroquois pipeline extends from the U.S.-Canadian border at Waddington, New York through the state of Connecticut to South Commack, Long Island, New York and continuing on from Northport, Long Island, New York through the Long Island Sound to Hunts Point, Bronx, New York. See Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information about Dominions equity method investment in Iroquois. 
 In September 2014, Dominion, along with Duke and Southern Company Gas (formerly known as AGL Resources Inc.), announced the formation of Atlantic Coast Pipeline. The Atlantic Coast Pipeline partnership agreement includes provisions to allow Dominion an option to purchase additional ownership interest in Atlantic Coast Pipeline to maintain a leading ownership percentage. In October 2016, Dominion purchased an additional 3% membership interest in Atlantic Coast Pipeline from Duke for $14 million. The members, which are subsidiaries of the above-referenced parent companies, hold the following membership interests: Dominion, 48%; Duke, 47%; and Southern Company Gas (formerly known as AGL Resources Inc.), 5%. Atlantic Coast Pipeline is focused on constructing an approximately 600-mile natural gas pipeline running from West Virginia through Virginia to North Carolina, which has a total expected cost of $5.0 billion 

  to $5.5 billion, excluding financing costs. In October 2014, Atlantic Coast Pipeline requested approval from FERC to utilize the pre-filing process under which environmental review for the natural gas pipeline project will commence. Atlantic Coast Pipeline filed its FERC application in September 2015 and expects to be in service in late 2019. The project is subject to FERC, state and other federal approvals. See Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information about Dominions equity method investment in Atlantic Coast Pipeline. 
 In December 2012, Dominion formed Blue Racer with Caiman to provide midstream services to natural gas producers operating in the Utica Shale region in Ohio and portions of Pennsylvania. Blue Racer is an equal partnership between Dominion and Caiman, with Dominion contributing midstream assets and Caiman contributing private equity capital. Midstream services offered by Blue Racer include gathering, processing, fractionation, and natural gas liquids transportation and marketing. Blue Racer is expected to develop additional new capacity designed to meet producer needs as the development of the Utica Shale formation increases. See Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information about Dominions equity method investment in Blue Racer. 
 SOURCES OF ENERGY SUPPLY
Dominions and Dominion Gas natural gas supply is obtained from various sources including purchases from major and independent producers in the Mid-Continent and Gulf Coast regions, local producers in the Appalachian area, gas marketers and, for Questar Gas specifically, from Wexpro and other producers in the Rocky Mountain region. Wexpros gas development and production operations serve the majority of Questar Gas gas supply requirements in accordance with the Wexpro Agreement and the Wexpro II Agreement, comprehensive agreements with the states of Utah and Wyoming. Dominions and Dominion Gas large underground natural gas storage network and the location of their pipeline systems are a significant link between the countrys major interstate gas pipelines and large markets in the Northeast, mid-Atlantic and Rocky Mountain regions. Dominions and Dominion Gas pipelines are part of an interconnected gas transmission system, which provides access to supplies nationwide for local distribution companies, marketers, power generators and industrial and commercial customers. 
 Dominions and Dominion Gas underground storage facilities play an important part in balancing gas supply with consumer demand and are essential to serving the Northeast, mid-Atlantic, Midwest and Rocky Mountain regions. In addition, storage capacity is an important element in the effective management of both gas supply and pipeline transmission capacity. 
 The supply of gas to serve Dominions retail energy marketing customers is procured through Dominions energy marketing group and market wholesalers. 
 SEASONALITY
Dominion Energys natural gas distribution business earnings vary seasonally, as a result of the impact of changes in temperature on demand by residential and commercial customers for gas to meet heating needs. Historically, the majority of these earnings have been generated during the heating season, which is generally from November to March; however, implementation of rate

  mechanisms in Ohio for East Ohio, and Utah, Wyoming and Idaho for Questar Gas, have reduced the earnings impact of weather-related fluctuations. Demand for services at Dominions gas transmission and storage business can also be weather sensitive. Earnings are also impacted by changes in commodity prices driven by seasonal weather changes, the effects of unusual weather events on operations and the economy. 
 The earnings of Dominions retail energy marketing operations also vary seasonally. Generally, the demand for gas peaks during the winter months to meet heating needs. 
 Corporate and Other 
 Corporate and Other Segment-Virginia Power and Dominion Gas 
 Virginia Powers and Dominion Gas Corporate and Other segments primarily include certain specific items attributable to their operating segments that are not included in profit measures evaluated by executive management in assessing the segments performance or in allocating resources. 
 Corporate and Other Segment-Dominion 
 Dominions Corporate and Other segment includes its corporate, service company and other functions (including unallocated debt). In addition, Corporate and Other includes specific items attributable to Dominions operating segments that are not included in profit measures evaluated by executive management in assessing the segments performance or in allocating resources. 
 REGULATION
The Companies are subject to regulation by various federal, state and local authorities, including the state commissions of Virginia, North Carolina, Ohio, West Virginia, Utah, Wyoming and Idaho, SEC, FERC, EPA, DOE, NRC, Army Corps of Engineers, and the Department of Transportation. 
State Regulations 
 ELECTRIC
Virginia Powers electric utility retail service is subject to regulation by the Virginia Commission and the North Carolina Commission. 
 Virginia Power holds CPCNs which authorize it to maintain and operate its electric facilities now in operation and to sell electricity to customers. However, Virginia Power may not construct generating facilities or large capacity transmission lines without the prior approval of various state and federal government agencies. In addition, the Virginia Commission and the North Carolina Commission regulate Virginia Powers transactions with affiliates and transfers of certain facilities. The Virginia Commission also regulates the issuance of certain securities. 
Electric Regulation in Virginia 
 The Regulation Act instituted a cost-of-service rate model, ending Virginias planned transition to retail competition for electric supply service to most classes of customers. 
 The Regulation Act authorizes stand-alone rate adjustment clauses for recovery of costs for new generation projects, FERC-approved transmission costs, underground distribution lines, 

  environmental compliance, conservation and energy efficiency programs and renewable energy programs, and also contains statutory provisions directing Virginia Power to file annual fuel cost recovery cases with the Virginia Commission. As amended, it provides for enhanced returns on capital expenditures on specific newly-proposed generation projects. 
 In February 2015, the Virginia Governor signed legislation into law which will keep Virginia Powers base rates unchanged until at least December 1, 2022. In addition, no biennial reviews will be conducted by the Virginia Commission for the five successive 12-month test periods beginning January 1, 2015, and ending December 31, 2019. The legislation states that Virginia Powers 2015 biennial review, filed in March 2015, would proceed for the sole purpose of reviewing and determining whether any refunds are due to customers based on earnings performance for generation and distribution services during the 2013 and 2014 test periods. In addition the legislation requires the Virginia Commission to conduct proceedings in 2017 and 2019 to determine the utilitys ROE for use in connection with rate adjustment clauses and requires utilities to file integrated resource plans annually rather than biennially. 
 If the Virginia Commissions future rate decisions, including actions relating to Virginia Powers rate adjustment clause filings, differ materially from Virginia Powers expectations, it may adversely affect its results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. 
 See Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information, which is incorporated herein by reference. 
 Electric Regulation in North Carolina 
 Virginia Powers retail electric base rates in North Carolina are regulated on a cost-of-service/rate-of-return basis subject to North Carolina statutes and the rules and procedures of the North Carolina Commission. North Carolina base rates are set by a process that allows Virginia Power to recover its operating costs and an ROIC. If retail electric earnings exceed the authorized ROE established by the North Carolina Commission, retail electric rates may be subject to review and possible reduction by the North Carolina Commission, which may decrease Virginia Powers future earnings. Additionally, if the North Carolina Commission does not allow recovery of costs incurred in providing service on a timely basis, Virginia Powers future earnings could be negatively impacted. Fuel rates are subject to revision under annual fuel cost adjustment proceedings. 
 Virginia Powers transmission service rates in North Carolina are regulated by the North Carolina Commission as part of Virginia Powers bundled retail service to North Carolina customers. 
 See Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information, which is incorporated herein by reference. 
 GAS
Dominion Questars natural gas development, production, transportation, and distribution services, including the rates it may charge its customers, are regulated by the state commissions of Utah, Wyoming and Idaho. East Ohios natural gas distribution services, including the rates it may charge its customers, are regulated by the Ohio Commission. Hopes natural gas distribution services are regulated by the West Virginia Commission. 


20

Gas Regulation in Utah, Wyoming and Idaho 
 Questar Gas is subject to regulation of rates and other aspects of its business by the Utah, Wyoming and Idaho Commissions. The Idaho Commission has contracted with the Utah Commission for rate oversight of Questar Gas operations in a small area of southeastern Idaho. When necessary, Questar Gas seeks general base rate increases to recover increased operating costs and a fair return on rate base investments. Base rates are set based on the cost-of-service by rate class. Base rates for Questar Gas are designed primarily based on rate design methodology in which the majority of operating costs are recovered through volumetric charges. 
 In addition to general rate increases, Questar Gas makes routine separate filings with the Utah and Wyoming Commissions to reflect changes in the costs of purchased gas. The majority of these purchased gas costs are subject to rate recovery through the Wexpro Agreement and Wexpro II Agreement. Costs that are expected to be recovered in future rates are deferred as regulatory assets. The purchased gas recovery filings generally cover a prospective twelve-month period. Approved increases or decreases in gas cost recovery rates result in increases or decreases in revenues with corresponding increases or decreases in net purchased gas cost expenses. 
 Questar Gas withdrew its general rate case filed in July 2016 with the Utah Commission and agreed not to file a general rate case with the Utah Commission to adjust its base distribution non-gas rates prior to July 2019, unless otherwise ordered by the Utah Commission. In addition Questar Gas agreed not to file a general rate case with the Wyoming Commission with a requested rate effective date earlier than January 2020. This does not impact Questar Gas ability to adjust rates through various riders. See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. 
 Gas Regulation in Ohio 
 East Ohio is subject to regulation of rates and other aspects of its business by the Ohio Commission. When necessary, East Ohio seeks general base rate increases to recover increased operating costs and a fair return on rate base investments. Base rates are set based on the cost-of-service by rate class. A straight-fixed-variable rate design, in which the majority of operating costs are recovered through a monthly charge rather than a volumetric charge, is utilized to establish rates for a majority of East Ohios customers pursuant to a 2008 rate case settlement. 
 In addition to general base rate increases, East Ohio makes routine filings with the Ohio Commission to reflect changes in the costs of gas purchased for operational balancing on its system. These purchased gas costs are subject to rate recovery through a mechanism that ensures dollar for dollar recovery of prudently incurred costs. Costs that are expected to be recovered in future rates are deferred as regulatory assets. The rider filings cover unrecovered gas costs plus prospective annual demand costs. Increases or decreases in gas cost rider rates result in increases or decreases in revenues with corresponding increases or decreases in net purchased gas cost expenses. 
 The Ohio Commission has also approved several stand-alone cost recovery mechanisms to recover specified costs and a return for infrastructure projects and certain other costs that vary widely over time; such costs are excluded from general base rates. See Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. 

 Gas Regulation in West Virginia 
 Hope is subject to regulation of rates and other aspects of its business by the West Virginia Commission. When necessary, Hope seeks general base rate increases to recover increased operating costs and a fair return on rate base investments. Base rates are set based on the cost-of-service by rate class. Base rates for Hope are designed primarily based on rate design methodology in which the majority of operating costs are recovered through volumetric charges. 
 In addition to general rate increases, Hope makes routine separate filings with the West Virginia Commission to reflect changes in the costs of purchased gas. The majority of these purchased gas costs are subject to rate recovery through a mechanism that ensures dollar for dollar recovery of prudently incurred costs. Costs that are expected to be recovered in future rates are deferred as regulatory assets. The purchased gas cost recovery filings generally cover a prospective twelve-month period. Approved increases or decreases in gas cost recovery rates result in increases or decreases in revenues with corresponding increases or decreases in net purchased gas cost expenses. 
 Legislation was passed in West Virginia authorizing a stand-alone cost recovery mechanism to recover specified costs and a return for infrastructure upgrades, replacements and expansions between general base rate cases. 
 Status of Competitive Retail Gas Services 
 The states of Ohio and West Virginia, in which Dominion and Dominion Gas have gas distribution operations, have considered legislation regarding a competitive deregulation of natural gas sales at the retail level. 
 OhioSince October 2000, East Ohio has offered the Energy Choice program, under which residential and commercial customers are encouraged to purchase gas directly from retail suppliers or through a community aggregation program. In October 2006, East Ohio restructured its commodity service by entering into gas purchase contracts with selected suppliers at a fixed price above the New York Mercantile Exchange month-end settlement and passing that gas cost to customers under the Standard Service Offer program. Starting in April 2009, East Ohio buys natural gas under the Standard Service Offer program only for customers not eligible to participate in the Energy Choice program and places Energy Choice-eligible customers in a direct retail relationship with selected suppliers, which is designated on the customers bills. 
 In January 2013, the Ohio Commission granted East Ohios motion to fully exit the merchant function for its nonresidential customers, beginning in April 2013, which requires those customers to choose a retail supplier or be assigned to one at a monthly variable rate set by the supplier. At December 31, 2016, approximately 1.0 million of Dominion Gas 1.2 million Ohio customers were participating in the Energy Choice program. Subject to the Ohio Commissions approval, East Ohio may eventually exit the gas merchant function in Ohio entirely and have all customers select an alternate gas supplier. East Ohio continues to be the provider of last resort in the event of default by a supplier. Large industrial customers in Ohio also source their own natural gas supplies. 
 West VirginiaAt this time, West Virginia has not enacted legislation allowing customers to choose providers in the retail 



 
21

 



  natural gas markets served by Hope. However, the West Virginia Commission has issued regulations to govern pooling services, one of the tools that natural gas suppliers may utilize to provide retail customers a choice in the future and has issued rules requiring competitive gas service providers to be licensed in West Virginia. 
 Federal Regulations 
 FEDERAL ENERGY REGULATORY COMMISSION
Electric 
 Under the Federal Power Act, FERC regulates wholesale sales and transmission of electricity in interstate commerce by public utilities. Virginia Power purchases and sells electricity in the PJM wholesale market and Dominions merchant generators sell electricity in the PJM, MISO, CAISO and ISO-NE wholesale markets, and to wholesale purchasers in the states of Virginia, North Carolina, Indiana, Connecticut, Tennessee, Georgia, California and Utah, under Dominions market-based sales tariffs authorized by FERC or pursuant to FERC authority to sell as a qualified facility. In addition, Virginia Power has FERC approval of a tariff to sell wholesale power at capped rates based on its embedded cost of generation. This cost-based sales tariff could be used to sell to loads within or outside Virginia Powers service territory. Any such sales would be voluntary. 
 Dominion and Virginia Power are subject to FERCs Standards of Conduct that govern conduct between transmission function employees of interstate gas and electricity transmission providers and the marketing function employees of their affiliates. The rule defines the scope of transmission and marketing-related functions that are covered by the standards and is designed to prevent transmission providers from giving their affiliates undue preferences. 
 Dominion and Virginia Power are also subject to FERCs affiliate restrictions that (1) prohibit power sales between Virginia Power and Dominions merchant plants without first receiving FERC authorization, (2) require the merchant plants and Virginia Power to conduct their wholesale power sales operations separately, and (3) prohibit Virginia Power from sharing market information with merchant plant operating personnel. The rules are designed to prohibit Virginia Power from giving the merchant plants a competitive advantage. 
 EPACT included provisions to create an ERO. The ERO is required to promulgate mandatory reliability standards governing the operation of the bulk power system in the U.S. FERC has certified NERC as the ERO and also issued an initial order approving many reliability standards that went into effect in 2007. Entities that violate standards will be subject to fines of up to $1 million per day, per violation and can also be assessed non-monetary penalties, depending upon the nature and severity of the violation. 
 Dominion and Virginia Power plan and operate their facilities in compliance with approved NERC reliability requirements. Dominion and Virginia Power employees participate on various NERC committees, track the development and implementation of standards, and maintain proper compliance registration with NERCs regional organizations. Dominion and Virginia Power anticipate incurring additional compliance expenditures over the next several years as a result of the implementation of new 

  cybersecurity programs. In addition, NERC has redefined critical assets which expanded the number of assets subject to NERC reliability standards, including cybersecurity assets. NERC continues to develop additional requirements specifically regarding supply chain standards and control centers that impact the bulk electric system. While Dominion and Virginia Power expect to incur additional compliance costs in connection with NERC requirements and initiatives, such expenses are not expected to significantly affect results of operations. 
 In April 2008, FERC granted an application for Virginia Powers electric transmission operations to establish a forward-looking formula rate mechanism that updates transmission rates on an annual basis and approved an ROE of 11.4%, effective as of January 1, 2008. The formula rate is designed to recover the expected revenue requirement for each calendar year and is updated based on actual costs. The FERC-approved formula method, which is based on projected costs, allows Virginia Power to earn a current return on its growing investment in electric transmission infrastructure. 
 Gas 
 FERC regulates the transportation and sale for resale of natural gas in interstate commerce under the Natural Gas Act of 1938 and the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978, as amended. Under the Natural Gas Act, FERC has authority over rates, terms and conditions of services performed by Questar Pipeline, DTI, DCG, Iroquois and certain services performed by Cove Point. Pursuant to FERCs February 2014 approval of DTIs uncontested settlement offer, DTIs base rates for storage and transportation services are subject to a moratorium through the end of 2016. The design, construction and operation of Cove Points LNG facility, including associated natural gas pipelines, the Liquefaction Project and the import and export of LNG are also regulated by FERC. 
 Dominions and Dominion Gas interstate gas transmission and storage activities are conducted on an open access basis, in accordance with certificates, tariffs and service agreements on file with FERC and FERC regulations. 
 Dominion and Dominion Gas operate in compliance with FERC standards of conduct, which prohibit the sharing of certain non-public transmission information or customer specific data by its interstate gas transmission and storage companies with non-transmission function employees. Pursuant to these standards of conduct, Dominion and Dominion Gas also make certain informational postings available on Dominions website. 
 See Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. 
 Safety Regulations 
 Dominion and Dominion Gas are also subject to the Pipeline Safety Improvement Act of 2002 and the Pipeline Safety, Regulatory Certainty and Job Creation Act of 2011, which mandate inspections of interstate and intrastate natural gas transmission and storage pipelines, particularly those located in areas of high-density population. Dominion and Dominion Gas have evaluated their natural gas transmission and storage properties, as required by the Department of Transportation regulations under these Acts, and has implemented a program of identification, testing and potential remediation activities. These activities are ongoing.

 The Companies are subject to a number of federal and state laws and regulations, including Occupational Safety and Health Administration, and comparable state statutes, whose purpose is to protect the health and safety of workers. The Companies have an internal safety, health and security program designed to monitor and enforce compliance with worker safety requirements, which is routinely reviewed and considered for improvement. The Companies believe that they are in material compliance with all applicable laws and regulations related to worker health and safety. Notwithstanding these preventive measures, incidents may occur that are outside of the Companies control. 
 Environmental Regulations 
 Each of the Companies operating segments faces substantial laws, regulations and compliance costs with respect to environmental matters. In addition to imposing continuing compliance obligations, these laws and regulations authorize the imposition of substantial penalties for noncompliance, including fines, injunctive relief and other sanctions. The cost of complying with applicable environmental laws, regulations and rules is expected to be material to the Companies. If compliance expenditures and associated operating costs are not recoverable from customers through regulated rates (in regulated businesses) or market prices (in unregulated businesses), those costs could adversely affect future results of operations and cash flows. The Companies have applied for or obtained the necessary environmental permits for the operation of their facilities. Many of these permits are subject to reissuance and continuing review. For a discussion of significant aspects of these matters, including current and planned capital expenditures relating to environmental compliance required to be discussed in this Item, see Environmental Matters in Future Issues and Other Matters in Item 7. MD&A, which information is incorporated herein by reference. Additional information can also be found in Item 3. Legal Proceedings and Note 22 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, which information is incorporated herein by reference. 
 AIR
The CAA is a comprehensive program utilizing a broad range of regulatory tools to protect and preserve the nations air quality. Regulated emissions include, but are not limited to, carbon, methane, VOC, other GHG, mercury, other toxic metals, hydrogen chloride, NOx, SO2, and particulate matter. At a minimum, delegated states are required to establish regulatory programs to address all requirements of the CAA. However, states may choose to develop regulatory programs that are more restrictive. Many of the Companies facilities are subject to the CAAs permitting and other requirements. 
 GLOBAL CLIMATE CHANGE
The national and international attention in recent years on GHG emissions and their relationship to climate change has resulted in federal, regional and state legislative and regulatory action in this area. See, for example, the discussion of the Clean Power Plan and the United Nations Paris Agreement in Environmental Matters in Future Issues and Other Matters in Item 7. MD&A. 
 The Companies support national climate change legislation that would provide a consistent, economy-wide approach to addressing this issue and are currently taking action to protect the 

  environment and address climate change while meeting the growing needs of their service territory. Dominions CEO and operating segment CEOs are responsible for compliance with the laws and regulations governing environmental matters, including climate change, and Dominions Board of Directors receives periodic updates on these matters. See Environmental Strategy below, Environmental Matters in Future Issues and Other Matters in Item 7. MD&A and Note 22 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information on climate change legislation and regulation, which information is incorporated herein by reference. 
 WATER
The CWA is a comprehensive program requiring a broad range of regulatory tools including a permit program to authorize and regulate discharges to surface waters with strong enforcement mechanisms. The CWA and analogous state laws impose restrictions and strict controls regarding the discharge of effluent into surface waters and require permits to be obtained from the EPA or the analogous state agency to discharge into state waters or waters of the U.S. Containment berms and similar structures may be required to help prevent accidental releases. Dominion must comply with applicable aspects of the CWA programs at its current and former operating facilities. From time to time, Dominions projects and operations may impact tidal and non-tidal wetlands. In these instances, Dominion must obtain authorization from the appropriate federal, state and local agencies prior to impacting a subject wetland. The authorizing agency may impose significant direct or indirect mitigation costs to compensate for such impacts to wetlands. 
 GAS AND OIL WELLS
All wells drilled in tight-gas-sand and shale reservoirs require hydraulic-fracture stimulation to achieve economic production rates and recoverable reserves. The majority of Wexpros current and future production and reserve potential is derived from reservoirs that require hydraulic-fracture stimulation to be commercially viable. Currently, all well construction activities, including hydraulic-fracture stimulation and management and disposal of hydraulic fracturing fluids, are regulated by federal and state agencies that review and approve all aspects of gas- and oil-well design and operation. New environmental initiatives, proposed federal and state legislation, and rule-making pertaining to hydraulic fracture stimulation could increase Wexpros costs, restrict its access to natural gas reserves and impose additional permitting and reporting requirements. These potential restrictions on the use of hydraulic-fracture stimulation could materially affect Dominions ability to develop gas and oil reserves. 
 OTHER REGULATIONS
Other significant environmental regulations to which the Companies are subject include the CERCLA (providing for immediate response and removal actions, and contamination clean up, in the event of releases of hazardous substances into the environment), the Endangered Species Act (prohibiting activities that can result in harm to specific species of plants and animals), and federal and state laws protecting graves, sacred sites and cultural resources, including those of Native American populations. These regulations can result in compliance costs and potential adverse effects 


23

 



  on project plans and schedules such that the Companies businesses may be materially affected. 
 Nuclear Regulatory Commission 
 All aspects of the operation and maintenance of Dominions and Virginia Powers nuclear power stations are regulated by the NRC. Operating licenses issued by the NRC are subject to revocation, suspension or modification, and the operation of a nuclear unit may be suspended if the NRC determines that the public interest, health or safety so requires. 
 From time to time, the NRC adopts new requirements for the operation and maintenance of nuclear facilities. In many cases, these new regulations require changes in the design, operation and maintenance of existing nuclear facilities. If the NRC adopts such requirements in the future, it could result in substantial increases in the cost of operating and maintaining Dominions and Virginia Powers nuclear generating units. See Note 22 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. 
 The NRC also requires Dominion and Virginia Power to decontaminate their nuclear facilities once operations cease. This process is referred to as decommissioning, and Dominion and Virginia Power are required by the NRC to be financially prepared. For information on decommissioning trusts, see Dominion Generation-Nuclear Decommissioning above and Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. See Note 22 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information on spent nuclear fuel. 
 

ENVIRONMENTAL STRATEGY
Environmental stewardship is embedded in the Companies culture and core values and is the responsibility of all employees. They are committed to working with their stakeholders and the communities in which the Companies operate to find sustainable solutions to the energy and environmental challenges that confront the Companies and the U.S. The Companies are committed to delivering reliable, clean and affordable energy while protecting the environment and strengthening the communities they serve. The Companies are dedicated to meeting their customers growing energy needs with innovative, sustainable solutions. It is the Companies belief that sustainable solutions must balance the interdependent goals of environmental stewardship and economic prosperity. Their integrated strategy to meet this objective consists of four major elements: 

 | Compliance with applicable environmental laws, regulations and rules;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Conservation and load management;
--+----------------------------------


 | Renewable generation development; and
--+--------------------------------------


 | Improvements in other energy infrastructure, including natural gas operations.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 This strategy incorporates the Companies efforts to voluntarily reduce GHG emissions, which are described below. See Dominion Generation-Properties and Dominion Energy-Properties for more information on certain of the projects described below. 
 Conservation and Load Management 
 Conservation and load management play a significant role in meeting the growing demand for electricity. The Regulation Act 

  provides incentives for energy conservation through the implementation of conservation programs. Additional legislation in 2009 added definitions of peak-shaving and energy efficiency programs, and allowed for a margin on operating expenses and recovery of revenue reductions related to energy efficiency programs. 
 Virginia Powers DSM programs, implemented with Virginia Commission and North Carolina Commission approval, provide important incremental steps in assisting customers to reduce energy consumption through programs that include energy audits and incentives for customers to upgrade or install certain energy efficient measures and/or systems. The DSM programs began in Virginia in 2010 and in North Carolina in 2011. Currently, there are residential and non-residential DSM programs active in the two states. Virginia Power continues to evaluate opportunities to redesign current DSM programs and develop new DSM initiatives in Virginia and North Carolina. 
 In Ohio, East Ohio offers three DSM programs, approved by the Ohio Commission, designed to help customers reduce their energy consumption. 
 Questar Gas offers an energy-efficiency program, approved by the Utah and Wyoming Commissions, designed to help customers reduce their energy consumption. 
 Virginia Power continues to upgrade meters throughout Virginia to AMI, also referred to as smart meters. The AMI meter upgrades are part of an ongoing demonstration effort to help Virginia Power further evaluate the effectiveness of AMI meters in monitoring voltage stability, remotely turn off and on electric service, increase detection and reporting capabilities with respect to power outages and restorations, obtain remote daily meter readings and offer dynamic rates. 
 Renewable Generation 
 Renewable energy is also an important component of a diverse and reliable energy mix. Both Virginia and North Carolina have passed legislation setting targets for renewable power. Dominion is committed to meeting Virginias goals of 12% of base year electric energy sales from renewable power sources by 2022, and 15% by 2025, and North Carolinas Renewable Portfolio Standard of 12.5% by 2021 and continues to add utility-scale solar capacity in Virginia. 
 See Operating Segments and Item 2. Properties for additional information, including Dominions merchant solar properties. 
 Improvements in Other Energy Infrastructure 
 Dominions existing five-year investment plan includes significant capital expenditures to upgrade or add new electric transmission and distribution lines, substations and other facilities to meet growing electricity demand within its service territory, maintain reliability and address environmental requirements. These enhancements are primarily aimed at meeting Dominions continued goal of providing reliable service, and are intended to address both continued population growth and increases in electricity consumption by the typical consumer. An additional benefit will be added capacity to efficiently deliver electricity from the renewable projects now being developed or to be developed in the future. See Properties in Item 1. Business, Operating Segments, DVP for additional information. 
 Dominion and Dominion Gas, in connection with their existing five-year investment plans, are also pursuing the construction 



 
24

 



  or upgrade of regulated infrastructure in their natural gas businesses. See Properties and Investments in Item 1. Business, Operating Segments, Dominion Energy for additional information, including natural gas infrastructure projects. 
 The Companies GHG Management Strategy 
 The Companies have not established a standalone GHG emissions reduction target or timetable, but they are actively engaged in GHG emission reduction efforts. The Companies have an integrated strategy for reducing GHG emission intensity with diversification and lower carbon intensity as its cornerstone. The principal components of the strategy include initiatives that address electric energy management, electric energy production, electric energy delivery and natural gas storage, transmission and delivery, as follows: 

 | Enhance conservation and energy efficiency programs to help customers use energy wisely and reduce environmental impacts;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Expand the Companies renewable energy portfolio, principally solar, wind power, fuel cells and biomass, to help diversify the Companies fleet, meet state renewable energy targets and lower the carbon footprint;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Evaluate other new generating capacity, including low emissions natural-gas fired and emissions-free nuclear units to meet customers future electricity needs;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Construct new electric transmission infrastructure to modernize the grid, promote economic security and help deliver more green energy to population centers where it is needed most;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Construct new natural gas infrastructure to expand availability of this cleaner fuel, to reduce emissions, and to promote energy and economic security both in the U.S. and abroad;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Implement and enhance voluntary methane mitigation measures through the EPAs Natural Gas Star and Methane Challenge programs; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | As part of their commitment to compliance with such environmental laws, Dominion and Virginia Power have sold or closed a number of coal-fired generation units over the past several years, and may close additional units in the future.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Since 2000, Dominion and Virginia Power have tracked the emissions of their electric generation fleet, which employs a mix of fuel and renewable energy sources. Comparing annual year 2015 to annual year 2000, the entire electric generating fleet (based on ownership percentage) reduced its average CO2 emissions rate per MWh of energy produced from electric generation by approximately 43%. Comparing annual year 2015 to annual year 2000, the regulated electric generating fleet (based on ownership percentage) reduced its average CO2 emissions rate per MWh of energy produced from electric generation by approximately 23%. Dominion and Virginia Power do not yet have final 2016 emissions data. 
 Dominion also develops a comprehensive GHG inventory annually. For Dominion Generation, Dominions and Virginia Powers direct CO2 equivalent emissions, based on ownership percentage, were 34.3 million metric tons and 30.9 million metric tons, respectively, in 2015, compared to 33.6 million metric tons and 30.1 million metric tons, respectively, in 2014. For the DVP operating segments electric transmission and distribution operations, direct CO2 equivalent emissions for 2015 were 53,819 metric tons, compared to 75,671 metric tons in 2014. For 2015, 

  DTIs and Cove Points direct CO2 equivalent emissions together were 1.0 million metric tons, decreasing from 1.3 million metric tons in 2014, and Hopes and East Ohios direct CO2 equivalent emissions together remained unchanged since 2014 at 0.9 million metric tons. The Companies GHG inventory follows all methodologies specified in the EPA Mandatory Greenhouse Gas Reporting Rule, 40 Code of Federal Regulations Part 98 for calculating emissions. 
 

CYBERSECURITY
In an effort to reduce the likelihood and severity of cyber intrusions, the Companies have a comprehensive cybersecurity program designed to protect and preserve the confidentiality, integrity and availability of data and systems. In addition, the Companies are subject to mandatory cybersecurity regulatory requirements, interface regularly with a wide range of external organizations, and participate in classified briefings to maintain an awareness of current cybersecurity threats and vulnerabilities. The Companies current security posture and regulatory compliance efforts are intended to address the evolving and changing cyber threats. See Item 1A. Risk Factors for additional information.
