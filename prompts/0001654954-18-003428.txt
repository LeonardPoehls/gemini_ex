 ITEM 1. BUSINESS
 
  Recent Developments
 
  On February 7, 2018, Cord Blood America, Inc. (“CBAI” or the “Company” or “We”) announced that it entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement, dated as of February 6, 2018 (the “Purchase Agreement”), with California Cryobank Stem Cell Services LLC (“FamilyCord”).
 
  Pursuant to the terms of the Purchase Agreement, FamilyCord agreed to acquire from CBAI substantially all of the assets of CBAI and its wholly-owned subsidiaries and to assume certain liabilities of CBAI and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. The sale does not include CBAI’s cash and certain other excluded assets and liabilities. FamilyCord agreed to pay a purchase price of $15,500,000 in cash at closing with $3,000,000 of the purchase price deposited into escrow to secure CBAI’s indemnification obligations under the Purchase Agreement. The sale, which is subject to the closing conditions described below, is expected to close as soon as practicable, but likely during the second quarter of 2018.
 
  The Purchase Agreement contains customary representations, warranties and covenants for a transaction of this type and nature. Pursuant to the terms of the Purchase Agreement, CBAI shall indemnify FamilyCord for breaches of its representations and warranties, breaches of covenants, losses related to excluded assets or excluded liabilities and certain other matters. The representations and warranties set forth in the Purchase Agreement generally survive for two years following the closing.
 
  In connection with the sale, the parties will also enter into a transition services agreement designed to ensure a smooth transition of CBAI’s business from CBAI to FamilyCord.
 
  The consummation of the sale is dependent upon the satisfaction or waiver of a number of closing conditions, including among other things, approval by CBAI’s shareholders, receipt of certain third-party consents and FamilyCord obtaining external financing. The Purchase Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the date of closing by mutual agreement of the parties, or by either party under certain circumstances set forth in the Purchase Agreement, including by either party if the closing has not occurred within six months of the execution of the Purchase Agreement, by FamilyCord for CBAI’s failure to obtain its shareholders’ approval of the asset sale, by FamilyCord if CBAI pursues an alternative superior transaction or by FamilyCord if it is unable to obtain necessary financing. The Purchase Agreement also sets forth termination fees that may be payable by one party to the other under certain circumstances of termination.
 
  A copy of the Purchase Agreement was attached as Exhibit 2.1 to the Form 8-K filed by the Company on February 8, 2018.
  
 The Red Oak Fund, LP, The Red Oak Long Fund, LP and Pinnacle Opportunities Fund, LP (collectively, the “Shareholders”), which own 164,073,684, 76,226,316 and 140,752,632 shares of CBAI’s common stock, respectively, or approximately 30.0% of CBAI’s issued and outstanding common stock in the aggregate, and each of which are affiliates of Red Oak Partners, LLC, entered into a voting agreement (the “Voting Agreement”) with FamilyCord and CBAI on February 6, 2018, pursuant to which the Shareholders have agreed, among other things, to vote their shares (the “Covered Shares”) in favor of the asset sale and grant to FamilyCord an irrevocable proxy with respect to their respective Covered Shares.
  
 Assets and liabilities included in the Purchase Agreement are now classified as assets and liabilities held for sale and operations related to these assets and liabilities are classified as discontinued operations for all years presented.
  
 Upon closing of the transaction, the Company will have no or nominal operations and no or nominal assets and will therefore considered to be a “Shell Company” as that term is defined in Rule 12b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”).

  Industry Background of Cord
 
 The human body is comprised of many types of cells with individual characteristics and specific functions. Cells with a defined or specialized function are referred to as differentiated. Examples of differentiated cells include nerve cells, red blood cells and skin cells. Differentiated cells are replaced and renewed over time from a population of rare, undifferentiated cells known as stem cells. As stem cells grow and proliferate, they are capable of producing both additional stem cells as well as cells that have differentiated to perform a specific function. Stem cell differentiation is prompted by specific cell-to-cell interactions or other molecular signals. These signals trigger a change in the cell’s genetic profile, causing specific genes to become active and others to become inactive. As a result, the cell develops specialized structures, features and functions representative of its differentiated cell type.

 There are many types of stem cells in the human body. These stem cells are found in different concentrations and in different locations in the body during a person’s lifetime. Current thinking suggests that each organ and tissue in the body is founded, maintained and possibly rejuvenated to different degrees, on a more or less continual basis, by specific stem cell populations naturally present in the body. Types of stem cells include:
 
  Hematopoietic stem cells. Hematopoietic, or blood, stem cells reside in the bone marrow, umbilical cord and placenta. They can also be found in an infant’s umbilical cord as well as circulating in very small numbers in the blood. Hematopoietic stem cells generate all other blood and immune system cells in the body.
 
  Neural stem cells. Neural stem cells can be found in the brain and spinal cord and are capable of differentiating into nerve and brain tissue.
 
  Mesenchymal stem cells. Mesenchymal stem cells can be found in bone marrow, cord tissue and adipose tissue and differentiate into bone, cartilage, fat, muscle, tendon and other connective tissues.
 
  Pancreatic islet stem cells. Pancreatic islet stem cells can be found in the pancreas and differentiate into specialized cells of the pancreas including cells that secrete insulin.
 
 The ability of a stem cell to differentiate into multiple types of cells of a certain tissue is referred to as pluripotency. For example, a hematopoietic stem cell has the ability to differentiate into many types of blood and immune system cells. However, stem cells of one tissue type may also generate specialized cells of another tissue type, a characteristic referred to as plasticity. For example, under specific conditions, hematopoietic stem cells have been shown to generate specialized cells of other systems, including neural, endocrine, skeletal, respiratory and cardiac systems. These characteristics make stem cells highly flexible and useful for a number of applications, including the potential use as therapeutics.
 
  Cell therapy. Cell therapy is the use of live cells as therapeutic agents to treat disease. This therapy involves the introduction of cells to replace or initiate the production of other cells that are missing or damaged due to disease. Currently, the most common forms of cell therapy include blood and platelet transfusions and bone marrow transplants.
 
 Bone marrow transplantation is a medical procedure in which hematopoietic stem cells are introduced into the body in order to regenerate healthy, functioning bone marrow. In this procedure, stem cells are obtained from a donor through a surgical procedure to remove bone marrow. The donated bone marrow, including any “captured” stem cells, is then transfused into the patient. Stem cells for transplantation may also be obtained from peripheral blood or umbilical cord blood donations. Sometimes the stem cells used in the procedure are obtained from the patient’s own bone marrow or blood.
 
 Bone marrow transplantation has been successfully employed in the treatment of a variety of cancers and other serious diseases since the 1960s.
 
 The flexibility and plasticity of stem cells has led many researchers to believe that stem cells have tremendous promise in the treatment of diseases other than those currently addressed by stem cell procedures. Researchers have reported progress in the development of new therapies utilizing stem cells for the treatment of cancer, neurological, immunological, genetic, cardiac, pancreatic, liver and degenerative diseases.
 
  Umbilical Cord Blood Banking
 
 The success of current and emerging cell therapies is dependent on the presence of a rich and abundant source of stem cells. Umbilical cord blood has been emerging as an ideal source for these cells. As information about the potential therapeutic value of stem cells has entered the mainstream, and following the first successful cord blood transplant performed in 1988, cord blood collection has grown. In the past decades, multiple public and private cord blood banks have been established to provide for the collection and storage of these cells. Public cord blood banks collect and store umbilical cord blood donated by women at the birth of the child. This blood is stored and made available for a significant fee to an unrelated individual who matches the cord blood stored. The Company does not currently collect or store donated cord blood units. Private, or family cord blood banks such as Cord, collect and store umbilical cord blood on a fee-for-service basis for families. This blood is stored and made available to the family in the event the family needs stem cells for a transplant.

  Umbilical Cord Tissue Banking
 
 An emerging source of stem cells found in the umbilical cord tissue for therapeutic use are Mesenchymal stem cells.  Mesenchymal stem cells, which are abundant in the cord tissue, possess the ability to regenerate into connective tissues including nerves, bones, muscles and ligaments.  While there are currently no clinically approved use for these stem cells, there are clinical trials underway, and many scientists view this source of stem cells as promising resource in the field of regenerative medicine.  In more recent years, many of the private or family cord blood banks have begun offering cord tissue related processing and storage services on a fee-for-service basis for families.   Private cord blood banks typically offer to store a whole segment of the cord tissue, or a service where the Mesenchymal stem cells are isolated from the cord tissue, expanded, and then cryogenically stored.   Cord facilitates whole segment cord tissue processing and storage services.

 In March 2010 the Company acquired, pursuant to a License Agreement, a 10% non-dilutive interest in what became, in December 2010, China Stem Cells, Ltd., a Cayman Islands Company (hereinafter "Cayman"), which indirectly holds a 100% capital interest in AXM Shenyang, a company organized to conduct a Stem Cell Storage Business in China. In exchange for issuance of equity interest in Cayman, under the terms of the Transfer of Technology Agreement the Company agreed to provide technology transfer, knowhow and training in the setup, marketing and operation of the China Stem Cell Storage business. In connection with the License Agreement, the Company will receive royalties equal to 8.5% of "Net Revenues" realized from the China Stem Cell Storage business, over the 15 year term of the agreement, with certain minimum annual royalties’ payable beginning in 2011. The Company has not been paid any royalty balance due to date, and it remains doubtful that any such royalties will be collected.
  
 In December 2010 the Company also acquired the option to provide up to $750,000 of additional capital funding to Cayman through the purchase of Cayman Secured Convertible Promissory Notes and attached Cayman Warrants to acquire its Common Stock. Other Cayman shareholders were granted similar options, with the intent of raising the aggregate up to $1.5 million in additional capital for Cayman and its subsidiaries.
  
 As of December 31, 2017, Cord Blood has exercised this option in part, and provided a total of $400,000 in additional capital to Cayman in 2011 and 2012, and received Cayman Secured Convertible Promissory Notes for this sum along with 50 Cayman Warrants. The Secured Convertible Promissory Notes are convertible into Cayman stock at a conversion price of $1,500 per share, subject to certain adjustments. The Warrants, which were exercisable at an option exercise price of $0.05 per share per share, subject to certain adjustments, expired unexercised on March 31, 2015. The Company recorded a reserve for the entire carrying value of the receivable of $458,706, including interest, as of December 31, 2017.
  
  BioCells Acquisition
  
 In September 2010, the Company entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement (the “Agreement”), with the Shareholders of Biocordcell Argentina S.A., a corporation organized under the laws of Argentina (“Bio”), providing for the Company’s acquisition of 50.004% of the outstanding shares of Bio (the “Shares).
  
 On September 29, 2014, the Company closed a transaction whereby it sold its ownership stake in BioCells, amounting to 50.004% of the outstanding shares of BioCells to Diego Rissola (Purchaser), who is the current President and Chairman of the Board of BioCells and a shareholder prior to the transaction.

 The Purchaser is current with the payment schedule as of December 31, 2017.
 
  VidaPlus
 
 On January 24, 2011, the Company entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement to acquire up to 51% of the capital stock in VidaPlus, an umbilical cord processing and storage company headquartered in Madrid, Spain. The Agreement is organized into three tranches; the first executed at closing with an initial investment of approximately $204,000 (150,000 Euro) for an amount equivalent to 7% as follows; 1% of share capital in initial equity or approximately $30,000 and 6% or an estimated $174,000 as a loan convertible into equity within 12 months of closing. The initial investment was secured by a Pledge Agreement on 270 VidaPlus samples that were incurring annual storage fees. The second tranche provided the opportunity for an additional 28% in share capital through monthly investments based on the number of samples processed in that month (up to a maximum of 550,000 EUR). In connection with Tranche 2, the Company loaned VidaPlus $246,525. Converting the investment from a loan into equity was to take place within 24 months of the date the amount of shares due to the Company pursuant to the second tranche is calculated. According to the Stock Purchase Agreement, the third tranche follows a similar loan to equity agreement as tranche two but for an additional 16% equity at the option of the Company (up to a maximum of 550,000 EUR).
 
 In connection with the VidaPlus Stock Purchase Agreement entered into on January 24, 2011, the Company was obligated to make monthly loans to VidaPlus based on the number of new samples processed and up to a maximum of 550,000 Euro for each of Tranche 2 and 3 of the Agreement. Tranche 2 did contain provisions that provided the Company an option to discontinue funding if certain performance targets were not met.

 In January 2012, the Company exercised its right to convert its Tranche 1 loan into 6% of the outstanding shares of VidaPlus, and as a result, the Company owned a total of 7% of the outstanding shares. At the time of the equity conversion, the Company no longer maintained its Pledge on the 270 VidaPlus samples associated with Tranche 1; however, the Company maintained a liquidation preference in VidaPlus over the money invested by the Company in VidaPlus. Additionally, the Company declined to make any further investment (loan or otherwise) to VidaPlus under either Tranche 2, Tranche 3 or otherwise. Pursuant to the Agreement, CBAI held a pledge over the umbilical cord blood maintenance and storage contracts between VidaPlus and certain of its customers, and all rights contained therein, including but not limited to the rights to administer those contracts and the rights to collect the revenues derived from those contracts, for 328 samples. CBAI held that pledge until such time as it converted the monies paid to VidaPlus under Tranche 2 of the Stock Purchase Agreement into equity into VidaPlus, in accordance with the formulas set forth in the Stock Purchase Agreement. CBAI was required to make that conversion within two years of when the calculation was made as to the amount of shares to which CBAI is entitled pursuant to Tranche 2, which meant that such conversion would take place around or before February 2014. CBAI also held a liquidation preference in VidaPlus for the money the Company invested in VidaPlus. On February 14, 2014, CBAI delivered to VidaPlus its election to convert its loan under Tranche 2 into shares of stock in VidaPlus, including Anti-Dilution shares.  The Company is entitled to an additional ownership stake of approximately 2.24% in connection with the forgoing, bringing its total ownership percentage to approximately 9.24%.
 
 The Company holds approximately 9.24% of the outstanding shares of VidaPlus and has a balance of convertible loans receivable amounting to $246,525. During the year ended December 31, 2012, the Company reviewed the recoverability of the equity investment and loans receivable and the carrying amount exceeds the fair value of the investment as a result of recurring and continued operating losses at VidaPlus. Fair value of the loans receivable is determined based on the discounted future net cash flows expected to be generated by assets pledged against the loans. The Company recorded an impairment of 100% of the book value of the equity investment and convertible loan receivable.
