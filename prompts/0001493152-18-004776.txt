ITEM 1. DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS
GENERAL
 
Curative Biosciences, Inc., formerly Amaize Beverage Corporation, (“the Company”, “the Registrant”, “we”, “us” or “our”) is a life sciences company focused on developing and commercializing novel therapeutics using hemp-derived CBD. Our consumer product segment is focused on manufacturing, marketing and selling plant-based CBD products to a range of market sectors.
 
Through our consumer products business, we plan to manufacture, market and sell consumer products containing plant-based CBD under our brand Curative Biosciences. All of our products are non-psychoactive allowing for the global distribution of our hemp oil into international markets that have a zero tolerance for any levels of THC.
 
We expect to realize revenue from our consumer products business segment to fund a portion of our working capital needs, however, we will need to raise additional capital either through the issuance of equity and/or the issuance of debt. Given the small size of our company and the development stage of the Company, we may find it difficult to raise sufficient capital to meet our needs. We do not have any firm commitments for all of our capital needs, and there are no assurances they will be available to us. We made no sales during the twelve months ended June 30, 2017 or 2016.
 
Our principal executive office address is 2 South Biscayne Boulevard, #3760, Miami, Florida 33131 and our telephone number is (949) 287-3164.
 
ORGANIZATION
 
Curative Biosciences, Inc., formerly Amaize Beverage Corporation is organized under the laws of the state of Nevada. The Board of Directors and the majority shareholders of the Company constituting a total of 9,180,143 shares of common stock (58.44%) approved as of August 29, 2017, in a written consent of the Board of Directors and the majority of the shareholders of the Company as of the same date, a name change from “Amaize Beverage Corporation” to “Curative Biosciences, Inc.” The Company believes that its new name will better reflect the new direction of the Company’s business, that of developing and commercializing novel therapeutics using hemp-derived CBD. The Company seeks to manufacture, market and sell consumer products containing plant-based CBD under our brand Curative Biosciences. On October 6, 2017, the Company filed an amendment to its articles of incorporation (the “Amendment”) with the Secretary of State of the state of Nevada. The Amendment provided for the change of the Company’s name from Amaize Beverage Corporation to its current name, Curative Biosciences, Inc. The Company submitted to FINRA an Issuer Company Related Action Notification for the name change and request for a new trading symbol and is waiting to be declared effective by FINRA. The Company will announce the name and symbol change once it has been declared effective. 
BUSINESS OVERVIEW
 
In November 2013, Richard Damion joined our Company as the acting Chief Executive Officer. He was then approved by the Board of Directors as the Company’s President and Chief Executive Officer in January 2014. On February 15, 2015, the Board of Directors of the Company appointed A.R. Grandsaert as the Company’s new President. Richard Damion resigned as the Company’s President as of that date; however, he remains the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Director.
 
We determined during the first quarter of 2015 that we would transition out of our lower margin, perishable snack food product lines. The Company intends to manufacture and market natural health products and operate within the medical cannabis industry. We are building a portfolio of hemp derived Cannabidiol (CBD) products under our Curative brand. The demand for hemp-derived CBD products has grown at an estimated 22% CAGR over the last three years and is expected to increase substantially over the next five years. Curative Biosciences aims to be a significant player in the industry.
 
We are a virtual company with distributed employees. We focus on staying lean through the employment of cloud based technologies, maintaining low overhead, subcontracting services, creating sales through commissioned brokers, developing products through reputable co-packers and keeping minimum inventory to ensure freshness and shelf life for our customers and distribution partners.
 
OUR PRODUCTS 
 
Our product formulas are derived from natural genetic strains of phytocannabinoid-rich hemp and are grown using 100% organic farming practices. The plants are registered with the Colorado State Department of Agriculture and tested to ensure the THC levels are below .3%. All of our products are non-psychoactive allowing for global distribution into international markets that have a zero tolerance for any levels of THC. The extraction and purification processing technology used in the manufacturing of our products preserves all the phytocannabinoids, terpenes, and plant lipids, while eliminating any remaining THC and chlorophyll.
 
Our Curative brand Softgels have been developed with a patent pending water-soluble liquid with CBD, and other phytocannabinoids including CBG, CBN, CBC, and over 40 naturally present terpenes. We plan to offer the Curative brand of softgels in 30 and 60 count bottles of “body ready” potencies designed to deliver 10mg CBD and 25mg of CBD per serving. We designed the Curative Softgels for maximum absorption and optimum bioavailability without THC. Our pharmaceutical grade formula utilizes proprietary water-soluble hemp oil, increasing bioavailability by an order of magnitude compared with an oil form.
 
Our Curative brand of Tinctures have been developed with cannabidiol (CBD) oil in varying concentrations and formulated using our full spectrum hemp oil blended with hemp seed oil, grape seed oil, or MCT derived from coconut oil. Our Tinctures contain no THC.

DISTRIBUTION 
 
We intend to employ several distribution methods to ensure maximum growth, market share and profitability. Initially, we plan to focus our distribution efforts on ecommerce and targeted specialty retail shops.
 
Our marketing efforts will be focused on online consumers and retail distribution channels in the United States. We believe this approach is ideal for our products market as it provides an opportunity to focus our marketing efforts on educating targeted customers about the potential health benefits of CBD and other key ingredients in our products.
 
INDUSTRY OUTLOOK
 
Hemp Business Journal’s data demonstrates the hemp industry is growing with a 22% CAGR, and they estimate that the hemp industry will grow to $1.8 billion USD in sales by 2020, led by food, body care, and CBD-based products.1,2 
 
The report estimated $130 million USD in hemp-derived CBD sales in 2016. This category is being driven by channel sales in the natural products industry, smoke shops and online verticals, with pharmaceutical players quickly moving into position to capture market share.
 
The US medical cannabis market is a rapidly growing market with estimated retail cannabis sales rising from an estimated $2.2-$2.6 billion USD in 2014 to $7.4-8.2 billion USD in 2018.3 A 2016 Bloomberg report predicted the US cannabis market to reach $50 billion USD by 2026.3

THE LAW AND DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS 
 
For the first time since 1937, industrial hemp has been decriminalized at the federal level and can be grown legally in the United States, but on a limited basis. A landmark provision passed in the Agricultural Act of 2014 recognizes hemp as distinct from its genetic cousin, marijuana. Federal law now exempts industrial hemp from U.S. drug laws to allow for crop research by universities, colleges and state agriculture departments. The new Federal law allows for agricultural pilot programs for industrial hemp “in states that permit the growth or cultivation of hemp.”
COMPETITION 
 
The hemp derived CBD sector of the cannabis industry is in its infancy. Competition is highly fragmented with no dominant player. Curative’s competition will include CW Hemp, Medical Marijuana, Inc., CV Sciences, Bluebird Botanicals, and Elixinol, among others. There are also large nutritional companies that currently do not offer hemp derived CBD products but may in the future. We expect this and new entrants in the marketplace in the coming years.
 
We expect Curative to be competitive in the marketplace as we intend to focus our efforts on social media, education and awareness, beautifully designed eco-friendly packaging, competitive pricing, quality and potency in product formulation and a superior customer experience.
 
CBD RESEARCH
 
A large body of research data on cannabinoids and their potential therapeutic effects on inflammation and oxidative associated diseases, disorders and health conditions has been published. Clinical trials have been conducted on a range of disorders, from general analgesia4 and inflammation5, to major cardiovascular6, oncological7 and neurodegenerative disorders8. This body of clinical trials is publicly available via the National Institutes of Health website9.
