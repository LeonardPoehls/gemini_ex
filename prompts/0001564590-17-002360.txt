Vertical Markets
 The Company promotes a majority of its services through five vertical market focus areas: Technology Service Providers, Manufacturing, Healthcare (which includes services provided to healthcare providers, health insurers (payers), and life sciences companies), Financial Services, and Energy. The remainder of CTG’s revenue is derived from general markets.
 CTG’s revenue by vertical market as a percentage of consolidated revenue for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 is as follows:
 
 
 | 2016 | | | 2015 | | 2014
-----------------------------+------+-------+---+------+-------+-----
Technology service providers | | 35.2 | % | | 31.1 | % | 26.3 | %
Manufacturing | | 24.2 | % | | 25.7 | % | 24.0 | %
Healthcare | | 18.2 | % | | 23.5 | % | 28.6 | %
Financial services | | 7.7 | % | | 7.1 | % | 7.8 | %
Energy | | 5.1 | % | | 5.4 | % | 6.1 | %
General markets | | 9.6 | % | | 7.2 | % | 7.2 | %
Total | | 100.0 | % | | 100.0 | % | 100.0 | %

 
Revenue for the Company's technology service providers vertical market as a percentage of consolidated revenue increased in 2016 as compared with 2015 due to a change in business mix. Revenue from IBM, our largest client, which is included in this vertical market, remained consistent in 2016 as compared with 2015, which aided in minimizing the decrease in revenue in this vertical market. However, revenue from a number of our other vertical markets fell year-over-year. Demand from this vertical market did slow in the 2016 fourth quarter due to a reduction in requirements from IBM. The revenue increase for 2015 as compared with 2014 was due to strong demand for the first three quarters of 2015 from several of the Company's largest clients in its IT staffing services business unit, which are included in this vertical market. Demand from this vertical market did slow significantly in the 2015 fourth quarter, however, as several large clients cut back on their requirements for our services due to their own challenging financial results.
 The revenue in our manufacturing vertical market is primarily generated from several large staffing clients, including Lenovo (through SDI as a vendor manager for Lenovo) which is our second largest client. Revenue from Lenovo and others in this vertical market fell throughout 2016 due to various reductions in requirements.  However, a reduction in revenue in other vertical markets reduced the impact of these losses as a percentage of total revenue. Revenue from Lenovo increased by approximately $7 million in 2015 as compared with 2014 primarily as a result of the acquisition from IBM of the x86 server business.
 In 2014, 2015 and 2016, the demand from our healthcare clients decreased. This decrease was directly related to the U.S. federal government sequestration which cut Medicare reimbursements to hospitals and health systems by 2% starting in April 2013. As a result, the Company’s healthcare revenue, primarily from electronic health records (EHR) and related projects, declined in 2014, and continued to decrease in 2015 and 2016 as the Company continues to transform its business from selling primarily EHR projects to advisory and technical services, outsourcing, and staff augmentation.
 Revenue for the Company’s financial services vertical market as a percentage of consolidated revenue increased in 2016 as compared with 2015 due to a change in business mix. Revenue in this vertical market decreased slightly in 2016, while revenue from a number of the other vertical markets had larger reductions during this time period. During 2015, the percentage of revenue attributable to the financial services market decreased from 2014, primarily due to the fact that most of the revenue generated in this vertical market is in Europe, and there was a significant decrease in the value of the Euro in 2015 as compared with 2014.
 Revenue for the Company's energy vertical market decreased as a percentage of consolidated revenue in 2016 as compared with 2015, and in 2015 as compared with 2014, as demand in this vertical market declined. Generally, the decrease in the price of oil caused several of our clients to reduce their overall spending, including requirements for IT services, in each of 2016, 2015 and 2014.
 For the year ended December 31, 2016, CTG provided its services to approximately 450 clients in North America and Europe. In North America, the Company operates in the United States and Canada, with greater than 99% of 2016 North American revenue generated in the United States. In Europe, the Company operates in Belgium, Luxembourg, and the United Kingdom. Of total 2016 consolidated revenue of $324.9 million, approximately 78% was generated in North America and 22% in Europe. Two clients, IBM and Lenovo (through SDI as a vendor manager), each accounted for greater than 10% of CTG’s consolidated revenue in 2016.

Revenue Recognition and Backlog
 The Company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, when the services have been rendered, when the price is determinable, and when collectibility of the amounts due is reasonably assured. For time-and-material contracts, revenue is recognized as hours are incurred and costs are expended. For contracts with periodic billing schedules, primarily monthly, revenue is recognized as services are rendered to the client. Revenue for fixed-price contracts is recognized per the proportional method of accounting using an input-based approach. On a given project, actual salary and indirect labor costs incurred are measured and compared against the total estimated costs of such items at the completion of the project. Revenue is recognized based upon the percentage-of-completion calculation of total incurred costs to total estimated costs. The Company infrequently works on fixed-price projects that include significant amounts of material or other non-labor related costs which could distort the percent complete within a percentage-of-completion calculation. The Company’s estimate of the total labor costs it expects to incur over the term of the contract is based on the nature of the project and our past experience on similar projects, and includes management judgments and estimates which affect the amount of revenue recognized on fixed-price contracts in any accounting period.
 The Company’s revenue from contracts accounted for under time-and-material, progress billing, and percentage-of-completion methods as a percentage of consolidated revenue for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 is as follows:
 
 
 | 2016 | | | 2015 | | 2014
-------------------------+------+-------+---+------+-------+-----
Time-and-material | | 86.5 | % | | 88.6 | % | 86.2 | %
Progress billing | | 10.8 | % | | 9.5 | % | 11.2 | %
Percentage-of-completion | | 2.7 | % | | 1.9 | % | 2.6 | %
Total | | 100.0 | % | | 100.0 | % | 100.0 | %

 
As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, the backlog for fixed-price and all managed-support contracts was approximately $29.7 million and $30.2 million, respectively. Approximately 75% or $22.2 million of the December 31, 2016 backlog is expected to be earned in 2017. Approximately 68% of the $30.2 million of backlog at December 31, 2015, or $20.7 million, was earned in 2016. Revenue is subject to slight seasonal variations, with a minor slowdown and a decrease in billable resource utilization in months of high vacation and legal holidays (July, August, and December). Backlog does not tend to be seasonal; however, it does fluctuate based upon the timing of entry into long-term contracts.
 Competition
 The IT services market, for both IT solutions and IT staffing services, is highly competitive. The market is also highly fragmented with many providers and no single competitor maintaining clear market leadership. Competition varies by location, the type of service provided, and the client to whom services are provided. The Company’s competition comes from four major channels: large national or international companies, including major accounting and consulting firms and large companies headquartered in India; hardware vendors and suppliers of packaged software systems; small local firms or individuals specializing in specific programming services or applications; and from a client’s internal IT staff. CTG competes against all four of these channels for its share of the market. The Company believes that to compete successfully it is necessary to have a local geographic presence, offer appropriate IT solutions, provide skilled professional resources, and price its services competitively.
Intellectual Property
 The Company has registered its symbol and logo with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office and has taken steps to preserve its rights in other countries where it operates. We regard patents, trademarks, copyrights and other intellectual property as important to our success, and we rely on them in the United States and foreign countries to protect our investments in products and technology. Our patents expire at various times, but we believe that the loss or expiration of any individual patent would not materially affect our business. We, like any other company, may be subject to claims of alleged infringement of the patents, trademarks and other intellectual property rights of third parties from time to time in the ordinary course of business. CTG has entered into agreements with various software and hardware vendors from time to time in the normal course of business, and has capitalized certain costs under software development projects.

Employees
 CTG’s business depends on the Company’s ability to attract and retain qualified professional staff to provide services to its clients. The Company has a structured recruiting organization that works with its clients to meet their requirements by recruiting and providing high quality, motivated staff. The Company employs approximately 3,400 employees worldwide, with approximately 2,700 in the United States and Canada and 700 in Europe. Of these employees, approximately 3,100 are IT professionals and 300 are individuals who work in sales, recruiting, delivery, administrative and support positions. The Company believes that its relationship with its employees is good. No employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement or are represented by a labor union. CTG is an equal opportunity employer.
