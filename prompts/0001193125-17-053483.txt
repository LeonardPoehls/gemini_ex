 As used in this report, the term affiliates refers to distributors that deliver packages of networks to their subscribers, including cable system operators, satellite service distributors and telephone companies (traditional affiliates) and virtual multichannel video programming distributors (virtual MVPDs); and the term OTT services refers to services that deliver video content to consumers over the Internet and includes subscription video-on-demand (SVOD) services and advertising-supported VOD (AVOD) services such as social media platforms and user-generated content digital platforms, but does not include virtual MVPDs. 
 On October 22, 2016, Time Warner entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the Merger Agreement) with AT&T Inc. (AT&T), West Merger Sub, Inc. and West Merger Sub II, LLC, pursuant to which Time Warner will combine with AT&T in a stock-and-cash transaction. The Merger Agreement has been approved unanimously by the boards of directors of both companies. Time Warner shareholders adopted the Merger Agreement at a special meeting of shareholders held on February 15, 2017. Subject to the satisfaction of the remaining conditions in the Merger Agreement, upon consummation of the merger, Time Warners shareholders will receive per share consideration consisting of $53.75 in cash and a specified number of shares of AT&T stock, as set forth in the Merger Agreement and determined by reference to the average of the volume weighted averages of the trading price of AT&T common stock on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) on each of the 15 consecutive NYSE trading days ending on and including the trading day that is three trading days prior to the closing of the merger (the Average Stock Price). The stock portion of the per share consideration will be subject to a collar such that if the Average Stock Price is between $37.411 and $41.349, Time Warner shareholders will receive shares of AT&T stock equal to $53.75 in value for each share of Time Warner common stock. If the Average Stock Price is below $37.411, Time Warners shareholders will receive 1.437 AT&T shares for each share of Time Warner common stock. If the Average Stock Price is above $41.349, Time Warner shareholders will receive 1.300 AT&T shares for each share of Time Warner common stock. The merger is conditioned on the receipt of certain antitrust and other required regulatory consents. The merger is expected to close before year-end 2017. 
 Time Warners business is focused on the production and distribution of high-quality video content to take advantage of growing global demand. Time Warners businesses work together to leverage their strong brands, distinctive intellectual property and global scale to produce and distribute content that resonates deeply with consumers. As the television industry continues to evolve, with developments in technology, rapid growth of new video services and shifting consumer viewing habits, Time Warner is well-positioned to address and capitalize on these changes. Accordingly, the Company is focused on both strengthening its position within the traditional TV ecosystem and pursuing growth opportunities outside the ecosystem, including increasing the content and services offered directly to consumers. 
 Within the traditional TV ecosystem, the Company is a leader in improving the value of traditional multichannel video service subscriptions for consumers and affiliates. The Company is continuing to increase its investment in high-quality distinctive programming, make more of its content available on-demand and on a growing variety of devices and invest in technology to enhance the consumer experience. To make television advertising on Turners networks more attractive and valuable to advertisers and more relevant to consumers, Turner is pursuing a number of initiatives, including developing new advertising offerings that use data and analytics to enable advertisers to better reach their target audiences and improve their ability to measure the effectiveness of their advertisements.

The Company is also capitalizing on growth opportunities outside the traditional TV ecosystem by increasing its investments in new digital products and technologies, including launching OTT services, as well as investing in and obtaining distribution of its content through other companies OTT services. To support this effort, Time Warner is investing in content that will appeal to consumers who view it in a multi-platform, on-demand environment and building technological capabilities, such as in data analytics, video transport and digital product management. In addition, the Company is focused on increasing the digital sales and rentals of its film and television content and is a leader in various initiatives designed to make digital ownership of content more compelling for consumers. 
 The merger with AT&T is consistent with the Companys strategy of ensuring that its content is available to consumers on a wide range of distribution platforms. The Company expects the merger will accelerate the Companys efforts to spur innovation in the media industry and improve the consumer experience in pay television bundles by creating compelling consumer offerings and developing more targeted advertising offerings, and it will accelerate and reduce the risk in Time Warners strategy to distribute content through other online and mobile services, including those offered directly to consumers. 
 At December 31, 2016, the Company had a total of approximately 25,000 employees.

Some of Turners programming is also available on other companies OTT services. 
 Turners digital properties consist of its own digital properties and those it manages and/or operates for sports leagues where Turner holds the related programming rights.

 Turner continues to focus on improving the value of traditional multichannel video service subscriptions for consumers and affiliates and enhancing the value of television advertising for advertisers.

In 2016, Turner launched rebrands of TNT and TBS, shifting its programming toward high-quality distinctive original series that are aimed at engaging younger audiences across multiple viewing platforms. In addition, over the past several years, Turner has broadened the scope of CNNs programming to include compelling storytelling about important events, people and places through original programming, long-form documentaries and films and has strengthened the programming at truTV, where it has rebranded the network to focus on comedy-driven reality and scripted series aimed at young adults. Turner also is continuing to expand the amount of its programming available on demand to its affiliates subscribers, including complete current seasons of programming from Turners networks. As part of its efforts to deliver more value to advertisers and improve the consumer experience, Turner continues to support industry efforts to improve the measurement of viewing and audience engagement across all platforms and is offering new data- and analytics-driven advertising products to enable advertisers to better reach their target audiences and measure the effectiveness of their advertisements, while making advertisements more relevant to consumers. In addition, in 2016, Turner began reducing the advertising loads on primetime original programs on truTV and on certain new original series on TNT. 
 Turner is also increasing its investments in new digital technology and products and different types of content to capitalize on growth opportunities outside the traditional TV ecosystem. To improve its digital streaming capabilities, in 2015, Turner acquired a majority ownership interest in iStreamPlanet Co., LLC (iStreamPlanet), a provider of streaming and cloud-based video and technology services that specializes in streaming large scale, live sporting events. In November 2016, Turner launched its first domestic SVOD service, FilmStruck, which offers contemporary and classic arthouse, independent and foreign films and related content. Turner is also developing content for distribution outside the traditional television ecosystem. These initiatives include Great Big Story, an independent storytelling brand that creates original digital content aimed at urban millennial audiences and is distributed via social media platforms, and Super Deluxe, a comedy-focused digital production studio that produces content for its own audiences on social media platforms, as well as other programming distributors and sponsors. Turner is also increasingly investing in programming for its networks that will engage audiences across multiple platforms. 
 Turner is continuing to increase its scale and strengthen its competitive position internationally through strategic regional channel launches, partnerships and acquisitions in key territories, and it is placing greater emphasis on creating local programming to strengthen its brands internationally.

How Turner Generates Revenues 
 Turner generates revenues principally from licensing programming to affiliates that have contracted to receive and distribute the programming to subscribers, the sale of advertising on its networks and the digital properties it owns or manages for other companies, and the license of its original programming and its brands and characters for consumer products and other business ventures. Turners license agreements with its affiliates are typically multi-year arrangements that provide for annual service fee increases and have fee arrangements that are generally related to the number of subscribers served by the affiliate, the package of programming provided to the affiliate by each network and the competitive environment. Turners advertising revenues are generated from a wide variety of advertiser categories, and the advertising arrangements for its networks generally have terms of one year or less. In the U.S., the advertising revenues generated by Turner are a function of the size and demographics of the audience delivered, the number of units of time sold and the price per unit. Turner sells some of its advertising inventory in the upfront market in advance each year and other inventory in the scatter market closer to the time a program airs. Outside the U.S., advertising is generally sold at a fixed rate for the unit of time sold, determined by the time of day and network.

Half of the top eighty feature films theatrically released in 2016 (as determined based on domestic box office receipts) will be exhibited exclusively on the HBO and Cinemax premium pay television and OTT services during the applicable license periods. Home Box Office also has agreements to license older films with Fox, Universal, Warner Bros. and a number of other major studios and independent distributors. 
International Programming

Home Box Office also has agreements to license older films from a number of major U.S. studios and other domestic and international independent distributors. In addition to films, Home Box Offices international content offerings may feature local language original programming and/or U.S. television programming produced by other production studios. 
Home Box Offices Businesses and Revenues 
 Domestic Premium Pay Television and OTT Services

 Home Box Offices license agreements with affiliates are typically long-term arrangements that provide for annual service fee increases and marketing support.

 Unique, country-specific HBO- and Cinemax-branded premium pay, basic tier television and OTT services are distributed in more than 60 countries in Latin America, Europe and Asia. In Europe and Asia, Home Box Office operates through consolidated, wholly-owned subsidiaries. In Latin America, Home Box Office operates through an unconsolidated joint venture. Home Box Office had approximately 85 million international premium pay, basic tier television service and OTT service subscribers at December 31, 2016, including subscribers through Home Box Offices unconsolidated joint ventures. HBO GO was available to HBO premium pay television subscribers in over 30 countries and territories at December 31, 2016, and Home Box Office plans to make HBO GO available to HBO premium pay television subscribers in additional countries and territories in 2017. Home Box Office generates revenues primarily from licensing its programming to international affiliates. The terms of Home Box Offices agreements with its international affiliates vary from country to country, and the amount of revenues attributable to such agreements can be based on a number of factors such as basic and/or pay television subscriber thresholds, performance-based or volume discounts, negotiated minimum guarantees or flat-fee arrangements. 
 Home Box Office operates OTT services in the Nordic region and Spain (launched in November 2016). In addition, HBO Latin America (Home Box Offices largest joint venture) provides OTT services in Colombia, Mexico, Brazil (launched in December 2016) and Argentina (launched in December 2016). Home Box Office expects to expand the distribution of OTT services to additional territories around the world. 
 Home Entertainment and Content Licensing 
 Home Box Office also generates revenues from the exploitation of its original programming through multiple other distribution outlets. Home Box Office sells its original programming in both physical and digital formats in the U.S. and various international regions through a wide variety of digital storefronts and traditional retailers. Significant home entertainment releases in 2016 included Game of Thrones: The Complete Fifth Season, Game of Thrones: The Complete Sixth Season, Silicon Valley: The Complete Second Season and Veep: The Complete Fourth Season. In addition, Home Box Office also licenses some of its library programming to the Amazon Prime SVOD service. Finally, Home Box Office has also licensed some of its original programming, such as Sex and the City, as well as Everybody Loves Raymond, which was produced by Home Box Office but originally aired on broadcast television, to domestic basic cable networks and local television stations. 
 Home Box Office licenses both individual programs and packages of programs to television networks and OTT services in over 150 countries, including arrangements under which it licenses programming to television networks that are branded as the Home of HBO in countries such as the U.K., Australia, France, Germany and Israel and as HBO Canada in Canada. In 2016, Home Box Office expanded its agreement with Sky Television, which provides Sky Atlantic exclusive rights to air HBO programming in Austria, Germany, Ireland, Italy and the U.K. until 2020.

DramaFever has both the technology platform and direct consumer expertise that will enable Warner Bros. to build, launch and operate a portfolio of 
 
10 
 
 OTT service offerings. Warner Bros. Digital Networks also oversees Machinima (acquired by Warner Bros. in 2016), a global aggregator of gaming, superhero and fandom-generated content. Warner Bros.

 Television 
 Warner Bros. is a leader in the global television production and distribution business. Warner Bros. is focused on maintaining its leadership position in producing primetime series for the U.S. broadcast networks (including The CW broadcast network (The CW)) while increasing production of high-quality original series for basic cable networks (including expanding its collaboration with Turner), premium pay television services (including HBO) and OTT services. Warner Bros. is also expanding its international local television production business by using its global network of local production companies. 
 Warner Bros. is actively collaborating with Turner to significantly expand their global kids businesses and maximize the related consumer product opportunities.

Warner Bros. has continued to strategically license in-season stacking rights to the networks and OTT services licensing Warner Bros. programming. After the initial domestic television airing, Warner Bros. licenses its television programming for subsequent airing on basic cable networks, local television stations and OTT services. These licenses enable Warner Bros. to generate significant revenues from hit television series for years beyond their initial airing on television. 
 Warner Bros. also licenses its feature films to broadcast and cable networks, OTT services and premium pay television services (including HBO) starting approximately eight to nine months following their theatrical release. During 2016, Warner Bros. licensed hundreds of feature films and thousands of hours of feature film programming to television networks, premium pay television services and OTT services. 
 International Business 
 Warner Bros. licenses rights to exhibit its feature films and original television series in international territories through agreements with television networks, premium pay television services, basic tier television services and OTT services. Warner Bros. licenses rights to exhibit feature films to an SVOD service in China, and feature films and original television series to HOOQ, an SVOD service operating in India, Indonesia, the Philippines, Singapore and Thailand, which is owned by Warner Bros., Singtel Telecommunications Limited and Sony Pictures Television. During 2016, Warner Bros. licensed thousands of hours of programming, dubbed or subtitled in more than 90 languages, to international distributors in more than 190 countries. 
 As the worldwide demand for locally produced, local language programming increases, Warner Bros. is focused on expanding its international local production business. Warner Bros. is developing programming specifically tailored for local audiences through its global network of production companies. Warner Bros. is also adapting international local programming into formats that can be produced by its local production companies in additional territories, including the U.S. For example, The Bachelor (a format owned by Warner Bros. that originated in the U.S.) is being adapted and produced in multiple international territories, including Australia, Finland, Germany, New Zealand, Sweden and Switzerland. 
Television Business Revenues 
 The revenues generated by Warner Bros. television business consist of (1) fees for the initial broadcast of Warner Bros. television programming on U.S. broadcast and cable television networks and premium pay television and OTT services, (2) fees for the airing or other distribution of its television programming after its initial broadcast in secondary U.S. distribution channels (such as basic cable networks, local television stations and OTT services), (3) fees for the international distribution of Warner Bros. television programming for free-to-air television, basic tier television services, premium pay television services and OTT services, and (4) revenues from the sale of the television programming of Warner Bros. and other companies in physical and digital formats. Warner Bros. television programming also supports Warner Bros. key brands and franchises, which helps generate consumer product and brand licensing revenues based on the programming for years beyond the initial airing of the programming on television. 
Feature Films 
 Warner Bros. is a leader in the feature film business and produces feature films under its Warner Bros. and New Line Cinema banners. Warner Bros. also enters into arrangements with others to co-produce and co-finance feature films. Warner Bros. produces and distributes a wide-ranging slate of films, and it is focused on building its film slate around its strongest franchises with global appeal. Warner Bros. plans to release six to eight event films each year that target a wide audience domestically and internationally. 
 During 2016, Warner Bros. released 19 original feature films for distribution in the U.S., including Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice, Central Intelligence, The Conjuring 2, Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them, The Legend of Tarzan, Lights Out, Me Before You, Suicide Squad, Storks and Sully. Of the films released during 2016, five were released in 3D format and five were formatted for viewing on IMAX screens. In February 2017, Warner Bros. released Fist Fight and The LEGO Batman Movie. Warner Bros. plans to release an additional 17 films during 2017, including Dunkirk from Christopher Nolan and two films based on DC Entertainment characters (Justice League and Wonder Woman). 

12 
 
Internationally, Warner Bros. produces and distributes both English language and local language films for theatrical exhibition in more than 125 territories outside the U.S. Warner Bros. uses both day and date and a staggered release schedule for its international releases. In 2016, Warner Bros. released internationally 15 English-language films and 43 local-language films that it either produced itself or acquired from other companies. In March 2016, Flagship Entertainment, a joint venture between Warner Bros. and China Media Capital, announced its inaugural slate of Chinese-language films for distribution in China and elsewhere around the world. 
 After the theatrical exhibition of its feature films, Warner Bros. releases them both domestically and internationally for distribution in various time periods through a variety of distribution channels, including retail stores, online and digital retailers; premium pay television services; broadcast and basic cable networks; OTT services and other exhibitors such as airlines and hotels. Feature films are released for sale through physical and digital formats and for rental via transactional VOD beginning approximately three to six months after their release in theaters. The date for that release is influenced by seasonality, competitive conditions, film attributes and expected performance. Feature films are typically released for rental in physical formats 28 days later. After that, Warner Bros. licenses the feature films for domestic and international distribution to premium pay television services (including HBO and Cinemax), broadcast and basic cable networks (including Turners networks), and OTT services and, in most cases, other exhibitors such as airlines and hotels. 
 Warner Bros. produces most of the films it releases in the U.S. under co-financing arrangements, which give Warner Bros. a greater ability to manage the financial risks of its film slate and offset some of the significant costs involved in the production, marketing and distribution of feature films, particularly event films. In most cases, Warner Bros. maintains worldwide distribution rights for the films it co-finances with others. Warner Bros. has co-financing arrangements with MGM Holdings Inc., RatPac Dune Entertainment and Village Roadshow Pictures. Warner Bros. also enters into co-financing arrangements with other studios. Warner Bros. monetizes its distribution and marketing operations by distributing films that other companies wholly finance and produce, and it has an exclusive distribution arrangement with Alcon Entertainment. 
 Feature Film Business Revenues 
 The revenues generated by Warner Bros. feature film business primarily consist of (1) rental fees paid by theaters for the theatrical exhibition of feature films produced (or co-produced) and/or distributed by Warner Bros., (2) licensing fees paid by television networks, premium pay television services and OTT services for the exhibition of feature films produced or co-produced by Warner Bros. and (3) revenues from the distribution of Warner Bros. and other companies feature films in physical and digital formats. Warner Bros. feature films also support Warner Bros. key brands and franchises, which helps generate consumer product and brand licensing revenues based on its films and characters. 
Home Entertainment 
 Warner Bros. also generates revenues through the home entertainment distribution of its film and television content in physical and digital formats. Warner Bros. continues to be a leader in the home entertainment industry, and its significant home entertainment releases during 2016 included Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice, Central Intelligence, The Conjuring 2 and Suicide Squad. 
 The home entertainment industry has been undergoing significant changes as it transitions from the distribution of film and television content via physical formats to digital formats. In recent years, consumer spending on home entertainment product in physical formats has declined as a result of several factors, including consumers shifting to digital purchases and transactional VOD rentals of content; changing retailer initiatives and strategies; retail store closures; increasing competition for consumer discretionary time and spending; and piracy. Consumers have also been increasingly shifting to OTT services that are based on a subscription model rather than a transactional model. Consumer spending on film and television content in higher margin digital formats has been increasing in recent years, but that growth has not fully offset declines in consumer spending on home entertainment product in physical formats. 
 In response to these dynamics, Warner Bros. has been focusing on increasing the more profitable electronic sell-through (EST) sales and transactional VOD rentals of its film and television content and is an innovator in a variety of initiatives designed to make digital ownership more compelling for consumers, including providing enhanced content offerings, improving digital storefronts and promoting industry standards for content portability across retail platforms. Warner Bros. licenses its newly released feature films as well as films from its library and its television content to EST and transactional VOD services for viewing online and on mobile platforms in the U.S. and internationally. In the U.S. and most major international territories, Warner Bros. recent theatrical releases are generally released for sale via EST at least two weeks before their release in physical formats and transactional VOD. 
 
13 
 
Although consumer spending on home entertainment product in physical formats has declined in recent years, the distribution of home entertainment product in physical formats still generates significant revenues for Warner Bros. The home entertainment product it distributes in physical formats includes its own feature films and television content, including library content, as well as content acquired from others. Warner Bros. also distributes content in physical formats for others, such as Home Box Office, Turner, the BBC and Sesame Street in the U.S., as well as several content producers outside the U.S. 
 Videogames 
 Warner Bros. develops, publishes and distributes videogames, including mobile and console games. Its videogames are based on intellectual property owned or licensed by Warner Bros. (including DC Entertainment properties, Harry Potter and Mortal Kombat). Warner Bros. is focused on increasing its monetization of its franchises in its videogames business in the future. In 2016, Warner Bros. released 12 videogames, including Batman: Arkham VR, LEGO Marvels Avengers and Mortal Kombat XL. Warner Bros. also released additional character packages for the toys-to-life videogame LEGO: Dimensions, which includes Harry Potter, LEGO Batman and many other DC Entertainment characters among its cast of characters. Warner Bros. plans to release 15 videogames in 2017, including Injustice 2 and LEGO Worlds. Warner Bros. also licenses Warner Bros. and DC Entertainment properties for videogames to other companies. Warner Bros. videogames revenues consist of revenues from the development and distribution of the videogames of Warner Bros. and other companies. 
OTHER TELEVISION NETWORK ASSETS 
 The Company also holds interests in companies that operate broadcast networks. 
 Central European Media Enterprises Ltd. 
 As of December 31, 2016, Time Warner held an approximate 47% voting interest and an approximate 76% economic interest in the equity interests of Central European Media Enterprises Ltd. (CME), a publicly-traded broadcasting company that operates leading television networks in Bulgaria, Croatia, the Czech Republic, Romania, the Slovak Republic and Slovenia. CME also develops and produces content for its television networks. Time Warners investment consists of (i) common stock, (ii) convertible preferred stock that has voting rights, (iii) convertible redeemable preferred shares that do not have voting rights and (iv) warrants to purchase common stock of CME. Time Warner accounts for its investment in CMEs common stock and convertible preferred stock under the equity method of accounting, and it accounts for its investment in CMEs convertible redeemable preferred shares under the cost method of accounting. Time Warner also guarantees all of CMEs outstanding senior indebtedness and provides financing to CME under a revolving credit facility. 
 The CW 
 The CW is a 50-50 joint venture between Warner Bros. and CBS Corporation. The CWs 2016-2017 schedule includes a 5-night, 10-hour primetime lineup of advertising-supported original programming such as The 100, Arrow, Crazy Ex-Girlfriend, DCs Legends of Tomorrow, The Flash, Frequency, iZombie, Jane the Virgin, No Tomorrow, The Originals, Reign, Riverdale, Supergirl, Supernatural and The Vampire Diaries, as well as a five-hour block of advertising-supported programming on Saturday mornings. The CW has entered into an agreement with a third party pursuant to which the third party is programming the Saturday morning programming block through the 2020-2021 season and pays The CW a license fee. For the 2016-2017 season, Warner Bros. and CBS are producing 15 series for The CW, including five based on DC Entertainment characters. Advertising-supported full episodes of The CWs original series are also available on cwtv.com and through The CWs apps for mobile devices and Internet-connected televisions. The CW does not require any login or authentication of a cable subscription to stream its content. The CWs programming is also available through an OTT service after the full season of programming airs on The CW. The CW also operates CW Seed, The CWs digital-only platform for original programming, which is available online and on mobile devices. The Company accounts for its investment in The CW under the equity method of accounting. 
 COMPETITION 
 The Companys businesses operate in highly competitive industries. Competition in these industries has intensified as leisure and entertainment options have proliferated and audience fragmentation has increased. The Companys businesses compete for consumers entertainment and leisure time and spending with each other, as well as other forms of 
 
14 
 
 entertainment, including other television networks, premium pay television services, local over-the-air television stations, OTT services, motion pictures, home entertainment products and services, videogames, print media, live events, radio broadcasts and other forms of news, information and entertainment, as well as pirated content. 
 The Companys competitive position is greatly affected by the quality of, and public response to, its content. The Companys businesses compete with other production companies and studios for the services of producers, directors, writers, actors and others and for the acquisition of literary properties. The Companys television networks and premium pay television services compete for programming with other television networks and premium pay television services, local television stations and OTT services, and competition for programming, particularly licensed and sports programming, is intense. 
 The Company also faces competition for the licensing and distribution of its programming. As a producer and distributor of programming, the Company competes with other studios and television production groups, and independent producers to produce and sell programming. Many television networks have affiliated production companies from which they are increasingly obtaining their programming, which has reduced the demand for programming from non-affiliated production companies. The Company also faces competition from other television networks and premium pay television services for distribution and marketing of its television networks and premium pay and basic tier television services by affiliates. 
 The Companys businesses face significant competition in other areas as well. For example, the Companys television networks and websites compete for advertising with networks, websites, print, radio, outdoor display and other media, and the Companys businesses compete in their character and brand merchandising and other licensing activities with other licensors of characters and brands. 
 REGULATORY MATTERS 
 The Companys businesses are subject to and affected by laws and regulations of U.S. federal, state and local governmental authorities as well as the laws and regulations of other countries and international bodies such as the European Union (the EU), and these laws and regulations are subject to change, including due to regulatory reform measures that might be pursued during the new U.S. Presidential administration. The following descriptions of significant U.S. federal, state, local and international laws, regulations, regulatory agency inquiries, rulemaking proceedings and other developments should be read in conjunction with the texts of the respective laws and regulations and other related materials. 
Intellectual Property Laws 
 Time Warner is one of the worlds leading creators, owners and distributors of intellectual property. The Companys vast intellectual property assets include copyrights in films, television programs, software, comic books and mobile apps; trademarks in names, logos and characters; patents or patent applications for inventions related to products and services; and licenses of intellectual property rights of various kinds. The Company derives value from these assets through its business activities. 
 To protect the Companys intellectual property, the Company relies on a combination of copyright, trademark, unfair competition, patent and trade secret laws and license agreements. The duration of the protection afforded to the Companys intellectual property depends on the type of property, the laws and regulations of the relevant jurisdiction and the terms of its license agreements. With respect to the Companys trademarks and trade names, trademark laws and rights are generally territorial in scope and the Companys rights are generally limited to those countries where a mark has been registered or otherwise protected. While trademark registrations may generally be maintained in effect for as long as the mark is in use in the respective jurisdictions, there may be occasions where a mark or title is not registrable or protectable or cannot be used in a particular country. In addition, a trademark registration may be cancelled or invalidated if challenged by others based on certain use requirements or other limited grounds. In the U.S., the usual copyright term for authored works is the life of the author plus 70 years, and the copyright term for works made for hire is the shorter of 95 years from the first publication or 120 years from the date the work was created. The Company also relies on laws that prohibit the circumvention of technological protection measures and trafficking in circumvention devices. The extent of copyright protection and benefit from laws prohibiting the circumvention of technological protection measures vary in different countries. 
 
15 
 
Piracy, particularly of digital content, continues to present a threat to the Companys revenues from products and services based on intellectual property. The Company seeks to limit that threat through a combination of approaches, including working with cross-industry groups, trade associations and strategic partners to develop and implement technological solutions to control piracy, promoting legitimate market alternatives, applying technological protection measures, engaging in efforts to ensure effective and appropriately tailored legal remedies for infringement, enhancing public awareness of the meaning and value of intellectual property and promoting and advocating for appropriate legislative and policy initiatives both in the U.S. and internationally. The Company vigorously pursues appropriate avenues to protect its intellectual property, including sending takedown notices in appropriate circumstances and pursuing litigation and referrals to law enforcement against websites that distribute or facilitate the unauthorized distribution of the Companys content. The volume of actions against websites dedicated to copyright theft is increasing internationally, and certain countries have implemented or are considering implementing programs or remedies designed to address and deter widespread infringement. 
 Outside the U.S., laws and regulations relating to intellectual property protection and the effective enforcement of these laws and regulations vary greatly from country to country and continue to evolve. Judicial, legislative and administrative developments are taking place in certain jurisdictions that may limit the ability of rights holders to exploit and enforce certain of their exclusive intellectual property rights outside the U.S. For example, in October 2011, the European Court of Justice held, in the context of satellite broadcasts of live soccer matches, that it was an unlawful restriction on competition for Englands Football Association Premier League to prohibit broadcasting licensees from distributing satellite decoder cards outside the territory for which the broadcasts were licensed for reception. As a result of that decision, in January 2014, the European Commission (the EC) began an antitrust investigation of the cross-border access to satellite and online services, and is examining certain provisions in licensing agreements between a number of U.S. film studios, including Warner Bros., and several large European satellite pay TV broadcasters. The EC has stated that its investigation is focusing on contractual restrictions that prevent broadcasters in one EU country from selling subscriptions in response to unsolicited requests from viewers in other EU countries. In July 2015, the EC sent a Statement of Objections to a number of U.S. film studios, including Warner Bros., reflecting its preliminary view that such contractual provisions may violate EU competition rules prohibiting anti-competitive agreements. In January 2016, the EC held a hearing on the matter. The Statement of Objections and hearing are steps in the process, but do not represent a finding of infringement or indicate the outcome of the ECs investigation, which is ongoing. Separately, in 2015, the EC published its Digital Single Market strategy, which includes a broad range of high-level proposals that are intended to promote access to online services and entertainment content across national borders within the EU to foster the creation of a single digital market in the EU. For example, in December 2015, the EC announced a proposal for a regulation to provide content portability to subscribers to certain online content services in an EU Member State who travel temporarily to another EU Member State. It is not possible to predict the impact the ECs investigation or potential regulations and directives in the EU related to the Digital Single Market strategy could have on the Companys businesses. 
 Regulation Relating to Data Privacy, Data Security and Cybersecurity 
 The Companys businesses are subject to laws and regulations governing data privacy, data security and cybersecurity. For example, in the U.S., the Company is subject to: (1) the Childrens Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), which applies to certain of the Companys websites, mobile apps and other online business activities and restricts the collection, maintenance and use of personal information regarding children; (2) the Privacy and Security Rules under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, which imposes privacy and security requirements on the Companys health plans for its employees and on service providers under those plans; (3) the Video Privacy Protection Act, which restricts disclosure of video viewing information; (4) state statutes requiring data security controls and notice to individuals when personally identifiable information (PII) has been accessed or acquired in a data breach; and (5) privacy and security rules imposed by the payment card industry, as well as regulations designed to protect against identity theft and fraud in connection with the collection of credit and debit card payments from consumers. 
 Moreover, several laws, regulations and policies that could affect how the Company collects, uses and protects data are in effect or are being considered in the U.S. and internationally. In the U.S., for example, the Federal Trade Commission (the FTC) frequently issues guidance that sets forth best practices for businesses to build privacy protections into their products and provide consumers greater control over the collection and use of their personal information. In addition, in 2013, the FTC updated its regulations implementing COPPA by expanding the categories of data that are considered personal 
 
16 
 
 information, such as IP addresses, geolocation data and screen names, and updating the requirements for notice, parental consent, confidentiality and security. Self-regulatory bodies also have established requirements to implement notice and opt-out mechanisms and place other limitations on data tracking and usage. 
 Congress, the White House and federal agencies continue to examine and focus on data security and consumer privacy in light of several recent high-profile data security breaches. For example, in December 2015, President Obama signed into law the Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act of 2015 (CISA). The aim of CISA is to promote voluntary sharing of information regarding cybersecurity threats and defensive measures undertaken in response to those threats with the government and other businesses. Members of Congress also remain focused on privacy, data security and cybersecurity, particularly in light of the confirmed and alleged cybersecurity attacks surrounding the 2016 U.S. Presidential election. The adoption of new privacy, data security and cybersecurity laws or regulations may in some cases increase the Companys compliance costs. 
 Several state legislatures have also adopted legislation that regulates how businesses operate online, including measures relating to privacy, data security and data breaches. For example, California law requires operators of websites and online services (including mobile apps) to make disclosures about how the operator or other parties may collect PII about a consumers online activities, including in some cases disclosure of how the operator responds to Web browser do not track signals or other mechanisms that enable consumers to opt out of the collection of such information. Furthermore, California law requires operators of commercial websites and online services to post a privacy policy that meets designated requirements, including providing a list of categories of PII that the operator collects and a list of third parties with whom the PII may be shared. 
 Foreign governments have also focused on data privacy and security concerns for many years. The EC adopted a data directive in 1995 to protect the privacy rights of individuals within the European Union and the transfer of personal information outside the EU (the Directive). In October 2015, the Court of Justice of the European Union (the CJEU) issued an opinion ruling that the U.S.  EU Safe Harbor framework (the Safe Harbor framework), which had been in place since 2000 and was a central mechanism relied on by U.S. organizations, including the Company, to transfer personal data from the EU to the U.S., was invalid. The decision did not invalidate any other legal mechanisms or bases that can be utilized or relied on to transfer personal data from the EU to the U.S. in compliance with the Directive, such as standard contractual clauses, binding corporate rules or individual consent. A new framework called the EU  U.S. Privacy Shield (the Privacy Shield framework), which replaces the Safe Harbor framework, was formally approved by the EC in July 2016. The Privacy Shield framework imposes greater obligations on U.S. companies to protect personal data transferred from the EU to the U.S. and requires the U.S. Department of Commerce and the FTC to carry out stricter monitoring and enforcement. The Company continues to evaluate the mechanisms available to comply with EU/U.S. data transfer requirements to be able to continue to operate its businesses. 
 In April 2016, the European Parliament and the EC adopted the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which will become enforceable in May 2018 and will replace the Directive. The GDPR is intended to support the Single Digital Market strategy within the EU by providing a single set of rules on data protection across the EU, while enabling individuals to better control their personal data. The Company is evaluating the final text of the GDPR to determine its impact on the Companys operations and businesses. 
 Regulation of Television Networks, Internet/Broadband Services, Programming and Advertising 
 The Companys businesses are also subject to a number of laws and regulations relating to the distribution and licensing of television programming, the content of that programming, and advertising and marketing. In the U.S., cable networks and premium pay television services, either directly or indirectly through their distribution partners, are subject to various obligations under the Communications Act of 1934, as amended (the Communications Act), and related regulations issued by the Federal Communications Commission (the FCC). These obligations and regulations, among other things, require closed captioning of programming for the hearing impaired, require certain content providers to make available audio descriptions of programming for the visually impaired, limit the amount and content of commercial matter that may be shown during programming aimed primarily at an audience of children aged 12 and under, and require the identification of (or the maintenance of lists of) sponsors of political advertising.

The FCC continues to examine policies for video programming and distribution, and in 2014 and 2015 it adopted and proposed regulations that could directly or indirectly restrict the Companys ability to produce, distribute or fully monetize its content. For example, in March 2015, the FCC adopted net neutrality regulations that constrain how ISPs can offer broadband and related services that can be used to distribute the Companys programming via the Internet. The net neutrality regulations subject ISPs to the requirements of Title II of the Communications Act, including imposing limitations on unreasonable practices, obligations regarding customer privacy and protections for people with disabilities and authorize the FCC to investigate and act on consumer complaints. The regulations prohibit ISPs from: (i) blocking access to legal content, applications or services or to devices that do not harm their network, (ii) impairing or degrading lawful Internet content and (iii) implementing paid prioritization or fast lanes for content or applications. ISPs generally are permitted to engage in reasonable network management (other than paid prioritization), but only if the purpose of their actions is related to managing their network. In 2015, a trade group, several broadband providers and others (Petitioners) filed lawsuits in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia challenging the net neutrality regulations and, in June 2016, the court found in favor of the FCC and upheld the net neutrality regulations. The Petitioners have filed for rehearing of the case en banc. It is not possible to predict how these lawsuits and net neutrality regulations will impact the Company. 
 In addition, in December 2014, the FCC proposed rules to expand its interpretation of multichannel video programming distributor under the Communications Act to include over-the-top providers of multiple streams of linear programming (i.e., television programming delivered via the Internet in a regularly scheduled, continuous manner, either live or on a delayed basis), which would give these over-the-top providers rights to distribute broadcast network television programming and cable-operator affiliated programming, while also subjecting them to various obligations such as retransmission fees. Depending on the scope and specific provisions of any final rules, they could affect the Companys negotiations regarding, and provision of, online linear video. 
 In February 2016, the FCC proposed rules regarding the interoperability of set-top boxes provided by affiliates with other devices and services. In January 2017, the newly appointed FCC Chairman removed the pending proposals from immediate consideration by the FCC commissioners. If proceedings relating to these proposed rules move forward in the future, any final rules could affect the way the Companys programming is presented to consumers, including with respect to channel placement, branding and the type and placement of advertisements, and could have a negative impact on the Companys copyright protections, as well as the value of the Companys programming, and make it more difficult for the Company to roll out new services. 
 In September 2016, the FCC proposed rules that would constrain how affiliates negotiate carriage agreements with programming providers that are independent of the affiliate or major production studios. The proposed rules would prohibit affiliates from including in such carriage agreements most favored nation clauses that enable the affiliate to receive favorable contract terms that a programming provider has given to another distributor without requiring the affiliate to be subject to any corresponding obligations included in the other distribution agreement. The proposed rules would also prohibit contract provisions that restrict a programming providers ability to distribute its programming through alternative video distribution platforms, including online platforms. It is not possible to predict the impact that any such rules could have on the Company. 
 From time to time, the FCC also conducts inquiries and rulemaking proceedings, which could lead to additional regulations that could have a material effect on the Companys businesses. The FCC has also initiated the following proceedings: 
 

 | The FCC is engaged in a number of proceedings designed to make more of the electromagnetic spectrum that is currently used for broadcast television and satellite distribution available for wireless broadband. These proceedings include conducting voluntary incentive auctions, which began in March 2016, for portions of the spectrum used by television broadcasters to provide additional spectrum for wireless broadband, and evaluating the potential use of certain portions of the satellite spectrum for wireless broadband. The potential changes to the satellite spectrum could negatively impact the Companys ability to deliver linear network feeds of its domestic basic cable networks to its affiliates. It may take several years for these proceedings and any related spectrum reallocation to be completed, and it is not possible to predict the impact that any such proceedings and reallocation could have on the Company.

 | The FCC has initiated several rulemaking proceedings to implement the 21st Century Communications and Video Accessibility Act of 2010 (the Accessibility Act). The FCC changed its television closed captioning rules effective in March 2015 to, among other things, extend certain obligations regarding the quality of closed captioning of television programming to companies that produce video programming. In February 2016, the FCC also announced (i) further changes to the complaint and compliance procedures used for these rules and (ii) that it would require video programmers to submit television captioning certifications directly to the FCC and maintain contact information for captioning complaints on the FCC website. These new rules, which generally have not yet taken effect pending further procedural requirements, will increase the captioning compliance obligations of video programmers such as the Company.

 | In early 2016, pursuant to the Accessibility Act, the FCC proposed rules that would increase the number of hours of audio descriptions of video content required to be provided by video distributors, as well as the number of video distributors subject to such rules. If adopted, the new rules would nearly double the number of required hours of audio-described programming on two Turner networks.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Pursuant to the Accessibility Act, in July 2014, the FCC issued an order requiring closed captioning for clips of video programming that previously aired on television and are posted online or available through online applications in certain circumstances. Under the FCCs rules, video clips that contain a single excerpt of a captioned television program with the same video and audio that was shown on television (straight lift clips) must be captioned, and, beginning in January 2017, the rule was expanded to apply to newly posted video clips that contain compilations of straight lift clips containing content previously shown on television with captions. Starting in July 2017, video clips of live and near-live television programming (such as news or sporting events) must also be captioned. These rules will increase the costs of making video clips available online.

 Various other federal laws also contain provisions that place restrictions on violent and sexually explicit programming. Regulators, legislatures and other policymakers are interested in laws and regulations intended to protect the interests of children by placing limitations on food and beverage marketing in media popular with children and teens. 
 In international territories, there are various laws and regulations relating to the distribution or licensing of television programming and other products. These include television licensing requirements relating to closed captioning of programming for the hearing impaired, descriptive audio versions for the visually impaired and mandatory local language dubbed and/or subtitled versions of programming, laws providing for minimum percentages of local content and maximum percentages of foreign content on television, local language advertising requirements, laws and regulations imposing pricing, exclusivity and importing restrictions, editorial control, translation or local editing requirements and other nationality-based restrictions. There are also a number of laws and regulations in these international territories relating to the nature of content and advertising and marketing efforts, including content codes and laws requiring government approval of certain content prior to exhibition, consumer protection laws (particularly those relating to advertisements and programming aimed at children) and laws restricting the amount of advertising permitted on television networks. For example, the EU Audio Visual Media Services directive, which allows EU member states to adopt more restrictive regimes and applies to all programs produced after December 2009, obligates broadcasters to notify viewers if an audiovisual program contains paid product placement, bans any form of product placement in childrens and news programming and prohibits product placement of tobacco products and prescription medication. The directive also imposes an obligation on EU member states and the EC to encourage broadcasters and channel providers to develop codes of conduct regarding advertising for foods high in fat, salt and sugar in or around childrens programming. Accordingly, in the U.K., the Office of Communications has restricted such television advertising, and other EU jurisdictions have required that nutritional information be included in food advertisements. In May 2016, the EC proposed an amendment to the directive to require that the rules implemented under the directive by EU member states are applied consistently across various platforms, including traditional broadcast networks, VOD providers and video-sharing platforms. The Council of the EU and the European Parliament are reviewing the legislative proposal. Outside the EU, other governments are considering or have already implemented food advertising restrictions similar to those in the U.K., including in Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Chile, Ecuador, Mexico, Norway, Peru, Singapore and Uruguay. Finally, several governments, including in Argentina, Brazil, India, Mexico and Uruguay, have recently proposed, enacted or more strictly enforced regulations that limit the amount of advertising content that can be aired on television networks.

Regulation of the Distribution and Licensing of Feature Films 
 In countries outside the U.S., there are a variety of laws and regulations relating to the distribution or licensing of feature films for exhibition in theaters and on broadcast and cable networks. These include copyright laws and regulations, television licensing requirements similar to those applicable to made-for-television programming, trade and customs regulations, laws providing for minimum percentages of local content in theaters and on broadcast television and maximum percentages of foreign content on television and laws that limit increases in prices paid by distributors to content providers. In certain countries, laws and regulations limit the number of foreign films exhibited in such countries in a calendar year. For example, China, which was the second-largest box office territory based on box office receipts in 2016, limits the number of foreign films that can be distributed annually using revenue-sharing arrangements as well as the percentage of revenue shared with the foreign film distributor. 
 Marketing Regulation 
 The Companys marketing and advertising sales activities are subject to regulation by the FTC, the FCC, and each of the states under general consumer protection statutes prohibiting unfair or deceptive acts or practices. Certain marketing activities are also subject to specific federal statutes and rules, such as COPPA and the Telephone Consumer Protection Act (the TCPA), which restricts telephone, fax or mobile text messages to consumers without their prior consent. Outside the U.S., laws restricting marketing and sales activities also continue to be adopted. For example, the Canadian Anti-Spam legislation (the CASL), which went into effect July 1, 2014, restricts commercial electronic messages to consumers without their prior permission. Both the TCPA and CASL provide for private rights of action, and violations of these laws can result in potential liability, including substantial administrative fines and class action lawsuits. 
FINANCIAL INFORMATION ABOUT SEGMENTS, GEOGRAPHIC AREAS AND BACKLOG 
 Financial and other information by segment and revenues by geographic area for each year in the three-year period ended December 31, 2016 are set forth in Note 16 to the Companys consolidated financial statements, Segment Information. Information with respect to the Companys backlog, representing future revenue not yet recorded from cash contracts for the worldwide licensing of theatrical and television product for premium pay television services, basic cable and network and syndicated television exhibition, at December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, is set forth in Note 17 to the Companys consolidated financial statements, Commitments and Contingencies  Commitments  Programming Licensing Backlog.
