Item 1. Business
Our Company
We are a real estate investment trust, or REIT, that was organized under Maryland law in 2011. We primarily own single tenant, net leased properties. As of December 31, 2016, we owned 121 properties (362 buildings, leasable land parcels and easements) with approximately 44.8 million rentable square feet that were 96.8% leased (based on rentable square feet). These properties consisted of (i) 110 office and industrial properties (133 buildings) with approximately 27.0 million square feet located in 34 states throughout the mainland United States, or our Mainland Properties, and (ii) 11 properties (229 buildings, leasable land parcels and easements) located on the island of Oahu, HI with approximately 17.8 million rentable square feet that are primarily leased to industrial and commercial tenants, or our Hawaii Properties. As of December 31, 2016, our properties were leased to 312 different tenants, with a weighted average remaining lease term (based on annualized rental revenue) of approximately 10.1 years.
Our principal executive offices are located at Two Newton Place, 255 Washington Street, Suite 300, Newton, Massachusetts 02458-1634, and our telephone number is (617) 796-8303.
Acquisition of Cole Corporate Income Trust, Inc. and Sale of Healthcare Properties to Senior Housing Properties Trust
On January 29, 2015, we completed our acquisition of Cole Corporate Income Trust, Inc., a Maryland corporation, or CCIT, pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of August 30, 2014, as amended, or the Merger Agreement, by and among us, SC Merger Sub LLC, a Maryland limited liability company and our wholly owned subsidiary, or SIR Merger Sub, and CCIT. On January 29, 2015, CCIT merged with and into SIR Merger Sub, and the separate corporate existence of CCIT ceased, with SIR Merger Sub surviving as our wholly owned subsidiary, or the CCIT Merger.
At the effective time of the CCIT Merger, we acquired CCIT’s full property portfolio, which included 64 office and industrial net leased properties, or the 64 CCIT Properties, as well as 23 healthcare properties which, as described below, we sold to Senior Housing Properties Trust, or SNH.  The total consideration for our acquisition of CCIT’s full portfolio was approximately $3.0 billion, including the assumption of approximately $297.7 million of mortgage debt principal (of which approximately $30.0 million was assumed by SNH, in the Healthcare Properties Sale (as defined and described below) and excluding acquisition related costs.  Pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, we paid approximately $1.245 billion in cash and issued approximately 28.4 million of our common shares as merger consideration to former holders of CCIT common stock.
Concurrently with the closing of the CCIT Merger, we sold entities acquired in the CCIT Merger which own 23 healthcare properties, or the CCIT MOBs, for approximately $501.7 million in cash, plus the assumption of approximately $30.0 million of mortgage debt principal, to SNH. We refer to this sale as the Healthcare Properties Sale.
Our Business
Our Mainland Properties generally consist of properties that are net leased to single tenants. Because of the capital improvements in which many of these tenants have invested and because many of our properties appear to have strategic importance to the tenants’ businesses, we believe that there is a greater likelihood that these tenants will renew or extend their leases when they expire as compared to tenants in a property with multiple tenants. However, we also believe that if a building previously occupied by a single tenant becomes vacant, it may take longer and cost more to locate a replacement tenant than when space becomes vacant in a multi-tenant property because in place improvements designed specifically for the needs of the prior single tenant may not suit a replacement tenant’s needs.
A significant number of our Hawaii Properties consist of lands which are leased to third parties for rents that are periodically reset based on fair market values, generally every five to ten years. During our ownership of the Hawaii Properties, market rents have generally increased along with Hawaii’s generally improving economy and, as a result, the revenues from our Hawaii Properties have often increased when leases have expired or rent resets occurred. We expect to continue to negotiate rents, based on then current fair market values, when leases expire or when rent resets occur at our Hawaii Properties.
Whenever we extend, renew or enter into new leases for our properties, we seek rents which are equal to or higher than our historical rents for the same properties; however, our ability to maintain or increase the rents for our properties depends in large part upon market conditions which are beyond our control.
1

We currently intend to expand our investments by primarily acquiring additional single tenant, net leased properties throughout the mainland United States and we expect to use the extensive nationwide resources of our manager, The RMR Group LLC, a Maryland limited liability company, or RMR LLC, to locate and acquire such properties. One of our goals in acquiring additional properties will be to further diversify our sources of rents and thus improve the security of our revenues. Another goal will be to purchase properties that produce rents, less property operating expenses, that are greater than our capital costs for the properties and, accordingly, allow us to increase distributions to our shareholders over time. We expect that most of our acquisition efforts will focus on office and industrial properties; however, we may consider acquiring other types of properties, including properties which are net leased to single tenants for retail uses and special purpose properties specifically suited to particular tenants’ requirements. We also may acquire additional properties in Hawaii, but we currently expect this will not be a significant part of our future acquisitions because there are limited opportunities to acquire properties in Hawaii, especially to acquire lands which are leased to third party tenants.
Our external growth strategy is defined by our acquisition, disposition and financing policies.
Our Acquisition Policies
In evaluating potential property acquisitions, we consider various factors, including but not limited to, the following:

• | the historic and projected rents received and likely to be received from the property;


• | the quality, experience and creditworthiness of the property’s tenant;


• | the strategic nature of the property to the tenant’s business;


• | the remaining length of the lease relating to the property and its other terms;


• | the strategic fit of the property with the rest of our portfolio,


• | the growth, tax and regulatory environments of the market in which the property is located;


• | occupancy and demand for similar properties in the same or nearby markets;


• | the construction quality, physical condition and design of the property and expected capital expenditures that may be needed at the property;


• | the estimated replacement cost of the property;


• | the location and type of property;


• | the pricing of comparable properties as evidenced by recent market sales;


• | our weighted average long term cost of capital compared to projected returns we may realize by owning the property; and


• | the existence of alternative sources, uses or needs for our capital.

Our Board of Trustees may change our acquisition and investment policies at any time without a vote of, or notice to, our shareholders. Also, we may in the future adopt policies with respect to investments in real estate mortgages or securities of other entities engaged in real estate activities.
We have in the past considered, and may in the future consider, the possibility of entering into mergers or strategic combinations with other companies. A principal goal of any such transaction may be to further diversify our revenue sources and increase our cash flow from operations.
Our Disposition Policies
We generally consider ourselves to be a long term owner of properties and are more interested in the long term earnings potential of our properties than selling properties for short term gains. However, we may, from time to time, decide to sell certain of our properties. We expect our decision to sell properties will be based upon the following considerations, among others, which may be relevant to a particular property at a particular time:
2


• | whether the property is leased;


• | our evaluation of the property tenant’s ability and desire to renew or extend its lease;


• | our evaluation of our ability to locate a new tenant if the property is vacant or likely to become vacant;


• | our evaluation of future rents which may be achieved from the property;


• | our evaluation of the costs associated with finding a replacement tenant, including tenant improvements, leasing commissions and concessions, the cost to operate the property while vacant, and building improvement capital, as compared to the projected return from future rents;


• | the proposed sale price;


• | the strategic fit of the property with the rest of our portfolio;


• | the estimated value we may receive by selling the property;


• | our intended use of the proceeds we may realize from the sale of a property; and


• | the existence of alternative sources, uses or needs for capital.

Our Board of Trustees may change our disposition policies at any time without a vote of, or notice to, our shareholders.
Our Financing Policies
To qualify for taxation as a REIT under the United States Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the IRC, we must distribute at least 90% of our annual REIT taxable income (excluding capital gains) and satisfy a number of organizational and operational requirements. Accordingly, we generally will not be able to retain sufficient cash from operations to repay debts, invest in properties and fund acquisitions. Instead, we expect to repay our debts, invest in our properties and fund acquisitions by borrowing, issuing equity or debt securities or using retained cash from operations which may exceed our distributions. Our growth has been primarily financed by borrowings under our revolving credit facility and term loan and our senior unsecured note issuances and by equity issuances in addition to our cash generated by our operations. When we have significant borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility and as the maturities of our revolving credit facility, term loan or senior unsecured notes approach, we expect to refinance such indebtedness with equity issuances or new debt. We will decide when and whether to issue equity or new debt depending upon market conditions and other factors. Because our ability to raise capital may depend, in large part, upon market conditions, we can provide you no assurance that we will be able to raise sufficient capital to repay our debt or to fund our growth strategies.
We currently have a $750.0 million unsecured revolving credit facility that we use for working capital and general business purposes and for acquisition funding on an interim basis until we may refinance with equity or term debt. In some instances, we may assume outstanding mortgage debt in connection with our acquisition of properties or place new mortgages on properties we own. For more information regarding our financing sources and activities, please see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources—Our Investment and Financing Liquidity and Resources” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Generally, we intend to manage our leverage in a way that may allow us to maintain “investment grade” ratings from nationally recognized statistical rating organizations; however, we can provide no assurance that we will be able to maintain our investment grade ratings. Also, our Board of Trustees may change our financing policies at any time without a vote of, or notice to, our shareholders.
Our History
We were formerly a wholly owned subsidiary of Equity Commonwealth, or our former parent. Our former parent created us to concentrate its ownership of certain net leased lands located in Hawaii that our former parent purchased in 2003 and 2005 and other single tenant, net leased properties. On February 16, 2012, our former parent contributed 30 initial properties (251 buildings, leasable land parcels and easements), or the Initial Properties, to us and in return we issued to our former parent: (i) 22,000,000 common shares (including 1,000 common shares initially issued to our former parent on December 21, 2011 in connection with our formation); and (ii) a $400.0 million demand promissory note, or the Demand Note. On March 12, 2012, we sold 9,200,000 of our common shares in our initial public offering, or IPO, and we became a public 
3

company. Simultaneous with the closing of our IPO, we entered into a $500.0 million revolving credit facility which has subsequently been increased to $750.0 million and which is available for our general business purposes, including acquisitions. We used the net proceeds from our IPO and borrowings under our revolving credit facility to repay in full the Demand Note and to reimburse our former parent for costs that it incurred in connection with our organization and preparation for our IPO. On July 9, 2014, our former parent sold 21,500,000 of our common shares that it owned to Government Properties Income Trust, a Maryland real estate investment trust, or GOV, and sold 500,000 of our common shares that it owned to RMR LLC. We understand that, following these sales, our former parent no longer owned any of our common shares.
Our Leases
The following is an overview of the general lease terms for our properties. The terms of any particular lease may vary from those described below.
Mainland Office and Industrial Leases
In general, our office and industrial properties located on the mainland United States include buildings that are net leased to single tenants. The leases generally require that the tenants pay fixed annual rents on a monthly, quarterly or semi-annual basis, and also pay or reimburse us for all, or substantially all, property level operating and maintenance expenses, such as real estate taxes, insurance, utilities and repairs. Some of these leases provide for periodic increases of base rent. Certain leases for our buildings at our Mainland Properties require us to maintain the roof, exterior walls, foundation and other structural elements of the buildings at our expense and some require us to pay property operating costs.
Hawaii Leases
In general, leases for our properties in Hawaii are net leases, which require that the tenant pay a fixed annual rent on a monthly, quarterly or semi-annual basis, and also pay or reimburse us for all, or substantially all, property level operating and maintenance expenses, such as real estate taxes, insurance, utilities and repairs. A minority of our Hawaii leases include buildings that we own. Certain leases for our buildings in Hawaii require us to maintain the roof, exterior walls, foundation and other structural elements of the buildings at our expense and some require us to pay property operating costs. A majority of our Hawaii Properties are lands that are leased for fixed annual rents that are periodically reset based on fair market values. In some cases, the resets are based on fair market value rent and in other cases a percentage of the fair market value of the land. Fair market value rent reset rates are generally determined through negotiations between us and individual tenants; however, when no agreement is achieved, the Hawaii leases require an appraisal process. In the appraisal process for the land leases that are periodically reset based on fair market value rents, the appraisers are generally required to determine the fair and reasonable rent, exclusive of improvements. In the appraisal process for the leases that are periodically reset based on a percentage of the fair market value of the land, the appraisers are required to determine the fair market value of the land, exclusive of improvements, with such fair market value being based on the highest and best use of the land and as though unencumbered by the lease.
Environmental Matters
Ownership of real estate is subject to risks associated with environmental hazards. We may be liable for environmental hazards at, or migrating from, our properties, including those created by prior owners or occupants, existing tenants, abutters or other persons. Various federal and state laws impose liabilities upon property owners, including us, for environmental damages arising at, or migrating from, owned properties, and we cannot be sure that we will not be held liable for the costs of environmental investigation and clean up at, or near, our properties. As an owner or previous owner of properties, we also may be liable to pay damages to governmental agencies or third parties for costs and damages they incur arising from environmental hazards at, or migrating from, our properties. The costs and damages that may arise from environmental hazards are often difficult to project and may be substantial.
Although our leases generally require our tenants to operate in compliance with applicable law and to indemnify us against any environmental liabilities arising from their activities on our properties, we could be subject to strict liability by virtue of our ownership interests. Also, our tenants may be unwilling or have insufficient financial resources to satisfy their indemnification obligations under our leases. Furthermore, the discovery of contamination or violations of environmental laws on any of our properties could lead to significant remediation costs or fines, penalties or other liabilities or obligations attributable to the tenant of that property. Such liabilities or obligations may affect a tenant’s ability to make payments to us, including rental payments and, where applicable, indemnification payments. When we acquired the Initial Properties from our former parent, we agreed to indemnify our former parent against all environmental liabilities with respect to the Initial Properties.
4

Certain of our properties are used or have been used for industrial purposes. Though we have reviewed these and our other properties for potential environmental liabilities and have established a reserve for potential costs that may be incurred as a result of environmental contamination, we cannot be sure that we have identified all potential environmental liabilities or that our reserve will be sufficient to cover any costs we may incur relating to environmental matters. Some of our properties contain, or may have contained, or are near other properties that contain, or may have contained underground storage tanks for the storage of petroleum products and other hazardous substances. The presence of such storage tanks may have resulted in or may result in the release of petroleum products or other hazardous or toxic substances onto our properties. In addition, certain of our properties are on or near other properties upon which others have engaged, or may in the future engage, in activities that may release petroleum products or other hazardous substances which migrate to our properties.
We do not have any insurance designated to limit any losses that we may incur as a result of known or unknown environmental conditions which are not caused by an insured event, such as, for example, fire or flood. As of December 31, 2016, we have reserved approximately $8.2 million for potential environmental liabilities arising at our properties. The environmental reserve our former parent applied to the Initial Properties, and that we have applied since we began owning the Initial Properties, historically has not varied significantly from year to year and the actual historical costs to remediate certain environmental issues have not deviated significantly from the corresponding reserve amount. Nevertheless, environmental exposures are difficult to assess and estimate for numerous reasons, including uncertainty about the extent of contamination, alternative treatment methods that may be applied, and location of the affected property which subjects it to differing local laws and regulations and their interpretations, as well as the time it takes to remediate contamination. In developing reserves for potential environmental liability on a property by property basis, we consider among other things, enacted laws and regulations, assessments of contamination and surrounding geology, the quality of information available, currently available technologies for treatment, alternative methods of remediation and our prior experience and the known experience of prior owners or occupants of our properties. Environmental reserves are based on estimates which are subject to significant change and are often adjusted as remediation treatments progress, as circumstances change and as environmental contingencies become more clearly defined and reasonably estimable. Although we do not believe that there are environmental conditions at any of our properties that will materially and adversely affect us, we cannot be sure that such conditions or costs we may be required to incur in the future to address environmental contamination will not materially and adversely affect us.
We believe that some of our properties may contain asbestos. We believe any asbestos on our properties is contained in accordance with applicable laws and regulations, and we have no current plans to remove it. If we removed the asbestos or demolished the affected properties, certain environmental regulations govern the manner in which the asbestos must be handled and removed, and we could incur substantial costs complying with such regulations.
Further, we may be impacted by laws enacted or proposed addressing climate change and climate change may adversely affect our business. For more information regarding climate change matters and their possible adverse impact on us, please see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources—Impact of Climate Change” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Competition
Investing in and operating commercial properties is a very competitive business. We compete against publicly traded and private REITs, numerous financial institutions, individuals and public and private companies. Some of our competitors may have greater financial and other resources than we have. We believe the diversity of our tenants, the experience and abilities of our management, the quality of our properties and the structure of our leases may afford us some competitive advantages and allow us to operate our business successfully despite the competitive nature of our business. For more information, see “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—We face significant competition” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Our Manager
The RMR Group Inc. (Nasdaq: RMR), a Maryland corporation, or RMR Inc., is a holding company and substantially all of its business is conducted by RMR LLC. Barry Portnoy and Adam Portnoy, our Managing Trustees, are the controlling shareholders, directors and officers of RMR LLC. Our day to day operations are conducted by RMR LLC. RMR LLC originates and presents investment and divestment opportunities to our Board of Trustees and provides management and administrative services to us. RMR LLC has a principal place of business at Two Newton Place, 255 Washington Street, Suite 300, Newton, Massachusetts 02458-1634, and its telephone number is (617) 796-8390. RMR LLC also acts as the manager to GOV, Hospitality Properties Trust, or HPT, and SNH and provides management and other services to other private and public companies, including Five Star Quality Care, Inc., or Five Star, TravelCenters of America LLC, or TA, and Sonesta International Hotels Corporation, or Sonesta. As of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the executive officers of RMR LLC are: Adam Portnoy, President and Chief Executive Officer; Barry Portnoy, Chairman; David M.

Executive Vice President; Mark L. Kleifges, Executive Vice President; Bruce J. Mackey Jr., Executive Vice President; John G. Murray, Executive Vice President; Thomas M. O’Brien, Executive Vice President; and John C. Popeo, Executive Vice President. David M. Blackman and John C. Popeo are also our executive officers. Messrs. Blackman and Popeo and other officers of RMR LLC also serve as officers of other companies to which RMR LLC provides management services.
Employees
We have no employees. Services which would otherwise be provided to us by employees are provided by RMR LLC and by our Managing Trustees and officers. As of February 1, 2017, RMR LLC had over 450 full time employees in its headquarters and regional offices located throughout the United States.
Insurance
We generally have insurance coverage for our properties and the operations conducted on them, including for casualty, liability, fire, extended coverage and rental or business interruption loss. Under our Hawaii land leases, our tenants are generally responsible for purchasing the insurance directly, while under our leases relating to our Hawaii buildings, our tenants are generally either required to reimburse us for the costs of maintaining the insurance coverage or purchase such insurance directly and list us as an insured party. With respect to our Mainland Properties, we either purchase the insurance ourselves and our tenants reimburse us, or the tenants buy the insurance directly and are required to list us as an insured party. We participate with RMR LLC and other companies to which RMR LLC provides management services in a combined property insurance program through Affiliates Insurance Company, or AIC, and with respect to which AIC is a reinsurer of certain coverage amounts. For more information, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources—Related Person Transactions” and Note 13 to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Other Matters
Legislative and regulatory developments may occur at the federal, state and local levels that have direct or indirect impact on the ownership, leasing and operation of our properties. We may need to make expenditures, to the extent these costs are not paid by our tenants, due to changes in government laws and regulations, or the application of such laws and regulations to our properties, including the Americans with Disabilities Act, fire and safety regulations, building codes, land use regulations or environmental regulations for containment, abatement or removal of hazardous substances.

MATERIAL UNITED STATES FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSIDERATIONS
The following summary of material United States federal income tax considerations is based on existing law, and is limited to investors who own our shares as investment assets rather than as inventory or as property used in a trade or business. The summary does not discuss all of the particular tax considerations that might be relevant to you if you are subject to special rules under federal income tax law, for example if you are:

• | a bank, insurance company or other financial institution;

6


• | a regulated investment company or REIT;


• | a subchapter S corporation;


• | a broker, dealer or trader in securities or foreign currency;


• | a person who marks-to-market our shares for U.S. federal income tax purposes;


• | a U.S. shareholder (as defined below) that has a functional currency other than the U.S. dollar;


• | a person who acquires or owns our shares in connection with employment or other performance of services;


• | a person subject to alternative minimum tax;


• | a person who acquires or owns our shares as part of a straddle, hedging transaction, constructive sale transaction, constructive ownership transaction or conversion transaction, or as part of a “synthetic security” or other integrated financial transaction;


• | a person who owns 10% or more (by vote or value, directly or constructively under the IRC) of any class of our shares;


• | a U.S. expatriate;


• | a non-U.S. shareholder (as defined below) whose investment in our shares is effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States;


• | a nonresident alien individual present in the United States for 183 days or more during an applicable taxable year;


• | a “qualified shareholder” (as defined in Section 897(k)(3)(A) of the IRC);


• | a “qualified foreign pension fund” (as defined in Section 897(l)(2) of the IRC) or any entity wholly owned by one or more qualified foreign pension funds; or


• | except as specifically described in the following summary, a trust, estate, tax-exempt entity or foreign person.

The sections of the IRC that govern the federal income tax qualification and treatment of a REIT and its shareholders are complex. This presentation is a summary of applicable IRC provisions, related rules and regulations, and administrative and judicial interpretations, all of which are subject to change, possibly with retroactive effect. Future legislative, judicial or administrative actions or decisions could also affect the accuracy of statements made in this summary. We have not received a ruling from the U.S. Internal Revenue Service, or the IRS, with respect to any matter described in this summary, and we cannot assure you that the IRS or a court will agree with all of the statements made in this summary. The IRS could, for example, take a different position from that described in this summary with respect to our acquisitions, operations, restructurings or other matters, which, if a court agreed, could result in significant tax liabilities for applicable parties. In addition, this summary is not exhaustive of all possible tax considerations, and does not discuss any estate, gift, state, local or foreign tax considerations. For all these reasons, we urge you and any holder of or prospective acquiror of our shares to consult with a tax advisor about the federal income tax and other tax consequences of the acquisition, ownership and disposition of our shares. Our intentions and beliefs described in this summary are based upon our understanding of applicable laws and regulations that are in effect as of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. If new laws or regulations are enacted which impact us directly or indirectly, we may change our intentions or beliefs.
Your federal income tax consequences generally will differ depending on whether or not you are a “U.S. shareholder.” For purposes of this summary, a “U.S. shareholder” is a beneficial owner of our shares that is:

• | an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States, including an alien individual who is a lawful permanent resident of the United States or meets the substantial presence residency test under the federal income tax laws;


• | an entity treated as a corporation for federal income tax purposes that is created or organized in or under the laws of the United States, any state thereof or the District of Columbia;

7


• | an estate the income of which is subject to federal income taxation regardless of its source; or


• | a trust if a court within the United States is able to exercise primary supervision over the administration of the trust and one or more U.S. persons have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust, or, to the extent provided in Treasury regulations, a trust in existence on August 20, 1996 that has elected to be treated as a domestic trust;

whose status as a U.S. shareholder is not overridden by an applicable tax treaty. Conversely, a “non-U.S. shareholder” is a beneficial owner of our shares other than a partnership or a U.S. shareholder. 
If any entity treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes holds our shares, the tax treatment of a partner in the partnership generally will depend upon the status of the partner and the activities of the partnership. Any entity or other arrangement treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes that is a holder of our shares and the partners in such a partnership (as determined for federal income tax purposes) are urged to consult their own tax advisors about the federal income tax consequences and other tax consequences of the acquisition, ownership and disposition of our shares.
Taxation as a REIT
We have elected to be taxed as a REIT under Sections 856 through 860 of the IRC, commencing with our 2012 taxable year. Our REIT election, assuming continuing compliance with the then applicable qualification tests, has continued and will continue in effect for subsequent taxable years. Although no assurance can be given, we believe that from and after our 2012 taxable year we have been organized and have operated, and will continue to be organized and to operate, in a manner that qualified and will continue to qualify us to be taxed as a REIT under the IRC. 
As a REIT, we generally are not subject to federal income tax on our net income distributed as dividends to our shareholders. Distributions to our shareholders generally are included in their income as dividends to the extent of our available current or accumulated earnings and profits. Our dividends are not generally entitled to the preferential tax rates on qualified dividend income, but a portion of our dividends may be treated as capital gain dividends or as qualified dividend income, all as explained below. No portion of any of our dividends is generally eligible for the dividends received deduction for corporate shareholders. Distributions in excess of our current or accumulated earnings and profits generally are treated for federal income tax purposes as returns of capital to the extent of a recipient shareholder’s basis in our shares, and will reduce this basis. Our current or accumulated earnings and profits are generally allocated first to distributions made on our preferred shares, of which there are none outstanding at this time, and thereafter to distributions made on our common shares. For these purposes, our distributions include cash distributions, any in kind distributions of property that we might make, and deemed or constructive distributions resulting from capital market activities (such as some redemptions), as described below.
Our counsel, Sullivan & Worcester LLP, has provided to us an opinion that we have been organized and have qualified for taxation as a REIT under the IRC for our 2012 through 2016 taxable years, and that our current and anticipated investments and plan of operation will enable us to continue to meet the requirements for qualification and taxation as a REIT under the IRC. Our counsel’s opinions are conditioned upon the assumption that our leases, our declaration of trust and all other legal documents to which we have been or are a party have been and will be complied with by all parties to those documents, upon the accuracy and completeness of the factual matters described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and upon representations made by us to our counsel as to certain factual matters relating to our organization and operations and our expected manner of operation. If this assumption or a representation is inaccurate or incomplete, our counsel’s opinions may be adversely affected and may not be relied upon. The opinions of our counsel are based upon the law as it exists today, but the law may change in the future, possibly with retroactive effect. Given the highly complex nature of the rules governing REITs, the ongoing importance of factual determinations, and the possibility of future changes in our circumstances, no assurance can be given by Sullivan & Worcester LLP or us that we will qualify as or be taxed as a REIT for any particular year. Any opinion of Sullivan & Worcester LLP as to our qualification or taxation as a REIT will be expressed as of the date issued. Our counsel will have no obligation to advise us or our shareholders of any subsequent change in the matters stated, represented or assumed, or of any subsequent change in the applicable law. Also, the opinions of our counsel are not binding on either the IRS or a court, and either could take a position different from that expressed by our counsel. 
Our continued qualification and taxation as a REIT will depend upon our compliance on a continuing basis with various qualification tests imposed under the IRC and summarized below. While we believe that we have satisfied and will satisfy these tests, our counsel does not review compliance with these tests on a continuing basis. If we fail to qualify for taxation as a REIT in any year, we will be subject to federal income taxation as if we were a corporation taxed under subchapter C of the IRC, or a C corporation, and our shareholders will be taxed like shareholders of regular C corporations, meaning that federal income tax

generally will be applied at both the corporate and shareholder levels. In this event, we could be subject to significant tax liabilities, and the amount of cash available for distribution to our shareholders could be reduced or eliminated.
If we qualify for taxation as a REIT and meet the tests described below, we generally will not pay federal income tax on amounts we distribute to our shareholders. However, even if we qualify for taxation as a REIT, we may still be subject to federal tax in the following circumstances, as described below:

• | We will be taxed at regular corporate tax rates on any undistributed “real estate investment trust taxable income,” determined by including our undistributed net capital gains, if any.


• | We may be subject to the corporate alternative minimum tax on our items of tax preference.


• | If we have net income from the disposition of “foreclosure property,” as described in Section 856(e) of the IRC, that is held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of a trade or business or from other nonqualifying income from foreclosure property, we will be subject to tax on this income at the highest regular corporate tax rate.


• | If we have net income from “prohibited transactions” - that is, dispositions at a gain of inventory or property held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of a trade or business other than dispositions of foreclosure property and other than dispositions excepted by statutory safe harbors - we will be subject to tax on this income at a 100% rate.


• | If we fail to satisfy the 75% gross income test or the 95% gross income test discussed below, due to reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect, but nonetheless maintain our qualification for taxation as a REIT because of specified cure provisions, we will be subject to tax at a 100% rate on the greater of the amount by which we fail the 75% gross income test or the 95% gross income test, with adjustments, multiplied by a fraction intended to reflect our profitability for the taxable year.


• | If we fail to satisfy the REIT asset tests described below, due to reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect, but nonetheless maintain our qualification for taxation as a REIT because of specified cure provisions, we will be subject to a tax equal to the greater of $50,000 or the highest regular corporate tax rate multiplied by the net income generated by the nonqualifying assets that caused us to fail the test.


• | If we fail to satisfy any provision of the IRC that would result in our failure to qualify for taxation as a REIT (other than violations of the REIT gross income tests or violations of the REIT asset tests described below), due to reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect, we may retain our qualification for taxation as a REIT but will be subject to a penalty of $50,000 for each failure.


• | If we fail to distribute for any calendar year at least the sum of 85% of our REIT ordinary income for that year, 95% of our REIT capital gain net income for that year and any undistributed taxable income from prior periods, we will be subject to a 4% nondeductible excise tax on the excess of the required distribution over the amounts actually distributed.


• | If we acquire a REIT asset where our adjusted tax basis in the asset is determined by reference to the adjusted tax basis of the asset in the hands of a C corporation, under specified circumstances we may be subject to federal income taxation on all or part of the built-in gain (calculated as of the date the property ceased being owned by the C corporation) on such asset. We generally do not expect to sell assets if doing so would result in the imposition of a material built-in gains tax liability; but if and when we do sell assets that may have associated built-in gains tax exposure, then we expect to make appropriate provision for the associated tax liabilities on our financial statements.


• | If we acquire a corporation in a transaction where we succeed to its tax attributes, to preserve our qualification for taxation as a REIT we must generally distribute all of the C corporation earnings and profits inherited in that acquisition, if any, no later than the end of our taxable year in which the acquisition occurs. However, if we fail to do so, relief provisions would allow us to maintain our qualification for taxation as a REIT provided we distribute any subsequently discovered C corporation earnings and profits and pay an interest charge in respect of the period of delayed distribution.

• | Our subsidiaries that are C corporations, including our “taxable REIT subsidiaries” as defined in Section 856(l) of the IRC, or TRSs, generally will be required to pay federal corporate income tax on their earnings, and a 100% tax may be imposed on any transaction between us and one of our TRSs that does not reflect arm’s length terms.


• | As discussed below, we acquired an entity that formerly had qualified for taxation as a REIT pursuant to a transaction that was intended to qualify as a “reorganization” within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the IRC. If it is determined that this entity failed to satisfy one or more of the REIT tests described below, the IRS might allow us, as this entity’s successor, the same opportunity for relief as though we were the remediating REIT. In such case, this entity would be deemed to have retained its qualification for taxation as a REIT and the relevant penalties or sanctions for remediation would fall upon us in a manner comparable to the above. 

If we fail to qualify for taxation as a REIT in any year, then we will be subject to federal income tax in the same manner as a regular C corporation. Further, as a regular C corporation, distributions to our shareholders will not be deductible by us, nor will distributions be required under the IRC. Also, to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits, all distributions to our shareholders will generally be taxable as ordinary dividends potentially eligible for the preferential tax rates discussed below in “—Taxation of Taxable U.S. Shareholders” and, subject to limitations in the IRC, will be potentially eligible for the dividends received deduction for corporate shareholders. Finally, we will generally be disqualified from taxation as a REIT for the four taxable years following the taxable year in which the termination is effective. Our failure to qualify for taxation as a REIT for even one year could result in us reducing or eliminating distributions to our shareholders, or in us incurring substantial indebtedness or liquidating substantial investments in order to pay the resulting corporate-level taxes. Relief provisions under the IRC may allow us to continue to qualify for taxation as a REIT even if we fail to comply with various REIT requirements, all as discussed in more detail below. However, it is impossible to state whether in any particular circumstance we would be entitled to the benefit of these relief provisions.
REIT Qualification Requirements
General Requirements. Section 856(a) of the IRC defines a REIT as a corporation, trust or association:

(1) | that is managed by one or more trustees or directors;


(2) | the beneficial ownership of which is evidenced by transferable shares or by transferable certificates of beneficial interest;


(3) | that would be taxable, but for Sections 856 through 859 of the IRC, as a domestic C corporation;


(4) | that is not a financial institution or an insurance company subject to special provisions of the IRC;


(5) | the beneficial ownership of which is held by 100 or more persons;


(6) | that is not “closely held,” meaning that during the last half of each taxable year, not more than 50% in value of the outstanding shares are owned, directly or indirectly, by five or fewer “individuals” (as defined in the IRC to include specified tax-exempt entities); and


(7) | that meets other tests regarding the nature of its income and assets and the amount of its distributions, all as described below.

Section 856(b) of the IRC provides that conditions (1) through (4) must be met during the entire taxable year and that condition (5) must be met during at least 335 days of a taxable year of 12 months, or during a proportionate part of a taxable year of less than 12 months. We believe that we have met conditions (1) through (7) during each of the requisite periods ending on or before the close of our most recently completed taxable year, and that we will continue to meet these conditions in our current and future taxable years. There can, however, be no assurance in this regard.
To help comply with condition (6), our declaration of trust restricts transfers of our shares that would otherwise result in concentrated ownership positions. These restrictions, however, do not ensure that we have previously satisfied, and may not ensure that we will in all cases be able to continue to satisfy, the share ownership requirements described in condition (6). If we comply with applicable Treasury regulations to ascertain the ownership of our outstanding shares and do not know, or by exercising reasonable diligence would not have known, that we failed condition (6), then we will be treated as having met condition (6). Accordingly, we have complied and will continue to comply with these regulations, including by requesting annually from record holders of significant percentages of our shares information regarding the ownership of our shares. Under our declaration of trust, 
10

our shareholders are required to respond to these requests for information. A shareholder that fails or refuses to comply with the request is required by Treasury regulations to submit a statement with its federal income tax return disclosing its actual ownership of our shares and other information.
For purposes of condition (6), an “individual” generally includes a natural person, a supplemental unemployment compensation benefit plan, a private foundation, or a portion of a trust permanently set aside or used exclusively for charitable purposes, but does not include a qualified pension plan or profit-sharing trust. As a result, REIT shares owned by an entity that is not an “individual” are considered to be owned by the direct and indirect owners of the entity that are individuals (as so defined), rather than to be owned by the entity itself. Similarly, REIT shares held by a qualified pension plan or profit-sharing trust are treated as held directly by the individual beneficiaries in proportion to their actuarial interests in such plan or trust. Consequently, five or fewer such trusts could own more than 50% of the interests in an entity without jeopardizing that entity’s qualification for taxation as a REIT. 
The IRC provides that we will not automatically fail to qualify for taxation as a REIT if we do not meet conditions (1) through (6), provided we can establish that such failure was due to reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect. Each such excused failure will result in the imposition of a $50,000 penalty instead of REIT disqualification. This relief provision may apply to a failure of the applicable conditions even if the failure first occurred in a year prior to the taxable year in which the failure was discovered.
Our Wholly Owned Subsidiaries and Our Investments Through Partnerships. Except in respect of a TRS as discussed below, Section 856(i) of the IRC provides that any corporation, 100% of whose stock is held by a REIT and its disregarded subsidiaries, is a qualified REIT subsidiary and shall not be treated as a separate corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The assets, liabilities and items of income, deduction and credit of a qualified REIT subsidiary are treated as the REIT’s. We believe that each of our direct and indirect wholly owned subsidiaries, other than the TRSs discussed below (and entities owned in whole or in part by the TRSs), will be either a qualified REIT subsidiary within the meaning of Section 856(i) of the IRC, or a noncorporate entity that for federal income tax purposes is not treated as separate from its owner under Treasury regulations issued under Section 7701 of the IRC, each such disregarded entity referred to as a QRS. Thus, in applying all of the REIT qualification requirements described in this summary, all assets, liabilities and items of income, deduction and credit of our QRSs are treated as ours, and our investment in the stock and other securities of such QRSs will be disregarded.
We have invested and may in the future invest in real estate through one or more entities that are treated as partnerships for federal income tax purposes. In the case of a REIT that is a partner in a partnership, Treasury regulations under the IRC provide that, for purposes of the REIT qualification requirements regarding income and assets described below, the REIT is generally deemed to own its proportionate share, based on respective capital interests, of the income and assets of the partnership (except that for purposes of the 10% value test, described below, the REIT’s proportionate share of the partnership’s assets is based on its proportionate interest in the equity and specified debt securities issued by the partnership). In addition, for these purposes, the character of the assets and items of gross income of the partnership generally remains the same in the hands of the REIT. In contrast, for purposes of the distribution requirement discussed below, we must take into account as a partner our share of the partnership’s income as determined under the general federal income tax rules governing partners and partnerships under Sections 701 through 777 of the IRC.
Subsidiary REITs. We have invested and may in the future invest in real estate through one or more subsidiary entities that are intended to qualify for taxation as REITs. Any subsidiary REIT will generally be subject to the various REIT qualification requirements and other limitations described in this summary that are applicable to us. If one of our subsidiary REITs were to fail to qualify for taxation as a REIT, then (a) the subsidiary REIT would become subject to regular U.S. corporate income tax, as described above, and (b) our ownership of shares in the subsidiary REIT would cease to be a qualifying real estate asset for purposes of the 75% asset test and would become subject to the 5% asset test, the 10% vote test and the 10% value test generally applicable to our ownership in corporations other than REITs and TRSs, all as described under “—Asset Tests” below. If a subsidiary REIT were to fail to qualify for taxation as a REIT, it is possible that we would not meet the 5% asset test, the 10% vote test or the 10% value test with respect to our interest in the subsidiary REIT, in which event we would fail to qualify for taxation as a REIT unless we could utilize applicable relief provisions. We expect to make protective TRS elections with respect to our subsidiary REITs and may implement other protective arrangements intended to avoid a cascading REIT failure if any of our subsidiary REITs were not to qualify for taxation as a REIT, but there can be no assurance that such protective elections and other arrangements will be effective to avoid the resulting adverse consequences to us.
During our 2015 taxable year, we were invested in real estate through a subsidiary that was intended to qualify for taxation as a REIT. Accordingly, the above discussion regarding subsidiary REITs was generally applicable with respect to this subsidiary REIT during that time period. We believe that our former subsidiary REIT was organized and operated in a manner that permitted it to qualify for taxation as a REIT from and after the effective date of its REIT election and through the date of its liquidation for 
11

federal income tax purposes. In addition, to limit the possibility of a cascading REIT failure in the event that our former subsidiary REIT had somehow failed to qualify for taxation as a REIT, we made a protective TRS election with respect to this subsidiary that presumably would be effective to the extent our subsidiary had failed to qualify for taxation as a REIT.
Taxable REIT Subsidiaries. We are permitted to own any or all of the securities of a TRS, provided that no more than 25% (20% beginning with our 2018 taxable year) of the total value of our assets, at the close of each quarter, is comprised of our investments in the stock or other securities of our TRSs. Very generally, a TRS is a subsidiary corporation other than a REIT in which a REIT directly or indirectly holds stock and that has made a joint election with its parent REIT to be treated as a TRS. Our ownership of stock and other securities in TRSs is exempt from the 5% asset test, the 10% vote test and the 10% value test discussed below. 
In addition, any corporation (other than a REIT) in which a TRS directly or indirectly owns more than 35% of the voting power or value of the outstanding securities of such corporation will automatically be treated as a TRS. Subject to the discussion below, we believe that we and each of our TRSs have complied with, and will continue to comply with, the requirements for TRS status at all times during which we intend for the subsidiary’s TRS election to be in effect, and we believe that the same will be true for any TRS that we later form or acquire. 
We acquired in the second quarter of 2015, and owned until the fourth quarter of 2015, an ownership position in RMR Inc., that was in excess of 10% of RMR Inc.’s outstanding securities by vote or value. Accordingly, we elected to treat RMR Inc. as a TRS effective as of June 5, 2015. RMR Inc., through its principal subsidiary, RMR LLC, has provided and continues to provide business and property management and other services to us and to other public and private companies, including other public REITs. Among these clients were and are operators of lodging facilities, operators of health care facilities, and owners of such facilities. Our counsel, Sullivan & Worcester LLP, has provided to us an opinion that the activities proscribed to TRSs under Section 856(l)(3) of the IRC relating to operating or managing lodging facilities or health care facilities should include only regular onsite services or day-to-day operational activities at or for lodging facilities or health care facilities. To the best of our knowledge, neither RMR Inc. nor RMR LLC has been or is involved in proscribed activities at or for lodging facilities or health care facilities. Thus, we do not believe that Section 856(l)(3) of the IRC precluded or precludes RMR Inc. from being treated as our TRS. In addition, because we acquired a significant portion of our investment in RMR Inc. in exchange for our common shares that were newly issued, our counsel, Sullivan & Worcester LLP, is of the opinion that our investment in RMR Inc. should have qualified as a “temporary investment of new capital” under Section 856(c)(5)(B) of the IRC to the extent related to such issuance of our common shares. To the extent our investment in RMR Inc. so qualified, it constituted a “real estate asset” under Section 856(c) of the IRC and did not constitute a security subject to the REIT asset test limitations discussed below for a one-year period that ended in June 2016. If the IRS or a court determines, contrary to the opinion of our counsel, that RMR Inc. was or is precluded from being treated as our TRS, then our ownership position in RMR Inc. in excess of 10% of RMR Inc.’s outstanding securities by vote or value, except to the extent and for the period that such ownership qualified as a “temporary investment of new capital,” would have been and would be in violation of the applicable REIT asset tests described below. Under those circumstances, however, we expect that we would qualify for the REIT asset tests’ relief provision described below, and thereby would preserve our qualification for taxation as a REIT. If the relief provision below were to apply to us, we would be subject to tax at the highest regular corporate tax rate on the net income generated by our investment in RMR Inc. in excess of a 10% ownership position in that company.
Our TRSs are taxed as C corporations that are separate from us. As regular C corporations, TRSs may generally utilize net operating losses and other tax attribute carry-forwards to reduce or otherwise eliminate federal income tax liability in a given taxable year. Net operating losses and other carry-forwards are subject to limitations, including limitations imposed under Section 382 of the IRC following an “ownership change” (as defined in applicable Treasury regulations). As a result, there can be no assurance that our TRSs will be able to utilize, in full or in part, any net operating losses or other carry-forwards that they may generate in the future. 
As discussed below, TRSs can perform services for our tenants without disqualifying the rents we receive from those tenants under the 75% gross income test or the 95% gross income test discussed below. Moreover, because our TRSs are taxed as C corporations that are separate from us, their assets, liabilities and items of income, deduction and credit generally are not imputed to us for purposes of the REIT qualification requirements described in this summary. Therefore, our TRSs may generally undertake third-party management and development activities and activities not related to real estate.
Restrictions and sanctions, such as deduction limitations and excise taxes, are imposed on TRSs and their affiliated REITs to ensure that the TRSs will be subject to an appropriate level of federal income taxation. For example, a TRS may not deduct interest paid in any year to an affiliated REIT to the extent that the interest payments exceed, generally, 50% of the TRS’s adjusted taxable income for that year. However, the TRS may carry forward the disallowed interest expense to a succeeding year, and deduct the interest in that later year subject to that year’s 50% adjusted taxable income limitation. In addition, if a TRS pays 
12

interest, rent or other amounts to its affiliated REIT in an amount that exceeds what an unrelated third party would have paid in an arm’s length transaction, then the REIT generally will be subject to an excise tax equal to 100% of the excessive portion of the payment. Further, if in comparison to an arm’s length transaction, a third-party tenant has overpaid rent to the REIT in exchange for underpaying the TRS for services rendered, and if the REIT has not adequately compensated the TRS for services provided to or on behalf of the third-party tenant, then the REIT may be subject to an excise tax equal to 100% of the undercompensation to the TRS. A safe harbor exception to this excise tax applies if the TRS has been compensated at a rate at least equal to 150% of its direct cost in furnishing or rendering the service. Finally, beginning with our 2016 taxable year, the 100% excise tax also applies to the underpricing of services by a TRS to its affiliated REIT in contexts where the services are unrelated to services for REIT tenants. There can be no assurance that arrangements involving our TRSs will not result in the imposition of one or more of these deduction limitations or excise taxes, but we do not believe that we or our TRSs are or will be subject to these impositions.
Income Tests. There are two gross income requirements for qualification for taxation as a REIT under the IRC:

• | At least 75% of our gross income for each taxable year (excluding: (a) gross income from sales or other dispositions of property subject to the 100% tax on prohibited transactions; (b) any income arising from “clearly identified” hedging transactions that we enter into to manage interest rate or price changes or currency fluctuations with respect to borrowings we incur to acquire or carry real estate assets; (c) any income arising from “clearly identified” hedging transactions that we enter into primarily to manage risk of currency fluctuations relating to any item that qualifies under the 75% gross income test or the 95% gross income test (or any property that generates such income or gain); (d) beginning with our 2016 taxable year, any income from “clearly identified” hedging transactions that we enter into to manage risk associated with extant, qualified hedges of liabilities or properties that have been extinguished or disposed; (e) real estate foreign exchange gain (as defined in Section 856(n)(2) of the IRC); and (f) income from the repurchase or discharge of indebtedness) must be derived from investments relating to real property, including “rents from real property” as defined under Section 856 of the IRC, interest and gain from mortgages on real property or on interests in real property, income and gain from foreclosure property, gain from the sale or other disposition of real property, or dividends on and gain from the sale or disposition of shares in other REITs (but excluding in all cases any gains subject to the 100% tax on prohibited transactions). When we receive new capital in exchange for our shares or in a public offering of our five-year or longer debt instruments, income attributable to the temporary investment of this new capital in stock or a debt instrument, if received or accrued within one year of our receipt of the new capital, is generally also qualifying income under the 75% gross income test. 


• | At least 95% of our gross income for each taxable year (excluding: (a) gross income from sales or other dispositions of property subject to the 100% tax on prohibited transactions; (b) any income arising from “clearly identified” hedging transactions that we enter into to manage interest rate or price changes or currency fluctuations with respect to borrowings we incur to acquire or carry real estate assets; (c) any income arising from “clearly identified” hedging transactions that we enter into primarily to manage risk of currency fluctuations relating to any item that qualifies under the 75% gross income test or the 95% gross income test (or any property that generates such income or gain); (d) beginning with our 2016 taxable year, any income from “clearly identified” hedging transactions that we enter into to manage risk associated with extant, qualified hedges of liabilities or properties that have been extinguished or disposed; (e) passive foreign exchange gain (as defined in Section 856(n)(3) of the IRC); and (f) income from the repurchase or discharge of indebtedness) must be derived from a combination of items of real property income that satisfy the 75% gross income test described above, dividends, interest, or gains from the sale or disposition of stock, securities or real property (but excluding in all cases any gains subject to the 100% tax on prohibited transactions).

Although we will use our best efforts to ensure that the income generated by our investments will be of a type that satisfies both the 75% and 95% gross income tests, there can be no assurance in this regard.
In order to qualify as “rents from real property” under Section 856 of the IRC, several requirements must be met:

• | The amount of rent received generally must not be based on the income or profits of any person, but may be based on a fixed percentage or percentages of receipts or sales.


• | Rents do not qualify if the REIT owns 10% or more by vote or value of stock of the tenant (or 10% or more of the interests in the assets or net profits of the tenant, if the tenant is not a corporation), whether directly or after application of attribution rules. We generally do not intend to lease property to any party if rents from that property would not qualify as “rents from real property,” but application of the 10% ownership rule is dependent upon complex attribution rules and circumstances that may be beyond our control. Our declaration of trust 

13

generally disallows transfers or purported acquisitions, directly or by attribution, of our shares to the extent necessary to maintain our qualification for taxation as a REIT under the IRC. Nevertheless, there can be no assurance that these restrictions will be effective to prevent our qualification for taxation as a REIT from being jeopardized under the 10% affiliated tenant rule. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that we will be able to monitor and enforce these restrictions, nor will our shareholders necessarily be aware of ownership of our shares attributed to them under the IRC’s attribution rules.

• | There is a limited exception to the above prohibition on earning “rents from real property” from a 10% affiliated tenant where the tenant is a TRS. If at least 90% of the leased space of a property is leased to tenants other than TRSs and 10% affiliated tenants, and if the TRS’s rent to the REIT for space at that property is substantially comparable to the rents paid by nonaffiliated tenants for comparable space at the property, then otherwise qualifying rents paid by the TRS to the REIT will not be disqualified on account of the rule prohibiting 10% affiliated tenants. 


• | In order for rents to qualify, we generally must not manage the property or furnish or render services to the tenants of the property, except through an independent contractor from whom we derive no income or through one of our TRSs. There is an exception to this rule permitting a REIT to perform customary tenant services of the sort that a tax-exempt organization could perform without being considered in receipt of “unrelated business taxable income,” or UBTI, under Section 512(b)(3) of the IRC. In addition, a de minimis amount of noncustomary services provided to tenants will not disqualify income as “rents from real property” as long as the value of the impermissible tenant services does not exceed 1% of the gross income from the property. 


• | If rent attributable to personal property leased in connection with a lease of real property is 15% or less of the total rent received under the lease, then the rent attributable to personal property qualifies as “rents from real property.” None of the rent attributable to personal property received under a lease will qualify if this 15% threshold is exceeded. The portion of rental income treated as attributable to personal property is determined according to the ratio of the fair market value of the personal property to the total fair market value of the real and personal property that is rented. 


• | In addition, “rents from real property” includes both charges we receive for services customarily rendered in connection with the rental of comparable real property in the same geographical area, even if the charges are separately stated, as well as charges we receive for services provided by our TRSs when the charges are not separately stated. Whether separately stated charges received by a REIT for services that are not geographically customary and provided by a TRS are included in “rents from real property” has not been addressed clearly by the IRS in published authorities; however, our counsel, Sullivan & Worcester LLP, is of the opinion that, although the matter is not free from doubt, “rents from real property” also includes charges we receive for services provided by our TRSs when the charges are separately stated, even if the services are not geographically customary. Accordingly, we believe that our revenues from TRS-provided services, whether the charges are separately stated or not, qualify as “rents from real property” because the services satisfy the geographically customary standard, because the services have been provided by a TRS, or for both reasons. 

We believe that all or substantially all of our rents and related service charges have qualified and will continue to qualify as “rents from real property” for purposes of Section 856 of the IRC.
In order to qualify as mortgage interest on real property for purposes of the 75% gross income test, interest must derive from a mortgage loan secured by real property (or interests in real property) with a fair market value at the time the loan is made (reduced by any senior liens on the property) at least equal to the amount of such loan. If the amount of the loan exceeds the fair market value of the real property (as so reduced by senior liens), the interest will be treated as interest on a mortgage loan in a ratio equal to the ratio of the fair market value of the real property (as so reduced by senior liens) to the total amount of the mortgage loan.
Other than sales of foreclosure property, any gain we realize on the sale of property held as inventory or other property held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of a trade or business, together known as dealer gains, may be treated as income from a prohibited transaction that is subject to a penalty tax at a 100% rate. Whether property is held as inventory or primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of a trade or business is a question of fact that depends on all the facts and circumstances surrounding the particular transaction. Sections 857(b)(6)(C) and (E) of the IRC provide safe harbors pursuant to which limited sales of real property held for at least two years and meeting specified additional requirements will not be treated as prohibited transactions. However, compliance with the safe harbors is not always achievable in practice. There can be no assurance as to whether or not the IRS might successfully assert that one or more of our dispositions is subject to the 100% penalty 
14

tax. Dealer gains subject to the 100% penalty tax are excluded from the 75% and 95% gross income tests, whereas dealer gains exempted from the 100% penalty tax on account of the safe harbors are considered qualifying gross income for purposes of the 75% and 95% gross income tests.
We believe that any gain from dispositions of assets that we have made, or that we might make in the future, including through any partnerships, will generally qualify as income that satisfies the 75% and 95% gross income tests to the extent that such assets qualify as real property, and will not be dealer gains or subject to the 100% penalty tax, because our general intent has been and is to:

• | own our assets for investment with a view to long-term income production and capital appreciation;


• | engage in the business of developing, owning, leasing and managing our existing properties and acquiring, developing, owning, leasing and managing new properties; and


• | make occasional dispositions of our assets consistent with our long-term investment objectives.

If we fail to satisfy one or both of the 75% gross income test or the 95% gross income test in any taxable year, we may nevertheless qualify for taxation as a REIT for that year if we satisfy the following requirements:

• | our failure to meet the test is due to reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect; and


• | after we identify the failure, we file a schedule describing each item of our gross income included in the 75% gross income test or the 95% gross income test for that taxable year.

Even if this relief provision does apply, a 100% tax is imposed upon the greater of the amount by which we failed the 75% gross income test or the amount by which we failed the 95% gross income test, with adjustments, multiplied by a fraction intended to reflect our profitability for the taxable year. This relief provision may apply to a failure of the applicable income tests even if the failure first occurred in a year prior to the taxable year in which the failure was discovered.
Based on the discussion above, we believe that we have satisfied, and will continue to satisfy, the 75% and 95% gross income tests outlined above on a continuing basis beginning with our first taxable year as a REIT.
Asset Tests. At the close of each calendar quarter of each taxable year, we must also satisfy the following asset percentage tests in order to qualify for taxation as a REIT for federal income tax purposes:

• | At least 75% of the value of our total assets must consist of “real estate assets,” defined as real property (including interests in real property and interests in mortgages on real property or on interests in real property), ancillary personal property to the extent that rents attributable to such personal property are treated as rents from real property in accordance with the rules described above (beginning with our 2016 taxable year), cash and cash items, shares in other REITs, debt instruments issued by “publicly offered REITs” as defined in Section 562(c)(2) of the IRC (beginning with our 2016 taxable year), government securities and temporary investments of new capital (that is, any stock or debt instrument that we hold that is attributable to any amount received by us (a) in exchange for our stock or (b) in a public offering of our five-year or longer debt instruments, but only for the one-year period commencing with our receipt of the new capital).


• | Not more than 25% of the value of our total assets may be represented by securities other than those securities that count favorably toward the preceding 75% asset test.


• | Of the investments included in the preceding 25% asset class, the value of any one non-REIT issuer’s securities that we own may not exceed 5% of the value of our total assets. In addition, we may not own more than 10% of the vote or value of any one non-REIT issuer’s outstanding securities, unless the securities are “straight debt” securities or otherwise excepted as discussed below. Our stock and other securities in a TRS are exempted from these 5% and 10% asset tests. 


• | Not more than 25% (20% beginning with our 2018 taxable year) of the value of our total assets may be represented by stock or other securities of TRSs.


• | Beginning with our 2016 taxable year, not more than 25% of the value of our total assets may be represented by “nonqualified publicly offered REIT debt instruments” as defined in Section 856(c)(5)(L)(ii) of the IRC.

15

Our counsel, Sullivan & Worcester LLP, is of the opinion that, although the matter is not free from doubt, our investments in the equity or debt of a TRS, to the extent and during the period they qualify as temporary investments of new capital, will be treated as real estate assets, and not as securities, for purposes of the above REIT asset tests.
If we own a mortgage loan secured by real property (or interests in real property) with a fair market value at the time the loan is made (reduced by any senior liens on the property) at least equal to the amount of such loan, the mortgage loan will generally be treated as a real estate asset for purposes of the 75% asset test above. But if the loan is undersecured when made, then the portion adequately secured by real property (or interests in real property) will generally be treated as a real estate asset for purposes of the 75% asset test above and the remaining portion will generally be treated as a separate security that must satisfy applicable asset tests.
The above REIT asset tests must be satisfied at the close of each calendar quarter of each taxable year as a REIT. After a REIT meets the asset tests at the close of any quarter, it will not lose its qualification for taxation as a REIT in any subsequent quarter solely because of fluctuations in the values of its assets. This grandfathering rule may be of limited benefit to a REIT such as us that makes periodic acquisitions of both qualifying and nonqualifying REIT assets. When a failure to satisfy the above asset tests results from an acquisition of securities or other property during a quarter, the failure can be cured by disposition of sufficient nonqualifying assets within thirty days after the close of that quarter.
In addition, if we fail the 5% asset test, the 10% vote test or the 10% value test at the close of any quarter and we do not cure such failure within thirty days after the close of that quarter, that failure will nevertheless be excused if (a) the failure is de minimis and (b) within six months after the last day of the quarter in which we identify the failure, we either dispose of the assets causing the failure or otherwise satisfy the 5% asset test, the 10% vote test and the 10% value test. For purposes of this relief provision, the failure will be de minimis if the value of the assets causing the failure does not exceed $10,000,000. If our failure is not de minimis, or if any of the other REIT asset tests have been violated, we may nevertheless qualify for taxation as a REIT if (a) we provide the IRS with a description of each asset causing the failure, (b) the failure was due to reasonable cause and not willful neglect, (c) we pay a tax equal to the greater of (1) $50,000 or (2) the highest regular corporate tax rate imposed on the net income generated by the assets causing the failure during the period of the failure, and (d) within six months after the last day of the quarter in which we identify the failure, we either dispose of the assets causing the failure or otherwise satisfy all of the REIT asset tests. These relief provisions may apply to a failure of the applicable asset tests even if the failure first occurred in a year prior to the taxable year in which the failure was discovered.
The IRC also provides an excepted securities safe harbor to the 10% value test that includes among other items (a) “straight debt” securities, (b) specified rental agreements in which payment is to be made in subsequent years, (c) any obligation to pay “rents from real property,” (d) securities issued by governmental entities that are not dependent in whole or in part on the profits of or payments from a nongovernmental entity, and (e) any security issued by another REIT. In addition, any debt instrument issued by an entity classified as a partnership for federal income tax purposes, and not otherwise excepted from the definition of a security for purposes of the above safe harbor, will not be treated as a security for purposes of the 10% value test if at least 75% of the partnership’s gross income, excluding income from prohibited transactions, is qualifying income for purposes of the 75% gross income test. 
We have maintained and will continue to maintain records of the value of our assets to document our compliance with the above asset tests and intend to take actions as may be required to cure any failure to satisfy the tests within thirty days after the close of any quarter or within the six month periods described above. 
Based on the discussion above, we believe that we have satisfied, and will continue to satisfy, the REIT asset tests outlined above on a continuing basis beginning with our first taxable year as a REIT.
Annual Distribution Requirements. In order to qualify for taxation as a REIT under the IRC, we are required to make annual distributions other than capital gain dividends to our shareholders in an amount at least equal to the excess of:

(1) | the sum of 90% of our “real estate investment trust taxable income” and 90% of our net income after tax, if any, from property received in foreclosure, over


(2) | the amount by which our non-cash income (e.g., imputed rental income or income from transactions inadvertently failing to qualify as like-kind exchanges) exceeds 5% of our “real estate investment trust taxable income.”

For these purposes, our “real estate investment trust taxable income” is as defined under Section 857 of the IRC and is computed without regard to the dividends paid deduction and our net capital gain and will generally be reduced by specified corporate-level taxes that we pay (e.g., taxes on built-in gains or foreclosure property income).
16

For our 2014 and prior taxable years, a distribution of ours that was not pro rata within a class of our beneficial interests entitled to a distribution, or which was not consistent with the rights to distributions among our classes of beneficial interests, would have been a preferential distribution that would not have been taken into consideration for purposes of the distribution requirements, and accordingly the payment of a preferential distribution would have affected our ability to meet the distribution requirements. Taking into account our distribution policies, including any dividend reinvestment plan we adopted, we do not believe that we made any preferential distributions in 2014 or prior taxable years. From and after our 2015 taxable year, the preferential distribution rule has not applied to us because we have been and expect to remain a “publicly offered REIT” (as defined in Section 562(c)(2) of the IRC) that is required to file annual and periodic reports with the SEC under the Exchange Act. 
Distributions must be paid in the taxable year to which they relate, or in the following taxable year if declared before we timely file our federal income tax return for the earlier taxable year and if paid on or before the first regular distribution payment after that declaration. If a dividend is declared in October, November or December to shareholders of record during one of those months, and is paid during the following January, then for federal income tax purposes such dividend will be treated as having been both paid and received on December 31 of the prior taxable year. 
The 90% distribution requirements may be waived by the IRS if a REIT establishes that it failed to meet them by reason of distributions previously made to meet the requirements of the 4% excise tax discussed below. To the extent that we do not distribute all of our net capital gain and all of our “real estate investment trust taxable income,” as adjusted, we will be subject to federal income tax at regular corporate tax rates on undistributed amounts. Even if we fully distribute our net capital gain and all of our “real estate investment trust taxable income,” we may be subject to the corporate alternative minimum tax on our items of tax preference. In addition, we will be subject to a 4% nondeductible excise tax to the extent we fail within a calendar year to make required distributions to our shareholders of 85% of our ordinary income and 95% of our capital gain net income plus the excess, if any, of the “grossed up required distribution” for the preceding calendar year over the amount treated as distributed for that preceding calendar year. For this purpose, the term “grossed up required distribution” for any calendar year is the sum of our taxable income for the calendar year without regard to the deduction for dividends paid and all amounts from earlier years that are not treated as having been distributed under the provision. We will be treated as having sufficient earnings and profits to treat as a dividend any distribution by us up to the amount required to be distributed in order to avoid imposition of the 4% excise tax.
If we do not have enough cash or other liquid assets to meet the 90% distribution requirements, or if we so choose, we may find it necessary or desirable to arrange for new debt or equity financing to provide funds for required distributions in order to maintain our qualification for taxation as a REIT. We can provide no assurance that financing would be available for these purposes on favorable terms, or at all.
We may be able to rectify a failure to pay sufficient dividends for any year by paying “deficiency dividends” to shareholders in a later year. These deficiency dividends may be included in our deduction for dividends paid for the earlier year, but an interest charge would be imposed upon us for the delay in distribution. While the payment of a deficiency dividend will apply to a prior year for purposes of our REIT distribution requirements and our dividends paid deduction, it will be treated as an additional distribution to the shareholders receiving it in the year such dividend is paid.
In addition to the other distribution requirements above, to preserve our qualification for taxation as a REIT we are required to timely distribute all C corporation earnings and profits that we inherit from acquired corporations, as described below.
Acquisitions of C Corporations
We may in the future engage in transactions where we acquire all of the outstanding stock of a C corporation. Upon these acquisitions, except to the extent we make an applicable TRS election, each of our acquired entities and their various wholly-owned corporate and noncorporate subsidiaries will become our QRSs. Thus, after such acquisitions, all assets, liabilities and items of income, deduction and credit of the acquired and then disregarded entities will be treated as ours for purposes of the various REIT qualification tests described above. In addition, we generally will be treated as the successor to the acquired and then disregarded entities’ federal income tax attributes, such as those entities’ (a) adjusted tax bases in their assets and their depreciation schedules; and (b) earnings and profits for federal income tax purposes, if any. The carryover of these attributes creates REIT implications such as built-in gains tax exposure and additional distribution requirements, as described below. However, when we make an election under Section 338(g) of the IRC with respect to corporations that we acquire, we generally will not be subject to such attribute carryovers in respect of attributes existing prior to such election.
Built-in Gains from C Corporations. Notwithstanding our qualification and taxation as a REIT, under specified circumstances we may be subject to corporate taxation if we acquire a REIT asset where our adjusted tax basis in the asset is determined by reference to the adjusted tax basis of the asset as owned by a C corporation. For instance, we may be subject to federal income taxation on all or part of the built-in gain (calculated as of the date the property ceased being owned by the C 
17

corporation) on such an asset if we sell the asset during a prescribed period beginning on the day the asset was acquired. The prescribed period has ranged from as much as ten years to as few as five years, and is currently five years. To the extent of our gains in a taxable year that are subject to the built-in gains tax, net of any taxes paid on such gains with respect to that taxable year, our taxable dividends paid in the following year will be potentially eligible for taxation to noncorporate U.S. shareholders at the preferential tax rates for “qualified dividends” as described below in “—Taxation of Taxable U.S. Shareholders”. We generally do not expect to sell assets if doing so would result in the imposition of a material built-in gains tax liability; but if and when we do sell assets that may have associated built-in gains tax exposure, then we expect to make appropriate provision for the associated tax liabilities on our financial statements.
Earnings and Profits. Following a corporate acquisition, we must generally distribute all of the C corporation earnings and profits inherited in that transaction, if any, no later than the end of our taxable year in which the transaction occurs, in order to preserve our qualification for taxation as a REIT. However, if we fail to do so, relief provisions would allow us to maintain our qualification for taxation as a REIT provided we distribute any subsequently discovered C corporation earnings and profits and pay an interest charge in respect of the period of delayed distribution. C corporation earnings and profits that we inherit are, in general, specially allocated under a priority rule to the earliest possible distributions following the event causing the inheritance, and only then is the balance of our earnings and profits for the taxable year allocated among our distributions to the extent not already treated as a distribution of C corporation earnings and profits under the priority rule. The distribution of these earnings and profits is potentially eligible for taxation to noncorporate U.S. shareholders at the preferential tax rates for “qualified dividends” as described below in “—Taxation of Taxable U.S. Shareholders”.
Acquisition of CCIT
We acquired CCIT (an entity that itself had qualified for taxation as a REIT prior to such acquisition) in 2015 in a transaction that was intended to qualify as a “reorganization” within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the IRC, and both our counsel, Sullivan & Worcester LLP, and counsel to CCIT so opined. As a result, we are generally liable for unpaid taxes, including penalties and interest (if any), of CCIT. In addition, if CCIT is deemed to have lost its qualification for taxation as a REIT prior to the date that we acquired it and no relief is available, we would face the following tax consequences:

• | as the successor by merger to CCIT, we would generally inherit any corporate income tax liabilities of CCIT, including penalties and interest;


• | we would be subject to tax on the built-in gain on each asset of CCIT existing at the time we acquired it if we were to dispose of a CCIT asset during the five-year period following the date that we acquired CCIT; and


• | we could be required to pay a special distribution and/or employ applicable deficiency dividend procedures (including interest payments to the IRS) to eliminate any earnings and profits accumulated by CCIT for taxable periods that it did not qualify for taxation as a REIT.

Finally, if there is an adjustment to CCIT’s “real estate investment trust taxable income” or dividends paid deductions, we could elect to use the deficiency dividend procedure described above to preserve our predecessor CCIT’s qualification for taxation as a REIT. That deficiency dividend procedure could require us to make significant distributions to our shareholders and to pay significant interest to the IRS.
Depreciation and Federal Income Tax Treatment of Leases
Our initial tax bases in our assets will generally be our acquisition cost. We will generally depreciate our depreciable real property on a straight-line basis over forty years and our personal property over the applicable shorter periods. These depreciation schedules may vary for properties that we acquire through tax-free or carryover basis acquisitions, or that are the subject of cost segregation analyses.
We are entitled to depreciation deductions from our facilities only if we are treated for federal income tax purposes as the owner of the facilities. This means that the leases of the facilities must be classified for federal income tax purposes as true leases, rather than as sales or financing arrangements, and we believe this to be the case. 
Distributions to our Shareholders 
As described above, we expect to make distributions to our shareholders from time to time. These distributions may include cash distributions, in kind distributions of property, and deemed or constructive distributions resulting from capital market activities. The U.S. federal income tax treatment of our distributions will vary based on the status of the recipient shareholder as 
18

more fully described below under “—Taxation of Taxable U.S. Shareholders,” “—Taxation of Tax-Exempt U.S. Shareholders,” and “—Taxation of Non-U.S. Shareholders.”
A redemption of our shares for cash only will be treated as a distribution under Section 302 of the IRC, and hence taxable as a dividend to the extent of our available current or accumulated earnings and profits, unless the redemption satisfies one of the tests set forth in Section 302(b) of the IRC enabling the redemption to be treated as a sale or exchange of the shares. The redemption for cash only will be treated as a sale or exchange if it (a) is “substantially disproportionate” with respect to the surrendering shareholder’s ownership in us, (b) results in a “complete termination” of the surrendering shareholder’s entire share interest in us, or (c) is “not essentially equivalent to a dividend” with respect to the surrendering shareholder, all within the meaning of Section 302(b) of the IRC. In determining whether any of these tests have been met, a shareholder must generally take into account shares considered to be owned by such shareholder by reason of constructive ownership rules set forth in the IRC, as well as shares actually owned by such shareholder. In addition, if a redemption is treated as a distribution under the preceding tests, then a shareholder’s tax basis in the redeemed shares generally will be transferred to the shareholder’s remaining shares in us, if any, and if such shareholder owns no other shares in us, such basis generally may be transferred to a related person or may be lost entirely. Because the determination as to whether a shareholder will satisfy any of the tests of Section 302(b) of the IRC depends upon the facts and circumstances at the time that our shares are redeemed, we urge you to consult your own tax advisor to determine your particular tax treatment of any redemption.
Taxation of Taxable U.S. Shareholders
For noncorporate U.S. shareholders, to the extent that their total adjusted income does not exceed applicable thresholds, the maximum federal income tax rate for long-term capital gains and most corporate dividends is generally 15%. For those noncorporate U.S. shareholders whose total adjusted income exceeds the applicable thresholds, the maximum federal income tax rate for long-term capital gains and most corporate dividends is generally 20%. However, because we are not generally subject to federal income tax on the portion of our “real estate investment trust taxable income” distributed to our shareholders, dividends on our shares generally are not eligible for such preferential tax rates, except that any distribution of C corporation earnings and profits and taxed built-in gain items will potentially be eligible for these preferential tax rates. As a result, our ordinary dividends are generally taxed at the higher federal income tax rates applicable to ordinary income. To summarize, the preferential federal income tax rates for long-term capital gains and for qualified dividends generally apply to:

(1) | long-term capital gains, if any, recognized on the disposition of our shares;


(2) | our distributions designated as long-term capital gain dividends (except to the extent attributable to real estate depreciation recapture, in which case the distributions are subject to a maximum 25% federal income tax rate);


(3) | our dividends attributable to dividend income, if any, received by us from C corporations such as TRSs;


(4) | our dividends attributable to earnings and profits that we inherit from C corporations; and


(5) | our dividends to the extent attributable to income upon which we have paid federal corporate income tax (such as taxes on built-in gains), net of the corporate taxes thereon.

As long as we qualify for taxation as a REIT, a distribution to our U.S. shareholders that we do not designate as a capital gain dividend generally will be treated as an ordinary income dividend to the extent of our available current or accumulated earnings and profits. Distributions made out of our current or accumulated earnings and profits that we properly designate as capital gain dividends generally will be taxed as long-term capital gains, as discussed below, to the extent they do not exceed our actual net capital gain for the taxable year. However, corporate shareholders may be required to treat up to 20% of any capital gain dividend as ordinary income under Section 291 of the IRC.
In addition, we may elect to retain net capital gain income and treat it as constructively distributed. In that case:

(1) | we will be taxed at regular corporate capital gains tax rates on retained amounts;


(2) | each U.S. shareholder will be taxed on its designated proportionate share of our retained net capital gains as though that amount were distributed and designated as a capital gain dividend;


(3) | each U.S. shareholder will receive a credit or refund for its designated proportionate share of the tax that we pay;

19


(4) | each U.S. shareholder will increase its adjusted basis in our shares by the excess of the amount of its proportionate share of these retained net capital gains over the U.S. shareholder’s proportionate share of the tax that we pay; and


(5) | both we and our corporate shareholders will make commensurate adjustments in our respective earnings and profits for federal income tax purposes.

If we elect to retain our net capital gains in this fashion, we will notify our U.S. shareholders of the relevant tax information within sixty days after the close of the affected taxable year.
If for any taxable year we designate capital gain dividends for our shareholders, then a portion of the capital gain dividends we designate will be allocated to the holders of a particular class of shares on a percentage basis equal to the ratio of the amount of the total dividends paid or made available for the year to the holders of that class of shares to the total dividends paid or made available for the year to holders of all outstanding classes of our shares. We will similarly designate the portion of any capital gain dividend that is to be taxed to noncorporate U.S. shareholders at preferential maximum rates (including any capital gains attributable to real estate depreciation recapture that are subject to a maximum 25% federal income tax rate) so that the designations will be proportionate among all outstanding classes of our shares.
Distributions in excess of our current or accumulated earnings and profits will not be taxable to a U.S. shareholder to the extent that they do not exceed the shareholder’s adjusted tax basis in our shares, but will reduce the shareholder’s basis in such shares. To the extent that these excess distributions exceed a U.S. shareholder’s adjusted basis in such shares, they will be included in income as capital gain, with long-term gain generally taxed to noncorporate U.S. shareholders at preferential maximum rates. No U.S. shareholder may include on its federal income tax return any of our net operating losses or any of our capital losses. In addition, no portion of any of our dividends is eligible for the dividends received deduction for corporate shareholders.
If a dividend is declared in October, November or December to shareholders of record during one of those months, and is paid during the following January, then for federal income tax purposes the dividend will be treated as having been both paid and received on December 31 of the prior taxable year. Also, items that are treated differently for regular and alternative minimum tax purposes are to be allocated between a REIT and its shareholders under Treasury regulations which are to be prescribed. It is possible that these Treasury regulations will permit or require tax preference items to be allocated to our shareholders with respect to any accelerated depreciation or other tax preference items that we claim. We may choose to allocate applicable tax preference items to our shareholders, even in the absence of such regulations.
A U.S. shareholder will generally recognize gain or loss equal to the difference between the amount realized and the shareholder’s adjusted basis in our shares that are sold or exchanged. This gain or loss will be capital gain or loss, and will be long-term capital gain or loss if the shareholder’s holding period in our shares exceeds one year. In addition, any loss upon a sale or exchange of our shares held for six months or less will generally be treated as a long-term capital loss to the extent of any long-term capital gain dividends we paid on such shares during the holding period.
U.S. shareholders who are individuals, estates or trusts are generally required to pay a 3.8% Medicare tax on their net investment income (including dividends on and gains from the sale or other disposition of our shares), or in the case of estates and trusts on their net investment income that is not distributed, in each case to the extent that their total adjusted income exceeds applicable thresholds.
If a U.S. shareholder recognizes a loss upon a disposition of our shares in an amount that exceeds a prescribed threshold, it is possible that the provisions of Treasury regulations involving “reportable transactions” could apply, with a resulting requirement to separately disclose the loss-generating transaction to the IRS. These Treasury regulations are written quite broadly, and apply to many routine and simple transactions. A reportable transaction currently includes, among other things, a sale or exchange of our shares resulting in a tax loss in excess of (a) $10 million in any single year or $20 million in a prescribed combination of taxable years in the case of our shares held by a C corporation or by a partnership with only C corporation partners or (b) $2 million in any single year or $4 million in a prescribed combination of taxable years in the case of our shares held by any other partnership or an S corporation, trust or individual, including losses that flow through pass through entities to individuals. A taxpayer discloses a reportable transaction by filing IRS Form 8886 with its federal income tax return and, in the first year of filing, a copy of Form 8886 must be sent to the IRS’s Office of Tax Shelter Analysis. The annual maximum penalty for failing to disclose a reportable transaction is generally $10,000 in the case of a natural person and $50,000 in any other case. 
Noncorporate U.S. shareholders who borrow funds to finance their acquisition of our shares could be limited in the amount of deductions allowed for the interest paid on the indebtedness incurred. Under Section 163(d) of the IRC, interest paid or accrued on indebtedness incurred or continued to purchase or carry property held for investment is generally deductible only to the extent 
20

of the investor’s net investment income. A U.S. shareholder’s net investment income will include ordinary income dividend distributions received from us and, if an appropriate election is made by the shareholder, capital gain dividend distributions and qualified dividends received from us; however, distributions treated as a nontaxable return of the shareholder’s basis will not enter into the computation of net investment income.
Taxation of Tax-Exempt U.S. Shareholders
The rules governing the federal income taxation of tax-exempt entities are complex, and the following discussion is intended only as a summary of material considerations of an investment in our shares relevant to such investors. If you are a tax-exempt shareholder, we urge you to consult your own tax advisor to determine the impact of federal, state, local and foreign tax laws, including any tax return filing and other reporting requirements, with respect to your acquisition or investment in our shares.
Our distributions made to shareholders that are tax-exempt pension plans, individual retirement accounts or other qualifying tax-exempt entities should not constitute UBTI, provided that the shareholder has not financed its acquisition of our shares with “acquisition indebtedness” within the meaning of the IRC, that the shares are not otherwise used in an unrelated trade or business of the tax-exempt entity, and that, consistent with our present intent, we do not hold a residual interest in a real estate mortgage investment conduit. Special UBTI rules under Section 856(h)(3) of the IRC may apply to a trust described in Section 401(a) of the IRC if it owns more than 10% by value of a class of our shares.
Taxation of Non-U.S. Shareholders
The rules governing the U.S. federal income taxation of non-U.S. shareholders are complex, and the following discussion is intended only as a summary of material considerations of an investment in our shares relevant to such investors. If you are a non-U.S. shareholder, we urge you to consult your own tax advisor to determine the impact of U.S. federal, state, local and foreign tax laws, including any tax return filing and other reporting requirements, with respect to your acquisition or investment in our shares.
We expect that a non-U.S. shareholder’s receipt of (a) distributions from us, and (b) proceeds from the sale of our shares, will not be treated as income effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business and a non-U.S. shareholder will therefore not be subject to the higher tax rates and increased reporting requirements that apply to income effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business. This expectation and a number of the determinations below are predicated on our shares being listed on a U.S. national securities exchange, such as The NASDAQ Stock Market LLC, or Nasdaq.  Although there can be no assurance in this regard, we expect that each class of our shares has been and will remain listed on a U.S. national securities exchange; however, we can provide no assurance that our shares will continue to be so listed in future taxable years or that any class of our shares that we may issue in the future will be so listed. 
Distributions. A distribution by us to a non-U.S. shareholder that is not designated as a capital gain dividend will be treated as an ordinary income dividend to the extent that it is made out of our current or accumulated earnings and profits. A distribution of this type will generally be subject to U.S. federal income tax and withholding at the rate of 30%, or at a lower rate if the non-U.S. shareholder has in the manner prescribed by the IRS demonstrated to the applicable withholding agent its entitlement to benefits under a tax treaty. Because we cannot determine our current and accumulated earnings and profits until the end of the taxable year, withholding at the statutory rate of 30% or applicable lower treaty rate will generally be imposed on the gross amount of any distribution to a non-U.S. shareholder that we make and do not designate as a capital gain dividend. Notwithstanding this potential withholding on distributions in excess of our current and accumulated earnings and profits, these distributions are a nontaxable return of capital to the extent that they do not exceed the non-U.S. shareholder’s adjusted basis in our shares, and the nontaxable return of capital will reduce the adjusted basis in these shares. To the extent that distributions in excess of our current and accumulated earnings and profits exceed the non-U.S. shareholder’s adjusted basis in our shares, the distributions will give rise to federal income tax liability only in the unlikely event that the non-U.S. shareholder would otherwise be subject to tax on any gain from the sale or exchange of these shares, as discussed below under “—Dispositions of Our Shares.” A non-U.S. shareholder may seek a refund from the IRS of amounts withheld on distributions to it in excess of our current and accumulated earnings and profits.
For so long as a class of our shares is listed on a U.S. national securities exchange, capital gain dividends that we declare and pay to a non-U.S. shareholder on those shares, as well as dividends to a non-U.S. shareholder on those shares attributable to our sale or exchange of “United States real property interests” within the meaning of Section 897 of the IRC, or USRPIs, will not be subject to withholding as though those amounts were effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business, and non-U.S. shareholders will not be required to file U.S. federal income tax returns or pay branch profits tax in respect of these dividends. Instead, these dividends will generally be treated as ordinary dividends and subject to withholding in the manner described above. 
21

Tax treaties may reduce the withholding obligations on our distributions. Under some treaties, however, rates below 30% that are applicable to ordinary income dividends from U.S. corporations may not apply to ordinary income dividends from a REIT or may apply only if the REIT meets specified additional conditions. A non-U.S. shareholder must generally use an applicable IRS Form W-8, or substantially similar form, to claim tax treaty benefits. If the amount of tax withheld with respect to a distribution to a non-U.S. shareholder exceeds the shareholder’s U.S. federal income tax liability with respect to the distribution, the non-U.S. shareholder may file for a refund of the excess from the IRS. Treasury regulations also provide special rules to determine whether, for purposes of determining the applicability of a tax treaty, our distributions to a non-U.S. shareholder that is an entity should be treated as paid to the entity or to those owning an interest in that entity, and whether the entity or its owners are entitled to benefits under the tax treaty. 
If, contrary to our expectation, a class of our shares was not listed on a U.S. national securities exchange and we made a distribution on those shares that was attributable to gain from the sale or exchange of a USRPI, then a non-U.S. shareholder holding those shares would be taxed as if the distribution was gain effectively connected with a trade or business in the United States conducted by the non-U.S. shareholder. In addition, the applicable withholding agent would be required to withhold from a distribution to such a non-U.S. shareholder, and remit to the IRS, up to 35% of the maximum amount of any distribution that was or could have been designated as a capital gain dividend. The non-U.S. shareholder also would generally be subject to the same treatment as a U.S. shareholder with respect to the distribution (subject to any applicable alternative minimum tax and a special alternative minimum tax in the case of a nonresident alien individual), would be subject to fulsome U.S. federal income tax return reporting requirements, and, in the case of a corporate non-U.S. shareholder, may owe the up to 30% branch profits tax under Section 884 of the IRC (or lower applicable tax treaty rate) in respect of these amounts. 
A special “wash sale” rule under Section 897(h)(5) of the IRC may apply to a non-U.S. shareholder that owns more than 10% of a class of our shares.
Dispositions of Our Shares. If as expected our shares are not USRPIs, then a non-U.S. shareholder’s gain on the sale of these shares generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income taxation or withholding. We expect that our shares will not be USRPIs because one or both of the following exemptions will be available at all times.
First, for so long as a class of our shares is listed on a U.S. national securities exchange, a non-U.S. shareholder’s gain on the sale of those shares will not be subject to U.S. federal income taxation as a sale of a USRPI. Second, our shares will not constitute USRPIs if we are a “domestically controlled REIT.” A domestically controlled REIT is a REIT in which at all times during the preceding five-year period less than 50% of the fair market value of its outstanding shares was directly or indirectly held by foreign persons. From and after December 18, 2015, a person who at all relevant times holds less than 5% of a REIT’s shares that are “regularly traded” on a domestic “established securities market” is deemed to be a U.S. person in making the determination of whether a REIT is domestically controlled, unless the REIT has actual knowledge that the person is not a U.S. person. Other presumptions apply in making the determination with respect to other classes of REIT shareholders. As a result of applicable presumptions, we expect to be able to demonstrate from and after December 18, 2015 that we are less than 50% foreign owned. For periods prior to December 18, 2015, we believe that we were less than 50% foreign owned, but that may not be possible to demonstrate unless and until a pending technical correction clarifies the statute on this point. Accordingly, we can provide no assurance that we have been or will remain a domestically controlled REIT, particularly if that determination includes the period before December 18, 2015, when the presumptions described above may not apply unless and until the pending technical correction is passed. 
If, contrary to our expectation, a gain on the sale of our shares is subject to U.S. federal income taxation (for example, because neither of the above exemptions were then available, i.e., that class of our shares were not then listed on a U.S. national securities exchange and we were not a domestically controlled REIT), then (a) a non-U.S. shareholder would generally be subject to the same treatment as a U.S. shareholder with respect to its gain (subject to any applicable alternative minimum tax and a special alternative minimum tax in the case of nonresident alien individuals), (b) the non-U.S. shareholder would also be subject to fulsome U.S. federal income tax return reporting requirements, and (c) a purchaser of that class of our shares from the non-U.S. shareholder may be required to withhold 15% of the purchase price paid to the non-U.S. shareholder and to remit the withheld amount to the IRS. 
Information Reporting, Backup Withholding, and Foreign Account Withholding
Information reporting, backup withholding, and foreign account withholding may apply to distributions or proceeds paid to our shareholders under the circumstances discussed below. If a shareholder is subject to backup or other U.S. federal income tax withholding, then the applicable withholding agent will be required to withhold the appropriate amount with respect to a deemed or constructive distribution or a distribution in kind even though there is insufficient cash from which to satisfy the withholding obligation. To satisfy this withholding obligation, the applicable withholding agent may collect the amount of U.S. 
22

federal income tax required to be withheld by reducing to cash for remittance to the IRS a sufficient portion of the property that the shareholder would otherwise receive or own, and the shareholder may bear brokerage or other costs for this withholding procedure.
The backup withholding rate is currently 28%. Amounts withheld under backup withholding are generally not an additional tax and may be refunded by the IRS or credited against the shareholder’s federal income tax liability. A U.S. shareholder may be subject to backup withholding when it receives distributions on our shares or proceeds upon the sale, exchange, redemption, retirement or other disposition of our shares, unless the U.S. shareholder properly executes, or has previously properly executed, under penalties of perjury an IRS Form W-9 or substantially similar form that:

• | provides the U.S. shareholder’s correct taxpayer identification number;


• | certifies that the U.S. shareholder is exempt from backup withholding because (a) it comes within an enumerated exempt category, (b) it has not been notified by the IRS that it is subject to backup withholding, or (c) it has been notified by the IRS that it is no longer subject to backup withholding; and


• | certifies that it is a U.S. citizen or other U.S. person.

If the U.S. shareholder has not provided and does not provide its correct taxpayer identification number and appropriate certifications on an IRS Form W-9 or substantially similar form, it may be subject to penalties imposed by the IRS, and the applicable withholding agent may have to withhold a portion of any distributions or proceeds paid to such U.S. shareholder. Unless the U.S. shareholder has established on a properly executed IRS Form W-9 or substantially similar form that it comes within an enumerated exempt category, distributions or proceeds on our shares paid to it during the calendar year, and the amount of tax withheld, if any, will be reported to it and to the IRS.
Distributions on our shares to a non-U.S. shareholder during each calendar year and the amount of tax withheld, if any, will generally be reported to the non-U.S. shareholder and to the IRS. This information reporting requirement applies regardless of whether the non-U.S. shareholder is subject to withholding on distributions on our shares or whether the withholding was reduced or eliminated by an applicable tax treaty. Also, distributions paid to a non-U.S. shareholder on our shares will generally be subject to backup withholding, unless the non-U.S. shareholder properly certifies to the applicable withholding agent its non-U.S. shareholder status on an applicable IRS Form W-8 or substantially similar form. Information reporting and backup withholding will not apply to proceeds a non-U.S. shareholder receives upon the sale, exchange, redemption, retirement or other disposition of our shares, if the non-U.S. shareholder properly certifies to the applicable withholding agent its non-U.S. shareholder status on an applicable IRS Form W-8 or substantially similar form. Even without having executed an applicable IRS Form W-8 or substantially similar form, however, in some cases information reporting and backup withholding will not apply to proceeds that a non-U.S. shareholder receives upon the sale, exchange, redemption, retirement or other disposition of our shares if the non-U.S. shareholder receives those proceeds through a broker’s foreign office.
Non-U.S. financial institutions and other non-U.S. entities are subject to diligence and reporting requirements for purposes of identifying accounts and investments held directly or indirectly by U.S. persons. The failure to comply with these additional information reporting, certification and other requirements could result in a 30% withholding tax on applicable payments to non-U.S. persons. In particular, a payee that is a foreign financial institution that is subject to the diligence and reporting requirements described above must enter into an agreement with the U.S. Department of the Treasury requiring, among other things, that it undertake to identify accounts held by “specified United States persons” or “United States owned foreign entities” (each as defined in the IRC), annually report information about such accounts, and withhold 30% on applicable payments to noncompliant foreign financial institutions and account holders. Foreign financial institutions located in jurisdictions that have an intergovernmental agreement with the United States with respect to these requirements may be subject to different rules. The foregoing withholding regime generally applies to payments of dividends on our shares, and is expected to generally apply to other “withholdable payments” (including payments of gross proceeds from a sale, exchange, redemption, retirement or other disposition of our shares) made after December 31, 2018. In general, to avoid withholding, any non-U.S. intermediary through which a shareholder owns our shares must establish its compliance with the foregoing regime, and a non-U.S. shareholder must provide specified documentation (usually an applicable IRS Form W-8) containing information about its identity, its status, and if required, its direct and indirect U.S. owners. Non-U.S. shareholders and shareholders who hold our shares through a non-U.S. intermediary are encouraged to consult their own tax advisors regarding foreign account tax compliance.
Other Tax Considerations
Our tax treatment and that of our shareholders may be modified by legislative, judicial or administrative actions at any time, which actions may be retroactive in effect. The rules dealing with federal income taxation are constantly under review by 
23

the U.S. Congress, the IRS and the U.S. Department of the Treasury, and statutory changes, new regulations, revisions to existing regulations and revised interpretations of established concepts are issued frequently. Likewise, the rules regarding taxes other than U.S. federal income taxes may also be modified. No prediction can be made as to the likelihood of passage of new tax legislation or other provisions, or the direct or indirect effect on us and our shareholders. Revisions to tax laws and interpretations of these laws could adversely affect our ability to qualify and be taxed as a REIT, as well as the tax or other consequences of an investment in our shares. We and our shareholders may also be subject to taxation by state, local or other jurisdictions, including those in which we or our shareholders transact business or reside. These tax consequences may not be comparable to the U.S. federal income tax consequences discussed above.
ERISA PLANS, KEOGH PLANS AND INDIVIDUAL RETIREMENT ACCOUNTS
General Fiduciary Obligations
Fiduciaries of a pension, profit-sharing or other employee benefit plan subject to Title I of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended, or ERISA, must consider whether:

• | their investment in our shares or other securities satisfies the diversification requirements of ERISA;


• | the investment is prudent in light of possible limitations on the marketability of our shares;


• | they have authority to acquire our shares or other securities under the applicable governing instrument and Title I of ERISA; and


• | the investment is otherwise consistent with their fiduciary responsibilities.

Trustees and other fiduciaries of an ERISA plan may incur personal liability for any loss suffered by the plan on account of a violation of their fiduciary responsibilities. In addition, these fiduciaries may be subject to a civil penalty of up to 20% of any amount recovered by the plan on account of a violation. Fiduciaries of any individual retirement account or annuity, or IRA, Roth IRA, tax-favored account (such as an Archer MSA, Coverdell education savings account or health savings account), Keogh plan or other qualified retirement plan not subject to Title I of ERISA, or non-ERISA plans, should consider that the plan may only make investments that are authorized by the appropriate governing instrument.
Fiduciaries considering an investment in our securities should consult their own legal advisors if they have any concern as to whether the investment is consistent with the foregoing criteria or is otherwise appropriate. The sale of our securities to an ERISA or non-ERISA plan is in no respect a representation by us or any underwriter of the securities that the investment meets all relevant legal requirements with respect to investments by plans generally or any particular plan, or that the investment is appropriate for plans generally or any particular plan.
Prohibited Transactions
Fiduciaries of ERISA plans and persons making the investment decision for a non-ERISA plan should consider the application of the prohibited transaction provisions of ERISA and the IRC in making their investment decision. Sales and other transactions between an ERISA or non-ERISA plan, and persons related to it, are prohibited transactions. The particular facts concerning the sponsorship, operations and other investments of an ERISA plan or non-ERISA plan may cause a wide range of other persons to be treated as disqualified persons or parties in interest with respect to it. A prohibited transaction, in addition to imposing potential personal liability upon fiduciaries of ERISA plans, may also result in the imposition of an excise tax under the IRC or a penalty under ERISA upon the disqualified person or party in interest with respect to the plan. If the disqualified person who engages in the transaction is the individual on behalf of whom an IRA, Roth IRA or other tax-favored account is maintained or his beneficiary, the IRA, Roth IRA or other tax-favored account may lose its tax-exempt status and its assets may be deemed to have been distributed to the individual in a taxable distribution on account of the prohibited transaction, but no excise tax will be imposed. Fiduciaries considering an investment in our securities should consult their own legal advisors as to whether the ownership of our securities involves a prohibited transaction.
“Plan Assets” Considerations
The U.S. Department of Labor has issued a regulation defining “plan assets.” The regulation, as subsequently modified by ERISA, generally provides that when an ERISA or non-ERISA plan acquires a security that is an equity interest in an entity and that security is neither a “publicly offered security” nor a security issued by an investment company registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, the ERISA plan’s or non-ERISA plan’s assets include both the equity interest and 
24

an undivided interest in each of the underlying assets of the entity, unless it is established either that the entity is an operating company or that equity participation in the entity by benefit plan investors is not significant. We are not an investment company registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended.
Each class of our equity (that is, our common shares and any other class of equity that we may issue) must be analyzed separately to ascertain whether it is a publicly offered security. The regulation defines a publicly offered security as a security that is “widely held,” “freely transferable” and either part of a class of securities registered under the Exchange Act, or sold under an effective registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, provided the securities are registered under the Exchange Act within 120 days after the end of the fiscal year of the issuer during which the offering occurred. Each class of our outstanding shares has been registered under the Exchange Act within the necessary time frame to satisfy the foregoing condition.
The regulation provides that a security is “widely held” only if it is part of a class of securities that is owned by 100 or more investors independent of the issuer and of one another. However, a security will not fail to be “widely held” because the number of independent investors falls below 100 subsequent to the initial public offering as a result of events beyond the issuer’s control. We believe our common shares have been and will remain widely held, and we expect the same to be true of any future class of equity that we may issue, but we can give no assurances in this regard.
The regulation provides that whether a security is “freely transferable” is a factual question to be determined on the basis of all relevant facts and circumstances. The regulation further provides that, where a security is part of an offering in which the minimum investment is $10,000 or less, some restrictions on transfer ordinarily will not, alone or in combination, affect a finding that these securities are freely transferable. The restrictions on transfer enumerated in the regulation as not affecting that finding include:

• | any restriction on or prohibition against any transfer or assignment that would result in a termination or reclassification for federal or state tax purposes, or would otherwise violate any state or federal law or court order;


• | any requirement that advance notice of a transfer or assignment be given to the issuer and any requirement that either the transferor or transferee, or both, execute documentation setting forth representations as to compliance with any restrictions on transfer that are among those enumerated in the regulation as not affecting free transferability, including those described in the preceding clause of this sentence;


• | any administrative procedure that establishes an effective date, or an event prior to which a transfer or assignment will not be effective; and


• | any limitation or restriction on transfer or assignment that is not imposed by the issuer or a person acting on behalf of the issuer.

We believe that the restrictions imposed under our declaration of trust on the transfer of shares do not result in the failure of our shares to be “freely transferable.” Furthermore, we believe that there exist no other facts or circumstances limiting the transferability of our shares that are not included among those enumerated as not affecting their free transferability under the regulation, and we do not expect or intend to impose in the future, or to permit any person to impose on our behalf, any limitations or restrictions on transfer that would not be among the enumerated permissible limitations or restrictions.
Assuming that each class of our shares will be “widely held” and that no other facts and circumstances exist that restrict transferability of these shares, our counsel, Sullivan & Worcester LLP, is of the opinion that our shares will not fail to be “freely transferable” for purposes of the regulation due to the restrictions on transfer of our shares under our declaration of trust and that under the regulation each class of our currently outstanding shares is publicly offered and our assets will not be deemed to be “plan assets” of any ERISA plan or non-ERISA plan that acquires our shares in a public offering. This opinion is conditioned upon certain assumptions and representations, as discussed above in “Material United States Federal Income Tax Considerations—Taxation as a REIT.”
