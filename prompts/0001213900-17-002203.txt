ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Business Overview
 
Our Business
 
We develop and market enterprise legacy migration solutions and provide tools and professional services to international markets through several entities including wholly-owned and majority-owned subsidiaries located in: the United States, the United Kingdom, Italy, Romania, and Israel.  These technologies and services allow businesses to migrate from their legacy mainframe and distributed information technology infrastructures to modern environments and programming languages.
 
Through the use of Modern Systems developed technology, we:
 

● | perform conversions of legacy mainframe applications written in COBOL, CA GEN, Natural, PL/1 to Java and C# code; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | perform conversions of legacy databases such as IDMS, ADABAS, VSAM, IMS, ICL to SQL Server, Oracle and DB2 environments; and 
● | sell “Data Mirroring” software that allows companies to integrate legacy databases with modern relational databases on a routine/ongoing basis enabling data share across an organization without migration.

 
The technology conversion tools are proprietary to us and perform automated code conversion of programming languages and database replication. 
 
In addition to the technology tools, we provide professional services for:
 

● | project management of migrations; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------
● | understanding and mapping of the applications; 
● | testing; 
● | remediation; and 
● | ongoing monitoring and management of the environments.

Customers
 
We provide our modernization solutions directly to our customers or through our strategic partners, such as Fujitsu, IBM Corporation (IBM), Computer Sciences Corporation (CSC), Hewlett Packard (HP), Transoft and Dell Inc. Additionally, from time to time, other information technology services companies license our technologies for use in modernization projects in various markets. Our partners include system integrators, as well as other software vendors who assist us in increasing our penetration and exposure in the market. We provide solutions to our partners’ customers in collaboration with the system integrator’s team. In most cases, the partners provide related services to the customers. Our arrangements with our partners vary. We may enter into distribution agreements under which we grant license rights to our partners or to the partners’ customers or provide related services, or a combination of both. Alternatively, we may enter into subcontractor relationships with our strategic partners.
 
A substantial portion of our agreements are in the form of fixed price contracts. We bear risks and uncertainties in these contracts, as we price these contracts based on estimates of future costs, duration of the project, and the impact of potential changes in the scope of the work. We also enter into other types of contracts, including annual maintenance contracts, license agreements, and arrangements on a time and materials basis.
 
In 2016, Transoft and Intellectual Property Office accounted for 18.1% and 10.3% of our revenue, respectively. In 2015, Dell and IBM accounted for 21.6% and 13.7% of our revenue, respectively 
 
The following table summarizes our revenue by geographic regions based on the location of the end customer for the periods indicated:
 

 | Year ended December 31, | 
------------------+-----------------------------+-------
 | 2016 | | 2015 | 
 | (in thousands) | 
North America | | 6,306 | | | 6,501
Europe | | 4,387 | | | 2,852
Israel | | 288 | | | 454 
Total Revenue | $ | 10,981 | | $ | 9,807

Research and Development
 
We continue to reinvest in our company through our investment in technology and process improvement. We also invest in a skilled and specialized workforce. In 2016, our investment in research and development amounted to $2.1 million as compared to $1.5 million in 2015. The increase was largely due to the additional research and development cost resulting from developing new platforms for conversions to expand our customer base.

Chief Scientist Grants
 
We received, through a subsidiary, an aggregate of approximately $300,000 in grants from the Office of the Chief Scientist in the Ministry of Industry, Trade and Labor of the State of Israel (the “OCS”), for the development of PowerText. PowerText is a software solution for automated electronic document mining, management and presentment. Royalties of 3% are payable to the OCS on all sales of PowerText up to 100% of the dollar-linked grant received. The balance of the contingent liability relating to the royalties payable by our subsidiaries to the OCS, at December 31, 2016, amounted to approximately $177,000.
Intellectual Property
 
Our proprietary technology incorporates processes, methods, algorithms, and software that we believe are not easily copied. Despite these precautions, it may be possible for unauthorized third parties to copy aspects of our products or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary. However, we believe that with regard to most of our solutions, because of the rapid pace of technological change in the industry, patent and copyright protection are less significant to our competitive position than factors such as the knowledge, ability, and experience of our personnel, new product development, and ongoing product maintenance and support.
Challenges and Opportunities
 
In a market that continues to innovate and evolve, new technologies and practices, by definition, render existing technology deployments out-of-date or legacy. By the same measure, however, in order for us to capitalize on the constant source of legacy solutions, we must evolve our solutions portfolio to deal with the changing definition of what constitutes “leading edge” technologies and the growing set that is deemed to be “legacy.” Over time, as one legacy set of technologies is gradually replaced, we must be capable of addressing the modernization needs of the next set of aging technologies. However, these cycles are slow and provide us with the time to update our technology and products and build the necessary knowledge in-house.
 
The fact that the modernization needs of the market are evolving on a constant basis necessitates that we be capable of tracking and predicting changes in technologies. Anticipating the needs of the information technology modernization market and delivering new solutions that satisfy the emerging needs is a critical success factor.
 
However, even if we develop modernization solutions that address the evolving needs of the legacy information technology modernization market, we cannot assure that there will be a predictable demand for our offerings. Variables, ranging from the macro-economic climate, to the competitive landscape, and to the perceived need that the enterprise market has for a specific modernization solution, may have an impact of a longer sales cycle or increased pricing pressure.
 
To keep up with the demand for our solution, we must retain our skilled personnel in the fields of project management, legacy systems, and leading modern technologies. Maintaining and growing the requisite skill base can be problematic; personnel with an understanding of legacy technologies are a finite resource and the market for recruiting and retaining such workforce can be highly competitive.
 
Competition
 
We face competition for our solution from various entities operating in the market. At the highest level, the legacy information technology modernization market competes with two other approaches that can be employed to evolve the operating capabilities of a business: re-building business systems from scratch or buying a commercially available application package that can be configured to serve the specific needs of a particular business.
 
Competition in the legacy information technology modernization field is, to a large extent, based upon the functionality of the available technology and personnel expertise. Vendors in this market address the modernization of legacy systems in different ways, and therefore do not always compete directly with others. Many small vendors, those that possess just a few niche modernization technologies or a focused set of skills, are only capable of addressing a small portion of the overall modernization market. Selected few others are able to offer comprehensive suites of integrated solutions and are able to address the broad set of needs encountered by businesses.

Our principal competitors consist of system integrators, offshore outsourcers, and tool vendors, including leading software developers, who provide replacement or modernization of legacy systems. We also face competition from niche tools and solutions companies operating in the enterprise information technology modernization continuum.
 
In addition, enterprises themselves represent one of the largest categories of competition. For a variety of reasons, many businesses choose to execute legacy information technology modernization projects using their own internal information technology resources. The rationale for a company to attempt to conduct modernization activities using in-house resources varies. Reasons include wanting to justify the existence of available resources, the belief that using internal resources will be quicker or cheaper, and decision makers underestimating the complexity of modernization projects or failing to appreciate the benefits that can result by using experienced personnel and built-for-purpose tools.
