General

Clayton Williams Energy, Inc., incorporated in Delaware in 1991, is an independent oil and gas company engaged in the exploration for and production of oil and natural gas primarily in its core area in Southern Reeves County, Texas.  Unless the context otherwise requires, references to “the Company,” “CWEI,” “we,” “us” or “our” mean Clayton Williams Energy, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries.  On December 31, 2016, our estimated proved reserves were 34,754 MBOE, of which 63% were proved developed.  Our portfolio of oil and natural gas reserves is weighted in favor of oil, with approximately 84% of our proved reserves at December 31, 2016 consisting of oil and natural gas liquids (“NGL”) and approximately 16% consisting of natural gas.  During 2016, we added proved reserves of 4,077 MBOE through extensions and discoveries, had downward revisions of 168 MBOE and had sales of minerals-in-place of 10,728 MBOE.  We also had average net production of 13.7 MBOE per day in 2016, which implies a reserve life of approximately 7.0 years.  CWEI held interests in 2,726 gross (1,096.7 net) producing oil and gas wells and owned leasehold interests in approximately 423,000 gross (232,000 net) undeveloped acres at December 31, 2016.

Clayton W. Williams, Jr. (“Mr. Williams”), Chairman of our Board of Directors (the “Board”) and our Chief Executive Officer, beneficially owns, either individually or through his affiliates, 17.6% of the outstanding shares of our common stock.  In addition, The Williams Children’s Partnership, Ltd. (“WCPL”), a limited partnership of which Mr. Williams’ adult children are the limited partners, and Mel G. Riggs, our President, is the sole member in the general partner, owns an additional 17.3% of the outstanding shares of our common stock.  Messrs. Williams and Riggs actively participate in all facets of our business and have significant influence in matters voted on by our shareholders, including the election of our Board members.
Ares Management, LLC (“Ares”) beneficially owns, either individually or through its affiliates, 42.0% of the outstanding shares of our common stock. In addition, Ares possesses the right to elect up to two members of our Board and to recommend one other director to the Nominating and Governance Committee of the Board for appointment to the Board. Through its elected and recommended Board members and substantial ownership of our common stock, Ares has significant influence in matters voted on by our shareholders, including the election of our Board members.
Company Profile

Business Strategy 

We are an oil and gas operator with a strategic focus on developmental drilling in prolific oil shale provinces. We have significant holdings in one of the major oil shale plays in the United States, the Wolfcamp Shale in the Southern Delaware Basin of West Texas. In addition to our developmental drilling, we may explore for oil and natural gas reserves in areas that we believe offer exceptional opportunities for reserve growth, and we may also search for possible proved property acquisitions.  From year to year, our allocation of investment capital may vary between developmental and exploratory activities depending on our analysis of all available growth opportunities, but our long-term focus on growing oil and natural gas reserves is consistent with our goal of value enhancement for our shareholders. On January 13, 2017, we entered into a definitive agreement to be acquired by Noble Energy. For more information on our proposed merger with Noble Energy, see “— Recent Developments — Proposed Merger with Noble Energy” below.
Recent Developments
The severe downturn in oil prices that began in 2014 significantly reduced our cash flow from operations, causing us to suspend drilling operations in both of our core resource plays early in 2015 in order to preserve liquidity. Management quickly took decisive steps to reduce costs in an attempt to improve margins, but the combination of declining production attributable to suspended drilling activities and the impact of substantially lower oil and natural gas prices on cash flow led our senior management and the Board, beginning in early July 2015, to consider a variety of strategic and financial alternatives for the Company.
Ares Transactions
In August 2015, the Board formed a special committee comprising all four of our independent and disinterested directors to develop, explore and evaluate strategic alternatives for the Company, including potential transactions involving a business combination, a recapitalization, a sale of assets or securities of the Company, or another extraordinary transaction. Goldman, 
7

Sachs & Co. (“Goldman”) was engaged to serve as the Company’s exclusive financial advisor in this process. The special committee also engaged independent legal counsel.
With the assistance of senior management, Goldman identified and contacted potential counterparties on a confidential basis to determine their interest in one or more of the strategic alternatives under consideration by the Company. The Company received indications of interest across all of these alternatives. Throughout the review process, the special committee reviewed indications of interest and other information with Goldman, senior management, legal counsel for the Company and legal counsel for the special committee.
In mid-January 2016, final bids were submitted for various potential transactions, including proposals for secured debt financing. The special committee concluded that a secured debt alternative was favorable to the Company and its shareholders. In reaching this conclusion, the special committee considered, among other factors, that the secured debt alternative (1) avoided a sale of our core assets during a time of declining commodity prices, (2) provided a dedicated source of liquidity to fund our operations and development activities over the next two to three years, (3) limited immediate dilution to existing shareholders and (4) retained the opportunity to ultimately enhance shareholder value if the commodity environment improves. The special committee instructed Goldman to negotiate final proposals with these bidders, and following negotiations, the special committee and the Board unanimously selected the proposal submitted by Ares.
On March 8, 2016, we entered into (1) a credit agreement with Ares providing for the issuance of second lien term loans and common stock warrants and (2) an amendment to the revolving credit facility with our banks (the “Refinancing”). Upon closing of the Refinancing on March 15, 2016, we issued term loans to Ares in the principal amount of $350 million, net of original issue discount of $16.8 million, for cash proceeds of $333.2 million. Concurrently, we issued warrants to purchase 2,251,364 shares of our common stock at a price of $22.00 per share to Ares for cash proceeds equal to the original issue discount from the issuance on the term loans. The warrants represent the right to acquire approximately 12.8% of our outstanding shares of common stock, or approximately 11.2% of our common shares on a fully exercised basis. In connection with the issuance of the warrants, we designated and issued to funds managed by Ares, as the initial warrant holders, 3,500 shares of special voting preferred stock, $0.10 par value per share, granting them certain rights to elect two members of our Board. Aggregate cash proceeds from the transaction of approximately $340 million, net of transaction costs, were used to fully repay the outstanding indebtedness under the revolving credit facility of $160 million, plus accrued interest and fees, and added approximately $180 million of cash to our balance sheet to provide additional liquidity to fund our operations and future development.
The amendment to our revolving credit facility, among other things, reduced the borrowing base and aggregate lender commitments from $450 million to $100 million and modified the financial ratio covenant by (1) deleting the requirement that we maintain a specific ratio of consolidated EBITDAX to our consolidated net interest expense and (2) replacing the requirement that we maintain a varying ratio of consolidated funded indebtedness to consolidated EBITDAX with a fixed ratio of our debt under the revolving credit facility to consolidated EBITDAX of 2.0 to 1.0. The Refinancing has provided us dedicated liquidity and allowed us to decrease debt under the revolving credit facility in order to meet the financial ratio covenant under that facility. See the discussion under “Item 7 — Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Liquidity and Capital Resources — Revolving credit facility.”
On July 22, 2016, we entered into an agreement to sell 5,051,100 shares of common stock to funds managed by Ares for cash proceeds of $150 million, or approximately $29.70 per share (the “Private Placement”), which transaction closed on August 29, 2016. In connection with the Private Placement, we entered into an amendment to the term loan facility, waiving certain restrictions to enable us to use proceeds from equity issuances and specified asset sales for debt reduction and capital expenditures.
Giddings Sale
In October 2016, we entered into a definitive purchase and sale agreement with a third party to sell substantially all of our assets in the Giddings Area in East Central Texas for a sale price of $400 million, subject to customary closing adjustments. We closed the sale on December 19, 2016.
Proposed Merger with Noble Energy
On January 13, 2017, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”) with Noble Energy, Wild West Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Noble Energy (“Merger Sub”), and NBL Permian LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Noble Energy (“Merger Sub II”), pursuant to which Noble Energy will acquire the Company in exchange for a combination of shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Noble Energy (“Noble Energy Common Shares”) and cash. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of the Merger Agreement, (i) Merger Sub will merge with and into the Company (the “Merger”), with the Company continuing 
8

as the surviving corporation in the Merger and an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Noble Energy, and (ii) thereafter, the Company will merge with and into Merger Sub II, with Merger Sub II continuing as the surviving company and an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Noble Energy.

Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, at the effective time of the Merger (the “Effective Time”), each share of the Company’s common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than common stock held in treasury and common stock held by shareholders who properly comply in all respects with the provisions of Section 262 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (“DGCL”) as to appraisal rights) and each unexercised warrant to purchase or otherwise acquire shares of common stock of the Company (each, a “CWEI Warrant”) issued and outstanding as of the Effective Time will be cancelled and extinguished and automatically converted into the right to receive, at the election of the shareholder or warrant holder, as applicable, and subject to proration as described below, one of the following forms of consideration (the “Merger Consideration”):


• | for each share of common stock, one of (i) 3.7222 Noble Energy Common Shares (the “Share Consideration”); (ii) (A) $34.75 in cash (subject to applicable withholding tax), without interest, and (B) 2.7874 Noble Energy Common Shares (the “Mixed Consideration”); or (iii) $138.39 in cash (subject to applicable withholding tax), without interest (the “Cash Consideration”); and


• | for each CWEI Warrant, either (i) the Share Consideration in respect of the number of shares of common stock of the Company that would be issued upon a cashless exercise of such CWEI Warrant immediately prior to the Effective Time (“Warrant Notional Common Shares”); (ii) the Mixed Consideration in respect of the number of Warrant Notional Common Shares represented by such CWEI Warrant; or (iii) the Cash Consideration in respect of the number of Warrant Notional Common Shares represented by such CWEI Warrant.

The Merger Consideration is subject to proration so that the aggregate Merger Consideration paid in respect of all shares of common stock of the Company and CWEI Warrants consists of 75% Noble Energy Common Shares and 25% cash. No fractional Noble Energy Common Shares will be issued in the Merger, and holders of common stock of the Company will, instead, receive cash in lieu of fractional Noble Energy Common Shares, if any. The implied value of the aggregate Merger Consideration is $2.7 billion based on the per share closing trading price of Noble Energy Common Shares on January 13, 2017.

At the Effective Time, each share of preferred stock, par value $0.10 per share, of the Company (each, a “CWEI Preferred Share”) issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will be converted into the right to receive cash in an amount equal to $1.00 (subject to any applicable withholding tax), without interest.

Each option to purchase shares of common stock of the Company (each, a “CWEI Option”) that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will vest and be exchanged for the number of Noble Energy Common Shares, rounded down to the nearest whole share, equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (i) the product of (A) the number of shares of common stock of the Company subject to the CWEI Option and (B) the amount, if any, by which the per share closing trading price of common stock of the Company on the business day immediately before the closing date of the Merger exceeds the exercise price per common stock of the Company otherwise purchasable pursuant to the CWEI Option immediately prior to the Effective Time by (ii) the average of the closing sale prices of a Noble Energy Common Share as reported on the New York Stock Exchange for the ten consecutive full trading days ending at the close of trading on the full trading day immediately preceding the date on which the Effective Time occurs. If such calculation results in zero or a negative number, the applicable CWEI Option shall be forfeited for no consideration.

At the Effective Time, the restricted shares of common stock of the Company (“CWEI Restricted Shares”) outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will be converted into a number of restricted Noble Energy Common Shares equal to the number of CWEI Restricted Shares multiplied by the Share Consideration, rounded up to the nearest whole share, and subject to the same vesting, repurchase and other restrictions as the CWEI Restricted Shares.

Each of Noble Energy, Merger Sub and the Company has made customary representations and warranties and agreed to customary covenants in the Merger Agreement. The Merger is subject to various closing conditions, including but not limited to (i) approval of the Merger Agreement by at least a majority of the outstanding shares of common stock of the Company, (ii) the expiration or earlier termination of the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, (iii) the absence of any law, order or injunction prohibiting the Merger, (iv) the accuracy of each party’s representations and warranties, (v) each party’s compliance with its covenants and agreements contained in the Merger Agreement and (vi) that the aggregate number of shares of common stock of the Company as to which appraisal rights are exercised does not exceed 10% of the outstanding shares of common stock of the Company.

9

The Merger Agreement contains certain termination rights for both Noble Energy and the Company, including if the Merger is not consummated by July 17, 2017, and further provides that, upon termination of the Merger Agreement under certain circumstances, the Company may be required to pay Noble Energy a termination fee equal to $87 million. The closing of the Merger is expected to occur in the second quarter of 2017.
Domestic Operations

We conduct all of our drilling, exploration and production activities in the United States.  All of our oil and gas assets are located in the United States, and all of our revenues are derived from sales to customers within the United States.
Development Program

Our current focus is on developmental drilling in our core area of Southern Reeves County, Texas.  A developmental well is a well drilled within the proved area of an oil and gas reservoir to a horizon known to be productive.  We have an inventory of developmental projects available for drilling in the future, most of which are located in the oil-prone region of Southern Reeves County, Texas.  In many cases, our leasehold interests in developmental projects are held by the continuous production of other wells, meaning that our rights to drill these projects are not subject to near-term expiration.  This provides us with a high degree of flexibility in the timing of developing these reserves.  
Exploration Program

To a lesser degree, from time to time, we are also engaged in finding reserves through exploratory drilling.  Our exploration program consists of generating exploratory prospects, leasing the acreage related to these prospects, drilling exploratory wells on these prospects to determine if recoverable oil and gas reserves exist, drilling developmental wells on these prospects and producing and selling any resulting oil and gas production.
Acquisition and Divestitures of Proved Properties

In addition to our exploration and development activities, we seek opportunities to acquire reserves and leased acreage that could complement our current operations and enhance shareholder value. However, competition for the purchase of reserves and leased acreage can be intense.  Sellers often utilize a bid process to sell properties.  This process usually intensifies the competition and makes it difficult for us to acquire reserves and leased acreage without assuming significant price and production risks.
In January 2017, we purchased approximately 1,900 net mineral acres in Southern Reeves County, Texas from a private seller, for cash consideration totaling $44.3 million.  The acreage is located in and around our existing contiguous acreage block.  Also included in the deal was a non-operated gross working interest of approximately 26% in an existing horizontal well.  
From time to time, we sell certain of our undeveloped leases and proved properties when we believe it is more advantageous to dispose of the selected properties than to continue to hold them.  We consider many factors in deciding to sell properties, including the need for liquidity, the risks associated with continuing to own the properties, our expectations for future development on the properties, the fairness of the price offered and other factors related to the condition and location of the properties.
On December 19, 2016, we closed the sale of substantially all of our assets in the Giddings Area in East Central Texas for a sale price of $400 million, subject to customary closing adjustments. Prior to December 2016, we successfully closed several asset sales. In September 2016, we sold certain acreage in Burleson County, Texas for cash consideration of $1.4 million. In July 2016, we sold our interests in certain wells in Glasscock County, Texas for approximately $19.4 million, subject to customary post-closing adjustments. In June 2016, we sold our interests in certain wells in Oklahoma for cash consideration of $1.5 million. In April 2016, we sold certain acreage in Burleson County, Texas for cash consideration of $2 million. In February 2016, we sold certain acreage in Burleson County, Texas for cash consideration of $0.8 million.
Desta Drilling

Through our wholly owned subsidiary, Desta Drilling, L.P. (“Desta Drilling”), we currently have eight drilling rigs available for our use or for contract drilling operations.  The Desta Drilling rigs are primarily reserved for our use, but are available to conduct contract drilling operations for third parties.  Due to the downturn in oil prices, all our rigs have been idle since November 2015.

Exploration and Development Activities

Overview

We spent $91.3 million on exploration and development activities in the Permian Basin and the Giddings Area during 2016.  On October 24, 2016, we entered into a definitive purchase and sale agreement with a third party to sell substantially all of our assets in the Giddings Area in East Central Texas for a sale price of $400 million, subject to customary closing adjustments. We closed the sale on December 19, 2016. 
Areas of Operations

Permian Basin

The Permian Basin is a sedimentary basin in West Texas and Southeastern New Mexico known for its large oil and gas deposits from the Permian geologic period. The Permian Basin covers an area approximately 250 miles wide and 350 miles long and contains commercial accumulations of oil and gas in multiple stratigraphic horizons at depths ranging from 1,000 feet to over 25,000 feet.  The Permian Basin is characterized by an extensive production history, mature infrastructure, long reserve life, multiple producing horizons and enhanced recovery potential.  Although many fields in the Permian Basin have been heavily exploited in the past, favorable product prices over the past several years, coupled with improved technology (including deep horizontal drilling) continued to attract high levels of drilling and recompletion activities.
We spent $55.2 million in the Permian Basin during 2016 on drilling and completion activities and $23.7 million on leasing and seismic activities.  We drilled and completed 6 gross (6.0 net) operated wells in the Permian Basin and conducted various remedial operations on other wells during 2016. Following is a discussion of our principal assets in the Permian Basin.
Delaware Basin
We currently hold approximately 73,000 net acres in the active Wolfbone resource play in the Delaware Basin, primarily in Southern Reeves County, Texas. The Wolfbone resource play generally refers to the interval from the Bone Springs formation down through the Wolfcamp formation at depths typically found between 8,000 and 11,500 feet. A Wolfbone well generally refers to a vertical well completed in multiple intervals within these formations or a horizontal well being completed in an interval within such formations.  These Permian aged formations in the Delaware Basin are composed of limestone, sandstone and shale. Geology in the Delaware Basin consists of multiple stacked pay zones with both over-pressured and normal-pressured intervals.
We entered the Delaware Basin as a vertical play, but with encouraging results from our horizontal drilling, we shifted our emphasis to a horizontal program. Most of our horizontal drilling to date has targeted the Wolfcamp A shale interval in Southern Reeves County, Texas with 35 Wolfcamp A wells currently on production. We also have four Wolfcamp C wells currently on production.
We spent approximately $53 million on drilling and completion activities and $23.2 million on leasing activities in the Wolfbone play during 2016.  
We own oil, natural gas and water disposal pipelines in Southern Reeves County, Texas consisting of 119 miles of oil pipelines with current capacity of 10,000 barrels of oil per day (expandable to 25,000 barrels of oil per day), 117 miles of natural gas pipelines with a current capacity of 10,000 Mcf of natural gas per day (expandable to 25,000 Mcf of natural gas per day) and 124 miles of salt water disposal pipelines with a current capacity of 30,000 barrels of produced water per day (expandable to 36,000 barrels of produced water per day).
Other Permian Basin
Approximately 33% of our 2016 oil and gas production was derived from wells in parts of the Permian Basin other than our Delaware Basin Wolfbone resource play. Many of these wells are located on the Central Basin Platform, geographically located between the Midland Basin and Delaware Basin, and produce from formations with conventional porosity such as the San Andres, Grayburg, Fusselman, Ellenburger and Yeso formations. A significant portion of our production in this area is derived from mature fields, several of which are in varying stages of secondary and/or tertiary recovery. 
11

Other

We spent $2.2 million during 2016 on exploration and development activities in other regions, including Oklahoma and California.
Factors That Significantly Affect Our Financial Results
Revenue, cash flow from operations and future growth depend on many factors beyond our control, such as oil prices, cost of services and supplies, economic, political and regulatory developments and competition from other sources of energy. Historical oil prices have been volatile and are expected to fluctuate widely in the future. Sustained periods of low prices for oil could materially and adversely affect our financial position, our results of operations, the quantities of oil and gas that we can economically produce and our ability to obtain capital.
Like all businesses engaged in the exploration for and production of oil and gas, we face the challenge of natural production declines. As initial reservoir pressures are depleted, oil and gas production from a given well decreases. Thus, an oil and gas exploration and production company depletes part of its asset base with each unit of oil or gas it produces. We attempt to overcome this natural decline by developing existing properties, implementing secondary and tertiary recovery techniques and by acquiring more reserves than we produce. Our future growth will depend on our ability to enhance production levels from existing reserves and to continue to add reserves in excess of production through exploration, development and acquisition. We will maintain our focus on costs necessary to produce our reserves as well as the costs necessary to add reserves through production enhancement, drilling and acquisitions. Our ability to make capital expenditures to increase production from existing reserves and to acquire more reserves is dependent on availability of capital resources, and can be limited by many factors, including the ability to obtain capital in a cost-effective manner and to obtain permits and regulatory approvals in a timely manner.
Marketing Arrangements

Oil
Most of our oil production is sold based on the New York Mercantile Exchange (“NYMEX”) futures market for West Texas Intermediate light sweet crude oil (referred to as WTI and traded in the NYMEX futures market under the symbol CL).  Cushing, Oklahoma is a major trading hub for crude oil and is the price settlement point for WTI.  As a result, basis differentials exist between the NYMEX price and the price we receive for our oil production depending on the proximity of our properties to the ultimate market for that production.  Basis differentials are market-based and are adversely affected by logistical factors such as pipeline constraints and inadequate storage capacities.
Approximately 99% of our oil reserves at December 31, 2016 are located in the Permian Basin.  Most Permian Basin oil production gains access to refineries through the Cushing trading hub. Basis differentials between the Midland, Texas oil storage facility and the Cushing trading hub are referred to as the Midland-Cushing differential.  Through multiple marketing arrangements, which expire in November 2017, we have effectively limited our exposure to the Midland-Cushing differential to less than $2 per barrel on a majority of our Permian Basin production. 

Natural gas
Natural gas is generally sold based on the NYMEX futures market for natural gas (traded in the NYMEX futures market under the symbol NG). Since the delivery point for NYMEX traded natural gas is the distribution hub on a natural gas pipeline system in Erath, Louisiana, referred to as Henry Hub, basis differentials exist between the NYMEX price and the price we receive for our gas production depending on the proximity of our properties to the ultimate market for that production. Basis differentials are market-based and are adversely affected by logistical factors such as pipeline constraints and inadequate storage capacities.
Most of our natural gas production is produced from our oil wells. This gas, known as casinghead gas, generally has a high Btu content. Casinghead gas may be processed downstream to extract NGL from the gas and lower the Btu content of the residue gas to a level suitable for manufacturing and residential use. Our casinghead gas is generally sold in one of three ways: (1) as processed gas where the purchaser processes the gas and pays us a percentage of the value of the NGL and a percentage of the value of the residue gas; (2) as processed gas where the purchaser accounts for the value of any extracted NGL and includes that value in the price paid to us for our gas production at the wellhead; and (3) as unprocessed gas where the purchaser pays us a price per MMBtu for our gas production at the wellhead. All of the value we receive from casinghead gas production is recorded as gas sales in our financial records, except for the value of NGL paid to us under method (1), which is reported separately as NGL sales.
12

Some of our natural gas production is produced from gas wells. This gas, known as dry gas, generally not exceeding 1,000 Btus is not suitable for extraction of NGL. Most of our dry gas is sold under contracts where the purchaser pays us a price per MMBtu for our gas production at the wellhead.
Natural gas liquids
A portion of our casinghead gas production is processed under contracts where the purchaser pays us a percentage of the value of the NGL extracted. The price we receive for NGL is generally based on the spot liquids price for the various NGL products sold at Mont Belvieu, Texas and reported by Oil Price Information Service. We compute the price differential for NGL based on the NYMEX benchmark for oil, but the NGL components are subject to their own supply and demand factors, not all of which vary in correlation with changes in oil prices. 
Pipelines and Other Midstream Facilities
We own interests in and operate oil, natural gas and water service facilities in the state of Texas. These midstream facilities consist of interests in approximately 423 miles of pipeline located primarily in Southern Reeves County, Texas, two treating plants, one dehydration facility and multiple wellhead type treating and/or compression stations.  Most of our operated gas gathering and treating activities facilitate the transportation and marketing of our operated oil and gas production and third party producers. Portions of our gathering systems in Southern Reeves County, Texas are regulated by the Railroad Commission of Texas (the “RCT”). The RCT regulates portions of our crude oil gathering system as a common carrier, and it regulates portions of our natural gas gathering system as a gas utility.
Competition and Markets

Competition in all areas of our operations is intense.  We experience competition from major and independent oil and gas companies and oil and gas syndicates in bidding for desirable oil and gas properties, as well as in acquiring the equipment, data and labor required to operate and develop such properties. A number of our competitors have financial resources and acquisition, exploration and development budgets that are substantially greater than ours, which may adversely affect our ability to compete with these companies. Competitors may be able to pay more for productive oil and gas properties and exploratory prospects and to define, evaluate, bid for and purchase a greater number of properties and prospects than our financial or human resources permit.  Our ability to increase reserves in the future will depend on our success at selecting and acquiring suitable properties and prospects for future development and exploration activities.
In addition, the oil and gas industry as a whole competes with other industries in supplying the energy and fuel requirements of industrial, commercial and individual consumers.  The price and availability of alternative energy sources could adversely affect our revenues.
The market for our oil, gas and NGL production depends on factors beyond our control, including domestic and foreign political conditions, the overall level of supply of and demand for oil, gas and NGL, the price of imports of oil and gas, weather conditions, the price and availability of alternative fuels, the proximity and capacity of gas pipelines and other transportation facilities and overall economic conditions.
Regulation

Generally.  Our oil and gas exploration, production and related operations and activities are subject to extensive rules and regulations promulgated by federal, state and local governmental agencies. Failure to comply with such rules and regulations can result in substantial penalties. Because such rules and regulations are frequently amended or reinterpreted, we are unable to predict the future cost or impact of complying with such laws. Although the regulatory burden on the oil and gas industry increases our cost of doing business and, consequently, affects our profitability, these burdens generally do not affect us any differently or to any greater or lesser extent than they affect others in our industry with similar types, quantities and locations of production.

Regulations affecting production.  All of the states in which we operate generally require permits for drilling operations, require drilling bonds and reports concerning operations and impose other requirements relating to the exploration and production of oil and gas.  Such states also have statutes or regulations addressing conservation matters, including provisions for the unitization or pooling of oil and gas properties, the establishment of maximum rates of production from oil and gas wells, the spacing, plugging and abandonment of such wells, restrictions on venting or flaring gas and requirements regarding the ratability of production.

These laws and regulations may limit the amount of oil and gas we can produce from our wells and may limit the number of wells or the locations at which we can drill. Moreover, many states impose a production or severance tax with respect to the 
13

production and sale of oil and gas within their jurisdiction. States do not generally regulate wellhead prices or engage in other, similar direct economic regulation of production, but there can be no assurance they will not do so in the future.

In the event we conduct operations on federal, state or American Indian oil and gas leases, our operations may be required to comply with additional regulatory restrictions, including various nondiscrimination statutes, royalty and related valuation requirements and on-site security regulations, and other appropriate permits issued by the Bureau of Land Management (“BLM”) or other relevant federal or state agencies.
Regulations affecting sales.  The sales prices of oil, gas and NGL are not presently regulated but rather are set by the market.  We cannot predict, however, whether new legislation to regulate the price of energy commodities might be proposed, what proposals, if any, might actually be enacted by Congress or the various state legislatures and what effect, if any, the proposals might have on the operations of the underlying properties.

The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (the “FERC”) regulates interstate gas transportation rates and service conditions, which affect the marketing of gas we produce, as well as the revenues we receive for sales of such production.  The price and terms of access to pipeline transportation are subject to extensive federal and state regulation.  The FERC is continually proposing and implementing new rules and regulations affecting interstate transportation.  These initiatives also may affect the intrastate transportation of gas under certain circumstances.  The stated purpose of many of these regulatory changes is to promote competition among the various sectors of the gas industry. We do not believe that we will be affected by any such FERC action in a manner materially different from other gas producers in our areas of operation.

The price we receive from the sale of oil and NGL is affected by the cost of transporting those products to market.  Interstate transportation rates for oil, NGL and other products are regulated by the FERC.  Effective as of January 1, 1995, the FERC implemented regulations generally grandfathering all previously approved interstate transportation rates and establishing an indexing system for those rates by which adjustments are made annually based on the rate of inflation, subject to certain conditions and limitations. The FERC adjusts this index every five years.  We are not able to predict with any certainty what effect, if any, these regulations will have on us, but, other factors being equal, the regulations may, over time, tend to increase transportation costs, which may have the effect of reducing wellhead prices for oil and NGL.

Market manipulation and market transparency regulations.  Under the Energy Policy Act of 2005 (the “EP Act 2005”), the FERC possesses regulatory oversight over gas markets, including the purchase, sale and transportation of gas by “any entity” in order to enforce the anti-market manipulation provisions in the EP Act 2005. The Federal Trade Commission (the “FTC”) has similar regulatory oversight of oil markets in order to prevent market manipulation.  The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (the “CFTC”) also holds authority to monitor certain segments of the physical and futures energy commodities market pursuant to the Commodity Exchange Act.  With regard to our physical purchases and sales of crude oil, gas and NGL, our gathering of these energy commodities, and any related hedging transactions that we undertake, we are required to observe these anti-market manipulation laws and related regulations enforced by the FERC, the FTC and/or the CFTC.  These agencies hold substantial enforcement authority, including the ability to assess civil penalties potentially in excess of $1 million per day per violation, to order disgorgement of profits and to recommend criminal penalties.  Should we violate the anti-market manipulation laws and regulations, we could also be subject to related third-party damage claims by, among others, sellers, royalty owners and taxing authorities.

The FERC has issued certain market transparency rules for the gas industry pursuant to its EP Act 2005 authority, which may affect some or all of our operations.  The FERC issued a final rule in 2007, as amended by subsequent orders on rehearing (“Order 704”), which requires wholesale buyers and sellers of more than 2.2 MMBtu of physical gas in the previous calendar year, including gas producers, gatherers, processors and marketers, to report, on May 1 of each year, beginning in 2009, aggregate volumes of gas purchased or sold at wholesale in the prior calendar year to the extent such transactions utilize, contribute to or may contribute to the formation of price indices, as explained in Order 704. It is the responsibility of the reporting entity to determine which transactions should be reported based on the guidance of Order 704. In addition, to the extent that we enter into transportation contracts with interstate pipelines that are subject to FERC regulation, we are subject to FERC requirements related to use of such interstate capacity. Any failure on our part to comply with the FERC’s regulations could result in the imposition of civil and criminal penalties.

Gathering regulations.  Section 1(b) of the Natural Gas Act (the “NGA”) exempts gas gathering facilities from the jurisdiction of the FERC under the NGA.  We own certain gas pipelines that we believe meet the traditional tests that the FERC has used to establish a pipeline’s status as a gatherer not subject to the FERC jurisdiction.  There is, however, no bright-line test for determining the jurisdictional status of pipeline facilities. Moreover, the distinction between the FERC-regulated transmission facilities and federally unregulated gathering facilities is the subject of substantial, ongoing litigation, so the classification and regulation of our gathering lines may be subject to change based on future determinations by the FERC, the courts or Congress. 
14

While we own some gas gathering facilities, we also depend on gathering facilities owned and operated by third parties to gather production from our properties, and therefore, we are affected by the rates charged by these third parties for gathering services. To the extent that changes in federal or state regulation affect the rates charged for gathering services, we also may be affected by these changes. We do not anticipate that we would be affected any differently than similarly situated gas producers.

State regulation of gathering facilities generally includes various safety, environmental and, in some circumstances, nondiscriminatory take requirements and complaint-based rate regulation.  For example, portions of our natural gas and crude oil gathering systems in Southern Reeves County, Texas are regulated by the RCT. Accordingly, we have filed tariffs with the RCT with respect to those systems. Our gathering operations are also subject to state ratable take and common purchaser statutes, designed to prohibit discrimination in favor of one producer over another or one source of supply over another.  The regulations under these statutes can have the effect of imposing some restrictions on our ability as an owner of gathering facilities to decide with whom we contract to gather gas or crude oil.  In addition, our gas and crude oil gathering operations could be adversely affected should they be subject to more stringent application of state or federal regulation of rates and services.
Pipeline Safety Matters
Certain of our pipelines are subject to regulation by the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (“PHMSA”) of the U.S. Department of Transportation under the Hazardous Liquids Pipeline Safety Act (“HLPSA”) with respect to oil and the Natural Gas Pipeline Safety Act (“NGPSA”) with respect to natural gas. The HLPSA and NGPSA govern the design, installation, testing, construction, operation, replacement and management of oil and natural gas pipeline facilities. These laws have resulted in the adoption of rules by PHMSA, that, among other things, require transportation pipeline operators to implement integrity management programs, including more frequent inspections, correction of identified anomalies and other measures to ensure pipeline safety in high consequence areas, such as high population areas, areas unusually sensitive to environmental damage and commercially navigable waterways. The HLPSA and NGPSA were amended by the Pipeline, Safety, Regulatory Certainty and Job Creation Act of 2011 (“2011 Pipeline Safety Act”), which increased the penalties for safety violations, established additional safety requirements for newly constructed pipelines and required studies of safety issues that could result in the adoption of new regulatory requirements by PHMSA for existing pipelines. More recently, in June 2016, the Protecting Our Infrastructure of Pipelines and Enhancing Safety Act of 2016 (“2016 Pipeline Safety Act”) was passed, extending PHMSA’s statutory mandate through 2019 and, among other things, requiring PHMSA to complete certain of its outstanding mandates under the 2011 Pipeline Safety Act and developing new safety standards for natural gas storage facilities by June 22, 2018. The 2016 Pipeline Safety Act also empowers PHMSA to address imminent hazards by imposing emergency restrictions, prohibitions and safety measures on owners and operators of hazardous liquid or natural gas pipeline facilities without prior notice or an opportunity for a hearing. PHMSA issued interim regulations in October 2016 to implement the agency’s expanded authority to address unsafe pipeline conditions or practices that pose an imminent hazard to life, property, or the environment. In addition, states have adopted regulations similar to existing PHMSA regulations for certain intrastate natural gas and hazardous liquid pipelines, which regulations may impose more stringent requirements than found under federal law. 
Historically, our pipeline safety compliance costs have not had a material adverse effect on our results of operations; however, there can be no assurance that such costs will not be material in the future or that such future compliance costs will not have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results. New pipeline safety laws or implementing regulations adopted by PHMSA or analogous state agencies may impose more stringent requirements applicable to integrity management programs and other pipeline safety aspects of our operations, which could cause us to incur increased capital and operating costs and operational delays. For example, in January 2017, PHMSA issued a final rule that significantly extends and expands the reach of certain PHMSA integrity management requirements, such as, for example, periodic assessments, leak detection and repairs, regardless of the pipeline’s proximity to a high consequence area. The final rule also imposes new reporting requirements for certain unregulated pipelines, including all hazardous liquid gathering lines. However, the date of implementation of this final rule by publication in the Federal Register is uncertain given the recent change in presidential administrations. Additionally, in March 2016, PHMSA announced a proposed rulemaking that would impose new or more stringent requirements for certain natural gas lines and gathering lines including, among other things, expanding certain of PHMSA’s current regulatory safety programs for natural gas pipelines in newly defined “moderate consequence areas” that contain as few as five dwellings within a potential impact area; and requiring natural gas pipelines installed before 1970 and thus excluded from certain pressure testing obligations to be tested to determine their maximum allowable operating pressure. Additional requirements proposed by this proposed rulemaking would increase PHMSA’s integrity management requirements for natural gas pipelines and also require consideration of seismicity in evaluating threats to pipelines.

Environmental and Occupational Safety and Health Matters
Our operations pertaining to oil and natural gas exploration and production, as well as oil, natural gas and water pipeline or service facilities and related activities are subject to numerous federal, state and local laws governing occupational safety and health, the emission and discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to environmental protection.  These laws and regulations may require the acquisition of permits prior to commencing drilling, providing produced water disposal or other regulated activities in connection with our operations; restrict or prohibit the types, quantities and concentration of substances that we can release into the environment; restrict or prohibit activities that could impact wetlands, endangered or threatened species or other protected areas or natural resources; require some degree of remedial action to mitigate pollution from former operations, such as pit cleanups and plugging abandoned wells and pipelines; impose specific safety and health criteria addressing worker protection; and impose substantial liabilities for pollution resulting from our operations.  Such laws and regulations may substantially increase the cost of our operations and may prevent or delay the permitting, commencement or continuation of a given project and thus generally could have an adverse effect upon our capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position.  Violation of these laws and regulations could result in sanctions including administrative, civil and criminal penalties, the imposition of investigatory, remedial or corrective obligations and the issuance of orders enjoining some or all of our operations in affected areas.  We have experienced accidental spills, leaks and other discharges of contaminants at some of our properties, as have other similarly situated oil and gas companies, and some of the properties that we have acquired, operated or sold, or in which we may hold an interest but not operational control, may have past or ongoing contamination for which we may be held responsible. Also, some of our operations are located in environmentally sensitive environments, such as coastal waters, wetlands and other protected areas that may obligate us to implement costly mitigative or precautionary measures, while some of our properties are located in areas particularly susceptible to hurricanes and other destructive storms that may damage facilities and cause the release of pollutants. Our environmental insurance coverage may not fully insure all of these risks. 
Historically, our environmental compliance costs have not had a material adverse effect on our results of operations; however, there can be no assurance that such costs will not be material in the future or that such future compliance costs will not have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results.  Changes in existing environmental laws and regulations or the adoption of new legal requirements could have a significant impact on our operations, as well as the oil and gas industry in general.  For instance, any changes in environmental laws and regulations that result in more stringent and costly waste handling, storage, transport, disposal or clean-up requirements, or drilling, completion, construction or water management activities could have an adverse impact on our operations.
The following is a summary of the more significant existing environmental and worker health and safety laws and regulations, as amended from time to time, to which our business operations are subject and for which compliance may have a material adverse impact on our capital expenditures, results of operations or financial position.
Hazardous substances and wastes.  The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (“CERCLA”), also known as the “Superfund” law, and analogous state laws impose liability, without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct, on certain classes of persons that are considered to have contributed to the release of a hazardous substance into the environment.  Despite the “petroleum exclusion” of Section 101(14) of CERCLA, which applies to crude oil and natural gas, we nonetheless handle hazardous substances within the meaning of CERCLA, or similar state statutes, in the course of our ordinary operations and, as a result, may be jointly and severally liable under CERCLA for all or part of the costs required to clean up sites at which these hazardous substances have been released into the environment. These persons include the owner or operator of the disposal site or the site where the release occurred and companies that disposed or arranged for the disposal of the hazardous substances at the site where the release occurred.  Under CERCLA, such persons may be subject to joint and several liability for the costs of cleaning up the hazardous substances that have been released into the environment and for damages to natural resources, and it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the hazardous substances released into the environment.  
The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (“RCRA”) and analogous state laws impose detailed requirements for the generation, storage, treatment, transportation and disposal of hazardous and non-hazardous wastes.  In the course of our operations, we generate ordinary industrial wastes that may be regulated as hazardous wastes. RCRA currently exempts certain drilling fluids, produced waters and other wastes associated with exploration, development and production of oil and natural gas from regulation as hazardous wastes. These wastes, instead, are regulated under RCRA’s less stringent nonhazardous waste provisions, state laws or other federal laws. However, it is possible that certain oil and natural gas exploration, development and production wastes now classified as nonhazardous wastes could be classified as hazardous wastes in the future. For example, following the filing of a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia in May 2016 by several non-governmental environmental groups against the Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) for the agency’s failure to timely assess its RCRA Subtitle D criteria regulations for oil and natural gas wastes, the EPA and the environmental groups entered into an agreement that was finalized in a consent decree issued by the District Court on December 28, 2016 (the “Consent Decree”). Under the decree, the EPA is required 
16

to propose no later than March 15, 2019, a rulemaking for revision of certain Subtitle D criteria regulations pertaining to oil and natural gas wastes or sign a determination that revision of the regulations is not necessary. If the EPA proposes a rulemaking for revised oil and natural gas waste regulations, the Consent Decree requires that the EPA take final action following notice and comment rulemaking no later than July 15, 2021. Repeal or modification of the current RCRA exclusion or similar exemptions under state law could increase the amount of hazardous waste we or, in the case of our pipeline and natural gas treatment and dehydration services, our oil and natural gas exploration and production customers are required to manage and dispose of and could cause us or our customers to incur increased operating costs, which could have a significant impact on us as well as reduce demand for our pipeline and natural gas treatment and dehydration services.
We currently own or lease and have in the past owned or leased properties that for many years have been used for oil and natural gas exploration and production activities as well as pipeline and natural gas treatment and dehydration services. Although we have utilized operating and disposal practices that were standard in the industry at the time, hydrocarbons or other substances and wastes may have been disposed of or released on or under the properties owned or leased by us or on or under other locations where these hydrocarbons or other substances and wastes have been taken for treatment or disposal. In addition, certain of these properties have been operated by third parties whose treatment and disposal or release of hydrocarbons or other substances and wastes was not under our control. These properties and any hydrocarbons, substances and wastes disposed thereon may be subject to CERCLA, RCRA and analogous state laws. Under these laws, we could be required to remove or remediate previously disposed wastes (including wastes disposed of or released by prior owners or operators), to clean up contaminated property (including contaminated groundwater) and to perform remedial operations to prevent future contamination.
Air emissions.  The Clean Air Act (“CAA”) and comparable state laws and regulations impose restrictions on emissions of air pollutants from various industrial sources, including compressor stations and natural gas processing facilities, and also impose various monitoring and reporting requirements.  Such laws and regulations may require that we obtain pre-approval for the construction or modification of certain projects or facilities expected to produce air emissions or result in the increase of existing air emissions, obtain and strictly comply with air permits containing various emissions and operational limits or utilize specific emission control technologies to limit emissions.  For example, in October 2015, the EPA lowered the National Ambient Air Quality Standard (“NAAQS”) for ozone from 75 to 70 parts per billion for both the 8-hour primary and secondary standards. State implementation of the revised NAAQS could result in stricter permitting requirements, delay or prohibit our ability to obtain such permits, and result in increased expenditures for pollution control equipment, the costs of which could be significant. Additionally, the EPA issued final CAA regulations in 2012 that include New Source Performance Standards (“NSPS”) for completions of hydraulically fractured natural gas wells and issued added CAA regulations in June 2016 that include new emissions standards for methane and additional standards for volatile organic compounds from certain new, modified and reconstructed equipment and processes in the oil and natural gas source category, including production activities. Compliance with these or other new regulations could, among other things, require installation of new emission controls on some of our equipment, result in longer permitting timelines, and significantly increase our capital expenditures and operating costs, which could adversely impact our business. 
Water discharges.  The Federal Water Pollution Control Act (“Clean Water Act”) and analogous state laws and regulations impose restrictions and strict controls with respect to the discharge of pollutants, including spills and leaks of oil and other substances, into waters of the United States as well as state waters.  The discharge of pollutants into regulated waters is prohibited, except in accordance with the terms of a permit issued by the EPA or an analogous state agency.  Pursuant to these laws and regulations, we may be required to obtain and maintain approvals or permits for the discharge of wastewater or storm water from our operations and may be required to develop and implement spill prevention, control and countermeasure (“SPCC”) plans in connection with on-site storage of significant quantities of oil, including refined petroleum products. The EPA has issued final rules outlining its position on the federal jurisdictional reach over waters of the United States. This interpretation by the EPA may constitute an expansion of federal jurisdiction over waters of the United States. The rule was stayed nationwide by the U.S. Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals in October 2015 as that appellate court and several other courts ponder lawsuits opposing implementation of the rule. In January 2017, the United States Supreme Court accepted review of the rule to determine whether jurisdiction rests with the federal district or appellate courts. Litigation surrounding this rule is ongoing. To the extent this rule expands the scope of the Clean Water Act’s jurisdiction, drilling programs could incur increased costs and delays with respect to obtaining permits for dredge and fill activities in wetland areas.
The United States Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (“OPA”) amends the Clean Water Act, and sets minimum standards for prevention, containment and cleanup of oil spills. The OPA applies to vessels, offshore facilities and onshore facilities, including exploration and production facilities that may affect waters of the United States. Under the OPA, responsible parties including owners and operators of onshore facilities may be held strictly liable for oil cleanup costs and natural resource damages as well as a variety of public and private damages that may result from oil spills.
17

Subsurface injections. Fluids associated with oil and natural gas production, consisting primarily of salt water, are disposed by injection in belowground disposal wells. These disposal wells are regulated pursuant to the Underground Injection Control (“UIC”) program established under the federal Safe Drinking Water Act (“SDWA”) and analogous state laws. The UIC program requires permits from the EPA or an analogous state agency for the construction and operation of disposal wells, establishes minimum standards for disposal well operations, and restricts the types and quantities of fluids that may be disposed. Any change in disposal well regulations or the inability to obtain permits for new disposal wells in the future may affect our ability to dispose of salt water and ultimately increase the cost of our operations. For example, there exists a growing concern that the injection of saltwater and other fluids into belowground disposal wells triggers seismic activity in certain areas, including Texas, where we operate. In response to these concerns, in 2014, the Texas Railroad Commission (“TRC”) published a final rule governing permitting or re-permitting of disposal wells that would require, among other things, the submission of information on seismic events occurring within a specified radius of the disposal well location, as well as logs, geologic cross sections and structure maps relating to the disposal area in question. If the permittee or an applicant of a disposal well permit fails to demonstrate that the injected fluids are confined to the disposal zone or if scientific data indicates such a disposal well is likely to be or determined to be contributing to seismic activity, then the TRC may deny, modify, suspend or terminate the permit application or existing operating permit for that well. In addition, Oklahoma has taken numerous regulatory actions in response to concerns related to the operation of saltwater disposal wells and induced seismicity. These requirements include volumetric limits for wastewater disposal wells, enhanced monitoring and recordkeeping, and requirements to reduce the depth of, or “plug back,” existing disposal wells. Restriction on the volumes permissible for injection or a lack of waste disposal sites could cause us to delay, curtail or discontinue our exploration and development plans. Increased costs associated with the transportation and disposal of produced water, including the cost of complying with regulations concerning produced water disposal, such as requirements to monitor or plug back disposal wells, may reduce our profitability. These developments may result in additional levels of regulation, or increased complexity and costs with respect to existing regulations, that could lead to operational delays or increased operating and compliance costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition.
Climate change.  Climate change continues to attract considerable public and scientific attention. As a result, numerous proposals have been made and are likely to continue to be made at the international, national, regional and state levels of government to monitor and limit emissions of greenhouse gases (“GHGs”). These efforts have included consideration by states or groupings of states of cap-and-trade programs, carbon taxes, GHG reporting and tracking programs, and regulations that directly limit GHG emissions from certain sources. 
At the federal level, no comprehensive climate change legislation has been implemented to date. However, the EPA has determined that emissions of carbon dioxide, methane and other GHGs present an endangerment to public health and the environment and has adopted regulations under existing provisions of the CAA that establish Prevention of Significant Deterioration (“PSD”) construction and Title V operating permit reviews for GHG emissions from certain large stationary sources that already are potential major sources of certain principal pollutant emissions. Facilities required to obtain PSD permits for their GHG emissions also will be required to meet “best available control technology” standards. The EPA has also adopted rules requiring the monitoring and reporting of GHG emissions from specified sources in the United States on an annual basis, including, among others, onshore and offshore oil and natural gas production facilities and onshore processing, transmission, storage and distribution facilities, which include certain of our operations. In October 2015, the EPA amended and expanded the GHG reporting requirements to all segments of the oil and natural gas industry, including gathering and boosting facilities and blowdowns of natural gas transmission pipelines, and in January 2016, the EPA proposed additional revisions to leak detection methodology to align the reporting rules with the NSPS. 
Federal agencies also have begun directly regulating emissions of methane, a GHG, from oil and natural gas operations. In June 2016, the EPA published NSPS, known as Subpart OOOOa, that require certain new, modified or reconstructed facilities in the oil and natural gas sector to reduce these methane gas and volatile organic compound emissions. These Subpart OOOOa standards will expand the previously issued NSPS Subpart OOOO requirements issued in 2012 by using certain equipment-specific emissions control practices, requiring additional controls for pneumatic controllers and pumps as well as compressors, and imposing leak detection and repair requirements for natural gas compressor and booster stations. Moreover, in November 2016, the EPA issued a final information collection request (“ICR”) seeking information about methane emissions from facilities and operations in the oil and natural gas industry. The EPA has indicated that it intends to use the information from this request to develop Existing Source Performance Standards for the oil and natural gas industry. Additionally, in December 2015, the United States joined the international community at the 21st Conference of the Parties of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in Paris, France to prepare an agreement requiring member countries to review and “represent a progression” in their intended nationally determined contributions, which set GHG emission reduction goals every five years beginning in 2020. This “Paris agreement” was signed by the United States in April 2016 and entered into force in November 2016; however, this agreement does not create any binding obligations for nations to limit their GHG emissions but, rather, includes pledges to voluntarily limit or reduce future emissions.
18

The adoption and implementation of any international, federal or state legislation, regulations or other regulatory initiatives that require reporting of GHGs or otherwise restricts emissions of GHGs from our equipment and operations could require us or, in the case of our pipeline or treating or dehydration services, our oil and natural gas exploration and production customers to incur increased costs that could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Moreover, such new legislation or regulatory programs could also increase the cost to the consumer, and thereby reduce demand for oil and gas, which could reduce the demand for the oil and natural gas we or our customers produce and lower the value of our reserves as well as reduce demand for our pipeline and treating and dehydration services. 
Finally, it should be noted that some scientists have concluded that increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases in the Earth’s atmosphere may produce climate changes that have significant physical effects, such as increased frequency and severity of storms, droughts, floods and other climatic events. If any such effects were to occur, they could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. At this time, we have not developed a comprehensive plan to address the legal, economic, social or physical impacts of climate change on our operations.
Hydraulic fracturing. Hydraulic fracturing is an important and common practice that is used to stimulate production of natural gas and/or oil from dense subsurface rock formations.  The hydraulic fracturing process involves the injection of water, sand and chemicals under pressure into the target formation to fracture the surrounding rock and stimulate production.  We commonly use hydraulic fracturing as part of our operations.  Hydraulic fracturing typically is regulated by state oil and natural gas commissions or other similar state agencies, but several federal agencies have conducted investigations or asserted regulatory authority over certain aspects of the process. For example, in December 2016, the EPA released its final report on the potential impacts of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water resources, concluding that “water cycle” activities associated with hydraulic fracturing may impact drinking water resources under certain circumstances. Additionally, the EPA has taken the following actions: in 2014, asserted regulatory authority pursuant to the SDWA’s UIC program over hydraulic fracturing activities involving the use of diesel and issued guidance covering such activities; in 2012 and June 2016, issued final regulations under the CAA governing performance standards, including first-time standards in 2016 for the capture of methane emissions released during hydraulic fracturing; in June 2016, published an effluent limit guideline final rule prohibiting the discharge of wastewater from onshore unconventional oil and gas extraction facilities to publicly owned wastewater treatment plants; and in 2014, issued an advanced notice of proposed rulemaking under the Toxic Substances Control Act that would require companies to disclose information regarding the chemicals used in hydraulic fracturing. Also, the BLM published a final rule in March 2015 that established new or more stringent standards for performing hydraulic fracturing on federal and American Indian lands. In June 2016, the U.S. District Court of Wyoming struck down this final rule, finding that the BLM lacked authority to promulgate the rule, and that decision is currently being appealed by the federal government.
From time to time, the U.S. Congress has considered legislation to provide for federal regulation of hydraulic fracturing under the SDWA and to require disclosure of the chemicals used in the hydraulic fracturing process. At the state level, several states, including Texas and New Mexico, where we conduct operations, have adopted and other states are considering adopting legal requirements that could impose more stringent permitting, chemical disclosure and well construction requirements on hydraulic fracturing activities. Local government also may seek to adopt ordinances within their jurisdictions regulating the time, place and manner of drilling activities in general or hydraulic fracturing activities in particular. If new or more stringent federal, state or local legal restrictions relating to the hydraulic fracturing process are adopted in areas where we or, in the case of our pipeline and treating or dehydration services, our customers operate, we or our customers could incur potentially significant added costs to comply with such requirements, experience delays or curtailment in the pursuit of exploration, development or production activities, and perhaps even be precluded in the drilling of wells or in the volume that we or our customers are ultimately able to produce from reserves.
Endangered species.  The federal Endangered Species Act (“ESA”) and analogous state laws regulate activities that could have an adverse effect on threatened or endangered species or their critical habitat. Similar protections are offered to migratory birds under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act.  Some of our operations and pipeline services, including drilling, producing, treating or dehydration services and those of our pipeline customers are conducted in areas where protected species are known to exist.  In these areas, we or our customers may be obligated to develop and implement plans to avoid potential adverse impacts to protected species, and we or our customers may be prohibited from conducting drilling operations in certain locations or during certain seasons, such as breeding and nesting seasons, when we or our customers’ operations could have an adverse effect on protected species.  It is also possible that a federal or state agency could order a complete halt to drilling activities in certain locations if it is determined that such activities may have a serious adverse effect on a protected species.  The presence of a protected species in areas where we perform drilling activities could impair our ability to timely complete well drilling and development and could adversely affect our future production from those areas. Moreover, as a result of one or more settlements entered into by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (“FWS”), the agency is required to make a determination on the listing of numerous species as endangered or threatened under the ESA in accordance with specific timelines. The designation of previously unprotected species as threatened or endangered in areas where we operate could cause us to incur increased costs arising from species protection measures or could 
19

result in limitations on our exploration and production activities that could have an adverse effect on our ability to develop and produce reserves and, an indirect adverse impact on our pipeline and treating or dehydration services.
OSHA and other laws and regulations. We are subject to the requirements of the federal Occupational Safety and Health Act (“OSHA”) and comparable state statutes. These laws and the implementing regulations strictly govern the protection of the health and safety of employees. The OSHA hazard communication standard, the EPA community right-to-know regulations under Title III of CERCLA and similar state statutes require that we organize and/or disclose information about hazardous materials used or produced in our operations. 
Claims are sometimes made or threatened against companies engaged in oil and natural gas exploration, production and related activities by owners of surface estates, adjoining properties or others alleging damages resulting from environmental contamination and other incidents of operations. We have been named as a defendant in a number of such lawsuits. While some jurisdictions in which we operate limit damages in such cases to the value of land that has been impaired, courts in other jurisdictions have allowed damage claims in excess of land value, including claims for the cost of remediation of contaminated properties. However, we do not believe that resolution of these claims will have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and operations.
Title to Properties

As is customary in the oil and gas industry, we perform a minimal title investigation before acquiring undeveloped properties.  A title opinion is obtained prior to the commencement of drilling operations on such properties.  We have obtained title opinions on substantially all of our producing properties and believe that we have satisfactory title to such properties in accordance with standards generally accepted in the oil and gas industry.  These title investigations and title opinions, while consistent with industry standards, may not reveal existing or potential title defects, encumbrances or adverse claims as we are subject from time to time to claims or disputes regarding title to properties.  Our properties are subject to customary royalty interests, liens incident to operating agreements, liens for current taxes and other burdens that we believe do not materially interfere with the use of or affect the value of such properties. Substantially all of our oil and gas properties are currently mortgaged to secure borrowings under the revolving credit facility and the term loan credit facility and may be mortgaged under any future credit facilities entered into by us.
Operational Hazards and Insurance

Our operations are subject to the usual hazards incident to the drilling and production of oil and gas, such as blowouts, cratering, explosions, uncontrollable flows of oil, gas or well fluids, fires, pollution and other environmental risks.  These hazards can cause personal injury and loss of life, severe damage to and destruction of property and equipment, pollution or environmental damage and suspension of operation.  In addition, the presence of unanticipated pressures or irregularities in formations, miscalculations or accidents may cause our drilling activities to be unsuccessful and result in a total loss of our investment.

We maintain insurance of various types to cover our operations with policy limits and retention liability customary in the industry.  We believe the coverage and types of insurance are adequate.  The occurrence of a significant adverse event, the risks of which are not fully covered by insurance, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.  We cannot give any assurances that we will be able to maintain adequate insurance in the future at rates we consider reasonable.
Operating Segments

For financial information about our operating segments, see Note 18 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
Employees

At December 31, 2016, we had 197 full-time employees, of which eight were employed by Desta Drilling.  None of our employees are subject to a collective bargaining agreement.  In our opinion, relations with employees are good.
