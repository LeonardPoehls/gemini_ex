Changes in Control during 2017
We were was advised by Oltasho Nigeria Limited (“Oltasho”) and Latmol Investment Limited (“Latmol”) that on (a) April 3, 2017, an aggregate of 116,108,833 shares of the Company’s common stock previously held by Allied Energy Plc. (“Allied”), were transferred to Oltasho; and (b) April 13, 2017, an aggregate of 1,515,927 shares of the Company’s common stock previously held by CAMAC Int’l (Nigeria) Ltd. (“CAMAC International”), were transferred to Latmol. Prior to April 2017, the shares of common stock previously held by Allied and CAMAC International were beneficially owned by Dr. Kase Lawal, our former Chairman and former Chief Executive Officer, due to his ownership of equity interests in such entities and voting and dispositive control over the securities held by such entities.
The shares foreclosed upon represented approximately 54.6% of our outstanding voting shares (53.9% owned by Allied and 0.7% owned by CAMAC International) as of the dates of transfer and as such, represented a change in control of the Company. The Company has been advised that the shares held by Oltasho are beneficially owned by Alhaji Murhi Busari, its Chairman, and the shares held by Latmol are beneficially owned by Alhaji Murhi Busari, its Chairman.
On July 5, 2017, Oltasho and Latmol entered into a Voting Agreement with Dr. Lawal (the “Voting Agreement”) resulting in another change in control of the Company. Pursuant to the Voting Agreement, Oltasho and Latmol provided complete authority to Dr. Lawal to vote the 117,624,760 shares foreclosed upon (and any other securities of the Company obtained by Oltasho and/or Latmol in the future) at any and all meetings of stockholders of the Company and via any written consents. Those 117,624,760 shares represented approximately 54.6% of the Company’s common stock as of the parties’ entry into the Voting Agreement. The Voting Agreement has a term of approximately 10 years, through July 31, 2027, but can be terminated at any time with the mutual consent of the parties. In connection with their entry into the Voting Agreement, Oltasho and Latmol each provided Dr. Lawal an irrevocable voting proxy to vote the shares covered by the Voting Agreement. Additionally, during the term of such agreement, Oltasho and Latmol agreed not to transfer the shares covered by the Voting Agreement except pursuant to certain limited exceptions. According to the Voting Agreement, Oltasho and Latmol have no desire to control the Company and believe that voting control of the Company was best determined by Dr. Lawal, a United States resident, who has extensive knowledge of United States laws and the assets and operations of the Company, as Dr. Lawal was, until he retired in 2015, the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of the Company. Due to the Voting Agreement, Dr. Lawal will continue to hold voting control over the Company.
OIL AND GAS ACTIVITIES

Nigeria
In June 2012, Allied acquired all of Nigerian Agip Exploration Limited ("NAE")’s participating interest in Oil Mining Leases 120 and 121 (the "OMLs") offshore Nigeria, and all of NAE’s interest in the Production Sharing Contract ("the PSC") relating to the Oyo field. As a result of this transaction, Allied became the operator of the OMLs and the holder of the interests in the PSC, apart from the interests previously acquired by the Company in 2010 and 2011.
In September 2013, drilling operations commenced on the development well Oyo-7. Based on logging-while-drilling (“LWD”) data, the well encountered gross oil pay of 133 feet (net oil pay of 115 feet) and gross gas pay of 103 feet (net gas pay of 93 feet) in the gas cap from the then producing Pliocene reservoir, with excellent reservoir quality. The well was temporarily suspended. As a secondary objective, the well Oyo-7 confirmed the presence of hydrocarbons in the deeper Miocene formation. This marked the first time a well had been successfully drilled into the Miocene formation in OML 120. Hydrocarbons were encountered in three intervals totaling approximately 65 feet, as interpreted from the LWD data. The Company is currently making plans for further exploratory activities in the Miocene formation.
In February 2014, an affiliate of the Company entered into a long-term contract for the Floating Production, Storage and Offloading vessel ("FPSO") Armada Perdana. The contract provides for an initial term of seven years beginning January 1, 2014, with an automatic extension for an additional term of two years unless terminated by the Company with prior notice.

In February 2014, the Company acquired all remaining economic interests in the PSC and related assets, contracts and rights pertaining to the OMLs located offshore Nigeria, including the producing Oyo field (the “Allied Assets”), from Allied (the “Allied Transaction”) pursuant to a Transfer Agreement entered into in November 2013 by the Company and its affiliates, and Allied (the “Transfer Agreement”). In consideration for the Allied Assets, the Company issued 82.9 million shares of the Company’s common stock, delivered to Allied a $50.0 million convertible subordinated promissory note (the “2014 Convertible Subordinated Note”) and paid $170.0 million in cash. As a result of the Allied Transaction, the Company now owns 100% of the economic interest in the OMLs. The Allied Assets included two producing wells as of the transaction date: wells Oyo-5 and Oyo-6.
In August 2014, the Company drilled well Oyo-8 to a total vertical depth of approximately 6,059 feet (approximately 1,847 meters) and successfully encountered four new oil and gas reservoirs with total gross hydrocarbon thickness of 112 feet in the eastern fault block, based on results from the LWD data, reservoir pressure measurement, and reservoir fluid sampling. The well was temporarily suspended.

In September 2014, the Company shut-in both wells Oyo-5 and Oyo-6 and successfully removed their flow lines and other subsea equipment for relocation to wells Oyo-7 and Oyo-8 as planned. The Company also initiated temporary plug and abandonment activities for well Oyo-5. 

In March 2015, the Company finished completion operations for well Oyo-8, and successfully hooked it up to the FPSO. Production commenced in May 2015. In April 2015, the Company completed plug and abandonment activities for well Oyo-6 and subsequently initiated well Oyo-7's horizontal completion activities. The Company commenced production from well Oyo-7 in June 2015. 
The enforcement of certain control measures implemented by the Nigerian government with regards to the quarterly exportation and sale of crude oil products from Nigeria has had an impact on the Company’s operations. Petroleum producers are required to obtain export permits quarterly for crude oil liftings. During the period from May to September 2015, the Company produced approximately 1.5 million Bbls of crude oil but only sold approximately 0.6 million Bbls due to unexpected delays in the issuance of export permits for the quarter ending September 30, 2015. The resulting crude oil inventory of approximately 0.9 million Bbls, as of September 30, 2015, was approaching the Company’s crude oil storage capacity on its FPSO. As a result, the Company had to curtail production by temporarily shutting-in well Oyo-8 in September 2015. The Company subsequently received a permit to export approximately 1.3 million Bbls from October to December 2015.
In early May 2016, with the help of a light intervention vessel, the Company successfully completed well repair operations to resolve the mechanical problem related to well Oyo-8 and successfully resumed production from the well.

In early July 2016, well Oyo-7 was shut-in as a result of an emergency shut-in of the Oyo field production. This has resulted in a loss of approximately 1,400 BOPD from the field. The Company is currently working on relocating an existing gaslift line to well Oyo-7 to enable continuous gaslift operation. For cost effectiveness, the relocation of the gaslift line to well Oyo-7 is now planned to be combined with the Oyo-9 subsea equipment installation scheduled for the second half of 2018, subject to fund availability.
During the three months ended December 31, 2017, the average daily production was approximately 4,600 BOPD (approximately 4,000 BOPD net to the Company).
In early August 2017, the Pacific Bora drilling rig arrived on the Oyo field and immediately commenced drilling of the Oyo-9 well, In October 2017, the Company successfully completed the drilling phase of the Oyo-9 well. The well results indicate presence of the target channel system and 85.3 feet of net oil sand. The results are in line with predictions and confirm field extension to the western part of the field. Both the engineering and manufacturing of the subsea equipment are at various stages of completion. However, due to chronic delays in the release of the remaining funds and improper interference by the guarantor of the MCB Finance Facility (described and defined below under Note 8. - Debt -“Long-Term Debt - MCB Finance Facility and Related Agreements, to the Notes to Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements), the Company temporarily suspended the completion and hookup of the development program. On several occasions, the Company has demanded the guarantor cease and desist from interfering in the disbursement of funds for the project. Consequently, the Pacific Bora drilling rig and all drilling services has been demobilized. The Oyo-9 well will be tied in to the field’s current production facility, and is expected to add an additional 6,000 to 7,000 barrels of oil per day from the field.
7

In October 2017, the Company obtained a funding commitment to drill our potential high-impact exploration well ("Oyo-NW"), in the Miocene formation of the OMLs. The Company completed the drilling of the Oyo-NW well and, based on preliminary evaluation; it has discovered hydrocarbons in the Miocene Formation. Preliminary evaluation of the well data shows that the two main sand units, the Miocene U7.0 and U8.0, with a gross thickness of approximately 115.2 feet are hydrocarbon-bearing. Work has commenced to estimate the discovered volumes and to determine the relevant appraisal and development program.
Kenya

In May 2012, the Company, through a wholly-owned subsidiary, entered into four production sharing contracts with the Government of the Republic of Kenya, covering onshore exploration blocks L1B and L16, and offshore exploration blocks L27 and L28 (the “Kenya PSCs”). The Company is the operator of all of the blocks with the Government having the right to participate up to 20%, either directly or through an appointee, in any area subsequent to declaration of a commercial discovery. The Company is responsible for all exploration expenditures.

Blocks L1B and L16

The Kenya PSCs for onshore blocks L1B and L16 each provided for an initial exploration period with specified minimum work obligations during that period. Prior to the end of the initial exploration period, the Company was required, for each block, to i) conduct a gravity and magnetic survey and ii) acquire, process and interpret 2-D seismic data.
The initial exploration period for onshore blocks L1B and L16 ended in June 2015. Having satisfied all material contractual obligations under the initial exploration period, the Company received approval from the Kenya Ministry of Energy and Petroleum to enter into the First Additional Exploration Period for both blocks. 
The First Additional Exploration Period for both onshore blocks ended in July 2017. In accordance with the Kenya PSCs, the Company was obligated, for each block, to (i) acquire, process and interpret high density 300 square kilometer 3-D seismic data at a minimum expenditure of $12.0 million and (ii) drill one exploration well to a minimum depth of 3,000 meters at a minimum expenditure of $20.0 million.
In June 2017, the Company wrote off the costs related to onshore blocks L1B and L16 that had been capitalized to that date.
The Company no longer intends to renew or extend its leases on these onshore blocks.
Blocks L27 and L28
The Kenya PSCs for offshore blocks L27 and L28 each provided for an initial exploration period of three years, through August 2015, with specified minimum work obligations during that period. Prior to the end of the initial exploration period, the Company is required to, for each block, i) conduct a regional geological and geophysical study, ii) reprocess and re-interpret previous 2-D seismic data and iii) acquire, process and interpret 1,500 square kilometers of 3-D seismic data.
In March 2014, the Company, through its participation in a multi-client combined gravity/magnetic and 2-D seismic survey, completed its required gravity/magnetic and 2-D seismic data acquisition for both blocks. 
In April 2015, the Company completed a regional geological and geophysical study.
In August 2015, the Company received approval from the Kenya Ministry of Energy and Petroleum for an 18-month extension of the Initial Exploration Period for blocks L27 and L28, which lasted through February 2017. The remaining contractual obligation under the initial exploration period was for the Company to acquire, process and interpret 1,500 square kilometers of 3-D seismic data over both offshore blocks and wrote off the cost that had been capitalized to that date in 2016. 
The Company no longer intends to renew or extend its leases on these offshore blocks.
The Gambia

In May 2012, the Company, through a wholly-owned subsidiary, signed two Petroleum Exploration, Development & Production Licenses with The Republic of The Gambia, for offshore exploration blocks A2 and A5 (the “Gambia Licenses”). For both 
8

blocks, the Company is the operator, with the Gambian National Petroleum Company (“GNPCo”) having the right to elect to participate up to a 15% interest, following approval of a development and production plan. The Company is responsible for all expenditures prior to such approval even if the GNPCo elects to participate.
The term of the initial exploration period for both blocks A2 and A5, now extended through December 2018, require for the Company to (i) interpret the approximately 1,500 square kilometers of 3-D seismic data that was acquired and processed in 2015 and 2016 and (ii) drill one exploration well on either block A2 or A5 and evaluate the drilling results. The Company is currently interpreting the recently acquired and processed 3-D seismic data.
In March 2017, the Company entered into a Sale Agreement with FAR Ltd. ("FAR"), an Australian Securities Exchange listed oil and gas company, whereby FAR agreed to acquire an 80% interest and operatorship of the Company’s offshore A2 and A5 blocks, with the Company retaining a 20% working interest in both blocks. Under the terms of the Sale Agreement, which was approved by the Government of the Republic of The Gambia in June 2017, upon closing of the transaction, FAR paid the Company the purchase price of $5.2 million (the remaining $3.6 million was received on July 3, 2017) and will carry $8.0 million of the Company’s share of costs in a planned exploration well to be drilled in late 2018. In addition, if the Company’s share of the exploration well is less than $8.0 million, the balance is to be paid in cash to the Company. Any amount in excess of the $8.0 million representing the Company’s share of the exploration well will be borne by the Company.
The Company and FAR are currently working together to progress our plans to drill the Samo-1 prospect exploratory well in late 2018.
Ghana

In April 2014, the Company, through an indirect 50%-owned subsidiary, signed a Petroleum Agreement with the Republic of Ghana (the “Petroleum Agreement”) relating to the Expanded Shallow Water Tano block offshore Ghana ("ESWT"). The contracting parties, which hold 90% of the participating interest in the block, are Erin Energy Ghana Limited as the operator, GNPC Exploration and Production Company Limited, and Base Energy (collectively the “Contracting Parties”), holding 60%, 25%, and 15% of the participating interest of the Contracting Parties, respectively. The Ghana National Petroleum Corporation initially has a 10% carried interest through the exploration phase, and will have the option to acquire an additional paying interest of up to 10% following a declaration of commercial discovery. The Company owns 50% of its subsidiary Erin Energy Ghana Limited. The remaining 50% interest is owned by an affiliated company.

The ESWT block contains three previously discovered fields (the "Fields") and the work program required the Contracting Parties to determine, within nine months of the effective date of the Petroleum Agreement, the economic viability of developing the Fields. In addition, the Petroleum Agreement provided for an initial exploration period of two years from the effective date of the Petroleum Agreement, with specified work obligations during that period, including the reprocessing of existing 2-D and 3-D seismic data and the drilling of one exploration well on the ESWT block. The Contracting Parties have the right to apply for a first extension period of one and one-half years and a second extension period of up to two and one-half years. Each extension period has specified additional minimum work obligations, including (i) conducting geological and geophysical studies during the first extension period and (ii) drilling one exploration well during the first extension period and, depending on the length of the extension, one or two wells during the second extension period.

In January 2015, the Petroleum Agreement became effective, following the signing of a Joint Operating Agreement between the Contracting Parties.

In October 2015, at the completion of the initial technical and commercial evaluation of the Fields, the Contracting Parties concluded that certain fiscal terms in the Petroleum Agreement had to be adjusted in order to achieve commerciality of the Fields under current economic conditions. The Contracting Parties have presented this conclusion to the relevant government entities. The Ghanaian Government is currently reviewing the requests for adjustment of the fiscal terms, and has granted the Company an extension of the Initial Exploration Period for eighteen months until the end of July 2018. The Company has submitted an application to the Ghanaian government for an additional extension of the initial exploration period beyond the current date of July 2018. 
Following the recent decision of the Special Chamber of the International Tribunal of the Law of the Sea (ITLOS) in Hamburg, Germany, concerning the maritime boundary dispute between Ghana and Côte d’Ivoire, the Company is working with the Ghanaian Government and its partners to progress the development activities in its ESWT block, offshore Ghana. The 3D seismic 
9

data, which is planned to be acquired during the second half of 2018, will be used to improve subsurface definition and optimization of drilling targets.

Segment Information

For information related to our financial performance by segment, see Note 13. — Segment Information to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

REGULATION

General

Our operations and our ability to finance and fund our growth strategy are affected by political developments and laws and regulations in the areas in which we operate. In particular, oil and natural gas production operations and economics are affected by:

• | changes in governments;


• | civil unrest;


• | price and currency controls;


• | limitations on oil and natural gas production and exports;


• | tax, environmental, safety and other laws relating to the petroleum industry;


• | changes in laws relating to the petroleum industry;


• | changes in administrative regulations and the interpretation and application of such rules and regulations; and


• | changes in contract interpretation and policies of contract adherence.


In any country in which we may do business, the oil and natural gas industry legislation and agency regulation are periodically changed, sometimes retroactively, for a variety of political, economic, environmental and other reasons. Numerous governmental departments and agencies issue rules and regulations binding on the oil and natural gas industry, some of which carry substantial penalties for the failure to comply. The regulatory burden on the oil and natural gas industry increases our cost of doing business and our potential for economic loss.

Environmental and Government Regulation

Various federal, state, local and international laws and regulations relating to the discharge of materials into the environment, the disposal of oil and natural gas wastes, or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment may affect our operations and costs. We are committed to the protection of the environment and believe we are in material compliance with the applicable laws and regulations. However, regulatory requirements may, and often do, change and become more stringent, and there can be no assurance that future regulations will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. During the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, other than the plug and abandonment ("P&A") expenditures for well Oyo-6, we did not have any significant expenditures relating to environmental and government regulation.
MARKETING AND PRICING

We currently derive the totality of our revenue from the sale of crude oil in Nigeria. As a result, our revenues and ultimate profitability, the value of our reserves, our access to capital and our growth are substantially subject to the prevailing prices of crude oil. Prevailing prices for such commodities are subject to wide fluctuations for macro-economic reasons beyond our control. Historically, prices received for crude oil sales have been volatile and unpredictable, and such volatility and unpredictability is expected to continue.
COMPETITION

10

We compete with numerous large international oil companies and smaller oil companies that target opportunities in markets similar to ours, including the natural gas and petroleum markets. Many of these companies have far greater economic, political and material resources at their disposal. Our management team has prior experience in the fields of petroleum engineering, geology, field development, production, operations, international business development, and finance and experience in management and executive positions with international energy companies. Nevertheless, the markets in which we operate and plan to operate are highly competitive and the Company may not be able to compete successfully against its current and future competitors. See Item 1A. Risk Factors for risk factors associated with competition in the oil and gas industry.
RISK MANAGEMENT AND INSURANCE PROGRAM

Insurance Program
In accordance with industry practice, the Company maintains insurance against many, but not all, potential perils confronting our operations and in coverage amounts and deductible levels that we believe to be economic. Consistent with that profile, our insurance program is structured to provide us financial protection from significant losses resulting from damages to, or the loss of, physical assets or loss of human life and liability claims of third parties, including such occurrences as well blow-outs and weather events that result in oil spills and damage to our wells and/or platforms. Our goal is to balance the cost of insurance with our assessment of the potential risk of an adverse event. We maintain insurance at levels that we believe are appropriate and consistent with industry practice and statutory regulations and we regularly review our risks of loss and the cost and availability of insurance and revise our insurance program accordingly.

We continuously monitor regulatory changes and regulatory responses and their impact on the insurance market and our overall risk profile, and adjust our risk and insurance program to provide protection at optimum levels, weighing the cost of insurance against the potential and magnitude of disruption to our operations and cash flows. 

Currently, the Company has operator’s extra expense insurance coverage up to $250.0 million per occurrence with respect to drilling and $75.0 million per occurrence with respect to all other wells. This includes coverage for re-drilling and restoration of wells as well as coverage for resultant environmental damage, including voluntary clean-up. The Company also carries physical damage coverage on offshore assets that is subject to full replacement cost limits. Both of these coverages, operator’s extra expense and physical damage, are subject to certain customary exclusions and limitations and to deductibles generally ranging from approximately $0.3 million to $2.0 million per occurrence, which must be met prior to recovery. In addition, the Company carries third party liability insurance, which includes pollution insurance, up to a limit of $50 million. This program includes coverage for bodily injury and property damage to third parties, including sudden and accidental pollution liability coverage. 

Health, Safety and Environmental Program

Our Health, Safety and Environmental (“HSE”) Program is supervised by an HSE officer who reports to senior management to ensure compliance with all applicable state and federal regulations. Its implementation and execution is the direct responsibility of the respective country managers in all the countries in which we operate. We have in place an HSE policy that mandates compliance with all relevant HSE regulations and industry standards in the various countries in which we operate. The policy is designed with the joint goals of zero injuries and accidents, no risk to occupational health, and no damage to the environment.
EMPLOYEES

At December 31, 2017, the Company had a total of 61 full-time employees and 3 part-time employees, of which 26 were employed in the United States, and 35 in Africa. We have been successful in attracting a talented team of industry professionals that has been instrumental in achieving significant growth and success for the Company. In addition to our employees, we utilize the services of various independent contractors and service providers to perform certain professional services, as needed.

During 2018, the Company may need to hire additional personnel in certain operational positions as needed. The number and skill sets of individual employees will be primarily dependent on the relative rates of growth of the Company’s different projects and the extent to which operations and development activities are executed internally or contracted to outside parties. In order for us to attract and retain qualified personnel, we will have to offer competitive salaries to present and future employees.
