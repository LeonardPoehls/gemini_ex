ITEM 1.    BUSINESS
General 

RSP Permian, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“RSP Inc.,” the “Company,” “we,” “our,” or “us”), is an independent oil and natural gas company engaged in the acquisition, exploration, exploitation, development and production of unconventional oil and associated liquids-rich natural gas reserves in the Permian Basin of West Texas.  The vast majority of the Company’s acreage is located on large, contiguous acreage blocks in the core of the Midland Basin and the Delaware Basin, both sub-basins of the Permian Basin. The Midland Basin properties are primarily in the adjacent counties of Midland, Martin, Andrews, Ector, and Glasscock. The Delaware Basin properties are in Loving and Winkler counties. The Company’s common stock is listed and traded on the NYSE under the ticker symbol “RSPP.”
The Company’s executive offices are located at 3141 Hood St., Suite 500, Dallas, TX 75219, and the Company also maintains an office in Midland, Texas. The Company’s telephone number is 214-252-2700.
Business Activities

RSP Inc. is a leader in executing a multi-zone horizontal development program in the North Midland Basin with extensive industry knowledge relating to several productive zones on its properties. We target multiple oil and natural gas producing stratigraphic horizons, or stacked pay zones, on our properties. Since initiating our horizontal drilling program in the Midland Basin in late 2012, we have participated in the completion of 360 gross horizontal wells with wells completed in five different horizontal zones in the Midland Basin including the Middle Spraberry, Lower Spraberry, Wolfcamp A, Wolfcamp B, and Wolfcamp D. With the acquisition of Silver Hill, as defined below, we have acquired properties in which Silver Hill had horizontal wells completed in seven different zones in the Delaware Basin including the Brushy Canyon, 1st Bone Spring, 2nd Bone Spring, 3rd Bone Spring, Wolfcamp X/Y, Lower Wolfcamp A, and Wolfcamp B. As of December 31, 2017, we have participated in the completion of 29 gross horizontal wells in the Delaware Basin.
On October 13, 2016, the Company entered into definitive agreements to acquire 100% of Silver Hill Energy Partners, LLC (“SHEP I”) and Silver Hill E&P II, LLC (“SHEP II”, and together with SHEP I, “Silver Hill”) for $1.25 billion of cash and 31.0 million shares of RSP Inc. common stock in aggregate, implying a total purchase price of $2.4 billion (based on the 20-day volume weighted average price of RSP Inc. common stock). Substantially all of the purchase price was recorded to proved and unproved oil and natural gas properties on the Company’s balance sheet. The SHEP I acquisition closed on November 28, 2016 with a cash cost of $604.0 million, before purchase price adjustments, and 15.0 million shares of RSP Inc. common stock. The SHEP II acquisition closed on March 1, 2017, with cash consideration of $646.0 million, before purchase price adjustments, and approximately 16.0 million shares of RSP Inc. common stock. 
Silver Hill was comprised of two privately held entities that collectively owned oil and gas producing properties and undeveloped acreage in Loving and Winkler counties in Texas. Silver Hill owned approximately 40,100 net acres with net production of approximately 15,000 Boe per day as of the acquisition announcement date. This highly contiguous acreage position in the core of the Delaware Basin was complementary to the Company’s existing asset base in the Midland Basin, and the acquisition created substantial scale from a production and acreage standpoint. 
During 2017, our capital expenditures totaled $673.3 million, which included $610.6 million of drilling and completion activities and $62.7 million of infrastructure and other expenditures. The SHEP II acquisition closed on March 1, 2017 for a purchase price of $1.3 billion, before purchase price adjustments, that included cash consideration of $646.0 million, and approximately 16.0 million shares of RSP Inc. common stock, valued at $663.9 million based on our closing common share price of $41.44 per share on March 1, 2017. In addition, we spent $279.0 million on acquisitions of undeveloped acreage and additional mineral interests.
During 2016, our developmental capital expenditures, which includes drilling, completion, infrastructure and other and excludes acquisitions, totaled $294.2 million, which included approximately $275.5 million spent on drilling and completion activities and $18.7 million spent on infrastructure and other. The SHEP I acquisition closed on November 28, 2016 for a purchase price of $1.2 billion, before purchase price adjustments, that included cash consideration of $604.0 million, and approximately 15.0 million shares of RSP Inc. common stock valued at $595.9 million based on our closing common share price of $39.78 at the closing date. In addition, we spent $69.4 million on bolt-on acquisitions and additions to leasehold in the Midland Basin.

For the year ended December 31, 2017, our average net daily production was 55,255 Boe/d (approximately 72% oil, 12% natural gas and 16% NGLs), and we operated and produced from 266 horizontal and 409 vertical wells.
As of December 31, 2017, our net proved reserves were approximately 375.9 MMBoe (70% oil, 17% NGLs and 13% natural gas), of which 42% were classified as PDP. Our estimated proved reserves were prepared by our internal engineers and audited by Netherland Sewell, our independent petroleum engineering firm, as of December 31, 2017. 
Our board of directors has approved an initial capital budget for drilling, completion, and infrastructure and other for 2018 of approximately $815 million to $895 million which anticipates adding an eight rig and a third dedicated frac crew by the middle of the year. We continuously monitor commodity prices, our cash flow and returns to determine adjustments to our capital budget. We intend to allocate our 2018 capital budget approximately as follows:
•$725 million to $785 million for drilling and completion activities; approximately 10% of which is non-operated drilling and completion activities; and
•$90 million to $110 million for infrastructure and other.

Competition and Markets

General

As an operator, we design and manage the well development and supervise operation and maintenance activities on a day-to-day basis. Independent contractors engaged by us provide all the equipment and personnel associated with these activities. We employ petroleum engineers, geologists and land professionals who work to improve production rates, increase reserves and lower the cost of operating our oil and natural gas properties.
Marketing and Customers

We market the majority of the oil and natural gas production from properties we operate. We sell our oil, NGLs and natural gas production to purchasers at market prices. We normally sell production to a relatively small number of customers, as is customary in the exploration, development and production business. For the year ended December 31, 2017, three purchasers individually accounted for more than 10% of our revenue: Enterprise Crude Oil, LLC (“Enterprise”) (21%), Western Refining (21%) and Shell Trading (US) Company (“Shell Trading”) (14%). For the year ended December 31, 2016, two purchasers individually accounted for more than 10% of our revenue: Enterprise (27%) and Shell Trading (23%). For the year ended December 31, 2015, four purchasers individually accounted for more than 10% of our revenue: Shell Trading (37%), Phillips 66 Company (22%), Diamondback E&P LLC (13%) and Enterprise (12%). Based on the current demand for oil, NGLs, and natural gas, and the availability of other purchasers, we believe that the loss of any one or all of our major purchasers would not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations, as oil, NGLs, and natural gas are fungible products with well-established markets and numerous purchasers.
Transportation

During the initial development of our fields, we assess the gathering and delivery infrastructure in the areas of our production and then plan accordingly to arrange transportation to gathering systems or pipelines. Our oil is transported from the wellhead to our tank batteries by our gathering systems. The oil is then transported by the purchaser by truck to a tank farm or by pipeline. Our NGLs and natural gas are generally transported from the wellhead to the purchaser’s pipeline interconnection point through a third party gathering system.
Competition

The oil and natural gas industry is intensely competitive, and we compete with other companies that have greater resources. Many of these companies not only explore for and produce oil and natural gas, but also carry on midstream and refining operations and market petroleum and other products on a regional, national or worldwide basis. These companies may be able to pay more for productive oil and natural gas properties and exploratory prospects or to define, evaluate, bid for and purchase a greater number of properties and prospects than our financial or human resources permit. In addition, these companies may have a greater ability to continue exploration activities during periods of low oil and natural gas market prices. Larger or more integrated competitors also may be able to absorb the burden of existing, and any changes to, federal, state and local laws and regulations more easily than we can, which would adversely affect our competitive position. Our ability to acquire additional properties and to discover reserves in the future will be dependent upon our ability to evaluate and select suitable properties and to consummate transactions in a highly competitive environment. In addition, because we have fewer 
7

financial and human resources than many companies in our industry, we may be at a disadvantage in bidding for exploratory prospects and producing oil and natural gas properties.
There is also competition between oil and natural gas producers and other industries producing energy and fuel, such as nuclear, solar and wind. Furthermore, competitive conditions may be substantially affected by various forms of energy legislation and/or regulation considered from time to time by the governments of the United States and the jurisdictions in which we operate. It is not possible to predict the nature of any such legislation or regulation which may ultimately be adopted or its effects upon our future operations. Such laws and regulations may substantially increase the costs of exploring for, developing or producing oil and natural gas and may prevent or delay the commencement or continuation of a given operation.
Seasonality of Business

Weather conditions affect the demand for, and prices of, oil, NGLs and natural gas, and refinery turnaround and summer driving season affects demand for, and prices of oil. The prices of oil, NGLs and natural gas are heavily dependent on prevailing and expectations of future supply and demand factors, including current domestic and worldwide storage of each commodity and may not follow a seasonal pattern. Due to seasonal fluctuations or the other above factors impacting pricing, results of operations for individual periods may not be indicative of the results that may be realized on a long-term basis.
Title to Properties

As is customary in the oil and natural gas industry, we initially conduct only a cursory review of the title to our properties in connection with acquisition of leasehold acreage. At such time as we determine to conduct drilling operations on those properties, we conduct a thorough title examination and perform curative work with respect to significant defects prior to commencement of drilling operations. To the extent title opinions or other investigations reflect title defects on those properties, we are typically responsible for curing any title defects at our expense. We generally will not commence drilling operations on a property until we have cured any material title defects on such property. We have obtained title opinions on substantially all of our producing properties and believe that we have satisfactory title to our producing properties in accordance with standards generally accepted in the oil and natural gas industry.
Prior to completing an acquisition of producing oil and natural gas leases, we perform title reviews on the most significant leases and, depending on the materiality of properties, we may obtain a title opinion, obtain an updated title review or opinion or review previously obtained title opinions. Our oil and natural gas properties are subject to customary royalty and other interests, liens for current taxes and other burdens which we believe do not materially interfere with the use of or affect our carrying value of the properties.
We believe that we have satisfactory title to all of our material assets. Although title to these properties is subject to encumbrances in some cases, such as customary interests generally retained in connection with the acquisition of real property, customary royalty interests and contract terms and restrictions, liens under operating agreements, liens related to environmental liabilities associated with historical operations, liens for current taxes and other burdens, easements, restrictions and minor encumbrances customary in the oil and natural gas industry, we believe that none of these liens, restrictions, easements, burdens or encumbrances will materially detract from the value of these properties or from our interest in these properties or materially interfere with our use of these properties in the operation of our business. In addition, we believe that we have obtained sufficient right‑of‑way grants and permits from public authorities and private parties for us to operate our business.
Oil and Natural Gas Leases

The typical oil and natural gas lease agreement covering our properties provides for the payment of royalties to the mineral owner for all oil, NGLs and natural gas produced from all wells drilled on the leased premises. The lessor royalties and other leasehold burdens on our properties generally range from 20% to 25%, resulting in a net revenue interest to us generally ranging from 75% to 80%.
Regulation of the Oil and Natural Gas Industry 

Our operations are substantially affected by federal, state and local laws and regulations. All of the jurisdictions in which we own or operate producing oil and natural gas properties have statutory provisions regulating the exploration for and production of oil and natural gas, including provisions related to permits for the drilling of wells, bonding requirements to drill or operate wells, the location of wells, the method of drilling and casing wells, the surface use and restoration of properties upon which wells are drilled, sourcing and disposal of water used in the drilling and completion process, and the abandonment of wells. Our operations are also subject to various conservation laws and regulations. These include the regulation of the size 
8

of drilling and spacing units or proration units, the number of wells which may be drilled in an area, and the unitization or pooling of oil or natural gas wells, as well as regulations that generally prohibit the venting or flaring of natural gas, and impose certain requirements regarding the ratability or fair apportionment of production from fields and individual wells.
Failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations can result in substantial penalties. The regulatory burden on the industry increases the cost of doing business and affects profitability. Although we believe we are in substantial compliance with all applicable laws and regulations, such laws and regulations are frequently amended or reinterpreted. Therefore, we are unable to predict the future costs or impact of compliance. Additional proposals and proceedings that affect the oil and natural gas industry are regularly considered by Congress, the states, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (“FERC”) and the courts. We cannot predict when or whether any such proposals may become effective.
We believe we are in substantial compliance with currently applicable laws and regulations and that continued substantial compliance with existing requirements will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position, cash flows or results of operations. However, current regulatory requirements may change, currently unforeseen environmental incidents may occur or past non‑compliance with environmental laws or regulations may be discovered. 
Regulation of Production of Oil and Natural Gas

The production of oil and natural gas is subject to regulation under a wide range of local, state and federal statutes, rules, orders and regulations. Federal, state and local statutes and regulations require permits for drilling operations, drilling bonds and reports concerning operations. We own interests in properties located in Texas, which regulates drilling and operating activities by requiring, among other things, permits for the drilling of wells, maintaining bonding requirements in order to drill or operate wells, and regulating the location of wells, the method of drilling and casing wells, the surface use and restoration of properties upon which wells are drilled and the plugging and abandonment of wells. The laws of Texas also govern a number of conservation matters, including provisions for the unitization or pooling of oil and natural gas properties, the establishment of maximum allowable rates of production from oil and natural gas wells, the regulation of well spacing or density, and plugging and abandonment of wells. The effect of these regulations is to limit the amount of oil and natural gas that we can produce from our wells and to limit the number of wells or the locations at which we can drill, although we can apply for exceptions to such regulations or to have reductions in well spacing or density. Moreover, Texas imposes a production or severance tax with respect to the production and sale of oil, NGLs and natural gas within its jurisdiction.
The failure to comply with these rules and regulations can result in substantial penalties. Our competitors in the oil and natural gas industry are subject to the same regulatory requirements and restrictions that affect our operations.
Regulation of Transportation of Oil

Sales of oil, condensate and NGLs are not currently regulated and are made at negotiated prices. Nevertheless, Congress could reenact price controls in the future.
Our sales of oil are affected by the availability, terms and cost of transportation. The transportation of oil in common carrier pipelines is also subject to rate and access regulation. FERC regulates interstate oil pipeline transportation rates under the Interstate Commerce Act. In general, interstate oil pipeline rates must be cost‑based, although settlement rates agreed to by all shippers are permitted and market based rates may be permitted in certain circumstances.
Intrastate oil pipeline transportation rates are subject to regulation by state regulatory commissions. The basis for intrastate oil pipeline regulation, and the degree of regulatory oversight and scrutiny given to intrastate oil pipeline rates, varies from state to state. Insofar as effective interstate and intrastate rates and regulations regarding access are equally applicable to all comparable shippers, we believe that the regulation of oil transportation will not affect our operations in any way that is of material difference from those of our competitors who are similarly situated. 
In December 2015, H.R. 2029 was signed into law which lifted a ban on the export of oil from the United States. This will enable U.S. oil producers the flexibility to seek new markets and export oil into the global marketplace.
Regulation of Transportation and Sales of Natural Gas

Historically, the transportation and sale for resale of natural gas in interstate commerce have been regulated by agencies of the U.S. federal government, primarily FERC. In the past, the federal government has regulated the prices at which natural gas could be sold. While sales by producers of natural gas can currently be made at uncontrolled market prices, Congress could reenact price controls in the future. Deregulation of wellhead natural gas sales began with the enactment of the Natural Gas 
9

Pipeline Act (the “NGPA”), and culminated in adoption of the Natural Gas Wellhead Decontrol Act which removed controls affecting wellhead sales of natural gas effective January 1, 1993. The transportation and sale for resale of natural gas in interstate commerce is regulated primarily under the Natural Gas Act of 1938 (the “NGA”) and by regulations and orders promulgated under the NGA by FERC. In certain limited circumstances, intrastate transportation and wholesale sales of natural gas may also be affected directly or indirectly by laws enacted by Congress and by FERC regulations.
The Domenici-Barton Energy Policy Act of 2005 (the “EPAct”) is a comprehensive compilation of tax incentives, authorized appropriations for grants and guaranteed loans, and significant changes to the statutory policy that affects all segments of the energy industry. Among other matters, the EPAct amends the NGA to add an anti‑market manipulation provision which makes it unlawful for any entity to engage in prohibited behavior to be prescribed by FERC, and furthermore provides FERC with additional civil penalty authority. Under the EPAct, the FERC has civil penalty authority under the NGA and the NGPA to impose penalties for current violations of up to $1,238,271 per day for each violation and disgorgement of profits associated with any violation. The civil penalty provisions are applicable to entities that engage in the sale of natural gas for resale in interstate commerce. On January 19, 2006, FERC issued Order No. 670, a rule implementing the anti‑market manipulation provision of the EPAct, and subsequently denied rehearing. The rules make it unlawful: (i) in connection with the purchase or sale of natural gas subject to the jurisdiction of FERC, or the purchase or sale of transportation services subject to the jurisdiction of FERC, for any entity, directly or indirectly, to use or employ any device, scheme or artifice to defraud; (ii) to make any untrue statement of material fact or omit to make any such statement necessary to make the statements made not misleading; or (iii) to engage in any act or practice that operates as a fraud or deceit upon any person. The new anti‑market manipulation rule does not apply to activities that relate only to intrastate or other non‑jurisdictional sales or gathering, but does apply to activities of gas pipelines and storage companies that provide interstate services, as well as otherwise non‑jurisdictional entities to the extent the activities are conducted “in connection with” gas sales, purchases or transportation subject to FERC jurisdiction, which now includes the annual reporting requirements under Order 704, described below. The anti‑market manipulation rule and enhanced civil penalty authority reflect an expansion of FERC’s NGA enforcement authority.
On December 26, 2007, FERC issued Order 704, a final rule on the annual natural gas transaction reporting requirements, as amended by subsequent orders on rehearing. Under Order 704, wholesale buyers and sellers of more than 2.2 MMBtus of physical natural gas in the previous calendar year, including natural gas producers, gatherers and marketers, are now required to report, on May 1 of each year, aggregate volumes of natural gas purchased or sold at wholesale in the prior calendar year to the extent such transactions utilize, contribute to, or may contribute to the formation of price indices. It is the responsibility of the reporting entity to determine which individual transactions should be reported based on the guidance of Order 704. Order 704 also requires market participants to indicate whether they report prices to any index publishers, and if so, whether their reporting complies with FERC’s policy statement on price reporting.
Gathering service, which occurs upstream of jurisdictional transmission services, is regulated by the states onshore and in state waters. Section 1(b) of the NGA exempts natural gas gathering facilities from regulation by FERC as a natural gas company under the NGA. Although FERC has set forth a general test for determining whether facilities perform a non‑jurisdictional gathering function or a jurisdictional transmission function, FERC’s determinations as to the classification of facilities is done on a case by case basis, based on physical and geographic factors among others. To the extent that FERC issues an order that reclassifies certain jurisdictional transmission facilities as non‑jurisdictional gathering facilities, and depending on the scope of that decision, our costs of getting gas to point of sale locations may increase. We believe that the natural gas pipelines in our gathering systems meet the traditional tests FERC has used to establish a pipeline’s status as a gatherer not subject to regulation as a natural gas company. However, the distinction between FERC‑regulated transmission services and federally unregulated gathering services is the subject of ongoing litigation, so the classification and regulation of our gathering facilities are subject to change based on future determinations by FERC, the courts or Congress. State regulation of natural gas gathering facilities generally include various safety, environmental and, in some circumstances, nondiscriminatory‑take requirements. Although such regulation has not generally been affirmatively applied by state agencies, natural gas gathering may receive greater regulatory scrutiny in the future.
The price at which we sell natural gas is not currently subject to federal rate regulation and, for the most part, is not subject to state regulation. However, with regard to our physical sales of these energy commodities, we are required to observe anti‑market manipulation laws and related regulations enforced by FERC under the EPAct and under the Commodity Exchange Act (“CEA”), and regulations promulgated thereunder by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (the “CFTC”). The CEA prohibits any person from manipulating or attempting to manipulate the price of any commodity in interstate commerce or futures on such commodity. The CEA also prohibits knowingly delivering or causing to be delivered false or misleading or knowingly inaccurate reports concerning market information or conditions that affect or tend to affect the price of a commodity. Should we violate the anti‑market manipulation laws and regulations, we could also be subject to related third‑party damage claims by, among others, sellers, royalty owners and taxing authorities.
10

FERC actively pursues anti-manipulation matters and has successfully upheld its actions in Federal Courts, and these enforcement actions may result in significant financial penalties or settlement payments.  Also, additional policies, rules and legislation pertaining to those and other matters may be considered or adopted by FERC, Congress and the Courts from time to time.  Failure to comply with FERC’s regulatory requirements in the future could subject us to civil penalty liability.
Intrastate natural gas transportation is also subject to regulation by state regulatory agencies. The basis for intrastate regulation of natural gas transportation and the degree of regulatory oversight and scrutiny given to intrastate natural gas pipeline rates and services varies from state to state. Insofar as such regulation within a particular state will generally affect all intrastate natural gas shippers within the state on a comparable basis, we believe that the regulation of similarly situated intrastate natural gas transportation in any states in which we operate and ship natural gas on an intrastate basis will not affect our operations in any way that is of material difference from those of our competitors. Like the regulation of interstate transportation rates, the regulation of intrastate transportation rates affects the marketing of natural gas that we produce, as well as the revenues we receive for sales of our natural gas.
Our ability to access transportation options may also be impacted by FERC’s decision to review its long standing 1999 Pipeline Policy Statement on the certification of natural gas pipelines.  On December 21, 2017 the current FERC Chairman, Kevin McIntyre issued a press release stating that the next steps in this process will be announced in the near future.  This creates uncertainty regarding the development of future pipelines and FERC’s approval process for pipeline certifications.  Any uncertainty in the availability of pipeline capacity or future pipeline capacity development could adversely affect our operations and costs.   
Changes in law and to FERC policies and regulations may adversely affect the availability and reliability of firm and/or interruptible transportation service on interstate pipelines, and we cannot predict what future action FERC will take. We do not believe, however, that any regulatory changes will affect us in a way that materially differs from the way they will affect other natural gas producers, gatherers and marketers with which we compete.
Regulation of Environmental and Occupational Safety and Health Matters

Our oil and natural gas exploration and production operations are subject to numerous stringent federal, regional, state and local statutes and regulations governing occupational safety and health, the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to environmental protection, some of which carry substantial administrative, civil and criminal penalties for failure to comply. These laws and regulations may require the acquisition of a permit before drilling or other regulated activity commences; require notice to stakeholders of proposed and ongoing operations; require the installation of expensive pollution control equipment; restrict the types, quantities and concentrations of various substances that can be released into the environment in connection with drilling, production and transporting through pipelines; govern the sourcing and disposal of water used in the drilling and completion process; limit or prohibit drilling activities in certain areas and on certain lands lying within wilderness, wetlands, frontier and other protected areas, or otherwise restrict or prohibit activities that could impact the environment, including water resources; require some form of remedial action to prevent or mitigate pollution from former operations such as plugging abandoned wells or closing earthen pits; establish specific safety and health criteria addressing worker protection; and impose substantial liabilities for pollution resulting from operations or failure to comply with regulatory filings. In addition, these laws and regulations may restrict the rate of production. Federal, state, or local administrative decisions, developments in the federal or state court systems, or other governmental or judicial actions may influence the interpretation and/or enforcement of environmental laws and regulations and may thereby increase compliance costs. Environmental regulations have historically become more stringent over time and, thus, there can be no assurance as to the amount or timing of future expenditures for environmental compliance or remediation.
The following is a summary of the more significant existing environmental and occupational health and safety laws and regulations, as amended from time to time, to which our business operations are subject and for which compliance may have a material adverse impact on our capital expenditures, results of operations or financial position.
Hazardous Substances and Waste Handling

The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (“CERCLA”), also known as the “Superfund” law, and comparable state laws impose liability, without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct, on certain classes of persons that are considered to have contributed to the release of a “hazardous substance” into the environment. These persons include the current and past owner or operator of the disposal site or the site where the release occurred and companies that disposed or arranged for the disposal of the hazardous substances at the site where the release occurred. Under CERCLA, such persons may be subject to joint and several strict liability for the costs of cleaning up the hazardous substances that have been released into the environment and for damages to natural resources, and it is not 
11

uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the hazardous substances released into the environment. We are able to control directly the operation of only those wells with respect to which we act as operator. Notwithstanding our lack of direct control over wells operated by others, the failure of an operator other than us to comply with applicable environmental regulations may, in certain circumstances, be attributed to us. We also generate materials in the course of our operations that may be regulated as hazardous substances. We are unaware of any liabilities for which we may be held responsible that would materially and adversely affect us.
The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (“RCRA”) and analogous state laws, impose detailed requirements for the generation, handling, storage, treatment and disposal of nonhazardous and hazardous solid wastes. RCRA specifically excludes drilling fluids, produced waters and other wastes associated with the exploration, development or production of oil, natural gas or geothermal energy from regulation as hazardous wastes. However, these wastes may be regulated by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (the “EPA”) or state agencies under RCRA’s less stringent nonhazardous solid waste provisions, state laws or other federal laws. Moreover, it is possible that these particular oil and natural gas exploration, development and production wastes now classified as nonhazardous solid wastes could be classified as hazardous wastes in the future. A loss of the RCRA exclusion for drilling fluids, produced waters and related wastes could result in an increase in our costs to manage and dispose of generated wastes, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position. In addition, in the course of our operations, we generate some amounts of ordinary industrial wastes, such as paint wastes, waste solvents, laboratory wastes and waste compressor oils that may be regulated as hazardous wastes if such wastes have hazardous characteristics. Although the costs of managing hazardous waste may be significant, we do not believe that our costs in this regard are materially more burdensome than those for similarly situated companies.
We currently own, lease or operate numerous properties that have been used for oil and natural gas exploration and production activities for many years. Although we believe we have utilized operating and waste disposal practices that were standard in the industry at the time, hazardous substances, wastes or petroleum hydrocarbons may have been released on, under or from the properties owned or leased by us, or on, under or from other locations, including off‑site locations, where such substances have been taken for recycling or disposal. In addition, some of our properties have been operated by third parties or by previous owners or operators whose treatment and disposal of hazardous substances, wastes or petroleum hydrocarbons was not under our control. These properties and the substances disposed or released on, under or from them may be subject to CERCLA, RCRA and analogous state laws. Under such laws, we could be required to undertake response or corrective measures, which could include removal of previously disposed substances and wastes, cleanup of contaminated property or performance of remedial plugging or pit closure operations to prevent future contamination.
Water Discharges

The federal Water Pollution Control Act (the “Clean Water Act”) and comparable state laws impose restrictions and strict controls regarding the discharge of pollutants, including produced waters and other oil and natural gas wastes, into or near regulated waters. The discharge of pollutants into regulated waters is prohibited, except in accordance with the terms of a permit issued by the EPA or the state. The discharge of dredge and fill material in regulated waters, including wetlands, is also prohibited, unless authorized by a permit issued by the EPA or, in some circumstances, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, or an analogous state agency. Obtaining permits has the potential to delay the development of oil and natural gas projects. These laws and any implementing regulations provide for administrative, civil and criminal penalties for any unauthorized discharges of oil and other substances in reportable quantities and may impose substantial potential liability for the costs of removal, remediation and damages.
Pursuant to these laws and regulations, we may be required to obtain and maintain approvals or permits for the discharge of wastewater or storm water and are required to develop and implement spill prevention, control and countermeasure plans, also referred to as “SPCC plans,” in connection with on‑site storage of significant quantities of oil. We believe that we maintain all required discharge permits necessary to conduct our operations, and further believe we are in substantial compliance with the terms thereof.
In September 2015, new EPA and U.S. Army Corps of Engineers rules revising the definition of “waters of the United States” (“WOTUS”) for all CWA programs, thereby defining the scope of the EPA’s and the Corps’ jurisdiction, became effective. To the extent the rule expands the scope of jurisdiction of the Clean Water Act, we could face increased costs and delays with respect to obtaining permits for dredge and fill activities in wetland areas. The rule has been challenged in court on the grounds that it unlawfully expands the reach of Clean Water Act programs, and implementation of the rule has been stayed pending resolution of the court challenge. In response to this decision, the EPA and the Corps resumed nationwide use of the agencies’ prior regulations defining the term “waters of the United States.” Those regulations will be implemented as they were prior to the effective date of the new WOTUS rule. In January 2017, the U.S. Supreme Court accepted review of the WOTUS rule to determine whether jurisdiction to hear challenges to the rule rests with the federal district or appellate courts. In 
12

February 2017, the new Presidential administration issued an Executive Order directing the EPA and the Corps to review and, consistent with applicable law, to initiate a rule-making to rescind or revise the WOTUS rule. The EPA and the Corps published a notice of intent to review and rescind or revise the rule in March 2017. In addition, the U.S. Department of Justice filed a motion with the U.S. Supreme Court in March 2017 requesting that the U.S. Supreme Court stay the suit concerning which court should hear challenges to the rule. The U.S. Supreme Court denied the motion in April 2017. In June 2017, the EPA and the U.S. Army Corps proposed a rule that would initiate the first step in a two- step process intended to review and revise the definition of “waters of the United States” consistent with President Trump’s executive order. Under the proposal, the first step would be to rescind the May 2015 final rule and put back into effect the narrower language defining “waters of the United States” under the Clean Water Act that existed prior to the rule. The second step would be a notice-and- comment rule-making in which the agencies will conduct a substantive reevaluation of the definition of “waters of the United States.”
The primary federal law related specifically to oil spill liability is the Oil Pollution Act (“OPA”), which amends and augments the oil spill provisions of the Clean Water Act and imposes certain duties and liabilities on certain “responsible parties” related to the prevention of oil spills and damages resulting from such spills in or threatening waters of the United States or adjoining shorelines. For example, operators of certain oil and natural gas facilities must develop, implement and maintain facility response plans, conduct annual spill training for certain employees and provide varying degrees of financial assurance. Owners or operators of a facility, vessel or pipeline that is a source of an oil discharge or that poses the substantial threat of discharge is one type of “responsible party” who is liable. The OPA applies joint and several liability, without regard to fault, to each liable party for oil removal costs and a variety of public and private damages. Although defenses exist, they are limited. As such, a violation of the OPA has the potential to adversely affect our operations.
Air Emissions

The federal Clean Air Act and comparable state laws restrict the emission of air pollutants from many sources, such as, for example, tank batteries and compressor stations, through air emissions standards, construction and operating permitting programs and the imposition of other compliance requirements. These laws and regulations may require us to obtain pre‑approval for the construction or modification of certain projects or facilities expected to produce or significantly increase air emissions, obtain and strictly comply with stringent air permit requirements or utilize specific equipment or technologies to control emissions of certain pollutants. The need to obtain permits has the potential to delay the development of oil and natural gas projects. Over the next several years, we may be required to incur certain capital expenditures for air pollution control equipment or other air emissions related issues. For example, the EPA has promulgated final rules under the Clean Air Act that subject oil and natural gas production, processing, transmission and storage operations to regulation under the New Source Performance Standards (the “NSPS”) and the Natural Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (the “NESHAPS”) programs. With regards to production activities, these final rules have required, among other things, the reduction of volatile organic compound (“VOC”) emissions from three subcategories of fractured and refractured gas wells for which well completion operations are conducted: wildcat (exploratory) and delineation gas wells; low reservoir pressure non‑wildcat and non‑delineation gas wells; and all “other” fractured and refractured gas wells. All three subcategories of wells must route flow back emissions to a gathering line or be captured and combusted using a combustion device such as a flare. However, the “other” wells must use reduced emission completions, also known as “green completions.” These regulations also establish specific new requirements regarding emissions from production‑related wet seal and reciprocating compressors, and from pneumatic controllers and storage vessels. The rule is designed to limit emissions of VOC, sulfur dioxide, and hazardous air pollutants from a variety of sources within natural gas processing plants, oil and natural gas production facilities, and natural gas transmission compressor stations. In May 2016, the EPA issued new final rules that, among other things, imposed green completion requirements on all newly-fractured and refractured oil wells. This rule could require a number of modifications to our operations, including the installation of new equipment. However, in June 2017, the EPA proposed a two year stay of the fugitive emissions monitoring requirements, pneumatic pump standards, and closed vent system certification requirements in the 2016 New Source Performance Standards rule for the oil and gas industry while it reconsiders these aspects of the rule. The proposal is still under consideration. Compliance with these and other air pollution control and permitting requirements has the potential to delay the development of oil and natural gas projects and increase our costs of development and production, which costs could be significant. However, we do not believe that compliance with such requirements will have a material adverse effect on our operations.
Regulation of GHG Emissions

In response to findings that emissions of carbon dioxide, methane and other greenhouse gases (“GHGs”) present an endangerment to the public health and the environment, the EPA has adopted regulations under existing provisions of the federal Clean Air Act that, among other things, require preconstruction and operating permits for certain large stationary sources. Facilities required to obtain preconstruction permits for their GHG emissions also will be required to meet “best 
13

available control technology” standards that will be established by the states or, in some cases, by the EPA on a case‑by‑case basis.
These EPA rulemakings could adversely affect our operations and restrict or delay our ability to obtain air permits for new or modified sources. In addition, the EPA has adopted rules requiring the monitoring and reporting of GHG emissions from specified onshore and offshore oil and natural gas production sources in the United States on an annual basis, which include certain of our operations. We are monitoring GHG emissions from our operations in accordance with the GHG emissions reporting rule and believe that our monitoring activities are in substantial compliance with applicable reporting obligations. More recently, in May 2016, the EPA finalized a suite of regulations that established methane emission standards for new and modified oil and gas production and natural gas processing and transmission facilities. 
The U.S. Bureau of Land Management (“BLM”) finalized similar rules in November 2016 that limit methane emissions from new and existing oil and gas operations on federal lands through limitations on the venting and flaring of gas, as well as enhanced leak detection and repair requirements; however, in December 2017, the BLM temporarily suspended or delayed certain of these requirements set forth in its Venting and Flaring Rule until January 2019, pending administrate review of the rule. Increased regulation of methane and other GHGs have the potential to result in increased compliance costs and, consequently, adversely affect our operations.
On August 3, 2015, the EPA also issued new regulations limiting carbon dioxide emissions from existing power generation facilities. Under this rule, nationwide carbon dioxide emissions would be reduced by approximately 30% from 2005 levels by 2030 with a flexible interim goal. Several industry groups and states challenged the rule. On February 9, 2016, the Supreme Court of the United States stayed the implementation of this rule pending judicial review. On March 28, 2017, President Trump signed an Executive Order directing the EPA to review the regulations, and on April 4, 2017, the EPA announced that it was reviewing the 2015 carbon dioxide regulations. On April 28, 2017, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia stayed the litigation pending the current administration’s review. That stay was extended for another 60 days on August 8, 2017. On October 10, 2017, the EPA initiated the formal rulemaking process to repeal the regulations. The EPA’s proposal will be subject to public comment and likely legal challenge, and as such we cannot predict at this time what impact the rulemaking will have on the demand for oil and natural gas production and our operations.
While Congress has from time to time considered legislation to reduce emissions of GHGs, there has not been significant activity in the form of adopted legislation to reduce GHG emissions at the federal level in recent years. In the absence of such federal climate legislation, a number of state and regional efforts have emerged that are aimed at tracking and/or reducing GHG emissions by means of cap and trade programs. These programs typically require major sources of GHG emissions to acquire and surrender emission allowances in return for emitting those GHGs. The number of allowances available for purchase is typically reduced each year in an effort to achieve the overall GHG emission reduction goal. In addition, in 2015, the United States participated in the United Nations Conference on Climate Change, which led to the creation of the Paris Agreement. The Paris Agreement requires countries to review and “represent a progression” in their intended nationally determined contributions, which set GHG emission reduction goals, every five years beginning in 2020. However, in June 2017, President Trump announced that the United States plans to withdraw from the Paris Agreement and to seek negotiations either to reenter the Paris Agreement on different terms or establish a new framework agreement. The Paris Agreement provides for a four-year exit process beginning in November 2016, which would result in an effective exit date of November 2020. The United States’ adherence to the exit process and/or the terms on which the United States may reenter the Paris Agreement or a separately negotiated agreement are unclear at this time.
The adoption of legislation or regulatory programs to reduce emissions of GHGs could require us to incur increased operating costs and could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Finally, it should be noted that some scientists have concluded that increasing concentrations of GHGs in the Earth’s atmosphere may produce climate changes that have significant physical effects, such as increased frequency and severity of storms, floods and other climatic events; if any such effects were to occur, they could have a material adverse effect on our exploration and production operations.
Hydraulic Fracturing Activities

Hydraulic fracturing is an important and common practice that is used to stimulate production of oil and/or natural gas from dense subsurface rock formations. The hydraulic fracturing process involves the injection of water, sand and chemicals under pressure into targeted subsurface formations to fracture the surrounding rock and stimulate production. We regularly use hydraulic fracturing as part of our operations. Hydraulic fracturing is typically regulated by state oil and natural gas commissions, but the EPA has asserted federal regulatory authority pursuant to the Federal Safe Drinking Water Act (the “SDWA”) over certain hydraulic fracturing activities involving the use of diesel fuels and published permitting guidance in 
14

February 2014 addressing the performance of such activities using diesel fuels. Also, in May 2014, the EPA issued an Advanced Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, seeking comment on the development of regulations under the Toxic Substances Control Act to require companies to disclose information regarding the chemicals used in hydraulic fracturing. Furthermore, Congress has from time to time considered legislation to provide for federal regulation of hydraulic fracturing under the SDWA and to require disclosure of the chemicals used in the hydraulic fracturing process. It is unclear how any federal disclosure requirements may affect our operations.
We may be subject to regulations that restrict our ability to discharge water produced as part of our production operations, and the ability to use injection wells as a disposal option not only will depend on federal or state regulations but also on whether available injection wells have sufficient storage capacities. For example, the EPA has issued a “no discharge” effluent limitation prohibiting oil and natural gas operators from transporting wastewater associated with hydraulic fracturing activities to publicly owned treatment works for disposal. 
Certain governmental reviews have been conducted or are underway that focus on the potential environmental impacts of hydraulic fracturing. For example, the EPA has completed a study of the potential environmental effects of hydraulic fracturing on water resources and published a final report in December 2016. Other governmental agencies, including the U.S. Department of Energy, have evaluated or are evaluating various other aspects of hydraulic fracturing. These ongoing or proposed studies could spur initiatives to further regulate hydraulic fracturing and could ultimately make it more difficult or costly for us to perform fracturing and increase our costs of compliance and doing business.
At the state level, several states have adopted or are considering legal requirements that could impose more stringent permitting, disclosure and well construction requirements on hydraulic fracturing activities. For example, in May 2013, the Texas Railroad Commission issued a “well integrity rule,” which updates the requirements for drilling, putting pipe down and cementing wells. The rule also includes new testing and reporting requirements, such as (i) the requirement to submit cementing reports after well completion or after cessation of drilling, whichever is later, and (ii) the imposition of additional testing on wells less than 1,000 feet below usable groundwater. In 2013, the Texas Railroad Commission implemented its hydraulic fracturing disclosure rule, which requires oil and gas operators to disclose on the FracFocus website the chemical ingredients and water volumes used in hydraulic fracturing treatments. Local government also may seek to adopt ordinances within their jurisdictions regulating the time, place and manner of drilling activities in general or hydraulic fracturing activities in particular or prohibit the performance of well drilling in general or hydraulic fracturing in particular. We believe that we follow applicable standard industry practices and legal requirements for groundwater protection in our hydraulic fracturing activities. Nonetheless, if new or more stringent federal, state or local legal restrictions relating to the hydraulic fracturing process are adopted in areas where we operate, we could incur potentially significant added costs to comply with such requirements, experience delays or curtailment in the pursuit of exploration, development or production activities, and perhaps even be precluded from drilling wells.
Safe Drinking Water Act
Our oil and natural gas exploration and production operations generate produced water, drilling muds, and other waste streams, some of which may be disposed via injection in underground wells situated in non-producing subsurface formations. The drilling and operation of these injection wells are regulated by the SDWA. The Underground Injection Well Program under the SDWA requires that we obtain permits from the EPA or delegated state agencies for our disposal wells, establishes minimum standards for injection well operations, restricts the types and quantities of fluids that may be injected and prohibits the migration of fluid containing any contaminants into underground sources of drinking water. Any leakage from the subsurface portions of the injection wells may cause degradation of freshwater, potentially resulting in cancellation of operations of a well, imposition of fines and penalties from governmental agencies, incurrence of expenditures for remediation of affected resources, and imposition of liability by landowners or other parties claiming damages for alternative water supplies, property damages, and personal injuries. Any changes in the laws or regulations or the inability to obtain permits for new injection wells in the future may adversely affect our ability to dispose of produced waters and could ultimately significantly increase the cost of our operations.
Endangered Species Act and Migratory Birds

The Endangered Species Act (the “ESA”) and (in some cases) comparable state laws were established to protect endangered and threatened species. Pursuant to the ESA, if a species is listed as threatened or endangered, restrictions may be imposed on activities adversely affecting that species’ habitat. Similar protections are offered to migratory birds under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act. We may conduct operations on oil and natural gas leases in areas where certain species that are listed as threatened or endangered are known to exist and where other species, such as the sage grouse, that potentially could be listed as threatened or endangered under the ESA may exist. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (the “FWS”) may designate 
15

critical habitat and suitable habitat areas that it believes are necessary for survival of a threatened or endangered species. A critical habitat or suitable habitat designation could result in material restrictions on land use and may materially delay or prohibit land access for oil and natural gas development.
In addition, the federal government recently issued indictments under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act to several oil and natural gas companies after dead migratory birds were found near reserve pits associated with drilling activities. The identification or designation of previously unprotected species as threatened or endangered in areas where underlying property operations are conducted could cause us to incur increased costs arising from species protection measures or could result in limitations on our exploration and production activities that could have an adverse impact on our ability to develop and produce reserves. If we were to have a portion of our leases designated as critical or suitable habitat, it could adversely impact the value of our leases.
In summary, we believe we are in substantial compliance with currently applicable environmental laws and regulations. Although we have not experienced any material adverse effect from compliance with environmental requirements, there is no assurance that this will continue. We did not have any material capital or other non‑recurring expenditures in connection with complying with environmental laws or environmental remediation matters in 2016, nor do we anticipate that such expenditures will be material in 2017.
OSHA

We are subject to the requirements of the Occupation Health and Safety Act (“OSHA”) and comparable state statutes whose purpose is to protect the health and safety of workers. In addition, the OSHA hazard communication standard, the Emergency Planning and Community Right‑to‑Know Act and comparable state statutes and any implementing regulations require that we organize and/or disclose information about hazardous materials used or produced in our operations and that this information be provided to employees, state and local governmental authorities and citizens. We believe that we are in substantial compliance with all applicable laws and regulations relating to worker health and safety.
Related Permits and Authorizations

Many environmental laws require us to obtain permits or other authorizations from state and/or federal agencies before initiating certain drilling, construction, production, operation or other oil and natural gas activities, and to maintain these permits and compliance with their requirements for on‑going operations. These permits are generally subject to protest, appeal or litigation, which can in certain cases delay or halt projects and cease production or operation of wells, pipelines and other operations.
Related Insurance

We maintain insurance against some risks associated with above or underground contamination that may occur as a result of our exploration and production activities. However, this insurance is limited to activities at the well site and there can be no assurance that this insurance will continue to be commercially available or that this insurance will be available at premium levels that justify its purchase by us. The occurrence of a significant event that is not fully insured or indemnified against could have a materially adverse effect on our financial condition and operations. Further, we have no coverage for gradual, long‑term pollution events.
Employees

As of December 31, 2017, we had 180 full-time employees. We hire independent contractors on an as needed basis. We have no collective bargaining agreements with our employees. We believe our employee relationships are satisfactory.
