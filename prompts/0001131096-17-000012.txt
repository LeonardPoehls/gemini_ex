Overview
athenahealth partners with hospital and ambulatory clients to drive clinical and financial results. We offer network-enabled medical record, revenue cycle, patient engagement, care coordination, and population health services, as well as Epocrates® and other point-of-care mobile applications. athenahealth connects care across a national network of nearly 88,000 providers and nearly 86 million patients. Our network provides clients better insight across their own organization as well as the ability to learn from the experience of every other provider on the network. Through our model, we infuse the knowledge clients need to thrive in a changing industry directly into their workflow, from clinical guidelines to payer rules. We take on back-office work at scale so providers can focus on patients, not paperwork. 
Our mission is to be healthcare providers’ most trusted service, helping them do well by doing the right thing. We design our services to help minimize the hassles that healthcare providers and their staff face from complex billing rules, quality measurement and reporting, clinical documentation and data exchange, patient communication and referrals, and many related tasks that can take attention away from delivering care. We believe our services empower healthcare providers to achieve and sustain financial health while staying focused on quality patient care.

We deliver the majority of our service offerings through a single instance of cloud-based software, which we refer to as athenaNet. Our model combines a cloud-based network, knowledge, and back-office work, which we refer to as network, knowledge, and work, to help healthcare providers leverage technology to automate certain back-office tasks, assist at the point of care, and adapt to changes in government regulatory schemes or billing requirements of payers. For most offerings, we charge clients a percentage of collections for our services, directly aligning our financial results with those of our clients. In 2016, we generated revenue of $1,082.9 million primarily from the sale of our services, compared to $924.7 million in 2015 and $752.6 million in 2014.
We incorporated in Delaware in 1997. Our corporate headquarters are located at 311 Arsenal Street, Watertown, Massachusetts 02472, and our telephone number is (617) 402-1000.
Market Overview
The healthcare industry is complex, disconnected, and fragmented, and is largely served by legacy software systems that may not be able to support the current needs for usability, flexibility, and interoperability. Medical groups and health systems face rising costs and complexity from a variety of factors, including legislative and regulatory reform efforts, changes in health benefit plan design, complicated reimbursement models, partners’ demand for electronic data exchange, and continued changes to federally mandated transaction standards. In addition, healthcare providers and practices face time-consuming administrative challenges, such as consolidating and reporting to government quality performance programs, processing and sorting a practice’s incoming paper documents, identifying and managing payer rules, collecting payments from uninsured, underinsured, and high deductible health plan patients, having a live operator take patient phone calls after a practice closes for the day, and communicating physician orders and referrals to others. 
We believe the traditional software model fails to address many of the challenges experienced by healthcare providers. The majority of health information technology market operates on locally-installed, conventional software. We believe this delivery model does not allow for rapid innovation, timely upgrades, or intelligent evolution of system functionality to address client needs. Additionally, locally-installed software requires a sizable upfront investment in hardware and software plus the staff to manage and maintain these systems. With the traditional software model, the client is still responsible for all of the back-office work from managing claims to handling time-consuming clinical paperwork.
In contrast, we believe a cloud-based network is better positioned to solve a greater set of problems because it can quickly be updated and delivered to all clients – as a single, shared instance of a network-enabled platform – without expensive installations or upgrades. Our network-enabled platform also allows clients to receive the benefits and learnings of every other practice on the network. Integrating our back-office services, as well as many other services, with our cloud-based network is the crux of our services model. Our cloud-based network is designed to deliver the right knowledge to the right person at the right time, while our back-office services execute work, at scale, that would otherwise fall upon the practice. By allowing athenahealth to address these problems, healthcare providers can focus on delivering the highest quality of care and free their staff to spend time on higher-value tasks.
Our Strategy
We are committed to building the most connected network in healthcare and to driving meaningful, measurable results for everyone on our network. The connectivity and system infrastructure we provide would normally be unattainable for small independent practices, which make up a large portion of the healthcare provider market. However, because we automate processes and scale work across our entire provider network, we can efficiently deliver our services to medical practices of every size as well as small health systems. By giving small practices much of the same technical and service infrastructure available to large clients, we provide significant benefits not only to those practices, but also to their clinical exchange and trading partners with whom they share vital information. As practices continue to be acquired or divested by other entities, this strategic flexibility enhances our ability to compete, regardless of whether a practice is independent or owned by a large enterprise. In addition, we price our services as a percentage of collections, a strategy that incentivizes us to improve performance and reduce costs through more efficient operations.
Key elements of our strategic priorities include:

• | Fully leverage the power of our network. Our ability to leverage the power of our network, which includes nearly 88,000 providers and nearly 86 million patients, is one of our greatest differentiators. Through our network, we have the ability to connect providers to other providers, to payers, and to patients.


• | Continue our expansion across the continuum of care. Our vision is to build a unified clinical experience that allows providers to cross environments (e.g., inpatient, outpatient, point-of-care mobile applications and population health management) without having to log in to different systems. We aim to present a single clinical and financial record,

2

integrating information for the user from any system on which information resides. Since entering the hospital space in early 2015, we have made rapid progress in expanding our network-based services to meet the needs of this market. We continue to expand our service offerings organically, and through acquisitions and strategic partnerships, including through integration with our More Disruption Please, or MDP, partners’ solutions, to provide solutions for new modalities across care settings.

• | Equip providers to win at alternative reimbursement. We continue to orient our services to enable clients to participate in pay-for-reporting, pay-for-performance, shared savings, and other bonus payment programs, and we proactively coach our clients to enable their success in these programs. We also establish new engagement points to connect with patients, as we believe this stakeholder group continues to be an increasingly important part of such payment programs.


• | Configure our organization to enable greater scaling efficiencies. We continuously refine our organizational structure to align with the objectives of achieving greater efficiency and effectiveness in execution. We are consistently seeking to find new ways to further streamline our business, including the ways in which we run product demonstrations, manage client onboarding, and surface meaningful analysis in our clients' work flows, in an effort to create a better experience for our clients and reduce costs.

Our Network-Enabled Services
By combining three distinct but interconnected components – network, knowledge, and work – we empower our clients to achieve and sustain financial health while staying focused on quality patient care. We deliver the majority of our service offerings through a single instance of cloud-based software, which we refer to as athenaNet. We believe that including our clients on the same instance of software creates a network effect that enables each client to benefit from the collective experience of other clients. As our network grows, we believe these benefits also expand and accrue to the benefit of all of our clients on the network. athenaNet acts as a conduit for the exchange of information among clients, payers, trading partners, and our own experienced team. It enables us to learn continuously, innovate with agility, and deliver near-instant updates that we believe rapidly improve performance. In addition, our clients benefit from back-office administrative work that we perform on their behalf. This work ranges from receiving, scanning, and delivering faxes to tracking claims with payers and managing denials. We automate this work whenever possible; when automation is not an option, we perform the work at massive scale with our internal team. The knowledge we gain from doing work for our clients and discovering ways to improve their performance is culled, curated, and captured within athenaNet through mechanisms that include a patented billing rules engine and clinical quality management engine. Using this knowledge, we also proactively coach our clients on best practices to help improve their performance. As we work with clients, payers, and other industry trading partners, more knowledge is infused into each service, which we believe makes athenaNet “smarter” and more powerful for our clients. This unique combination of network, knowledge, and work is fundamental to our service model and value proposition to clients.
We have developed a number of network-enabled services to support healthcare providers across the continuum of care. We offer various combinations of our services to our clients, including athenaOne and athenaOne for Hospitals and Health Systems, depending on whether they are medical groups and practices or hospitals and larger health systems. As of December 31, 2016, our suite of network-enabled services are shown in the following table and also described below:

 | For practices & medical groups | For hospitals & health systems 
athenaCollector® Medical billing and practice management | athenaOne | athenaOne for Hospitals & Health Systems

Medical Billing and Practice Management
athenaCollector is our network-enabled billing and practice management solution that eliminates or reduces many time-consuming activities that typically burden our clients and their staff, allowing them to focus more on patient care and other business priorities. athenaCollector includes our intuitive, web-based practice management solution that helps clients improve practice management by simplifying workflows related to patient registration, scheduling, check-in, charge entry, referral management, checkout, follow-up, collections, accounting, and reporting. In addition, athenaCollector includes our patented billing rules engine, which represents the industry’s largest database of payer-specific reimbursement requirements. It delivers in-depth insight and knowledge to our clients that helps them get paid by health insurers. With athenaCollector, we also perform back-office services in partnership with our clients at all key steps of the billing process, including: generating and submitting electronic and paper claims, confirming receipt of claims and resubmitting lost claims, posting remittance advice received from payers, following up on unpaid and denied claims, updating our rules engine to help prevent denial recurrences, and reviewing key performance metrics.
Electronic Health Records
athenaClinicals, our network-enabled electronic health record, or EHR, service, organizes the moment of care to help providers maximize their clinical productivity and maintain focus on their patients. athenaClinicals combines a web-based EHR with a clinical cycle management solution and a back-office document management service to help manage patient’s clinical documentation. The web-based EHR application included in athenaClinicals addresses the core clinical workflows of a practice including: clinical chart, encounter documentation, order entry, results viewing, patient call tracking, clinical reminder tracking, and workflow task management. athenaClinicals includes a global library of content that is available for all clients and provides a starting point for certain specialty-specific content. In keeping with our service model of network, knowledge, and work, athenaClinicals also acts as a virtual clinical back office for our clients. Our document services team takes on burdensome administrative work on behalf of our clients by processing incoming documents and routing them to the practice’s staff for review via document routing rules defined by the client.
Patient Engagement
athenaCommunicator is our network-enabled patient engagement and communication solution that provides an on-demand, automated, communication service between patients and provider practices for interactions outside the exam room. athenaCommunicator uses phone, e-mail, a patient portal, and our own team of operators to help improve financial and operational performance for our clients. athenaCommunicator enables clients to build a highly flexible set of communication rules with their patients. Our automated messaging platform delivers phone calls, text messages, and e-mails to patients, including appointment reminders, past due balance alerts, disease management initiatives, secure test results, and other compliance-driven campaigns. Our patient portal enables patients to express communication preferences, view lab results, review appointment information, exchange secure messages with providers, update personal information, and pay bills. Additionally, we print and mail paper statements to patients on behalf of our clients to assist with patient payment collection. Collectively, these activities expand the availability of the medical practice to patients and help alleviate the burden of administrative communications, freeing staff to focus on higher-value and more critical tasks. In addition, by tracking patients' responses, we are able to optimize the effectiveness of these communications. 
Order Transmission and Care Coordination
athenaCoordinator is our network-enabled order transmission and care coordination service. athenaCoordinator is focused on increasing efficiency for healthcare providers utilizing multiple information technology systems and helps to provide efficient care for patients. athenaCoordinator is founded on three core value drivers: more convenient access to patient data for referring providers, greater visibility into a patient’s full care picture and ordering choices, and less work in managing the movement of patients and their data through the referral chain. This value is delivered through six core network service elements: order management and referral management, scheduling, registration, messaging, charts, and third-party integration. athenaCoordinator is not offered as a stand-alone solution but instead must be utilized with athenaCollector, athenaClinicals and athenaCommunicator.
Population Health Management
athenahealth Population Health is our population health solution that combines services with software and analytics. This comprehensive, cloud-based population health service identifies patients in need of care and analyzes the clinical and financial results of that care to drive improvements in outcomes and costs. After clients transfer data from payers, finance systems, 
4

laboratories, clinical repositories, and/or EHRs, athenahealth Population Health processes and integrates that data and provides a platform through which clients can gain insight into and manage the health of their patient population. The population health management functionality of athenahealth Population Health consists of data integration for payer feeds and EHRs, a virtual desktop, and a web portal to gain insight into and take action on that data.
Clinical Decision Support 
 In addition to providing native decision support functionality into our suite of service offerings, athenahealth also offers other stand-alone applications to providers at the point of care. These services, provided through our Epocrates brand, center around a variety of clinical information and decision support offerings available through healthcare providers’ mobile devices. Epocrates services include: drug and disease information, medical calculator and tools, clinical guidelines, clinical messaging, and market research. The majority of healthcare professionals using our clinical information services access the free versions of our applications; premium subscriptions for some of these services are also available, and some services are sponsored by clients in the healthcare industry (e.g., pharmaceutical companies, managed care companies, and market research firms) that seek opportunities to engage with our network of members. The Epocrates network of members consists of over one million healthcare professionals, including approximately 50% of U.S. physicians. We believe the features available through our Epocrates and other point-of-care mobile applications allow healthcare professionals to leverage technology and clinical content to help inform prescribing decisions, improve workflow, and enhance patient safety.
Additional Services

In addition to the services described above, we also offer the following services to certain clients:

• | athenahealth Health Plan Data Exchange facilitates efficiencies in the exchange of data between providers and health plans for the healthcare operations of clients that also utilize athenaClinicals and athenaCollector.


• | athenaOne Analytics is comprised of an analytics and dashboard application and provides visibility into the financial and operational health of an organization. This add-on service helps athenaCollector clients: (i) create alignment around organizational performance goals, (ii) monitor and track progress against internal targets and industry benchmarks; and (iii) monitor coding and compliance.


• | Authorization Management includes both pre-certification processing and referral processing services. We review orders and referrals to determine whether a pre-certification or referral from a primary care physician, or PCP, is required under a patient’s health plan and then compile the necessary clinical documentation to attain such pre-certifications or PCP referral.

Research and Development
Our research and development efforts focus on enhancing and expanding our service offerings in response to changes in the market and to better serve medical groups and health systems. All of our clients that utilize athenaNet services use the same version of athenaNet, with some rules designed to take effect locally for particular clients. We continually update our software and rules, and execute periodic releases of new software functionality for our clients. Our software development life cycle methodology is designed to ensure that each software release is properly designed, built, tested, and released. Our research and development teams are located in the United States and India. We complement our internal efforts with services from third-party technology providers. In addition to our core software development activities, we dedicate full-time staff to the ongoing development and maintenance of our rules database for the athenaCollector services. We also employ program management and product management personnel, who work continually on improvements to our research and development processes and our service design, respectively. In 2016, we incurred $134.5 million in research and development expenses, compared to $111.0 million in 2015 and $82.7 million in 2014.
Sales and Marketing
We have developed sales and marketing capabilities aimed at expanding our network of clients, including healthcare providers, medical groups, and health systems. We expect to expand our network by selling our complete suite of services to new clients and cross-selling additional services into our existing client base. We have a direct sales force, which we augment through our channel partners and marketing initiatives.
Direct Sales
As of December 31, 2016, we had a total of 210 quota-carrying sales representatives focused on sales of our athenahealth-branded services, up 25% from December 31, 2015. During 2016, our athenahealth-branded services sales force was divided 
5

into four groups: enterprise, which is dedicated to serving the largest managed care organizations, as well as those with high growth potential; group, which is dedicated to medical practices with seven to 150 physicians; small group, which is dedicated to medical practices with one to six physicians; and hospital, which is dedicated to hospitals and hospital-owned clinics and medical groups with 50 beds or less. In 2017, we reorganized our sales force into two segments for sales of athenahealth-branded services to better address our clients' needs and our markets: the enterprise team, which will be dedicated to serving community hospitals, regional and national health systems, payers, and integrated healthcare enterprises; and the independent medical group team, which will be dedicated to independent medical practices of all sizes. We also have a pharmaceutical sales teams dedicated to sales of our Epocrates-branded services for pharmaceutical and other institutional clients. Our sales force is supported by personnel in our marketing organization, who provide specialized support for promotional and selling efforts. Due to our ongoing service relationship with clients we conduct a consultative sales process for most of our offerings, which generally includes understanding the needs of prospective clients, developing service proposals, and negotiating contracts to enable the commencement of services.
Channel Partners
In addition to our direct sales force, we maintain business relationships with third parties that promote or support our sales or services within specific industries or geographic regions. We refer to these third parties as “channels” and the individuals and organizations involved as our “channel partners.” In most cases, these relationships are agreements that compensate channel partners for their services. These channel partners typically do not make direct sales. Other channel relationships permit third parties to act as independent marketing representatives, purchasing agents (as in the case of group purchasing organizations), or in other joint marketing capacities. In some instances, the channel relationship involves endorsement or promotion of our services by these third parties. 
Marketing and Awareness Initiatives
Our marketing and sales objectives are designed to increase awareness of our company, establish the benefits of our service model, and build credibility with prospective clients so they accept our company as a trustworthy long-term service provider. To execute on this strategy, we have designed and implemented specific activities and programs aimed at converting leads to new clients. In addition, we use the Epocrates member network as a lead-generation platform for selling our athenahealth-branded services.
Our marketing and awareness initiatives are generally targeted toward specific segments of the healthcare market. These marketing programs may include:

• | television, print, and digital advertising;


• | sponsored pay-per-click search advertising and other internet-focused awareness-building efforts (such as social media, online videos, webinars, targeted messages to users through our services, and destination websites covering compliance and other issues of interest to medical practices);


• | public relations activities aimed at generating media coverage;


• | thought leadership through blog posts, opinion pieces, and speaking engagements;


• | participation in industry-focused trade shows;


• | targeted mail, e-mail, and phone calls to health systems and medical groups;


• | informational meetings (such as strategic retreats with targeted potential clients); and


• | dinner seminars.

Competition
We have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, intense competition in the marketplace. Our primary competitors use locally-installed software to manage the various clinical and financial workflow needs within the medical group or health system. Other nationwide competitors offer services they refer to as “on-demand” or “software-as-a-service” models, under which software is centrally hosted and services are provided from central locations. Companies that sell practice management, EHR, care coordination software and services, population health management services, and/or clinical health management tools include: AdvancedMD, Inc.; Allscripts Healthcare Solutions, Inc.; CareCloud Corporation; Cerner Corporation; eClinicalWorks, LLC; Epic Systems Corporation; Greenway Health, LLC; McKesson Corp.; Optum, Inc.; Practice Fusion, Inc.; Quality Systems, Inc. and its subsidiary NextGen Healthcare Information Systems, LLC; SCI Solutions, Inc.; Medscape; and UpToDate, Inc.
The principal competitive factors in our industry include:

• | ability to quickly adapt to the increasing complexity of the healthcare reimbursement system;

6


• | size and scope of payer rules knowledge;


• | ability to introduce only relevant rules into the workflow at the point of care;


• | ease of use and rates of user adoption;


• | ability to reduce work on behalf of clients;


• | ability to generate a provable return on investment;


• | product functionality and scope of services;


• | scope of network connections to support electronic data interactions;


• | performance, security, scalability, and reliability of service;


• | sales and marketing capabilities of the vendor; and


• | financial stability of the vendor.

We believe that we compete favorably with our competitors on the basis of these factors. However, some of our competitors have significantly greater financial, technological, and other resources and name recognition, as well as more established distribution networks and relationships with healthcare providers. As a result, these companies may be able to invest more resources than we can in research and development, strategic acquisitions, sales and marketing, and patent prosecution and litigation.
Government Regulation
Although we generally do not contract with U.S. state or local government entities, the healthcare industry in which we operate is highly regulated and is subject to changing political, legislative, regulatory, and other influences. As a result, the services we provide are subject to a complex array of healthcare laws and regulations, including, among others, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended, and the regulations that have been issued under it, which we refer to as HIPAA, the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, which we refer to as the HITECH Act, regulations issued by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, of the Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, and a number of fraud and abuse laws, including the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and the Ethics in Patient Referrals Act. Our subsidiaries in India are subject to additional regulations by the Government of India, as well as its regional subdivisions. These and other regulations to which we are subject are more fully described in “Risk Factors – RISKS RELATED TO REGULATION” in Item 1A of Part I of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Intellectual Property
We rely on a combination of intellectual property laws, as well as confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions, to protect our proprietary technology, databases, and our brand. We have filed U.S. and international patent applications covering certain of our proprietary technology. As of December 31, 2016, we held 15 U.S. patents and three foreign patents, with a number of U.S. patent applications pending. Our issued U.S. patents are expected to expire between 2020 and 2032. We also rely on a combination of registered and unregistered trademarks and service marks to protect our brand. We will continue to file and prosecute applications for patents and trademarks when and where appropriate to protect our rights in proprietary technologies and our brand.
We have a policy of requiring employees and consultants to execute confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of an employment or consulting relationship with us. Our employee agreements also require relevant employees to assign to us all rights to any inventions made or conceived during their employment with us. In addition, we have a policy of requiring individuals and entities with which we discuss potential business relationships to sign non-disclosure agreements. Our agreements with clients include confidentiality and non-disclosure provisions.
Seasonality
There is moderate seasonality in the activity level of health systems and medical groups and our clients in the pharmaceutical industry. Typically, discretionary use of healthcare provider services declines in the late summer and during the holiday season, which leads to a decline in collections by our healthcare provider clients about 30 to 50 days later. Our pharmaceutical clients’ budgeting process impacts the timing of revenue related to sales of sponsored clinical information and decision support services, which has historically been highest in the fourth quarter. In addition, as further explained in “Risk Factors” in Item 1A of Part I of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, our revenues and operating results may fluctuate from quarter to quarter depending on a host of factors including, but not limited to, the severity, length, and timing of seasonal and pandemic illnesses.
7

Employees
As of December 31, 2016, we had approximately 5,305 full-time employees, with approximately 2,799 in service operations, 769 in sales and marketing, 1,283 in research and development, and 454 in general and administrative functions. Of these full-time employees, approximately 4,505 were located in the U.S. and 800 were located in India. We believe that we have good relationships with our employees. None of our employees are subject to collective bargaining agreements or are represented by a union.
