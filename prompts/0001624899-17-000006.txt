ITEM 1. | BUSINESS

INTRODUCTION 
STERIS plc is a leading provider of infection prevention and other procedural products and services. Our mission is to help our Customers create a healthier and safer world by providing innovative healthcare and life science product and service solutions around the globe. We offer our Customers a unique mix of innovative capital equipment products, such as sterilizers and surgical tables, and connectivity solutions such as operating room (“OR”) integration; consumable products, such as detergents, gastrointestinal ("GI") endoscopy accessories, barrier product solutions, and other products and services, including: equipment installation and maintenance, microbial reduction of medical devices, instrument and scope repair solutions, laboratory testing services, and on-site and off-site reprocessing.
STERIS plc (“Parent”) was organized in 2014 under the laws of England and Wales under the name Solar New HoldCo Limited as a private limited company for the purpose of effecting under the laws of England and Wales the combination (“Combination”) of STERIS Corporation, an Ohio corporation (“Old STERIS”), and Synergy Health plc, a public limited company organized under the laws of England and Wales (“Synergy”). Effective November 2, 2015 the Parent was re-registered as a public company under the name of STERIS plc and the Combination closed. As a result of the Combination closing, STERIS plc became the ultimate parent company of Old STERIS and Synergy. Synergy has been re-registered under the name of Synergy Health Limited. The acquisition of Old STERIS was accounted for in the consolidated financial statements as a merger between entities under common control; accordingly the historical consolidated financial statements of Old STERIS for periods prior to November 2, 2015, are considered to be the historical financial statements of STERIS plc. Due to the timing of the Combination, the results of Synergy are only reflected in the results of operations of the Company from November 2, 2015 forward, which will affect the comparability to the prior period historical operations of the Company throughout this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
With registered offices located in Leicester, UK, STERIS plc has approximately 12,000 employees. Through our field sales and service and a network of dealers and distributors, we serve Customers in more than 100 countries around the world.
We operate and report in four reportable business segments: Healthcare Products, Healthcare Specialty Services, Life Sciences, and Applied Sterilization Technologies. Corporate and other, which is presented separately, contains the Defense and Industrial business unit plus costs that are associated with being a publicly traded company and certain other corporate costs. These costs include executive office costs, Board of Directors compensation, shareholder services and investor relations, external audit fees, and legacy pension and post-retirement benefit costs.
Our Healthcare Products segment offers infection prevention and procedural solutions for healthcare providers worldwide, including capital equipment and related maintenance and installation services, as well as consumables. 
Our Healthcare Specialty Services segment provides a range of specialty services for healthcare providers including hospital sterilization services and instrument and scope repairs. Linen management operations were divested during fiscal 2017.
Our Life Sciences segment offers capital equipment and consumable products, and equipment maintenance and specialty services for pharmaceutical manufacturers and research facilities.
Our Applied Sterilization Technologies segment offers contract sterilization and laboratory services for medical device and pharmaceutical Customers and others. 
The bulk of our revenues are derived from the healthcare and pharmaceutical industries. Much of the growth in these industries is driven by the aging of the population throughout the world, as an increasing number of individuals are entering their prime healthcare consumption years, and is dependent upon advancement in healthcare delivery, acceptance of new technologies, government policies, and general economic conditions. The pharmaceutical industry has been impacted by increased regulatory scrutiny of cleaning and validation processes, mandating that manufacturers improve their processes. Within healthcare, there is increased concern regarding the level of hospital acquired infections around the world; increased demand for medical procedures, including preventive screenings such as endoscopies and colonoscopies; and a desire by our Customers to operate more efficiently, all of which are driving increased demand for many of our products and services.

INFORMATION WITH RESPECT TO OUR BUSINESS IN GENERAL
Sources and Availability of Raw Materials.  We purchase raw materials, sub-assemblies, components, and other supplies needed in our operations from numerous suppliers in the United States and internationally. The principal raw materials and supplies used in our operations include stainless steel, organic and inorganic chemicals, fuel, and plastic components. These raw materials and supplies are generally available from several suppliers and in sufficient quantities that we do not currently expect any significant sourcing problems in fiscal 2018. We have long-term supply contracts for certain materials for which there are few suppliers, or those that are single-sourced in certain regions of the world, such as EO and cobalt-60, which are necessary to our AST operations. 
Intellectual Property.  We protect our technology and products by, among other means, obtaining United States and foreign patents. There can be no assurance, however, that any patent will provide adequate protection for the technology, system, product, service, or process it covers. In addition, the process of obtaining and protecting patents can be long and expensive. We also rely upon trade secrets, technical know-how, and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position.
As of March 31, 2017, we held approximately 380 United States patents and 1,240 in other jurisdictions and had approximately 100 United States patent applications and 370 patent applications pending in other jurisdictions. Patents for individual products extend for varying periods according to the date of filing or grant and legal term of patents in various countries where a patent is obtained. The actual protection a patent provides varies from country to country and depends in part upon the type of patent, the scope of its coverage, and the availability of legal remedies in each country.
Our products are sold around the world under various brand names and trademarks. We consider our brand names and trademarks to be valuable in the marketing of our products. As of March 31, 2017, we had a total of approximately 1,990 trademark registrations worldwide.
Research and Development.  Research and development is an important factor in our long-term strategy. For the years ended March 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015, research and development expenses were $59.4 million, $56.7 million, and $54.1 million, respectively. We incurred these expenses primarily for the research and development of commercial products.
We are focused on introducing products that increase efficiencies for our Customers. We have new healthcare products throughout our portfolio, including InnoWave Sonic Irrigators/Ultrasonic Cleaners and Smart Sink technology and accessories, Harmony AIR ™ Surgical Lighting System and Harmony AIR™ Equipment Booms and Accessories, next generation operating room integration products, and a number of new products in US Endoscopy. 
Quality Assurance.  We manufacture, assemble, and package products in several countries. Each of our production facilities are dedicated to particular processes and products. Our success depends upon Customer confidence in the quality of our production process and the integrity of the data that supports our product safety and effectiveness. We have implemented quality assurance procedures to support the quality and integrity of scientific information and production processes. 
 6

Government Regulation.  Our business is subject to various degrees of governmental regulation in the countries in which we operate. In the United States, the United States Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”), the United States Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”), the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission (“NRC”), and other governmental authorities regulate the development, manufacture, sale, and distribution of our products and services. Our international operations also are subject to a significant amount of government regulation, including country-specific rules and regulations and U.S. regulations applicable to our international operations. Government regulations include detailed inspection of, and controls over, research and development, clinical investigations, product approvals and manufacturing, marketing and promotion, sampling, distribution, record-keeping, storage, and disposal practices.
Compliance with applicable regulations is a significant expense for us. Past, current or future regulations, their interpretation, or their application could have a material adverse impact on our operations. Also, additional governmental regulation may be passed that could prevent, delay, revoke, or result in the rejection of regulatory clearance of our products. We cannot predict the effect on our operations resulting from current or future governmental regulation or the interpretation or application of these regulations.
If we fail to comply with any applicable regulatory requirements, sanctions could be imposed on us. For more information about the risks we face regarding regulatory requirements, see Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report titled, “Risk Factors, We are subject to extensive regulatory requirements and must receive and maintain regulatory clearance or approval for many products and operations. Failure to receive or maintain, or delays in receiving, clearance or approvals may hurt our revenues, profitability, financial condition, or value."
We have received warning letters, paid civil penalties, conducted product recalls and field corrections, and been subject to other regulatory sanctions. We believe that we are currently compliant in all material respects with applicable regulatory requirements. However, there can be no assurance that future or current regulatory, governmental, or private action will not have a material adverse affect on us or on our performance, results, or financial condition.
Environmental Matters.  We are subject to various laws and governmental regulations concerning environmental matters and employee safety and health in the United Kingdom, United States and in other countries. We have made, and continue to make, significant investments to comply with these laws and regulations. We cannot predict the future capital expenditures or operating costs required to comply with environmental laws and regulations. We believe that we are currently compliant with applicable environmental, health, and safety requirements in all material respects. However, there can be no assurance that future or current regulatory, governmental, or private action will not have a material adverse affect on our performance, results, or financial condition. Please refer to Note 10 of our consolidated financial statements titled, "Commitments and Contingencies" for further information.
In the future, if a loss contingency related to environmental matters, employee safety, health or conditional asset retirement obligations is significantly greater than the current estimated amount, we would record a liability for the obligation and it may result in a material impact on net income for the annual or interim period during which the liability is recorded. The investigation and remediation of environmental obligations generally occur over an extended period of time, and therefore we do not know if these events would have a material adverse affect on our financial condition, liquidity, or cash flow, nor can there be any assurance that such liabilities would not have a material adverse affect on our performance, results, or financial condition.
Competition.  The markets in which we operate are highly competitive and generally highly regulated. Competition is intense in all of our business segments and includes many large and small competitors. Brand, design, quality, safety, ease of use, serviceability, price, product features, warranty, delivery, service, and technical support are important competitive factors to us. We expect to face continued competition in the future as new infection prevention, sterile processing, contamination control, gastrointestinal and surgical support products and services enter the market. We believe many organizations are working with a variety of technologies and sterilizing agents. Also, a number of companies have developed disposable medical instruments and other devices designed to address the risk of contamination.
We believe that our long-term competitive position depends on our success in discovering, developing, and marketing innovative, cost-effective products and services. We devote significant resources to research and development efforts and we believe STERIS is positioned as a global competitor in the search for technological innovations. In addition to research and development, we invest in quality control, Customer programs, distribution systems, technical services, and other information services.
There can be no assurance that we will develop significant new products or services, or that new products or services we provide or develop in the future will be more commercially successful than those provided or developed by our competitors. In addition, some of our existing or potential competitors may have greater resources than us. Therefore, a competitor may succeed in developing and commercializing products more rapidly than we do. Competition, as it relates to our business segments and product categories, is discussed in more detail in the section above titled, “Information Related to Business Segments.”

Employees.  As of March 31, 2017, we had approximately 12,000 employees throughout the world. We believe we generally have good relations with our employees.
Methods of Distribution.  Sales and service activities are supported by a staff of regionally based clinical specialists, system planners, corporate account managers, and in-house Customer service and field support departments. We also contract with distributors and dealers in select markets.
Customer training is important to our business. We provide a variety of courses at Customer locations, at our training and education centers, and over the internet. Our training programs help Customers understand the science, technology, and operation of our products and services. Many of our operator training programs are approved by professional certifying organizations and offer continuing education credits to eligible course participants.
Seasonality.  Our financial results have been, from time to time, subject to seasonal patterns. We cannot assure you that these patterns will continue.
International Operations.  We believe we have opportunity to expand internationally, as we currently serve only a portion of the world that could benefit from our products. Through our subsidiaries, we operate in various international locations. United States revenues represented 69% of our fiscal 2017 revenues. Revenues from the United Kingdom and Europe, Middle East and Africa ("EMEA") were 9% and 13%, respectively, of our fiscal 2017 revenues. The remaining 9% was generated in Canada, the Asia Pacific and Latin American regions. 
Also see Note 11 to our Consolidated Financial Statements titled, “Business Segment Information,” "MD&A," and Item 7 for a geographic presentation of our revenues for the three years ended March 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015.
We conduct manufacturing in the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, Mexico, Brazil, China and various other European countries. Cost of revenues incurred in currencies other than the United States dollar have represented approximately 39% of our total cost of revenues. There are, in varying degrees, a number of inherent risks to our international operations. We describe some of these risks in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report titled, "Risk Factors. We conduct manufacturing, sales, and distribution operations on a worldwide basis and are subject to a variety of risk associated with doing business internationally."
Backlog.  We define backlog as the amount of unfilled capital equipment purchase orders at a point in time. At March 31, 2017, we had a backlog of $162.9 million. Of this amount, $109.7 million and $53.2 million related to our Healthcare Products and Life Sciences segments, respectively. At March 31, 2016, we had backlog orders of $164.7 million. Of this amount $119.4 million and $45.3 million related to our Healthcare Products and Life Sciences segments, respectively. A significant portion of the backlog orders at March 31, 2017, is expected to ship in the 2018 fiscal year.
