ITEM 1. BUSINESS.
 
Cala Corporation was incorporated on June 13, 1985 under the laws of the State of Oklahoma. The Companyâ€™s sole industry segment was the business of owning, operating, licensing and joint venturing restaurants. The Company discontinued this line of business on December 31, 2006. Currently, the Company intends to build an underwater resort and casino. Over the next twelve months, the Company plans to secure $25 million to begin construction on the first vessel. As of the date of this filing none of the financing has been secured.
 
The Undersea Resort was the idea of Joe Cala, CEO of Cala Corporation. On November 1988, while swimming offshore from Maui, he was surrounded by humpback whales. It was the most profound divine encounter that he ever experienced. From that point forward, he committed himself to developing the Undersea Resort. Integral to the design is the installation of large windows below sea level which look out to the undersea habitat.
 
Since 2007, the company has generated no revenues. The company has an accumulated deficit of $17,081,888 as of December 31, 2017, and anticipates generating losses for the next twelve months. As of December 31, 2017, the company had cash and cash equivalents of $987. The company will need to raise capital to pay the auditors, accountant, attorney and transfer agent. The company has been unable to obtain such financing or any financing to begin any projects. To address this concern, the independent public accounting firm has issued an audit opinion, which includes a statement that the results of our operations and our financial condition raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.
