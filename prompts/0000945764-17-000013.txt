Item 1. Business and Properties
GENERAL
Denbury Resources Inc., a Delaware corporation, is an independent oil and natural gas company with 254.5 MMBOE of estimated proved oil and natural gas reserves as of December 31, 2016, of which 97% is oil.  Our operations are focused in two key operating areas: the Gulf Coast and Rocky Mountain regions.  Our goal is to increase the value of our properties through a combination of exploitation, drilling and proven engineering extraction practices, with the most significant emphasis relating to CO2 enhanced oil recovery operations.
As part of our corporate strategy, we are committed to strong financial discipline, efficient operations and creating long-term value for our shareholders through the following key principles:

• | target specific regions where we either have, or believe we can create, a competitive advantage as a result of our ownership or use of CO2 reserves, oil fields and CO2 infrastructure;


• | secure properties where we believe additional value can be created through tertiary recovery operations and a combination of other exploitation, development, exploration and marketing techniques;


• | acquire properties that give us a majority working interest and operational control or where we believe we can ultimately obtain it;


• | maximize the value and cash flow generated from our operations by increasing production and reserves while controlling costs;


• | optimize the timing and allocation of capital among our investment opportunities to maximize the rates of return on our investments;


• | exercise financial discipline by attempting to balance our development capital expenditures with our cash flows from operations; and


• | attract and maintain a highly competitive team of experienced and incentivized personnel.

Denbury has been publicly traded on the New York Stock Exchange since 1997. Our corporate headquarters is located at 5320 Legacy Drive, Plano, Texas 75024, and our phone number is 972-673-2000. At December 31, 2016, we had 1,058 employees, 577 of whom were employed in field operations or at our field offices.  We make our annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to those reports, filed or furnished pursuant to section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, available free of charge on or through our website, www.denbury.com, as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file such material with, or furnish it to, the SEC.  The public may read and copy any materials we file with the SEC at the SEC’s Public Reference Room at 100 F Street, NE, Washington, DC 20549. The public may obtain information on the operation of the Public Reference Room by calling the SEC at 1-800-SEC-0330. The SEC also maintains a website, http://www.sec.gov, which contains reports, proxy and information statements and other information filed by Denbury.  Throughout this Annual Report on Form 10-K (“Form 10-K”) we use the terms “Denbury,” “Company,” “we,” “our” and “us” to refer to Denbury Resources Inc. and, as the context may require, its subsidiaries.
2016 BUSINESS DEVELOPMENTS
Oil prices generally constitute the single largest variable in our operating results. Oil prices have historically been volatile, with NYMEX oil prices ranging from $26 to $107 per Bbl over the last three calendar years, with prices in February 2016 representing the lowest level in over 14 years. Although realized prices have increased from the lows experienced during the first quarter of 2016, our focus continues to remain on cost reductions and preserving liquidity. Our 2016 business developments included the following:

• | Generated $219.2 million of cash flow from operations (which amount includes $84.2 million of receipts on settlements of commodity derivatives) in 2016, which was $10.6 million higher than our incurred development capital expenditures ($208.6 million).


• | Reduced our cash operating costs, including corporate overhead and interest, to approximately $34 per BOE during 2016, a 7% decrease from similar levels during 2015, and reflects improved CO2 efficiency resulting in a 32% decrease in CO2 usage between 2015 and 2016.

Denbury Resources Inc.


• | Completed a series of privately negotiated debt exchanges and open-market debt repurchases, contributing to a net reduction of our debt principal balance of approximately $530.4 million during 2016. As a result of the reduction in our average debt outstanding, cash interest expense also decreased $11.5 million between 2015 and 2016. 


• | Generated average total production of 64,003 BOE/d in 2016, an 11% decrease from 2015 production levels when adjusted for asset sales, despite reducing 2016 development capital spending to approximately half of 2015 levels.


• | Modified certain of our financial performance covenants applicable to the 2016, 2017 and 2018 periods to provide more flexibility in managing our balance sheet, the credit extended by our lenders, and continuing compliance with financial performance covenants in this low oil price environment. In addition, maintained the $1.05 billion borrowing base under our senior secured bank credit facility, providing us with significant liquidity. 


• | Completed construction of a natural gas liquids extraction plant at Delhi Field, providing us with the ability to sell natural gas liquids from the produced stream, improve the efficiency of the CO2 flood, and utilize extracted methane to power the plant and reduce field operating expenses.


• | Revised the joint venture arrangement at Grieve Field to provide for our joint venture partner to fund up to $55 million of the remaining estimated capital to complete development of the facility and fieldwork in exchange for a 14% higher working interest and a disproportionate share of revenues from the first 2 million barrels of production.


• | Completed a process of evaluating our assets with a goal of increasing the value of both existing assets and future projects by optimizing field operational and development plans, identifying exploitation opportunities, reducing CO2 injection volumes through increased efficiency, and reducing costs.

2017 BUSINESS OUTLOOK
Beginning in mid-2016, NYMEX oil prices reversed the previous sustained downward trend, increasing to per-barrel prices in the low $50’s in late 2016 and early 2017. While these NYMEX oil prices are an improvement from the lows experienced in February 2016, we continue to exercise caution when determining capital budgets and finalizing field development plans, as our primary focus continues to be on preserving our financial strength and flexibility. Given expectations around oil prices using 2017 NYMEX oil futures and our current hedging levels, our 2017 capital spending has initially been budgeted at approximately $300 million, excluding capitalized interest and acquisitions, an increase of 44% over 2016 spending levels. With this increased capital spending level, we currently anticipate 2017 average daily production will remain relatively flat with our exit rate in 2016 of roughly 60,000 BOE/d. Based upon our current production forecast and hedges currently in place, using expected average oil prices in the mid-$50’s per barrel during 2017, we currently expect that our operations would internally fund all but a minor amount of our 2017 capital spending budget of $300 million. We currently intend to fund any potential shortfall with incremental borrowings on our senior secured bank credit facility, and as of December 31, 2016, we had ample availability on our senior secured bank credit facility to cover any foreseeable cash flow shortfall.
Our capital spending during 2017 will focus primarily on the continued development of our current tertiary floods, with less focus on the development of unproved reserves. Planned development activities presented in the discussions that follow may be delayed or modified during the course of 2017 depending primarily upon oil prices and our level of cash flow to fund such development, and we will continue to evaluate the timing of the development of our inventory of fields and related pipelines and facilities. Additionally, we plan to continue our focus on improving our balance sheet, maintaining and enhancing the efficiencies achieved over the last couple of years and pursuing opportunities to increase or accelerate growth. We believe the market for acquisitions is improving and under the right conditions and terms acquisitions could provide one potential way to enhance our growth. In light of this, we are focusing on acquisition efforts directed at oil properties, preferably in our two areas of operation, in a manner that is accretive and does not significantly increase our leverage or reduce our liquidity.

ESTIMATED NET QUANTITIES OF PROVED OIL AND NATURAL GAS RESERVES AND PRESENT VALUE OF ESTIMATED FUTURE NET REVENUES
Oil and Natural Gas Reserve Estimates
DeGolyer and MacNaughton (“D&M”) prepared estimates of our net proved oil and natural gas reserves as of December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 (see the summary of D&M’s report as of December 31, 2016, included as an exhibit to this Form 10-K). These estimates of reserves were prepared using an average price equal to the unweighted arithmetic average of hydrocarbon prices on the first day of each month within the 12-month period in accordance with rules and regulations of the SEC.  These oil and natural gas reserve estimates do not include any value for probable or possible reserves that may exist, nor do they include any value for undeveloped acreage.  The reserve estimates represent our net revenue interest in our properties.

Denbury Resources Inc.

The following table provides estimated proved reserve information prepared by D&M as of December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, as well as PV-10 Values and Standardized Measures for each period. There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved oil and natural gas reserves and their values, including many factors beyond our control.  Proved oil and natural gas reserve quantities and values presented in the table reflect the significant decline in commodity prices beginning in late 2014 and continuing through 2016, whereby the average first-day-of-the-month NYMEX oil price used in estimating our proved reserves declined from $94.99 per Bbl at December 31, 2014, to $42.75 per Bbl at December 31, 2016, and for natural gas declined from $4.30 per MMBtu at December 31, 2014, to $2.55 per MMBtu at December 31, 2016. These commodity price changes contributed to the largest portion of the decline in proved reserves, including a decline of approximately 126 MMBOE (29%) in our proved reserves from December 31, 2014, to December 31, 2015, approximately half of which was attributable to natural gas reserves at Riley Ridge that were reclassified and are no longer considered proved reserves. See also Oil and Natural Gas Operations – Field Summary Table, Item 1A, Risk Factors – Estimating our reserves, production and future net cash flows is difficult to do with any certainty, and Supplemental Oil and Natural Gas Disclosures (Unaudited) to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of reserve inputs and changes between periods.

(1) | The significant decrease in natural gas reserves reflects the decline in commodity prices between December 31, 2014 and 2015. As a result of this decrease, natural gas reserves at Riley Ridge were reclassified and are no longer considered proved reserves, and which reserves totaled approximately 368 Bcf (61 MMBOE) as of December 31, 2014, or approximately 81% of our total proved natural gas reserves at that date.

(2) | The reference prices were based on the arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month NYMEX commodity prices for each month during the respective year. These prices do not reflect adjustments for market differentials by field that are utilized in the preparation of our reserve report to arrive at the appropriate net price we receive. See Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Results of Operations – Operating Results Table for details of oil and natural gas prices received, both including and excluding the impact of derivative settlements. 


(3) | Determined based on the average first-day-of-the-month prices for each month, adjusted to prices received by field in accordance with standards set forth in the Financial Accounting Standards Board Codification (“FASC”). PV-10 Values and the Standardized Measure are significantly impacted by the oil prices we receive relative to NYMEX oil prices (our NYMEX oil price differential). The weighted-average oil price differentials utilized were $3.39 per Bbl below representative NYMEX oil prices as of December 31, 2016, compared to $2.17 per Bbl below NYMEX oil prices as of December 31, 2015, and $3.10 per Bbl below NYMEX oil prices as of December 31, 2014. 


(4) | PV-10 Value is a non-GAAP measure and is different from the Standardized Measure in that PV-10 Value is a pre-tax number and the Standardized Measure is an after-tax number. The information used to calculate PV-10 Value is derived directly from data determined in accordance with FASC Topic 932. The difference between these two amounts, the discounted estimated future income tax, was $142.5 million at December 31, 2016; $428.4 million at December 31, 2015; and $2.84 billion at December 31, 2014. We believe that PV-10 Value is a useful supplemental disclosure to the Standardized Measure because the Standardized Measure can be impacted by a company’s unique tax situation, and it is not practical to calculate the Standardized Measure on a property-by-property basis. Because of this, PV-10 Value is a widely used measure within the industry and is commonly used by securities analysts, banks and credit rating agencies to evaluate the estimated future net cash flows from proved reserves on a comparative basis across companies or specific properties. PV-10 Value is commonly used by us and others in our industry to evaluate properties that are bought and sold, to assess the potential return on investment in our oil and natural gas properties, and to perform our impairment testing of oil and natural gas properties. PV-10 Value is not a measure of financial or operating performance under GAAP, nor should it be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the Standardized Measure. Our PV-10 Value and the Standardized Measure do not purport to represent the fair value of our oil and natural gas reserves. See Glossary and Selected Abbreviations for the definition of “PV-10 Value” and see Supplemental Oil and Natural Gas Disclosures (Unaudited) to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional disclosures about the Standardized Measure. 

Our proved non-producing reserves primarily relate to reserves that are to be recovered from productive zones that currently require a response to performance modifications before they can be classified as proved developed producing.  Since a majority of our properties are in areas with multiple pay zones, these properties may have both proved producing and proved non-producing reserves.
As of December 31, 2016, our estimated proved undeveloped reserves totaled approximately 45.2 MMBOE, or approximately 18% of our estimated total proved reserves, a decline of 14.0 MMBOE from December 31, 2015 levels for these reserves, which changes are discussed below.  Approximately 91% (41 MMBOE) of our proved undeveloped oil reserves relate to our CO2 tertiary operations.  We generally consider the CO2 tertiary proved undeveloped reserves to be lower risk than other proved undeveloped reserves that require drilling at locations offsetting existing production, because all of these proved undeveloped reserves are associated with tertiary recovery operations in fields and reservoirs that historically produced substantial volumes of oil under primary production. As of December 31, 2016, 12.6 MMBOE of our total proved undeveloped reserves are not scheduled to be developed within five years of initial booking, all of which are part of CO2 EOR projects. We believe these reserves satisfy the conditions to be included as proved reserves because (1) we have established and continue to follow the previously adopted development plan for each of these projects; (2) we have significant ongoing development activities in each of these CO2 EOR projects and (3) we have a historical record of completing the development of comparable long-term projects.
During 2016, we spent approximately $45 million to convert 5.9 MMBOE of proved undeveloped reserves to proved developed reserves, primarily related to continued tertiary development activities at Delhi Field, as well as non-tertiary development at Cedar Creek Anticline (“CCA”). Other changes during 2016 included adding 3.9 MMBOE of proved undeveloped reserves primarily related to our tertiary operations at Heidelberg Field; reclassifying 6.7 MMBOE of proved undeveloped reserves to unproved reserves pursuant to the five-year development rule established by the SEC primarily due to changes in our development plans; and recognizing other net downward proved undeveloped reserve revisions of 5.3 MMBOE, primarily the result of reserves that were determined to be uneconomic based on 2016 average oil and natural gas prices used in estimating our proved reserves.

Denbury Resources Inc.

During 2016, we provided oil and natural gas reserve estimates for 2015 to the United States Energy Information Agency that were substantially the same as the reserve estimates included in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.
Internal Controls Over Reserve Estimates
Reserve information in this report is based on estimates prepared by D&M, an independent petroleum engineering consulting firm located in Dallas, Texas, utilizing data provided by our internal reservoir engineering team and is the responsibility of management. We rely on D&M’s expertise to ensure that our reserve estimates are prepared in compliance with SEC rules and regulations and that appropriate geologic, petroleum engineering, and evaluation principles and techniques are applied in accordance with practices generally recognized by the petroleum industry as presented in the publication of the Society of Petroleum Engineers entitled “Standards Pertaining to the Estimating and Auditing of Oil and Gas Reserves Information (Revision as of February 19, 2007)”.  The person responsible for the preparation of the reserve report is a Senior Vice President at D&M; he is a Registered Professional Engineer in the State of Texas. He received a Master of Science degree in Petroleum Engineering from the University of Texas in 1975, and he has in excess of 37 years of experience in oil and gas reservoir studies and evaluations.  Our President and Chief Operating Officer is primarily responsible for overseeing the independent petroleum engineering firm during the process.  Our President and Chief Operating Officer has a Bachelor of Science degree in Engineering, Civil Specialty, from the Colorado School of Mines and over 27 years of industry experience working with petroleum reserve estimates.  D&M relies on various data provided by our internal reservoir engineering team in preparing its reserve estimates, including such items as oil and natural gas prices, ownership interests, production information, operating costs, planned capital expenditures and other technical data. Our internal reservoir engineering team consists of qualified petroleum engineers who maintain the Company’s internal evaluation of reserves and compare the Company’s information to the reserves prepared by D&M. Management is responsible for designing the internal control procedures used in the preparation of our oil and gas reserves, which include verification of data input into reserve forecasting and economics evaluation software, as well as multi-discipline management reviews.  The internal reservoir engineering team reports directly to our President and Chief Operating Officer.  In addition, our Board of Directors’ Reserves and Health, Safety and Environmental (“HSE”) Committee, on behalf of the Board of Directors, oversees the qualifications, independence, performance and hiring of our independent petroleum engineering firm and reviews the final report and subsequent reporting of our oil and natural gas reserve estimates.  The Chairman of the Reserves and HSE Committee holds a Ph.D. in Chemical Engineering from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and bachelor’s degrees in Chemistry and Mathematics from Capital University in Ohio. He has more than 35 years of industry experience, with responsibilities including reserves preparation and approval.
OIL AND NATURAL GAS OPERATIONS
Summary. Our oil and natural gas properties are concentrated in the Gulf Coast and Rocky Mountain regions of the United States.  Currently our properties with proved and producing reserves in the Gulf Coast region are situated in Mississippi, Texas, Louisiana and Alabama, and in the Rocky Mountain region are situated in Montana, North Dakota and Wyoming. Our primary focus is increasing the value of our properties through a combination of exploitation, drilling and proven engineering extraction practices, with the most significant emphasis relating to CO2 EOR operations. Our current portfolio of CO2 EOR projects provides us significant oil production and reserve growth potential in the future, assuming crude oil prices are at levels that support the development of those projects.  
We have been conducting and expanding EOR operations on our assets in the Gulf Coast region since 1999, and as a result, we currently have many more CO2 EOR projects in this region than in the Rocky Mountain region. We began operations in the Rocky Mountain region in 2010 in connection with, and following, our merger with Encore Acquisition Company (“Encore”). In the Gulf Coast region, we own what is, to our knowledge, the region’s only significant naturally occurring source of CO2, and these large volumes of naturally occurring CO2 give us a significant competitive advantage in this area. In the Rocky Mountain region, we own an overriding royalty interest equivalent to an approximate one-third ownership interest in ExxonMobil Corporation’s (“ExxonMobil’s”) CO2 reserves in LaBarge Field in southwestern Wyoming. In addition to the sources of CO2 we currently own, we purchase and use CO2 captured from industrial sources which could otherwise be released into the atmosphere (sometimes referred to as anthropogenic, man-made or industrial-source CO2) in our tertiary operations. These industrial sources of CO2 help us recover additional oil from mature oil fields and, we believe, also provide an economical way to reduce atmospheric CO2 emissions through the concurrent underground storage of CO2 which occurs as part of our oil-producing EOR operations.

Field Summary Table. The following table provides a summary by field and region of selected proved oil and natural gas reserve information, including total proved reserve quantities and the associated PV-10 Value of those reserves as of December 31, 2016, and average daily production for 2016, all based on Denbury’s net revenue interest (“NRI”).  The reserve estimates presented were prepared by D&M, independent petroleum engineers located in Dallas, Texas.  We serve as operator of virtually all of our significant properties, in which we also own most of the interests, although typically less than a 100% working interest, and a lesser NRI due to royalties and other burdens. For additional oil and natural gas reserves information, see Estimated Net Quantities of Proved Oil and Natural Gas Reserves and Present Value of Estimated Future Net Revenues above and Supplemental Oil and Natural Gas Disclosures (Unaudited) to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

(1) | The above reserve estimates were prepared in accordance with FASC Topic 932, Extractive Industries – Oil and Gas, using the arithmetic averages of the first-day-of-the-month NYMEX commodity price for each month during 2016, which were $42.75 per Bbl for crude oil and $2.55 per MMBtu for natural gas.


(2) | PV-10 Value is a non-GAAP measure and is different from the GAAP measure, the Standardized Measure, in that PV-10 Value is a pre-tax number and the Standardized Measure is an after-tax number. The Standardized Measure was $1.4 billion at December 31, 2016. A comparison of PV-10 Value to the Standardized Measure is included in the reserves table in Estimated Net Quantities of Proved Oil and Natural Gas Reserves and Present Value of Estimated Future Net Revenues above. The information used to calculate the PV-10 Value is derived directly from data determined in accordance with FASC Topic 932. See the definition of PV-10 Value in the Glossary and Selected Abbreviations.

Enhanced Oil Recovery Overview. CO2 used in EOR is one of the most efficient tertiary recovery mechanisms for producing crude oil.  When injected under pressure into underground, oil-bearing rock formations, CO2 acts somewhat like a solvent as it travels through the reservoir rock, mixing with and modifying the characteristics of the oil so it can be produced and sold.  The terms “tertiary flood,” “CO2 flood” and “CO2 EOR” are used interchangeably throughout this document.
While enhanced oil recovery projects utilizing CO2 have been successfully performed by numerous oil and gas companies in a wide range of oil-bearing reservoirs in different oil-producing basins, we believe our investments, experience and acquired knowledge give us a strategic and competitive advantage in the areas in which we operate. We apply what we have learned and developed over the years to improve and increase sweep efficiency within the CO2 EOR projects we operate.  
We began our CO2 operations in August 1999, when we acquired Little Creek Field, followed by our acquisition of Jackson Dome CO2 reserves and the NEJD pipeline in 2001.  Based upon our success at Little Creek and the ownership of the CO2 reserves, we began to transition our capital spending and acquisition efforts to focus more heavily on CO2 EOR and, over time, transformed our strategy to focus primarily on owning and operating oil fields that are well suited for CO2 EOR projects. Prior to tertiary flooding, we strive to maximize the currently sizeable primary and secondary production from our prospective tertiary fields and from fields in which tertiary floods have commenced but still contain significant non-tertiary production.  Our asset base today almost entirely consists of, or otherwise relates to, oil fields that we are currently flooding with CO2 or plan to flood with CO2 in the future, or assets that produce CO2.
Our tertiary operations have grown so that (1) 59% of our proved reserves at December 31, 2016 are proved tertiary oil reserves; (2) 60% of our 2016 total production was related to tertiary oil operations (on a BOE basis); and (3) 80% of our 2016 capital expenditures (excluding acquisitions) were related to our tertiary oil operations.  At year-end 2016, the proved oil reserves in our tertiary recovery oil fields had an estimated PV-10 Value of approximately $943.8 million, or 61% of our total PV-10 Value.  In addition, there are significant probable and possible reserves at several other fields for which tertiary operations are underway or planned.
Although the up-front cost of tertiary production infrastructure and time to construct pipelines and production facilities is greater than in primary oil recovery in most circumstances, we believe tertiary recovery has several favorable, offsetting and unique attributes, including (1) a lower exploration risk, as we are operating oil fields that have significant historical production and reservoir and geological data, (2) reasonable return metrics at our anticipated long-term prices, (3) limited competition for this recovery method in our geographic regions and a strategic advantage due to our ownership of the CO2 reserves and CO2 pipeline infrastructure, (4) our EOR operations are generally less disruptive to new habitats in comparison to other oil and natural gas development because we further develop existing (as opposed to new) oil fields, and (5) through our oil-producing EOR operations, we concurrently store CO2 captured from industrial sources in the same underground formations that previously trapped and stored oil and natural gas.
Tertiary Oil Properties
Gulf Coast Region
CO2 Sources and Pipelines
Jackson Dome.  Our primary Gulf Coast CO2 source, Jackson Dome, located near Jackson, Mississippi, was discovered during the 1970s by oil and gas companies that were exploring for hydrocarbons.  This large and relatively pure source of naturally occurring CO2 (98% CO2) is, to our knowledge, the only significant underground deposit of CO2 in the United States east of the Mississippi River. Together with the related CO2 pipeline infrastructure, Jackson Dome provides us a significant strategic advantage in the acquisition of properties in Mississippi, Louisiana and southeastern Texas that are well suited for CO2 EOR.
We acquired Jackson Dome in February 2001 in a purchase that also gave us ownership and control of the NEJD CO2 pipeline and provided us with a reliable supply of CO2 at a reasonable and predictable cost for our Gulf Coast CO2 tertiary recovery

operations.  Since February 2001, we have acquired and drilled numerous CO2-producing wells, significantly increasing our estimated proved Gulf Coast CO2 reserves from approximately 800 Bcf at the time of acquisition of Jackson Dome to approximately 5.3 Tcf as of December 31, 2016.  The proved CO2 reserve estimates are based on a gross (8/8ths) basis, of which our net revenue interest is approximately 4.2 Tcf, and is included in the evaluation of proved CO2 reserves prepared by D&M, an independent petroleum engineering consulting firm.  In discussing our available CO2 reserves, we make reference to the gross amount of proved and probable reserves, as this is the amount that is available both for our own tertiary recovery programs and for industrial users who are customers of Denbury and others, as we are responsible for distributing the entire CO2 production stream.
In addition to our proved reserves, we estimate that we have 1.2 Tcf of probable CO2 reserves at Jackson Dome.  While the majority of these probable reserves are located in structures that have been drilled and tested, such reserves are still considered probable reserves because (1) the original well is plugged; (2) they are located in fault blocks that are immediately adjacent to fault blocks with proved reserves; or (3) they are reserves associated with increasing the ultimate recovery factor from our existing reservoirs with proved reserves. In addition, a significant portion of these probable reserves at Jackson Dome are located in undrilled structures where we have sufficient subsurface and seismic data indicating geophysical attributes that, coupled with our historically high drilling success rate, provide a reasonably high degree of certainty that CO2 is present.
In addition to our drilling at Jackson Dome, we continue to expand our processing and dehydration capacities, and we continue to install pipelines and/or pumping stations necessary to transport the CO2 through our controlled pipeline network. As part of our innovation and improvement initiative, we have identified fields where we have been able to reduce CO2 injections without significantly impacting production. As such, we have been able to reduce injected CO2 volumes in the Gulf Coast region by 23% when comparing injection levels in the fourth quarter of 2016 to those in the prior year fourth quarter. We expect our current proved reserves of CO2, coupled with a risked drilling program at Jackson Dome and CO2 expected to be captured from industrial sources, to provide sufficient quantities of CO2 for us to develop our proved and probable EOR reserves in the Gulf Coast region. In the future, we believe that once a CO2 flood in a field reaches its productive economic limit, we could recycle a portion of the CO2 that remains in that field’s reservoir and utilize it for oil production in another field’s tertiary flood.
In the Gulf Coast region, approximately 85% of our average daily CO2 produced from Jackson Dome or captured from industrial sources in 2016 was used in our tertiary recovery operations, compared to 88% in 2015 and 91% in 2014, with the balance delivered to third-party industrial users. During 2016, we used an average of 462 MMcf/d of CO2 (including CO2 captured from industrial sources) for our tertiary activities.
Gulf Coast CO2 Captured from Industrial Sources.  In addition to our natural source of CO2, we are currently party to three long-term contracts to purchase CO2 from industrial plants.  We have purchased CO2 from an industrial facility in Port Arthur, Texas since 2012 and from an industrial facility in Geismar, Louisiana since 2013, which currently supply approximately 55 MMcf/d of CO2 to our EOR operations.  We currently expect to begin purchasing CO2 from Mississippi Power’s Kemper County Energy Facility during the first half of 2017, which could more than double the amount of CO2 we currently utilize from industrial sources. Additionally, we are in ongoing discussions with other parties who have plans to construct plants near the Green Pipeline. One of these projects includes construction of a methanol plant in Lake Charles, Louisiana, which is currently in the project financing stage of development. If the project is successfully financed in 2017, we would not expect first deliveries of CO2 from the plant until 2021 at the earliest.
In October 2015, the Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) finalized a rule – Carbon Pollution Emission Guidelines for Existing Stationary Sources: Electric Utility Generating Units (also known or commonly referred to as the “Clean Power Plan”) – that would impose limits on greenhouse gas emissions from new and existing U.S. electric generation units.  The Clean Power Plan in its current form contains requirements which would likely impact our ability to purchase power plant CO2 for our EOR operations from Mississippi Power’s Kemper County Energy Facility. The Clean Power Plan has been challenged by various states, trade associations, companies (including Denbury) and environmental groups.  On February 9, 2016, the U.S. Supreme Court stayed the implementation of the Clean Power Plan pending resolution of various challenges to the rule. On September 27, 2016, an en banc panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit heard oral argument on the merits of the various challenges to the Clean Power Plan. A decision could be issued at any time. In the meantime, the Supreme Court’s stay of the rule is in place and is expected to remain so until it grants certiorari and issues its own decision on the Plan, possibly as late as summer 2018. Additionally, the Trump administration has announced its intention to revise or rescind the Clean Power Plan. Given the Clean Power Plan’s status as a “final rule,” any change or revocation would likely involve a new rule-making process or Congressional action, the timing and details of which cannot be predicted. Although we do not believe the Clean Power Plan will impact our ability to take CO2 from Mississippi Power’s Kemper County Energy Facility in the near term, it could limit our ability to take CO2 in the future if upheld and maintained in effect.

In addition to the potential CO2 sources discussed above, we continue to have ongoing discussions with owners of existing plants of various types that emit CO2 that we may be able to purchase and/or transport. In order to capture such volumes, we (or the plant owner) would need to install additional equipment, which includes, at a minimum, compression and dehydration facilities.  Most of these existing plants emit relatively small volumes of CO2, generally less than our contracted sources, but such volumes may still be attractive if the source is located near CO2 pipelines.  The capture of CO2 could also be influenced by possible legislation or regulatory orders pertaining to CO2 emissions.  We believe that we are a likely purchaser of CO2 captured in our areas of operation because of the scale of our tertiary operations and our CO2 pipeline infrastructure.
Gulf Coast CO2 Pipelines. We acquired the 183-mile NEJD CO2 pipeline that runs from Jackson Dome to near Donaldsonville, Louisiana, as part of the 2001 acquisition of our Jackson Dome CO2 source.  Since 2001, we have acquired or constructed nearly 750 miles of CO2 pipelines, and as of December 31, 2016, we have access to nearly 950 miles of CO2 pipelines, which gives us the ability to deliver CO2 throughout the Gulf Coast region.  In addition to the NEJD CO2 pipeline, the major pipelines in the Gulf Coast region are the Free State Pipeline (90 miles), the Delta Pipeline (110 miles), the Green Pipeline Texas (120 miles), and the Green Pipeline Louisiana (200 miles).
Completion of the Green Pipeline allowed for the first CO2 injection into Hastings Field, located near Houston, Texas, in 2010, and gives us the ability to deliver CO2 to oil fields all along the Gulf Coast from Baton Rouge, Louisiana, to Alvin, Texas.  At the present time, most of the CO2 flowing in the Green Pipeline is delivered from the Jackson Dome area, but also includes the CO2 we are receiving from the industrial facilities in Port Arthur, Texas and Geismar, Louisiana, and we are currently transporting a third party’s CO2 for a fee to the sales point at Hastings Field.  We expect the volume of CO2 transported through the Green Pipeline to increase in future years as we develop our inventory of CO2 EOR projects in this area.
Tertiary Properties with Tertiary Production and Proved Tertiary Reserves at December 31, 2016
Mature properties. Mature properties include our longest-producing properties which are generally located along our NEJD CO2 pipeline in southwest Mississippi and Louisiana and our Free State Pipeline in east Mississippi.  This group of properties includes our initial CO2 field, Little Creek, as well as several other fields (Brookhaven, Cranfield, Eucutta, Lockhart Crossing, Mallalieu, Martinville, McComb and Soso fields).  These fields accounted for 23% of our total 2016 CO2 EOR production and approximately 12% of our year-end proved tertiary reserves.  These fields have been producing for some time, and their production is generally declining. Many of these fields contain multiple reservoirs that are amenable to CO2 EOR.
Delhi Field. Delhi Field is located east of Monroe, Louisiana.  In May 2006, we purchased our initial interest in Delhi for $50 million.  We began well and facility development in 2008 and began delivering CO2 to the field in the fourth quarter of 2009 via the Delta Pipeline, which runs from Tinsley Field to Delhi Field.
First tertiary production occurred at Delhi Field in the first quarter of 2010.  Production from Delhi Field in the fourth quarter of 2016 averaged 4,387 Bbls/d, up from 3,898 Bbls/d in the fourth quarter of 2015.  During late 2016, we completed construction of a natural gas liquids extraction plant, which provides us with the ability to sell natural gas liquids from the produced stream, improve the efficiency of the CO2 flood, and utilize extracted methane to power the plant and reduce field operating expenses. Our 2017 development capital budget includes investing approximately $20 million in this field, primarily related to continued phase development and infill drilling.
Hastings Field.  Hastings Field is located south of Houston, Texas.  We acquired a majority interest in this field in February 2009 for $247 million.  We initiated CO2 injection in the West Hastings Unit during the fourth quarter of 2010 upon completion of the construction of the Green Pipeline.  Due to the large vertical oil column that exists in the field, we are developing the Frio reservoir using dedicated CO2 injection and producing wells for each of the major sand intervals. We began producing oil from our EOR operations at Hastings Field in the first quarter of 2012, and we booked initial proved tertiary reserves for the West Hastings Unit in 2012.  During the fourth quarter of 2016, tertiary production from Hastings Field averaged 4,552 Bbls/d, compared to 5,082 Bbls/d in the fourth quarter of 2015. Our 2017 development capital budget includes investing approximately $30 million in this field primarily related to continued tertiary development opportunities and conformance work. 
Heidelberg Field.  Heidelberg Field is located in Mississippi and consists of an East Unit and a West Unit.  Construction of the CO2 facility, connecting pipeline and well work commenced on the West Heidelberg Unit during 2008, with our first CO2 injections into the Eutaw zone in the fourth quarter of 2008.  Our first tertiary oil production occurred in the second quarter of 2009, and we began flooding the Christmas and Tuscaloosa zones in 2013 and 2014, respectively.  During the fourth quarter of 
 14

Denbury Resources Inc.

2016, tertiary production at Heidelberg Field averaged 4,924 Bbls/d, compared to 5,635 Bbls/d in the fourth quarter of 2015.  Our future plans for Heidelberg Field include continued development of the East and West Heidelberg Units, including an expansion of our Tuscaloosa development and Christmas zone and adjustments to our CO2 floods of existing zones to better direct the CO2 through the zones and optimize oil recovery from the field, the ultimate timing of which will depend upon future oil prices or revised development plans. Our 2017 development capital budget includes investing approximately $35 million in this field, primarily related to developing portions of the Christmas Yellow sand in East Heidelberg and conformance work. 
Oyster Bayou Field.  We acquired a majority interest in Oyster Bayou Field in 2007. The field is located in southeast Texas, east of Galveston Bay, and is somewhat unique when compared to our other CO2 EOR projects because the field covers a relatively small area of 3,912 acres. We began CO2 injections into Oyster Bayou Field in the second quarter of 2010, commenced tertiary production in the fourth quarter of 2011 from the Frio A-1 zone, and booked initial proved tertiary reserves for the field in 2012.  In 2014, we completed development of the Frio A-2 zone. During the fourth quarter of 2016, tertiary production at Oyster Bayou Field averaged 4,988 Bbls/d, compared to 5,831 Bbls/d in the fourth quarter of 2015. Production from Oyster Bayou Field is believed to have peaked during 2015.
Tinsley Field.  We acquired Tinsley Field in 2006. This Mississippi field was discovered and first developed in the 1930s and is separated by different fault blocks.  As is the case with the majority of fields in Mississippi, Tinsley Field produces from multiple reservoirs.  Our CO2 enhanced oil recovery operations at Tinsley Field have thus far targeted the Woodruff formation, although there is additional potential in the Perry sandstone and other smaller reservoirs.  We commenced tertiary oil production from Tinsley Field in the second quarter of 2008 and substantially completed development of the Woodruff formation during 2014.  During the fourth quarter of 2016, average tertiary oil production from the field was 6,786 Bbls/d, compared to 7,522 Bbls/d in the fourth quarter of 2015. Although production from Tinsley Field is believed to have peaked in 2015, we continue to evaluate future potential investment opportunities in this field. Our 2017 development capital budget includes investing approximately $15 million in this field, primarily related to improvements at the recycle facility.
Future Tertiary Properties with No Tertiary Production or Proved Tertiary Reserves at December 31, 2016
Webster Field. We acquired our interest in Webster Field in the fourth quarter of 2012. The field is located in Texas, approximately eight miles northeast of our Hastings Field which we are currently flooding with CO2. At December 31, 2016, Webster Field had estimated proved non-tertiary reserves of approximately 2.6 MMBOE, net to our interest.  During the fourth quarter of 2016, non-tertiary production at Webster Field averaged 828 BOE/d, compared to 1,001 BOE/d in the fourth quarter of 2015.  Webster Field is geologically similar to our Hastings Field, producing oil from the Frio zone at similar depths; as a result, we believe it is well suited for CO2 EOR. In 2014, we completed a nine-mile lateral between the Green Pipeline and Webster Field, which will eventually deliver CO2 to the field. The timing of CO2 injections at Webster Field is primarily dependent upon future oil prices.
Conroe Field.  Conroe Field, our largest potential tertiary flood in the Gulf Coast region, is located north of Houston, Texas.  We acquired a majority interest in this field in 2009 for $271 million in cash and 11.6 million shares of Denbury common stock, for a total aggregate value of $439 million.  Conroe Field had estimated proved non-tertiary reserves of approximately 7.0 MMBOE at December 31, 2016, net to our interest, all of which are proved developed.  During the fourth quarter of 2016, production at Conroe Field averaged 2,281 BOE/d, compared to 2,889 BOE/d in the fourth quarter of 2015.
To initiate a CO2 flood at Conroe Field, a pipeline must be constructed so that CO2 can be delivered to the field.  This pipeline, which is planned as an extension of our Green Pipeline, is preliminarily estimated to cover approximately 90 miles at a cost of approximately $220 million. Our current plan for initiating a CO2 flood at Conroe Field is scheduled several years from now, the timing of which may change depending on future oil prices and pipeline construction.
Thompson Field. We acquired our interest in Thompson Field in June 2012 for $366 million. The field is located in Texas, approximately 18 miles west of our Hastings Field. Thompson Field had estimated proved non-tertiary reserves of approximately 4.0 MMBOE at December 31, 2016, net to our interest, all of which are proved developed.  During the fourth quarter of 2016, non-tertiary production at Thompson Field averaged 1,344 BOE/d net to our interest, compared to 1,508 BOE/d in the fourth quarter of 2015.  Thompson Field is geologically similar to Hastings Field, producing oil from the Frio zone at similar depths, and we therefore believe it has CO2 EOR potential. Under the terms of the Thompson Field acquisition agreement, after the initiation of CO2 injection, the seller will retain approximately a 5% gross revenue interest (less severance taxes) once average monthly oil production exceeds 3,000 Bbls/d. The timing of CO2 injections at Thompson Field is primarily dependent upon future oil prices.

CO2 Sources and Pipelines
LaBarge Field.  We acquired an overriding royalty interest equivalent to an approximate one-third ownership interest in ExxonMobil’s CO2 reserves in LaBarge Field in the fourth quarter of 2012 as part of the sale and exchange transaction with ExxonMobil. Our interest at Riley Ridge (discussed below) is also produced from the LaBarge Field. LaBarge Field is located in southwestern Wyoming.
During 2016, we received an average of approximately 63 MMcf/d of CO2 from ExxonMobil’s Shute Creek gas processing plant at LaBarge Field. Based on current capacity, and subject to availability of CO2, we currently expect that we could receive up to 115 MMcf/d of CO2 by 2021 from such plant. We pay ExxonMobil a fee to process and deliver the CO2, which we use in our Rocky Mountain region CO2 floods. As of December 31, 2016, our interest in LaBarge Field consisted of approximately 1.2 Tcf of proved CO2 reserves.
Riley Ridge. The Riley Ridge Federal Unit is also located in southwestern Wyoming and produces gas from the same LaBarge Field. We own 100% of the operating interests in Riley Ridge, as well as a gas processing facility. We acquired the Riley Ridge Federal Unit and the associated gas processing facility with the intent to separate for sale the natural gas and helium from the full well stream after construction of the gas processing facility was completed, and ultimately for the purpose of gaining a source of CO2 to utilize in flooding our fields in the Rocky Mountain region. Subsequently, issues arose related to contractor performance and design failure that caused significant delays and incremental costs to complete the facility. We placed the gas processing facility into service during the fourth quarter of 2013, and we were successful in running the facility for part of 2014 before additional issues arose related to optimal operation of the facility and sulfur build-up in the gas supply wells. In mid-2014, the gas processing facility was shut-in and to date remains shut-in. We plan to continue engineering work and analysis in 2017 to determine if there are alternative options to remediate the sulfur build-up in the gas supply wells and to assess our ability to reduce the costs thereof; however, the time of completion and results of such analysis are currently uncertain.
Other Rocky Mountain CO2 Sources.  While Riley Ridge is a potential source of CO2 for flooding our fields in the Rocky Mountain region, we have formed alternative plans to develop our future CO2 EOR floods, which CO2 volumes we currently anticipate could be supplied through existing CO2 sources. We began purchasing and receiving CO2 from the ConocoPhillips-operated Lost Cabin gas plant in central Wyoming in the first quarter of 2013, under a contract that provides us as much as 50 MMcf/d of CO2 for use in our Rocky Mountain region CO2 floods.
Greencore Pipeline.  The 20-inch Greencore Pipeline in Wyoming is the first CO2 pipeline we constructed in the Rocky Mountain region.  We plan to use the pipeline as our trunk line in the Rocky Mountain region, eventually connecting our various Rocky Mountain region CO2 sources (see Rocky Mountain Region CO2 Sources and Pipelines above) to the Cedar Creek Anticline in eastern Montana and western North Dakota. The initial 232-mile section of the Greencore Pipeline begins at the ConocoPhillips-operated Lost Cabin gas plant in Wyoming and terminates at Bell Creek Field in Montana.  We completed construction of this section of the pipeline in the fourth quarter of 2012 and received our first CO2 deliveries from the ConocoPhillips-operated Lost Cabin gas plant during the first quarter of 2013.  During the first quarter of 2014, we completed construction of an interconnect between our Greencore Pipeline and an existing third-party CO2 pipeline in Wyoming, which enables us to transport CO2 from LaBarge Field to our Bell Creek Field.
Tertiary Properties with Tertiary Production and Proved Tertiary Reserves at December 31, 2016
Bell Creek Field.  We acquired our interest in Bell Creek Field in southeast Montana as part of the Encore merger in 2010.  The oil-producing reservoir in Bell Creek Field is a sandstone reservoir with characteristics similar to those we have successfully flooded with CO2 in the Gulf Coast region. During 2013, we began first CO2 injections into Bell Creek Field, recorded our first tertiary oil production, and booked initial proved tertiary reserves. Tertiary production, net to our interest, during the fourth quarter of 2016 averaged 3,269 Bbls/d of oil, compared to 2,806 Bbls/d in the fourth quarter of 2015, as production has steadily grown from the initial production response in the third quarter of 2013.  Our 2017 development capital budget includes investing approximately $25 million in this field primarily related to expansion of the flood into new phases. We expect production from this field will continue to increase during 2017.

Future Tertiary Properties with No Tertiary Production or Proved Tertiary Reserves at December 31, 2016
Cedar Creek Anticline.  CCA is the largest potential EOR property that we own and currently our largest producing property, contributing approximately 26% of our 2016 total production. The field is primarily located in Montana but covers such a large area (approximately 126 miles) that it also extends into North Dakota.  CCA is a series of 14 different operating areas, each of which could be considered a field by itself.  We acquired our initial interest in CCA as part of the Encore merger in 2010 and acquired additional interests (the “CCA Acquisition”) from a wholly-owned subsidiary of ConocoPhillips in the first quarter of 2013 for $1.0 billion, adding 42.2 MMBOE of incremental proved reserves at that date. Production from CCA, net to our interest, averaged 15,186 BOE/d during the fourth quarter of 2016, compared to production during the fourth quarter of 2015 of 17,875 BOE/d. The non-tertiary proved reserves associated with CCA were 80.7 MMBOE, net to our interest, as of December 31, 2016.
CCA is located approximately 110 miles north of Bell Creek Field, and we currently expect to ultimately connect this field to our Greencore Pipeline.  In the future, we plan to perform minor conformance work at the field to minimize production declines, the timing of which will depend on future oil prices. Our current plan for initiating a CO2 flood at CCA is scheduled several years from now, the timing of which may change depending on future oil prices, pipeline permitting and sources and availability of CO2. In addition to the future plans to flood CCA with CO2, we are also creating plans for exploitation opportunities that exist across the field. Our 2017 development capital budget includes investing approximately $25 million in this field primarily related to field infrastructure upgrades.
Grieve Field. In the second quarter of 2011, we entered into a farm-in agreement, under which we obtained a 65% working interest in Grieve Field, located in Natrona County, Wyoming, in exchange for developing the Grieve Field CO2 flood. We completed a three-mile CO2 pipeline to deliver CO2 from an existing CO2 pipeline to Grieve Field in the fourth quarter of 2012. During the third quarter of 2016, the Company and its joint venture partner in Grieve Field reached an agreement to revise the joint venture arrangement between the parties for the continued development of the field. The revised agreement provides for our partner to fund up to $55 million of the remaining estimated capital to complete development of the facility and fieldwork in exchange for a 14% higher working interest and a disproportionate sharing of revenue from the first 2 million barrels of production. As a result of this agreement, our working interest in the field was reduced from 65% to 51%. This arrangement will accelerate the remaining development of the facility and fieldwork, and we currently anticipate first tertiary production by the middle of 2018.
Hartzog Draw Field. We acquired our interest in Hartzog Draw Field in the fourth quarter of 2012. The field is located in the Powder River Basin of northeastern Wyoming, approximately 12 miles from our Greencore Pipeline. Hartzog Draw Field had estimated proved reserves of approximately 3.2 MMBOE at December 31, 2016, net to our interest, 1.0 MMBOE of which relate to the natural gas producing Big George coal zone.  During the fourth quarter of 2016, non-tertiary production averaged 1,665 BOE/d, compared to 2,212 BOE/d in the fourth quarter of 2015. We successfully completed 5 wells in Hartzog Draw Field in 2014; however, we have temporarily suspended the non-tertiary development of Hartzog Draw Field in light of the recent oil price environment. We believe the oil reservoir characteristics of Hartzog Draw Field make it well suited for CO2 EOR in the future. We currently plan to initiate a CO2 flood at Hartzog Draw Field several years from now, the timing of which is dependent on future oil prices.
Other Non-Tertiary Oil Properties
Despite the majority of our oil and natural gas properties discussed above consisting of either existing or planned future tertiary floods, we do also produce oil and natural gas either from fields in both our Gulf Coast and Rocky Mountain regions that are not amenable to EOR or from specific reservoirs (within an existing tertiary field) that are not amenable to EOR. For example, at Heidelberg Field, we produce natural gas from the Selma Chalk reservoir, which is separate from the Christmas and Eutaw reservoirs currently being flooded with CO2. Continuing production from these other non-tertiary properties totaled 2,035 BOE/d during the fourth quarter of 2016, compared to 3,444 BOE/d during the fourth quarter of 2015.
OIL AND GAS ACREAGE, PRODUCTIVE WELLS AND DRILLING ACTIVITY
In the data below, “gross” represents the total acres or wells in which we own a working interest and “net” represents the gross acres or wells multiplied by our working interest percentage.  For the wells that produce both oil and gas, the well is typically classified as an oil or natural gas well based on the ratio of oil to natural gas production.

well, a service well or a stratigraphic test well.  A development well is a well drilled within the proved area of an oil or gas reservoir to the depth of a stratigraphic horizon known to be productive.

(2) | A productive well is an exploratory or development well found to be capable of producing either oil or natural gas in sufficient quantities to justify completion as an oil or natural gas well.


(3) | A non-productive well is an exploratory or development well that is not a productive well.


(4) | During 2016, 2015 and 2014, an additional 1, 6 and 43 wells, respectively, were drilled for water or CO2 injection purposes.

PRODUCTION AND UNIT PRICES
Further information regarding average production rates, unit sales prices and unit costs per BOE are set forth under Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Results of Operations – Operating Results Table, included herein.
TITLE TO PROPERTIES
As is customary in the oil and natural gas industry, Denbury conducts a limited title examination at the time of its acquisition of properties or leasehold interests targeted for enhanced recovery, and curative work is performed with respect to significant defects on higher-value properties of the greatest significance. We believe that title to our oil and natural gas properties is good and defensible, subject only to such exceptions that we believe do not materially interfere with the use of such properties, including encumbrances, easements, restrictions and royalty, overriding royalty and other similar interests.
SIGNIFICANT OIL AND GAS PURCHASERS AND PRODUCT MARKETING
Oil and natural gas sales are made on a day-to-day basis or under short-term contracts at the current area market price. We would not expect the loss of any single purchaser to have a material adverse effect upon our operations; however, the loss of a large single purchaser could potentially reduce the competition for our oil and natural gas production, which in turn could negatively impact the prices we receive.  For the year ended December 31, 2016, two purchasers accounted for 10% or more of our oil and natural gas revenues: Plains Marketing LP (20%) and Marathon Petroleum Company (14%). For the year ended December 31, 2015, two purchasers accounted for 10% or more of our oil and natural gas revenues: Marathon Petroleum Company (28%) and Plains Marketing LP (15%). For the year ended December 31, 2014, three purchasers accounted for 10% or more of our oil and natural gas revenues: Marathon Petroleum Company (31%), Plains Marketing LP (13%), and ConocoPhillips (12%).
Our ability to market oil and natural gas depends on many factors beyond our control, including the extent of domestic production and imports of oil and natural gas, the proximity of our oil and natural gas production to pipelines and corresponding markets, the available capacity in such pipelines, the demand for oil and natural gas, the effects of weather, and the effects of state and federal regulation.  As of December 31, 2016, we have not experienced significant difficulty in finding a market for all of our production as it becomes available or in transporting our production to those markets; however, there is no assurance that we will always be able to market all of our production or obtain favorable prices.
Oil Marketing
Prices received in a regional market fluctuate frequently and can differ from NYMEX pricing due to a variety of reasons, including supply and/or demand factors, crude oil quality and location differentials. The oil differentials we received in the Gulf Coast and Rocky Mountain regions are discussed in further detail below.
Crude oil prices in the Gulf Coast region are impacted significantly by the changes in prices received for our crude oil sold under Light Louisiana Sweet (“LLS”) index prices relative to the change in NYMEX prices. Overall, during 2016, we sold approximately 60% of our crude oil at prices based on, or partially tied to, the LLS index price, and the balance at prices based on various other indexes tied to NYMEX prices, primarily in the Rocky Mountain region. The average LLS-to-NYMEX differential (on a trade-month basis) was a positive $1.70 per Bbl during 2016, compared to a positive $3.72 per Bbl during 2015 and a positive $3.88 per Bbl in 2014. During 2016, our light sweet crude oil production in the Gulf Coast region, on average, sold for $1.38 per Bbl below NYMEX, compared to $0.56 per Bbl over NYMEX in 2015 and $1.80 per Bbl over NYMEX in 2014.  Our current markets at various sales points along the Gulf Coast have sufficient demand to accommodate our production, but there can be no assurance of future demand. We are, therefore, monitoring the marketplace for opportunities to strategically enter into long-term marketing arrangements.
The marketing of our Rocky Mountain region oil production is dependent on transportation through local pipelines to market centers in Guernsey, Wyoming; Clearbrook, Minnesota; Wood River, Illinois; and most recently Cushing, Oklahoma.  Shipments on some of the pipelines are at or near capacity and may be subject to apportionment.  We currently have access to, or have 
 20

Denbury Resources Inc.

contracted for, sufficient pipeline capacity to move our oil production; however, there can be no assurance that we will be allocated sufficient pipeline capacity to move all of our oil production in the future.  Because local demand for production is small in comparison to current production levels, much of the production in the Rocky Mountain region is transported to markets outside of the region. Therefore, prices in the Rocky Mountain region are further influenced by fluctuations in prices (primarily Brent and LLS) in coastal markets and by available pipeline capacity in the Midwest and Cushing markets. For the year ended December 31, 2016, the discount for our oil production in the Rocky Mountain region averaged $3.97 per Bbl, compared to $5.60 per Bbl during 2015 and $10.19 per Bbl during 2014.
Natural Gas Marketing
We have minimal natural gas production, as 96% of our 2016 average daily production was oil. Virtually all of our natural gas production in the Gulf Coast region is close to existing pipelines; consequently, we generally have a variety of options to market our natural gas.  However, our natural gas production in the Rocky Mountain region, like our oil production, is dependent on, among other factors, limited transportation options that can affect our ability to find markets for it.  We sell the majority of our natural gas on one-year contracts, with prices fluctuating month to month based on published pipeline indices and with slight premiums or discounts to the index.
COMPETITION AND MARKETS
We face competition from other oil and natural gas companies in all aspects of our business, including acquisition of producing properties, oil and gas leases, drilling rights, and CO2 properties; marketing of oil and natural gas; and obtaining and maintaining goods, services and labor.  Many of our competitors have substantially larger financial and other resources.  Factors that affect our ability to acquire producing properties include available liquidity, available information about prospective properties and our expectations for earning a minimum projected return on our investments.  Because of the primary nature of our core assets (our tertiary operations) and our ownership of relatively uncommon significant natural sources of CO2 in the Gulf Coast and Rocky Mountain regions, we believe that we are effective in competing in the market and have less competition than our peers in certain aspects of our business.
The demand for qualified and experienced field personnel to drill wells and conduct field operations and for geologists, geophysicists, engineers and other professionals in the oil and gas industry can fluctuate significantly, often in correlation with commodity prices, causing periodic shortages in such personnel.  Prior to the recent downturn in oil prices, the competition for qualified technical personnel had been extensive, and our personnel costs escalated. There were also periods with shortages of drilling rigs and other equipment, as demand for rigs and equipment has increased along with the number of wells being drilled.  These factors also cause significant increases in costs for equipment, services and personnel.  We cannot be certain when we will experience these issues, and these types of shortages or price increases could significantly decrease our profit margin, cash flow and operating results, and cause significant delays in our development operations.
FEDERAL AND STATE REGULATIONS
Numerous federal, state and local laws and regulations govern the oil and gas industry.  Additions or changes to these laws and regulations are often made in response to the current political or economic environment. Compliance with the evolving regulatory landscape is often difficult, and substantial penalties may be incurred for noncompliance. Additionally, the future annual cost of complying with all laws and regulations applicable to our operations is uncertain and will be ultimately determined by several factors, including future changes to legal and regulatory requirements. Management believes that continued compliance with existing laws and regulations applicable to our operations and future compliance therewith will not have a materially adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows, although such laws and regulations, and compliance therewith, could cause significant delays or otherwise impede operations, which may, among other things, cause our expected production rates and cash flows to be less than anticipated.
The following sections describe some specific laws and regulations that may affect us.  We cannot predict the cost or impact of these or other future legislative or regulatory initiatives.
Regulation of Natural Gas and Oil Exploration and Production
Our operations are subject to various types of regulation at the federal, state and local levels.  Such regulation includes requiring permits for drilling wells; maintaining bonding requirements in order to drill or operate wells and regulating the location of wells; 
 21

Denbury Resources Inc.

the method of drilling and casing wells; the surface use and restoration of properties upon which wells are drilled; the plugging and abandoning of wells; and the composition or disposal of chemicals and fluids used in connection with operations.  Our operations are also subject to various conservation laws and regulations.  These include regulation of the size of drilling, spacing or proration units and the density of wells that may be drilled in those units, and the unitization or pooling of oil and gas properties.  In addition, federal and state conservation laws, which establish maximum rates of production from oil and gas wells, generally prohibit or restrict the venting or flaring of natural gas and impose certain requirements regarding the ratability of production.  The effect of these laws and regulations may limit the amount of oil and natural gas we can produce from our wells and may limit the number of wells or the locations at which we can drill.  Regulatory requirements and compliance relative to the oil and gas industry increase our costs of doing business and, consequently, affect our profitability.
Federal Regulation of Sales Prices and Transportation
The transportation of, and certain sales with respect to, natural gas in interstate commerce are heavily regulated by agencies of the U.S. federal government and are affected by, among other things, the availability, terms and cost of transportation.  Notably, the price and terms of access to pipeline transportation are subject to extensive U.S. federal and state regulation.  The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (“FERC”) is continually proposing and implementing new and/or modified rules and regulations affecting the natural gas industry, some of which may adversely affect the availability and reliability of interruptible transportation service on interstate pipelines.  While our sales of crude oil, condensate and natural gas liquids are not currently subject to FERC regulation, our ability to transport and sell such products is dependent on certain pipelines whose rates, terms and conditions of service are subject to FERC regulation.  Additional proposals and proceedings that might affect the natural gas industry are considered from time to time by Congress, FERC, state regulatory bodies and the courts, and we cannot predict when or if any such proposals or proceedings might become effective and their effect or impact, if any, on our operations.
Federal Energy and Climate Change Legislation and Regulation
The Pipeline Safety, Regulatory Certainty and Job Creation Act of 2011, among other things, updated federal pipeline safety standards, increased penalties for violations of such standards, gave the Department of Transportation’s Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (the “PHMSA”) authority for new damage prevention and incident notification, and directed the PHMSA to prescribe new minimum safety standards for CO2 pipelines, which safety standards could affect our operations and the costs thereof. While the PHMSA has adopted or proposed to adopt a number of new regulations to implement this act, no new minimum safety standards have been proposed or adopted for CO2 pipelines.
Both federal and state authorities have in recent years proposed new regulations to limit the emission of greenhouse gasses as part of climate change initiatives.  For example, both the EPA and BLM have issued regulations for the control of methane emissions. The EPA has promulgated regulations requiring permitting for certain sources of greenhouse gas emissions, and in May 2016, promulgated final regulations to reduce methane and volatile organic compound emissions from the oil and gas sector. Enforcement of these regulations may impose additional costs related to compliance with new emission limits, as well as inspections and maintenance of several types of equipment used in our operations. Conversely, on February 3, 2017, the U.S. House of Representatives approved a resolution to void a Bureau of Land Management rule restricting methane venting and flaring, which must be approved by the U.S. Senate and signed by the President to take effect. 
Natural Gas Gathering Regulations
State and federal regulation of natural gas gathering facilities generally includes various safety, environmental and, in some circumstances, nondiscriminatory-take requirements.  With the increase in construction and operation of natural gas gathering lines in various states, natural gas gathering is receiving greater regulatory scrutiny from state and federal regulatory agencies, which is likely to continue in the future.
Federal, State or Indian Leases
Our operations on federal, state or Indian oil and gas leases, especially those in the Rocky Mountain region, are subject to numerous restrictions, including nondiscrimination statutes. Such operations must be conducted pursuant to certain on-site security regulations and other permits and authorizations issued by the Bureau of Land Management, the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement, the Bureau of Indian Affairs, and other federal and state stakeholder agencies.

Environmental Regulations
Our oil and natural gas production, saltwater disposal operations, injection of CO2, and the processing, handling and disposal of materials such as hydrocarbons and naturally occurring radioactive materials (“NORM”) are subject to stringent regulation.  We could incur significant costs, including cleanup costs resulting from a release of product, third-party claims for property damage and personal injuries, or penalties and other sanctions as a result of any violations or liabilities under environmental laws and regulations or other laws and regulations applicable to our operations.  Changes in, or more stringent enforcement of, environmental laws and other laws applicable to our operations could also result in delays or additional operating costs and capital expenditures.
Various federal, state and local laws and regulations controlling the discharge of materials into the environment, or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment and human health, directly impact our oil and gas exploration, development and production operations.  These include, among others, (1) regulations adopted by the EPA and various state agencies regarding approved methods of disposal for certain hazardous and nonhazardous wastes; (2) the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act and analogous state laws that regulate the removal or remediation of previously disposed wastes (including wastes disposed of or released by prior owners or operators), property contamination (including groundwater contamination), and remedial plugging operations to prevent future contamination; (3) the Clean Air Act and comparable state and local requirements already applicable to our operations and new restrictions on air emissions from our operations, including greenhouse gas emissions and those that could discourage the production of fossil fuels that, when used, ultimately release CO2; (4) the Oil Pollution Act of 1990, which contains numerous requirements relating to the prevention of, and response to, oil spills into waters of the United States; (5) the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, which is the principal federal statute governing the treatment, storage and disposal of hazardous wastes; (6) the Endangered Species Act and counterpart state legislation, which protects certain species (and their related habitats), including certain species that could be present on our leases, as threatened or endangered; and (7) state regulations and statutes governing the handling, treatment, storage and disposal of NORM and other wastes.
In the Rocky Mountain Region, federal agencies’ actions based upon their environmental review responsibilities under the National Environmental Policy Act can significantly impact the scope and timing of hydrocarbon development by slowing the timing of individual applications for permits to drill and requests for rights-of-way, and delaying large scale planning associated with region-level resource management plans and project-level master development plans. Given the Trump administration’s announced intention to revise or rescind federal regulations promulgated during the Obama administration and to promote fossil fuel development on federal lands, it is possible that there could be an increase in litigation initiated by environmental or citizens groups, state attorneys general, or other elected or appointed officials.
Management believes that we are currently in substantial compliance with existing applicable environmental laws and regulations, and does not currently anticipate that future compliance will have a materially adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows, although such laws and regulations, and compliance therewith, could cause significant delays or otherwise impede operations, which may, among other things, cause our expected production rates and cash flows to be less than anticipated.
Hydraulic Fracturing
During 2016, we fracture stimulated one water source well at Tinsley Field utilizing water-based fluids with no diesel fuel component. We are currently evaluating the potential to refrac approximately five wells at Hartzog Draw Field during 2017. We are familiar with the laws and regulations applicable to hydraulic fracturing operations and take steps to ensure compliance with these requirements.
