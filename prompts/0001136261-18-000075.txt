ITEM 1. BUSINESS
 Overview We are a specialty pharmaceutical company focused on improving patients' lives by identifying, developing and commercializing differentiated products that address unmet medical needs.  We target underserved segments, such as central nervous system (CNS) indications, including pain, neurology, and psychiatry, as well as other specialty therapeutic areas.  We promote our core branded products to physicians through our sales force of 74 Sales Specialists and distribute our generic products through our wholly owned subsidiaries, Macoven Pharmaceuticals, LLC (Macoven) and Cypress Pharmaceuticals, Inc. ® (Cypress). We have a portfolio of approved products that address medical needs in several therapeutic areas, including: 
Chronic Pain: Zohydro® ER (hydrocodone bitartrate) with BeadTekTM, an extended-release opioid agonist indicated for the management of pain
severe enough to require daily, around-the-clock, long-term opioid treatment for which alternative treatment options are inadequate;
Insomnia:  Silenor® (doxepin), the only non-narcotic, non-scheduled and non-addictive prescription sleep aid for the treatment of insomnia
characterized by difficulty with sleep maintenance; and
Migraine:  Treximet® (sumatriptan/naproxen sodium), a fixed dose combination product indicated for the treatment of acute migraine; 
 Our strategy is to continue to create shareholder value by: 
Growing or maintaining sales of the existing products in our portfolio in various ways, including identifying new growth opportunities; and 
Acquiring additional marketed specialty products or products close to regulatory approval to leverage our existing expertise and infrastructure.
 On January 4, 2018, we committed to and commenced a realignment plan to reduce operating costs and better align our workforce with the needs of our business in anticipation of the expiration of certain patents related to our Treximet® fixed dose combination product. We completed the realignment plan on January 5, 2018, resulting in a reduction of our workforce by 41 employees (representing approximately 22% of our workforce), the majority of which were associated with our sales force and commercial infrastructure. In connection with this commercial reorganization, we expect to realize annualized cost savings of $7.0 million - $8.0 million beginning in the first quarter of 2018. We anticipate recording a one-time charge of approximately $1.0 million during the first quarter of 2018 as a result of this realignment.  3  
Our Products and Product Candidates Pernix-Promoted Products  Zohydro ER with BeadTek  Zohydro ER with BeadTek is indicated for the management of pain severe enough to require daily, around-the-clock, long-term opioid treatment and for which alternative treatment options are inadequate. Zohydro ER does not contain acetaminophen, unlike many immediate-release hydrocodone products, reducing the risk for potential liver toxicity due to overexposure of acetaminophen. Zohydro ER with BeadTek has six dosage strengths; 10 mg, 15 mg, 20 mg, 30 mg, 40 mg and 50 mg. On January 30, 2015, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved this updated formulation that features BeadTek, a technology encompassing an indistinguishable mix of inactive beads, active immediate-release hydrocodone beads and active extended-release hydrocodone beads. Zohydro ER with BeadTek delivers an extended release of hydrocodone that provides 12-hour dose duration. When taken as directed, the inactive beads contained in Zohydro ER with BeadTek remain inert. The inactive beads dissolve independently of the active hydrocodone beads and are designed not to change the 12-hour release properties of the medication when taken as directed. However, a viscous gel forms when the inactive beads are crushed and dissolved in liquids or solvents.  It is estimated that about 100 million Americans suffer from chronic pain, defined as pain that lasts longer than three months. Chronic pain can be mild or excruciating, episodic or continuous, merely inconvenient or totally incapacitating. With chronic pain, signals of pain remain active in the nervous system for months or even years. This can take both a physical and emotional toll on a person. The most common sources of pain stem from lower back pain, joint pain or pain from injury. Other kinds of chronic pain include pain affecting specific parts of the body, such as the shoulders, pelvis, and neck. Generalized muscle or nerve pain can also develop into a chronic condition. Chronic pain may originate with an initial trauma/injury or infection, or there may be an ongoing cause of pain. Some people suffer chronic pain in the absence of any past injury or evidence of body damage. Chronic pain is complex, so there are many treatment options including opioid pain medications such as Zohydro ER with BeadTek. We believe Zohydro ER with BeadTek is a good option for patients who have pain severe enough to require daily, around-the-clock, long-term opioid treatment and for which alternative treatment options are inadequate because of its true 12-hour formulation ensuring patients are able to get pain control without the risk of end of dose failure.  We promote Zohydro ER with BeadTek in the United States through our nationwide specialty sales force, which covers 74 territories. In April 2015, we acquired the Zohydro ER franchise from Zogenix, Inc. (Zogenix). Zohydro ER with BeadTek is manufactured by and licensed from Recro Pharma, Inc. (Recro).  Prior to our acquisition of the Zohydro ER franchise, Zogenix was responsible for all commercialization activities in the U.S.  During this time, Zogenix paid milestones and royalties on sales to Alkermes plc. On March 3, 2015, Alkermes announced the sale of the manufacturing facility and royalty revenue associated with Zohydro ER to Recro. Recro is our supplier of the commercial product for distribution in the U.S.   Zohydro ER with BeadTek is covered by 13 issued U.S. patents, which our subsidiary, Pernix Ireland Pain Designated Activity Company (PIP DAC) (formerly known as Pernix Ireland Pain Ltd. (PIPL)) either owns or has rights to.  Two of these patents expire November 1, 2019, seven expire July 25, 2033 and four expire September 12, 2034. Net revenues of Zohydro were $24.0 million and $24.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. In May 2017, we announced that, due to a manufacturing issue with our supplier, we expect that the 20mg strength of Zohydro ER with BeadTek will be on back order until at least the first quarter of 2018. During this time, we have continued to market and distribute other strengths of Zohydro ER with BeadTek, including the 10 mg, 15 mg, 30 mg, 40 mg and 50 mg strengths. While utilization of the 10mg, 15mg and 30mg strengths have increased, we believe that the temporary stock out of the 20 mg strength has impacted the overall prescription volume for Zohydro ER with BeadTek, resulting in a loss of revenue and adverse effect on our financial condition.   Silenor (doxepin) Silenor is the only non-narcotic, non-scheduled and non-addictive prescription sleep aid for the treatment of insomnia characterized by difficulty with sleep maintenance.  Silenor is marketed as an oral tablet formulation and is available in 3 mg and 6 mg dosage forms. Doxepin, the active ingredient in Silenor, binds to H1 receptors in the brain and blocks histamine, which is believed to play an important role in the regulation of sleep.  Doxepin has been marketed and used for over 35 years at dosages ranging from 75 mg to 300 mg for the treatment of anxiety and depression, but has historically not been used to treat insomnia due to undesirable next-day residual effects. Silenor, which uses doxepin at much lower dosages, does not exhibit the same pharmacological effects as high-dose doxepin.  4   In four separate Phase III clinical trials, Silenor demonstrated a favorable safety and tolerability profile, including a low dropout rate and an adverse event profile comparable to placebo.  Silenor demonstrated no clinically meaningful next-day residual effects and no evidence of amnesia, complex sleep behaviors, hallucinations, tolerance or withdrawal effects.  Silenor was approved by the FDA in March 2010 for the treatment of insomnia characterized by difficulty with sleep maintenance and was launched commercially in the United States in September 2010 by Pernix Sleep, Inc. (f/k/a Somaxon Pharmaceuticals, Inc.) (Pernix Sleep). We acquired the Silenor product line as a result of our merger with Somaxon Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Somaxon) on March 6, 2013, and we launched Silenor in the second quarter of 2013. The current market-leading prescription products for the treatment of insomnia include: GABA-receptor agonists, which are classified by the FDA as Schedule IV controlled substances; melatonin agonists; hypnotic benzodiazepines; and sedating antidepressants.  Currently, the most widely-prescribed products for the treatment of insomnia include GABA-receptor agonists such as: zolpidem (Ambien®); zolpidem tartrate extended-release tablets (Ambien CR®), a controlled-release formulation of Ambien; eszopiclone (Lunesta®); and zalepon (Sonata®) and Belsomra® (suvorexant), an orexin receptor antagonist.  In addition, melatonin agonists such as ramelteon (Rozerem®), hypnotic benzodiazepines, such as temazapam (Restoril®) and flurazepam (Dalmane®), and sedating antidepressants such as trazodone (Desyrel®) are used to treat insomnia.  Our market research indicated that the market is underserved due in large part to characteristics associated with many of these products, such as next-day grogginess, memory impairment, amnesia, hallucinations, physical and psychological dependence, complex sleep behaviors such as sleep driving, hormonal changes and gastrointestinal effects. We believe that Silenor offers many benefits, including improved safety, tolerability and efficacy in the treatment of sleep maintenance.  Unlike many of the other insomnia treatments currently available, Silenor is not designated as a controlled substance, and according to its FDA-approved labeling, Silenor does not appear to have any potential for dependency, addiction or abuse. Because Silenor is not a controlled substance, it can be made available to physicians, facilitating initial physician and patient trials without the additional sampling regulation that applies to controlled substances. As a result of the numerous benefits presented by Silenor, the limitations of other current therapies, and because it is the first and only nonscheduled prescription sleep medication approved by the FDA for the treatment of insomnia characterized by difficulty with sleep maintenance, we believe that Silenor has the potential for increased growth in the market.  In addition, for these reasons, we believe Silenor is an attractive candidate for the over-the-counter (OTC) market. We are engaged in life-cycle management activities relating to Silenor, including the assessment of OTC opportunities such as potential out-licensing transactions. We also continue to review and assess options for internal development. We promote Silenor in the United States through a nationwide specialty sales force, which covers 74 territories. We market and sell Silenor through Paladin Labs (a division of Endo Pharmaceuticals plc) in Canada, and are currently working with CJ Healthcare Corporation, which launched Silenor in South Korea in 2015.  Silenor is covered by eight issued U.S. patents, the latest expiring 2030, five of which are exclusively licensed from ProCom One, Inc. (ProCom).  Four companies filed abbreviated new drug applications (ANDAs) with the FDA seeking approval to market a generic version of Silenor, which resulted in all four companies being permitted to launch in 2020. We have an exclusive supply agreement with JRS Pharma L.P. for the exclusive use of ProSolv®HD90, an ingredient used in our formulation for Silenor, in combination with doxepin.  Mylan is our supplier of commercial product for distribution in the U.S. Net revenues of Silenor were $22.3 million and $16.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Treximet (sumatriptan/naproxen sodium) Treximet is the only fixed dose combination product approved by the FDA to treat acute migraines.  Sumatriptan, one of the two active ingredients in Treximet, belongs to the triptan class used for the treatment of migraine headaches.  Naproxen sodium, the other active ingredient in Treximet, is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) used to relieve pain from various conditions such as headaches, muscle aches, tendonitis, dental pain, and menstrual cramps, as well as pain, swelling, and joint stiffness caused by arthritis, bursitis, and gout attacks.  Treximet was approved in April 2008 for acute migraine attacks, with or without aura, in adults.  The product is a unique formulation of sumatriptan and naproxen sodium that employs the patented formulation technology owned by Aralez Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (formerly POZEN Inc.) (Aralez) and the RT Technology™ of GlaxoSmithKline's (GSK). We believe this unique combination provides a synergistic therapeutic effect.  The triptan component shrinks the swollen blood vessels in the head, which has been demonstrated to provide relief of migraine pain.  The NSAID component inhibits the enzyme responsible for the production of prostaglandins, which are the mediators of pain and inflammation.  This dual mechanism of action of Treximet has been shown to provide superior sustained pain relief compared to placebo and to both of the active ingredients alone. In clinical trials, Treximet demonstrated significantly greater pain relief at two hours compared to sumatriptan 85mg or naproxen sodium 500 mg alone.  In addition, Treximet provided more patients with sustained migraine pain relief from two to 24 hours compared to the individual components alone.  5   Migraines are a common and disabling neurologic condition that affect an estimated 17% of females and 6% of males in the United States.  Based on current U.S. census data, there are over 28 million individuals in the U.S. who suffer from migraines.  A variety of medications have been specifically designed to treat migraines.  Medications used to combat migraines fall into two broad categories: acute or abortive medications; and preventative or prophylactic medications.  Triptans, which are the most commonly prescribed class of drugs for acute migraine, are available as oral pills, nasal sprays, injections and tablets that dissolve under the tongue.  NSAIDs, such as ibuprofen and naproxen, are also used to treat acute migraine.  Treximet is an acute medication that combines the benefits of both of these commonly used classes of drugs.  Migraines have an estimated prevalence of 8% to 23% in adolescents 11 years of age and older.  Acute and prophylactic treatments are similar to those used for adults.  Sumatriptan is the most widely studied triptan in adolescents.  In clinical trials to date, sumatriptan has failed to demonstrate efficacy versus placebo, primarily as a result of a high placebo response.  Currently medical providers and patients have limited options for the treatment of acute migraine attacks with or without aura approved for use in this population.  We believe Treximet has the potential to meet this void. On May 15, 2015, we announced that the FDA had approved Treximet for use in pediatric patients 12 years of age and older for the acute treatment of migraine with or without aura and we began to market and sell Treximet for pediatric patients in October 2016. In August 2014, we, through our wholly owned subsidiary, Pernix Ireland Limited (PIL) acquired the U.S. intellectual property rights to Treximet from GSK, as well as GSK's royalty obligation to Aralez. Treximet is exclusively licensed to us by GSK for U.S. marketing, sales and distribution. We originally promoted Treximet in the United States through our nationwide specialty sales force.  After the sales force restructure on January 4, 2018, we are no longer promoting Treximet with a sales force. We currently have two qualified suppliers of Treximet.  Treximet is covered by five patents in the U.S.  Including six months of pediatric exclusivity, four of the patents expired on February 14, 2018, and one expires on April 2, 2026.  Six companies filed ANDAs with the FDA seeking approval to market a generic version of Treximet, three of which are permitted to launch in 2018 and three other generics enjoined from launching until 2026. On February 14, 2018, four patents covering Treximet expired, enabling up to three generic competitors to enter the market. As of February 28, 2018, one of these competitors entered the market and we are expecting the other two competitors to enter later in 2018. Concurrent with the launch of generics by third parties, we launched an authorized generic version of Treximet. We will also continue to distribute the branded versions of Treximet. We have one additional patent that covers Treximet that will expire in 2026 that we expect to prevent additional generic competitors from entering the market until that time. We expect that generic competition for Treximet will negatively impact our net revenues for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2018. Net revenues of Treximet for the year ended December 31, 2016 were negatively impacted by $15.3 million of disputed rebate claims, which were recorded during the year ended December 31, 2016, for sales which occurred in prior periods ($12.5 million and $2.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively) related to the unfavorable arbitration ruling in our dispute with GSK. There was no impact on 2017 net revenues as a result of this ruling.  The following table sets forth the impact of the GSK arbitration award on net revenues of Treximet (in thousands): 
 | | Year Ended December 31,
--------------------------------------+---+------------------------
 | | 2017 | | 2016 | | 2015 | | 2014 
GAAP net revenues of Treximet | $ | 68,405 | $ | 66,961 | $ | 101,753 | $ | 54,775 
GSK arbitration award adjustment | | - | | 15,277 | | (12,484) | | (2,793)
Adjusted net revenues of Treximet (1) | $ | 68,405 | $ | 82,238 | $ | 89,269 | $ | 51,982 


(1) | Adjusted net revenues of Treximet is a non-generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) financial measure that adjusts GAAP net revenues of Treximet for the impact of the GSK arbitration award for the year ended December 31, 2016 and reclassifies it to the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 and, therefore, has not been calculated in accordance with GAAP. We believe that this non-GAAP financial measure provides meaningful supplemental information regarding our operating results because it reclassifies the gross-to-net adjustments that were the subject of the GSK arbitration award to the years (2015 and 2014) in which the sales directly related to the gross-to-net adjustments actually occurred. See further discussion under the heading "Non-GAAP Financial Measures" in Part II, Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Externally Promoted and Non-Promoted Products  We market and sell our non-core products, including generics, through our wholly owned subsidiaries, Cypress and Macoven.  We also market our non-promoted products through distributors and trade partners.  Through our Macoven entity, we had distributed a combination product called isometheptene mucate, dichlorphenazone, and acetaminophen, or IDA, which was originally approved in 1948 by the FDA, for safety only. The product's efficacy as an adjunct treatment for peptic ulcer disease, as well as other medical conditions, such as migraine headaches, was reviewed under the FDA's Drug Efficacy Study Implementation process, DESI notice 3265. We received a letter from the FDA dated October 19, 2017, asserting that IDA was subject to DESI 3265 and that any drug products identified in DESI 3265, including IDA, require an approved new drug application (NDA) or an abbreviated new drug application (ANDA) in order for them to continue to be distributed. Since we have not obtained an NDA or ANDA for IDA, the FDA directed that we should immediately cease distribution of IDA. While IDA has a long history of safe use, we complied with the FDA's request and confirmed with the FDA within its requested time frame that we ceased distribution of the product. For the year ended December 31, 2017, our net revenues from the sale of IDA were $14.9 million. As we will not have further revenues from the product in 2018, the discontinuance of the product will impact net revenues for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2018. Research and Development Our current development projects include potential line extensions.  We intend to be opportunistic in exploiting our in-house expertise and intellectual property to initiate additional low-risk development projects.  In addition, we will look for external opportunities through in-licensing, collaborations or partnerships to build our pipeline.  We are currently reviewing alternatives for a Prescription -to-Over-The-Counter (OTC) switch for Silenor. We held a pre-IND meeting with the FDA in June 2015, during which we received clarity from the FDA on the development activities that would be required to seek approval to market Silenor in the U.S. OTC market. Specifically, the FDA advised us that the results of preclinical studies to assess the abuse potential of Silenor, a label comprehension study, a driving study, a self-selection study and an actual use trial, among other things, would be needed as part of an NDA submission. Based upon our interactions with clinical research organizations (CROs) and potential out-licensing partners, we believe that it could take approximately four to five years to complete the development work needed to file an NDA and seek approval to market Silenor as an over-the counter (OTC) product.  For the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, we recorded $787,000 and $6.1 million, respectively, in research and development expenses.  Sales and Marketing  On January 4, 2018, we committed to and commenced a realignment plan to reduce operating costs and better align our workforce with the needs of our business in anticipation of the expiration of certain patents related to our Treximet® fixed dose combination product. We completed the realignment plan on January 5, 2018, resulting in a reduction of our workforce by 41 employees (representing approximately 22% of our workforce), the majority of which were associated with our sales force and commercial infrastructure. Our commercial activities in the United States are dedicated to our marketed products Zohydro ER with BeadTek and Silenor. Our commercial team also provides support for sales of certain of our other products from time to time. We currently sell our products through our nationwide sales force, which consists of approximately 74 territories. Our teams of experienced sales professionals discuss our products with Healthcare Providers (HCPs), such as prescribers, in specialties appropriate for each marketed product. Our commercial activities include marketing, managed care contracting and related services and commercial support services. We also employ third-party vendors, such as advertising agencies, market research firms and suppliers of marketing and other sales support-related services, to assist with our commercial activities. We currently have a relatively small number of sales representatives compared with the number of sales representatives of most other pharmaceutical companies with marketed products. Each of our sales representatives is responsible for a territory of significant size. We believe that the size of our sales force is appropriate to reach our target audience for our marketed products in the specialty markets in which we currently operate.  Continued growth of our current products and the launch of any future products may require expansion of our sales forces and sales support organization in the United States and internationally, and we may need to commit significant additional funds, management and other resources to the growth of our sales organization.  7  
GSK Arbitration, Restructuring and Business Development GSK Arbitration Update  We were involved in an arbitration proceeding with Glaxo Group Limited, GlaxoSmithKline LLC, GlaxoSmithKline Intellectual Property Holdings Limited, and GlaxoSmithKline Intellectual Property Management Limited (collectively, 
GSK). GSK claimed that we owed GSK damages relating to an alleged breach by us of a covenant contained in the Asset Purchase and Sale Agreement (APSA), dated as of May 13, 2014 by and among GSK and us pertaining to a pre-existing customer agreement. We asserted counterclaims and defenses under the APSA and also asserted claims against GSK related to breaches of a supply agreement between the parties. We and GSK entered into an interim settlement agreement (the Interim Settlement Agreement) under which we agreed to make payments to GSK and escrow additional funds. Additionally, the parties agreed to submit the matter to binding arbitration.  On January 31, 2017, the arbitration tribunal issued opinions in favor of GSK, awarding it damages and fees in the amount of approximately $35 million, plus interest (estimated to be approximately $2 to $5 million). The tribunal also denied our claim that GSK breached its obligations under the supply agreement. We had already paid to GSK an aggregate of $16.5 million, including $6.2 million from the escrow account, which will offset the total award. After discussions with GSK, an agreement was reached on March 17, 2017, to amend the Interim Settlement Agreement with GSK whereby we agreed to establish a payment schedule for satisfaction of the current balance of the award. Pursuant to the amendment, we agreed that the outstanding balance as of the date of the amendment was approximately $21.5 million to GSK and we agreed to make quarterly installments in amounts totaling $1.0 million in 2017, $3.5 million in 2018 and approximately $17.0 million in 2019. We recorded the fair value of this settlement in the amount of approximately $18.5 million in our financial statements at December 31, 2016 and recorded $15.3 million as a reduction to net revenues, $1.0 million to selling, general and administrative expense and $2.2 million to interest expense in the year ended December 31, 2016.  On July 20, 2017, we and GSK entered into Amendment No. 2 to the Interim Settlement Agreement.  Amendment No. 2 supersedes Amendment No. 1 and permitted payment by us to GSK of a reduced amount in full satisfaction of the remaining approximately $21.2 million unpaid portion of the award granted to GSK in the arbitration of certain matters previously disputed by the parties.  Pursuant to Amendment No. 2, we were obligated to make two fixed payments to GSK: (i) a payment of $3.45 million due on or before August 4, 2017 and (ii) a payment of $3.2 million due on or before December 31, 2017. Both of these payments were made as of December 31, 2017. Also pursuant to Amendment No. 2, we agreed that if on or before September 30, 2019, we (x) redeem or repurchase our 4.25% Convertible Notes (as defined below) for greater than 31.00 cents for every one dollar of principal amount outstanding or (y) exchange such notes for new notes or similar instruments that have a face value providing such exchanging holders a recovery that is greater than 31.00 cents for every one dollar of 4.25% Convertible Notes exchanged by such holders, we shall, no later than five business days thereafter, distribute to GSK additional cash or notes, as applicable, equal to such excess recovery, but in no event to exceed $2.0 million.  GSK has agreed that for so long as we comply with the payment terms set forth in the Amendment No. 2, enforcement of the Award will be stayed and GSK shall not seek to enforce or exercise any other remedies in respect of the award granted to GSK, and that the outstanding balance of such award shall be unconditionally and irrevocably forgiven upon satisfaction of such terms. We have recorded $2.0 million as contingent consideration for the potential payment due by September 30, 2019 and is recorded in Arbitration Award on our consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2017. Also, we recorded $10.5 million as gain from legal settlement for the year ended December 31, 2017 pursuant to Amendment No. 2 in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. Reverse Stock Split On October 13, 2016, we filed Articles of Amendment to our charter, with the State Department of Assessments and Taxation of Maryland to affect a one-for-ten reverse stock split of the outstanding shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share (the Reverse Stock Split). The purpose of the Reverse Stock Split was to raise the per share trading price of our common stock to regain compliance with the minimum $1.00 continued listing requirement for the listing of our common stock on The Nasdaq Global Market. As of the date of this Report, we have regained compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5450(a)(1). Each stockholder's percentage ownership in us and proportional voting power remained unchanged immediately after the Reverse Stock Split, except for minor changes resulting from the rounding up of fractional shares. The rights and privileges of stockholders were also unaffected by the Reverse Stock Split. There was no change to the number of authorized shares of our common stock as a result of the Reverse Stock Split. Accordingly, all share and per share information in this Annual Report on Form10-K has been restated to retroactively show the effect of the Reverse Stock Split.  8  
Debt Restructuring In August 2016, we announced the commencement of a formal process to pursue alternatives to improve financial flexibility, and we retained advisors to explore options to restructure our debt and assess other potential alternatives in order to maximize value for all stakeholders. On July 20, 2017, we entered into several refinancing transactions (collectively, the Transactions) with certain holders (the Holders) of our outstanding 4.25% Convertible Senior Notes Due 2021 (the 4.25% Convertible Notes). The Transactions closed on July 21, 2017, and included:  
A new five-year $40.0 million asset-based revolving credit facility (the ABL Credit Agreement) by and among us and certain of our subsidiaries as borrowers and guarantors
(the ABL Borrowers) and Pernix Ireland Pain DAC (PIP DAC), Pernix Ireland Limited, Pernix Holdco 1, LLC, Pernix Holdco 2, LLC and Pernix Holdco 3, LLC as additional guarantors (the ABL Guarantors),
Cantor Fitzgerald Securities, as agent, and the Holders, as lenders. The ABL Credit Agreement replaced our asset-based revolving credit agreement, dated as of August 21, 2015, by and among the ABL
Borrowers, Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as administrative agent, and the lenders party thereto, as amended (the Old ABL Facility); We have drawn $14.2 million under this facility at December 31, 2017;
A new five-year $45.0 million delayed draw term loan facility (the Delayed Draw Term Loan or DDTL) among PIP DAC, Cantor Fitzgerald Securities, as agent, and the Holders, as lenders. We drew
$30.0 million of the proceeds under this facility upon closing of the Transactions;
The issuance of (a) $36.2 million aggregate principal amount of PIP DAC's 4.25%/5.25% Exchangeable Senior Notes due 2022 (the Exchangeable Notes) and (b) 1,100,498 shares of Pernix's
common stock (the Exchange Shares), in exchange for the tender to PIP DAC of $51.8 million aggregate principal amount of Convertible Notes held by the Holders (the Exchange). The Exchangeable
Notes are governed by a new indenture under which PIP DAC is the issuer and Pernix and its other subsidiaries are the guarantors (the Exchangeable Notes Guarantors), with Wilmington Trust, National
Association, as trustee (the Exchangeable Notes Trustee). Concurrent with the Transactions, we entered into a registration rights agreement among Pernix, PIP DAC and the Holders that provides for the
registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, for the offer and sale of the Exchange Shares and the Underlying Shares (the Registration Rights Agreement). The Exchangeable Notes will be
exchangeable for our common stock. After giving effect to the Exchange, approximately $78.2 million principal amount of the 4.25% Convertible Notes remain outstanding. 
 These transactions are discussed in further detail below.  Financing Activities Convertible Notes: 4.25% Convertible Notes  On April 22, 2015, we issued $130.0 million aggregate principal amount in the 4.25% Convertible Notes. The 4.25% Convertible Notes mature on April 1, 2021, unless earlier converted, redeemed or repurchased.  We received net proceeds from the sale of the 4.25% Convertible Notes of $125.0 million, after deducting placement agent fees and commissions and offering expenses payable by us. Interest on the 4.25% Convertible Notes is payable on April 1 and October 1 of each year, beginning October 1, 2015. $51.8 million of these notes were tendered in consideration for the issuance of (a) $36.2 million aggregate principal amount of PIP DAC's 4.25%/5.25% Exchangeable Senior Notes due 2022 (the Exchangeable Notes) and (b) 1,100,498 shares of Pernix's common stock (the Exchange Shares) discussed above. Secured Notes:  Treximet Secured Notes  On August 19, 2014, we issued $220.0 million aggregate principal amount of our 12% Senior Secured Notes due 2020 (the Treximet Secured Notes) pursuant to an Indenture (the Treximet Notes Indenture), dated as of August 19, 2014, among us, certain of our subsidiaries (the Treximet Guarantors) and U.S. Bank National Association (the Treximet Notes Trustee), as trustee and collateral agent.  9   The Treximet Secured Notes mature on August 1, 2020 and bear interest at a rate of 12% per annum, payable in arrears on February 1 and August 1 of each year, beginning on February 1, 2015. On each payment date, commencing August 1, 2015, we will pay an installment of principal of the Treximet Secured Notes in an amount equal to 50% of net sales of Treximet for the two consecutive fiscal quarters immediately preceding such payment date (less the amount of interest paid on the Treximet Secured Notes on such payment date). As of December 31, 2017, the aggregate principal amount of the Treximet Secured Notes was approximately $172.1 million. Third Supplemental Indenture On December 29, 2017, we and U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee, entered into a third supplemental indenture (the "Third Supplemental Indenture") to the Treximet Notes Indenture with the consent of the holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of our Treximet Secured Notes. The Third Supplemental Indenture amends the Treximet Notes Indenture to clarify the definition of "Net Sales", as such term is defined in the Treximet Notes Indenture and resulted in the deferral of $3.2 million of principal payments until maturity. Credit Facilities: Cantor Fitzgerald  On July 21, 2017, we entered into a new five-year $40.0 million asset-based revolving credit facility (the ABL Credit Agreement) by and among Pernix and certain subsidiaries of Pernix as borrowers and guarantors (the ABL Borrowers) and Pernix Ireland Pain Designated Activity Company (PIP DAC), Pernix Ireland Limited, Pernix Holdco 1, LLC, Pernix Holdco 2, LLC and Pernix Holdco 3, LLC as additional guarantors (the ABL Guarantors), Cantor Fitzgerald Securities, as agent, and the Holders, as lenders. The ABL Credit Agreement replaced our asset-based revolving credit agreement, dated as of August 21, 2015, by and among the ABL Borrowers, Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as administrative agent, and the lenders party thereto, as amended (the Old ABL Facility). As of December 31, 2017, the aggregate principal amount of the ABL Credit Agreement was approximately $14.2 million.  Our obligations under the ABL Credit Agreement are secured by, among other things, our and certain of our subsidiaries' inventory and accounts receivable and were guaranteed by certain of our subsidiaries. Borrowings under the ABL Credit Agreement will bear interest at our election at (i) the rate of LIBOR plus 7.5% (ii) the Base Rate (as defined in the ABL Credit Agreement) plus 6.5%. In addition, we are required to pay a commitment fee on the undrawn commitments under the ABL Credit Agreement from time to time at an applicable rate of 0.25% per annum according to the average daily balance of borrowings under the ABL Credit Agreement during any month.  Wells Fargo  On August 21, 2015, we entered into a Credit Agreement with Wells Fargo National Association (Wells Fargo), as Administrative Agent and the lenders party thereto for a $50.0 million, three-year senior secured revolving credit facility (the Wells Fargo Credit Facility), which may have been increased by an additional $20.0 million in the lenders' discretion.  Our obligations under the Wells Fargo Credit Facility were secured by, among other things, our and certain of our subsidiaries' inventory and accounts receivable and were guaranteed by certain of our subsidiaries. The outstanding balances on this facility as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, were $0 and $14.0 million, respectively. Borrowings under the Wells Fargo Credit Facility accrued interest at our election at (i) the rate of LIBOR plus 1.5% to LIBOR plus 2.0% or (ii) the Base Rate (as defined in the Wells Fargo Credit Facility) plus 0.5% to the Base Rate plus 1.0%. The applicable interest rate margin percentage will be determined by the average daily availability of borrowings under the Wells Fargo Credit Facility. In addition, we were required to pay a commitment fee on the undrawn commitments under the Wells Fargo Credit Facility from time to time at an applicable rate of 0.25% per annum according to the average daily balance of borrowings under the Wells Fargo Credit Facility during any month. On February 8, 2017, we agreed to provide Wells Fargo with 30 days' prior notice of any request for a borrowing under this facility until April 8, 2017. As discussed earlier, the ABL Credit Facility entered into on July 21, 2017 replaced the Wells Fargo Credit Facility and the Company used the proceeds from the ABL Credit Facility to repay the outstanding obligation of the Wells Fargo Credit Facility.  10  
Term Facility  Cantor Fitzgerald  On July 21, 2017, we entered into a $45.0 million term loan credit agreement (the Delayed Draw Term Loan or DDTL) with Cantor Fitzgerald Securities, as agent (the Term Agent) and the lenders party thereto to obtain the DDTL. $30 million under the DDTL was drawn on the date of closing of the Transactions, and the remaining $15.0 million will be available for subsequent draws for certain specified purposes, including to finance certain acquisitions, subject to conditions set forth in the DDTL Credit Agreement. The DDTL includes an incremental feature that allows PIP DAC, with the consent of the requisite lenders under the Term Facility, to obtain up to an additional $20.0 million in term loan commitments from new or existing lenders under the Term Facility that agree to provide such commitments. Interest on the loans will accrue either in cash or a combination of cash and in- kind interest, at PIP DAC's election. Cash interest will accrue at a rate of 7.50% per annum, while the combination of cash and in-kind interest will accrue at a rate of 8.50% per annum, with up to 4.00% per annum added to the principal amount of loans and the balance paid in cash. The DDTL will contain representations and warranties, affirmative and negative covenants, and events of default applicable to PIP DAC and its subsidiaries (if any) that are customary for credit facilities of this type. The DDTL will mature on July 21, 2022. As of December 31, 2017, the aggregate principal amount outstanding of the DDTL was $30.0 million. Exchangeable Notes  Wilmington Trust  On July 21, 2017, PIP DAC, the Exchangeable Notes Guarantors, and Wilmington Trust, National Association, as Trustee, entered into a $36.2 million New Exchangeable Notes Indenture. The Exchangeable Notes issued under the New Notes Indenture will be guaranteed by Pernix and each other subsidiary thereof. The Exchangeable Notes are senior, unsecured obligations of PIP DAC. Interest on the Exchangeable Notes will be paid in cash or a combination of cash and in-kind interest at PIP DAC's election. Interest paid in cash (the "All Cash Method") will accrue at a rate of 4.25% per annum, while interest paid in a combination of cash and in-kind will accrue at a rate of 5.25% per annum, with 2.25% per annum of interest (plus additional interest, if any) capitalized to the principal amount of the Exchangeable Notes, and the balance paid in cash. The maturity date of the Exchangeable Notes Indenture is July 15, 2022.  The Exchangeable Notes initially are exchangeable into shares of our common stock at an exchange price per share of $5.50 (the "Exchange Price"). The Exchange Price will be subject to adjustment from time to time upon the occurrence of certain events, including, but not limited to, the issuance of certain stock dividends on our common stock, the issuance of certain rights or warrants, subdivisions, combinations, distributions of capital stock, indebtedness, or assets, the payment of cash dividends and certain Company tender or exchange offers. As of December 31, 2017, the aggregate principal amount outstanding of the Exchange Note was $35.7 million. Holders will exchange all or a portion of their Exchangeable Notes at their option at any time prior to the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity dates. See further discussion under the heading "Liquidity and Capital Resources" in Part II, Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. See further discussion in Note 12, Debt and Lines of Credit, to our audited consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 and also under the heading "Liquidity and Capital Resources" in Part II, Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.  Acquisition of Zohydro ER with BeadTek  On April 24, 2015, through our wholly-owned subsidiary, PIP DAC, formerly known as Pernix Ireland Pain Limited and Ferrimill Limited, we completed the acquisition of the pharmaceutical product line, Zohydro ER, including an abuse-deterrent pipeline and rights to all related intellectual property, a supplier contract and an associated liability payable and a specified quantity of inventory associated therewith, from Zogenix. There were no other tangible or intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed related to the Zohydro ER product line from Zogenix. The total purchase price consisted of an upfront cash payment of $80.0 million including a deposit of $10.0 million in an escrow fund, 168,209 shares of our Common Stock, $927,000 for a specified quantity of inventory, and regulatory and commercial milestone payments of up to $283.5 million, including a $12.5 million milestone payment upon approval of ZX007 abuse-deterrent extended-release hydrocodone tablet and up to $271.0 million in potential sales milestones if the Zohydro ER product line achieves certain agreed-upon net sales targets. We funded the cash portion of the purchase price from our issuance of $130.0 million aggregate principal amount of the 4.25% Convertible Notes.   11   
Acquisition of Treximet On August 20, 2014, we, through our wholly owned subsidiary Pernix Ireland Limited (PIL), formerly known as Worrigan Limited, completed the acquisition of the U.S. intellectual property rights to the pharmaceutical product, Treximet, from GSK. The total purchase price originally consisted of an upfront cash payment of $250.0 million to GSK upon closing of the transaction, and up to $17.0 million payable to GSK upon receipt of an updated written request for pediatric exclusivity from the FDA.  As a result of supply constraints, the contingent payment amount was subsequently reduced from $17.0 million to $1.95 million.  We funded this acquisition with $220.0 million in debt and approximately $32.0 million from available cash. In connection with the transaction, GSK assigned to PIL the Product Development and Commercialization Agreement (the PDC Agreement) between GSK and Aralez. In connection with the assignment of the PDC Agreement, PIL paid $3.0 million to CPPIB (which owns the rights to the royalty payments under the PDC Agreement), and we have also granted Aralez a warrant to purchase 50,000 shares of our common stock at an exercise price of $42.80 per share (the closing price of our common stock on May 13, 2014 as reported on Nasdaq) (the Warrant). The Warrant was exercisable from the closing date of the acquisition (August 20, 2014) until February 28, 2018. In March 2015, an assignee of Aralez exercised the warrant on a cashless basis, resulting in the issuance of 31,584 shares of common stock to such assignee. We will continue to pay a royalty to Aralez under the PDC Agreement, equal to 18% of net sales or lower under certain circumstances, with quarterly minimum royalty amounts of $4.0 million for the calendar quarters commencing on January 1, 2015 and ending on March 31, 2018.   Pursuant to the agreement between GSK and PIL, GSK was obligated to manufacture Treximet for sale to us for a period of three years, unless terminated earlier.  We were required to purchase 100% of our requirements of Treximet product from GSK until December 31, 2015. Additionally, the price of Treximet was firm for the first year of the term.  Thereafter, the price of Treximet is subject to increase based on the Pharmaceutical Preparation - Manufacturing Index for the twelve months immediately preceding additional years of the term. GSK manufactured Treximet for our adolescent sales and is no longer manufacturing Treximet for our adult sales. We have qualified and contracted with an additional manufacturing source to support current supply. Business Strategy  Our strategy is to maximize the commercial strengths and the value of the infrastructure that we have put in place to create a fully-integrated specialty pharmaceutical company.  We have launched Zohydro ER with BeadTek and re-launched Silenor in the U.S. market. We intend to expand upon and leverage our commercial successes and have launched an authorized generic version of Treximet.  We have also launched Pernix Prescriptions Direct®, a prescription processing service that provides benefit verification, prescription adjudication and mail order delivery of the prescription directly to the patient. We believe that our Pernix Prescriptions Direct program offers patients and healthcare professionals improved convenience that we believe will result in better compliance and reduced prescription abandonment among those participating in the program. We are focused on developing, acquiring and in-licensing additional products, and on partnering with and acquiring companies with which we can execute a targeted commercial approach.  We are focused primarily on CNS indications, including pain, neurology, and psychiatry, though we will consider other indications opportunistically.  Manufacturing  We currently outsource all of our manufacturing to third parties.  We maintain internal quality standards, regulatory compliance and a committed level of resources to administer the operations of these third-party relationships. We currently depend on third-party relationships for the supply of the active ingredients in our pharmaceutical products and product candidates, the manufacture of the finished product and the related packaging. This may increase the risk that we will not have sufficient quantities of our products or product candidates, or that such quantities, if available, cannot be acquired at an acceptable cost, which could result in development and commercialization of our product candidates being delayed, prevented or impaired. Where possible and commercially reasonable, we qualify more than one source for manufacturing and packaging of our products to mitigate the risk of supply disruptions. In such circumstances, if one of our manufacturers or packagers was unable to supply our needs, we would have an alternative source available for those products. We and all of our other manufacturers and suppliers are subject to the FDA's current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP), requirements. Certain of our manufacturers are also subject to the United States Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), regulations and other rules and regulations stipulated by other regulatory bodies.  12  
Intellectual Property Our performance relies partly on our capacity to achieve and maintain proprietary protection for our products and product candidates, technology and know-how to function without infringing on the ownership rights of others and to defend against others from infringing on our ownership rights.   Patents We own or have rights to 44 issued U.S. patents and 21 pending U.S. Patent Applications relating to our products and technology.  Further detail with respect to our patents pertaining to Treximet, Zohydro ER with BeadTek and Silenor are described below. Our Treximet patent portfolio broadly covers the pharmaceutical formulation, including the proprietary combination of a 5-HT agonist (i.e. sumatriptan) and a long-acting NSAID (i.e. naproxen), method of treatment, and bilayer tablet structure.  The portfolio comprises five issued U.S. patents (U.S. patent nos. 6,060,499, 6,586,458, 7,322,183, 8,022,095, and 5,872,145), all of which are listed in the FDA's Orange Book: Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations (Orange Book) and all of which benefit from six months pediatric exclusivity.  Four of the U.S. patents expire February 14, 2018, including six months pediatric exclusivity, and one expires April 2, 2026, including pediatric exclusivity. The adult and pediatric strengths have separate Orange Book listings.  There are no pending applications in the U.S.  All five patents are in-licensed from Aralez.  Zohydro ER with BeadTek is covered by 13 Orange Book listed patents, 6 of the 13 are in-licensed and the other 7 are solely owned by PIP DAC. Six additional U.S. patent applications relating to Zohydro ER with BeadTek are pending.  U.S. patent nos. 6,228,398 and 6,902,742, both of which expire on November 1, 2019 and both of which are in-licensed from Recro Gainesville, LLC, broadly cover the multiparticulate modified release composition.  U.S. patent nos. 9,132,096, 9,452,163, 9,486,451 and 9,713,611, also in-licensed from Recro, are directed to the abuse deterrent technology (BeadTek) and expire September 12, 2034.  U.S. patent nos. 9,265,760, 9,326,982, 9,333,201, 9,339,499, 9,421,200, 9,433,619 and 9,610,286 (all expire July 25, 2033) are solely owned by PIP DAC and are directed to methods of dosing patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment where no adjustment in start dose is required relative to patients without hepatic impairment. In a license agreement dated August 2003 and amended and restated in September 2010, Pernix Sleep, Inc. acquired the exclusive, worldwide license from ProCom One, Inc. to certain patents to develop and commercialize low dosages of doxepin for the treatment of insomnia. Silenor benefits from eight issued U.S. patents, all of which are listed in the Orange Book, with the latest expiring in September 2030.  U.S. patent no. 6,211,229 is broadly directed to the treatment of insomnia with doxepin and expires February 17, 2020.  U.S. patent nos. 7,915,307 and 9,572,814 are directed to methods of providing sleep therapy by administering doxepin several hours after a meal and expire August 24, 2027.  U.S. patent nos. 9,107,898 and 8,513,299, expiring May 1, 2028 and September 7, 2030, respectively, and 9,486,437 and 9,861,607, expiring May 18, 2027, are directed to methods of treating sleep maintenance insomnia by administering doxepin to reduce fragmented sleep or early awakenings.  Lastly, U.S. patent no. 9,532,971, expiring June 1, 2029, is directed to a pharmaceutical composition with doxepin and silicified microcrystalline cellulose.  It is anticipated that all of these issued U.S. patents will cover the proposed over-the-counter (OTC) version.  Further, we own or have rights to 11 pending U.S. patent applications that relate to Silenor.  In connection with the ASPA, GSK assigned to our wholly-owned subsidiary, PIL, all of its right, title and interest in and to that certain PDC Agreement.  Pursuant to such assignment, we acquired the right and license make, use, offer to sell, sell products in the United States and Puerto Rico using certain Aralez patents and other technology. The term of the PDC Agreement extends until the later of the date the last licensed patent expires and fifteen years from the first commercial sale of a product developed using the licensed patents.  The agreement is terminable at any time by us with 90 days' notice for any reason.  Either party may terminate the agreement with 60 days' notice if the other party commits a material breach of its obligations (or 15 days in the case of a failure to pay amounts due) and fails to remedy the breach within such notice period.  Under the terms of the agreement, we pay a royalty of eighteen percent (18.0%) of net sales (as defined in the agreement), which amount may be reduced under certain circumstances. Our predecessor-in-interest made upfront and milestone payments upon certain development milestones and regulatory approvals, all of which were satisfied prior to our acquisition of Treximet assets. Trademarks and Trade Secrets We own trademark interests in most of our current products and believe that having distinguishing marks is an important factor in marketing these products.  We currently own or have rights to approximately 25 trademarks registered with the United States Patent and Trademark Office, including PERNIX, SILENOR, TREXIMET, ZOHYDRO, ZOHYDRO ER, BEADTEK and many more.  The trademark registrations we own or hold rights to include registrations covering our product names, services, logos and slogans used for marketing of our products. In addition to our registered marks, we remain committed to branding our goodwill and we continuously file new trademarks used to brand and market our products and services. In some circumstances, we may depend on trade secrets to aid in protecting our technology.   13  
Seasonality  We generally experience some effects of seasonality due to our patients resetting their deductible amounts in the beginning of the calendar year and reaching their deductible amounts during the year. Accordingly, sales of our products and associated revenue have generally decreased in the first quarter of each year and begin to increase during the remainder of the year. This seasonality may cause fluctuations in our financial results. In addition, other seasonality trends may develop and the existing seasonality that we experience may change.  Customers, Distribution, and Reimbursement Customers and Distribution  Our customers consist of drug wholesalers, specialty pharmacies, retail drug stores, mass merchandisers and grocery store pharmacies in the U.S. We primarily sell products directly to drug wholesalers, which in turn distribute the products to retail drug stores, mass merchandisers and grocery store pharmacies. Our top three customers, which represented 88% and 93% of gross product sales in each of 2017 and 2016, are all drug wholesalers. Each customer and its respective percentage of our gross product sales are listed by year below: 
Gross Product Sales | 2017 | 2016
-----------------------------------+------+-----
McKesson Corporation | 34% | 36% 
AmerisourceBergen Drug Corporation | 30% | 31% 
Cardinal Health, Inc. | 24% | 26% 
Total | 88% | 93% 

 Consistent with industry practice, we maintain a returns policy that allows our customers to return products within a specified period prior and subsequent to the expiration date. Occasionally, we may also provide discounts to some customers to ensure adequate distribution of our products. We actively market our products to authorized distributors through regular sales calls. We have many years of experience working with various industry distribution channels. We believe that this significantly enhances our performance in the following ways: 
ensuring product stocking in major channels in the geographic areas where we do business;

continually following up with accounts and monitoring product performance;

developing successful product launch strategies; and

partnering with customers on other value-added programs.
 Our active marketing effort is designed to ensure appropriate distribution of our products so that patients' prescriptions can be filled with our products. Reimbursement  In the U.S. market, sales of pharmaceutical products depend in part on the availability of reimbursement to the patient from third-party payors, such as government health administration authorities, managed care organizations, or MCOs, and private insurance plans. Most of our products are generally covered by managed care and private insurance plans. The status or tier within each plan varies, but coverage for our products is similar to other products within the same class of drugs. We also participate in the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program with the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services and submit all of our covered products for inclusion in this program. Coverage of our products under individual state Medicaid plans varies from state to state. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged for pharmaceutical products and reviewing different cost savings efforts, which could affect the reimbursement available for our products and ultimately the net proceeds realized from the sales of our products.  14  
Competition  The pharmaceutical industry is highly competitive and characterized by a number of established, large pharmaceutical companies, as well as specialty pharmaceutical companies that market pain, neurology, psychiatry, primary care and other products. Many of these companies, particularly large pharmaceutical and life sciences companies, have substantially greater financial, operational and human resources than we do. They can spend more on, and have more expertise in, research and development, regulatory, manufacturing, distribution and sales activities. As a result, our competitors may obtain FDA or other regulatory approvals for their product candidates more rapidly than we may and may market their products more effectively than we do. Smaller or earlier stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large, established companies. Our ability to continue to grow requires that we compete successfully with other specialty pharmaceutical companies for product and product candidate acquisition and in-licensing opportunities. Some of these competitors include Teva, Depomed, Purdue Pharma, Pfizer, Collegium, Egalet and Valeant. These established companies may have a competitive advantage over us due to their size and financial resources.  We also face competition from manufacturers of generic drugs.  Generic competition often results in decreases in the prices at which branded products can be sold, particularly when there is more than one generic available in the marketplace. In addition, legislation enacted in some states in the United States allows for, and in a few instances in the absence of specific instructions from the prescribing physician mandates, the dispensing of generic products rather than branded products where a generic version is available.  Our products and product candidates may also compete in the future with new products currently under development by others. Any products that we develop are likely to be in a highly competitive market, and many of our competitors may succeed in developing products that may render our products obsolete or noncompetitive. With respect to all of our products and product candidates, we believe that our ability to successfully compete will depend on, among other things: 
the existence of competing or alternative products in the marketplace, including generic competition, and the relative price of those products;

the efficacy, safety and reliability of our products and product candidates compared to competing or alternative products;

product acceptance by physicians, other health care providers and patients;

protection of our proprietary rights;

obtaining reimbursement for our products in approved indications;

our ability to complete clinical development and obtain regulatory approvals for our product candidates, and the timing and scope of regulatory approvals;

our ability to supply commercial quantities of a product to the market; and

our ability to recruit, retain and develop skilled employees.
 Government Regulation  In the U.S. and other countries, federal, state, and local government authorities comprehensively regulate the research, development, testing, manufacture, packaging, storage, recordkeeping, labeling, advertising, promotion, distribution, marketing, importing and exporting of pharmaceutical products that we market, sell and develop.  15  
FDA Regulation of Drug Products In the United States, the FDA regulates the research, testing, development, manufacture, quality control, safety, effectiveness, approval, labeling, storage, record-keeping, reporting, distribution, import, export, marketing, advertising and promotion of our drug products and product candidates under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and its implementing regulations. Obtaining regulatory approvals and complying with applicable federal, state and local statutes and regulations require significant time and financial resources. Failure to comply with applicable FDA requirements during the development, approval or post-approval processes may subject an applicant to a range of judicial or administrative penalties, including the FDA's refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, clinical holds, warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, suspension of production or distribution, fines, restitution, disgorgement or civil or criminal sanctions. Before a sponsor may market a drug in the U.S., the FDA requires a process that generally involves the following steps: 
performance of preclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies in compliance with the FDA's Good Laboratory Practices, or GLP. regulations and the U.S. Department of
Agriculture's Animal Welfare Act;
submission of an investigational new drug application, or IND, to the FDA, which must become effective before human clinical trials may commence;
obtaining approval at each clinical trial site by an independent institutional review board, or IRB, before each trial may begin;
completion of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with Good Clinical Practices, or GCP, to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug for its intended use;
submission of a new drug application, or NDA, to the FDA;
adequate completion of an FDA advisory committee review, if applicable; and, 
FDA review and approval of the NDA.
 Preclinical Studies. Prior to full clinical studies, product candidates are evaluated in preclinical studies that may include extensive laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, toxicity, formulation and stability, as well as animal studies. The preclinical test results must be submitted by an IND sponsor, along with a clinical trial protocol, manufacturing information, analytical data and any available clinical data and literature to the FDA as part of the IND. Unless the FDA raises concerns or questions related to proposed clinical trials (such as concerns that human research subjects will be exposed to unreasonable risks) and places the clinical trials on a clinical hold, an IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA and clinical trials may commence. If the FDA issues a clinical hold, the IND sponsor and the FDA must settle any pending concerns before the clinical trial can begin. In addition, the FDA can impose clinical holds at any time before or during trials due to safety concerns or non-compliance. Thus, submission of an IND does not guarantee that the FDA will allow the commencement or the completion of clinical trials. Clinical Trials. Clinical trials involve the administration of an investigational new drug to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators. Clinical trials are subject to extensive regulation, including GCP requirements, which include, among other things, obtaining written informed consent from all study subjects, monitoring, and seeking review and approval by an IRB to conduct a clinical trial at each clinical study site. Clinical trials are performed in accordance with protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the study, dosing procedures and the parameters to be used to monitor subject safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated.   Once an IND is in effect, each new clinical protocol and any amendments to the protocol must be submitted for FDA review and to the IRBs for approval. Clinical trials are generally conducted in three consecutive phases, which may coincide or be combined: 
Phase I: The investigational product is initially introduced into healthy human subjects or, in certain circumstances, patients with the target disease or condition, and is tested for safety, dosage
tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution and excretion.
Phase II: The investigational product is administered to a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific
targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage and schedule.
Phase III: The investigational product is administered to an expanded patient population to further evaluate dosage, clinical efficacy and safety, to establish the overall risk-benefit ratio of the drug, and
to provide an adequate basis for regulatory approval and product labeling.
  16   An IND sponsor must submit reports to the FDA annually, or more frequently if the FDA requests, detailing among other things the results of the clinical trials and serious and unexpected adverse events. Phase I, II, and III trials may not be successfully completed within a specified period of time, or at all. Moreover, the FDA, an IRB, a Data Safety Monitoring Board or Data Monitoring Committee, or the sponsor may, at its discretion, suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that study subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk.  NDA Approval. If the required clinical testing is completed successfully, a sponsor may submit the results of the preclinical studies and clinical trials, along with detailed descriptions of the manufacturing process, analytical tests conducted on the drug, proposed labeling and other relevant information, as part of an NDA to the FDA, requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. The submission of an NDA is subject to a substantial application fee in most cases. Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act, certain applications for approval must include an assessment, generally based on clinical study data, of the safety and effectiveness of the drug in relevant pediatric populations. At the request of an applicant or by its own initiative, the FDA may grant deferrals or full or partial waivers from the pediatric data requirements. The pediatric data requirements do not apply to products with orphan designation, unless otherwise required by regulation. The FDA must determine whether to accept a submitted NDA for filing within sixty days of receipt, based on the agency's threshold determination that the application is adequately complete to permit substantive review. Alternatively, the FDA may request additional information. In such an event, the NDA must be resubmitted with the additional information. Once the application is accepted for filing, the FDA commences a detailed substantive review. The FDA may refer the NDA to an advisory committee for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA considers such recommendations when making decisions but is not bound by the recommendations of the advisory committee. As part of the approval process, the FDA also examines manufacturing facilities for the proposed product. The FDA will not approve an application if it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities do not comply with cGMP requirements and are unsatisfactory to assure consistent production within required specifications. In addition, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP before approving an NDA. The approval process is lengthy and can be difficult and the FDA may refuse to approve an NDA if the applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied or may require additional clinical data or other data and information. Even if such data and information are submitted, the FDA may ultimately decide that the NDA does not satisfy the criteria for approval. Data obtained from clinical trials are not always conclusive and the FDA may interpret data differently than our interpretation of the same data. The FDA will issue a complete response letter if the agency decides not to approve the NDA in its present form. The complete response letter usually describes all of the specific deficiencies that the FDA identified in the NDA. The deficiencies identified may be minor, for example, requiring labeling changes, or major, for example, requiring additional clinical trials. The complete response letter may include recommended actions that the applicant could take to place the application in a condition for approval. If a complete response letter is issued, the applicant may resubmit the NDA upon addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter, withdraw the application, or request an opportunity for a hearing. If a product receives regulatory approval, the approval may be significantly limited to specific indications or may otherwise be limited, which could restrict the commercial value of the product. Further, the FDA may require that certain contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling. As a condition of approval, the FDA may require a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, or REMS, to help ensure that the benefits of the drug outweigh the potential risks.  REMS can include medication guides, communication plans for healthcare professionals, and elements to assure safe use, or ETASU.  ETASU can include, but are not limited to, special training or certification for prescribing or dispensing, dispensing only under certain circumstances, special monitoring, and the use of patient registries.  The requirement for a REMS can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the drug.  Once adopted, REMS are subject to periodic assessment and modification.  In addition, the FDA may require Phase IV studies designed to further assess a drug's safety and effectiveness after NDA approval and may require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the safety of products that have been commercialized. Based on the results of post-market studies or surveillance programs, the FDA may prevent or limit further marketing of a product. Some types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes, and additional labeling claims, are subject to further FDA review and approval after initial approval has been granted. Post-approval Requirements. Drugs that receive FDA approval remain subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including requirements to report adverse events, provide the FDA with updated safety and efficacy information, comply with advertising and promotion regulations, submit periodic reports and maintain records. The FDA strictly regulates labeling, advertising and promotion of marketed drug products. Drugs may be promoted only for their approved indications. Improper promotion or advertising practices for prescription drugs may be subject to enforcement by the FDA and other federal and state agencies. The Federal Trade Commission regulates advertising for OTC drug products. Advertising for these products must be truthful, not misleading and supported by competent and reliable scientific evidence.  17   Additionally, drug manufacturers and other entities involved in the distribution and manufacturing of approved drugs must register with the FDA and state agencies and are subject to periodic inspections by the FDA and state agencies for compliance with cGMP requirements. The cGMP requirements apply to all stages of the manufacturing process, including the production, processing, sterilization, packaging, labeling, storage and shipment of the drug. Manufacturers must establish validated systems to ensure that products meet specifications and regulatory standards and must test each product batch or lot prior to its release. Certain changes to the manufacturing process generally require prior FDA approval before implementation. Future FDA and state inspections may identify compliance issues at the facilities of our contract manufacturers that may disrupt production or distribution or may require substantial resources to correct. Accordingly, we and our contract manufacturers must continue to spend time, money, and effort in the area of quality control and production to maintain cGMP compliance. The FDA may withdraw an approved application if we do not maintain compliance with regulatory requirements and standards or if problems arise after the product reaches the market. For example, the FDA may issue an approval letter for a drug that includes postmarket requirements, or PMRs, or commitments, or PMCs, including Phase IV clinical studies. The FDA may withdraw approval of a drug if it determines that the sponsor is not adequately completing its PMRs or PMCs. In addition, later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product may result in restrictions on the product or even complete withdrawal of the product from the market. Further, failure to comply with regulatory requirements may result in administrative or judicial actions, such as product recalls or restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product; warning letters, fines or holds on post-approval clinical trials; suspension or revocation of product approvals; refusal to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications; refusal to permit the import or export of products or product seizure or detention; or civil or criminal penalties or injunctions. From time to time, legislation is drafted, introduced and enacted by Congress that could significantly change the statutory provisions governing the approval, manufacturing and marketing of products regulated by the FDA. In addition to new legislation, FDA regulations and policies are often revised or reinterpreted by the agency or the courts in ways that may considerably affect our business and our products. It is impossible to predict whether further legislative or FDA regulation or policy changes will be enacted or implemented and what the impact of such changes, if any, may be. Products Subject to Ongoing DESI Proceedings  The FDCA, enacted in 1938, was the first statute requiring premarket approval of drugs by the FDA. These approvals, however, focused exclusively on safety data. In 1962, Congress amended the FDCA to require that sponsors demonstrate that new drugs are effective, as well as safe, in order to receive FDA approval. These amendments also required the FDA to conduct a retrospective evaluation of the effectiveness of the drug products that the FDA approved between 1938 and 1962 on the basis of safety alone. The agency contracted with the National Academy of Science/National Research Council, or NAS/NRC, to evaluate the effectiveness of drugs covered by NDAs at that time on an active drug ingredient basis and by regulation it applied the findings to all identical, related or similar, or IRS, drug products. The FDA's administrative implementation of the NAS/NRC reports was the Drug Efficacy Study Implementation, or DESI Review. The DESI review involved a multistep notice, comment, opportunity for hearing, and appellate process that has had vast administrative and legal complexities. Although the DESI Review began in the late 1960s, it was never completed. In the ensuing 50 years, the FDA developed other regulatory priorities, thus some unapproved products are subject to DESI proceedings in which a final determination regarding efficacy has not yet been made. In 2011, FDA published a Compliance Policy Guide, or CPG, that clarified how the FDA intends to exercise enforcement discretion with respect to drugs that are marketed without FDA approval.  We believe that a small number of our marketed pharmaceutical products are IRS to products with a pre-1962 NDA or ANDA that are subject to an ongoing DESI proceeding, and that may fall within the scope of the FDA's CPG. The regulatory status of each product is fact specific and we are exploring all the associated legal and regulatory issues. As all of these products are manufactured by subcontractors, we monitor their compliance with cGMPs in order to minimize product risk.  Over-The-Counter Drugs The FDA implemented a process of reviewing OTC drugs through rulemaking by therapeutic classes (e.g., antacids, antiperspirants, cold remedies). The FDA convenes an advisory panel for each therapeutic class, and each advisory panel develops final monographs for the class to be published in the Federal Register. OTC monographs set forth permissible claims, labeling, and active ingredients for OTC drugs in a particular class. They also specify acceptable ingredients, doses, formulations and labeling.  18    Drugs must meet all of the general conditions for OTC drugs and all of the conditions contained in an applicable final monograph to be considered generally recognized as safe and effective, or GRAS/GRAE, and thus to be legally marketed without prior FDA approval. The general conditions include, among other things, compliance with cGMP, establishment registration and labeling requirements. Any product that fails to conform to each of the general conditions and a monograph is subject to regulatory action.  We also market a number of dietary supplement and medical food products. While FDCA regulatory guidance relative to the labeling requirements for dietary supplements and medical foods products is general and the labeling for each of our products is intricate, we believe that we have labeled our products in accordance with applicable statutory requirements. While these products are not covered outpatient drugs, some options for the payment for non-covered drugs do exist, including the Children's Health Insurance Program, or CHIP, as well as various state-specific programs.   The Hatch-Waxman Act  Abbreviated New Drug Applications. The Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, also known as the Hatch-Waxman Act, created the abbreviated new drug application, or ANDA, pathway, which allows companies to seek approval for generic versions of brand-name drugs previously approved under an NDA. As part of the NDA approval process, applicants are required to list with the FDA each patent with claims that cover the applicant's product or an approved use of the product. Upon NDA approval, each of the patents listed in the application for the drug is published in the FDA's Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations, commonly known as the Orange Book. Potential generic manufacturers may reference certain drugs listed in the Orange Book as reference listed drugs, or RLDs, as the basis of their ANDAs. Generally, an ANDA must contain data and information showing that the proposed generic product is the same as its RLD by demonstrating that the two products (i) have the same active ingredient in the same strength and dosage form, to be delivered via the same route of administration, (ii) are intended for the same uses, and (iii) are bioequivalent. Under certain state laws, certain ANDA approved drugs may be (and in some cases, must be) replaced by pharmacists under prescriptions written for the RLD. An ANDA applicant must make one of the following certifications to the FDA for each patent listed for the RLD in the Orange Book: 
the required patent information has not been filed;
the listed patent has expired;
the listed patent will expire on a particular date, but has not expired and approval is sought after patent expiration; or
the listed patent is unenforceable, invalid or will not be infringed by the manufacture, sale or use of the new product (Paragraph IV certification).
 If the applicant does not challenge any of the listed patents, the ANDA application will not be approved until all the listed patents claiming the referenced product have expired. ANDA approval will not be delayed if there are no listed patents or if all patents have expired.
 If an ANDA applicant makes a Paragraph IV certification, it must notify the NDA holder and patent owners and provide of the factual and legal basis for the applicant's belief that the patents are invalid, unenforceable or not infringed. The ANDA applicant must provide this notification within 20 days after the FDA accepts the ANDA for filing. The NDA holder and patent owners may then initiate a patent infringement lawsuit in response to the notice of the Paragraph IV certification. In general, the filing of a patent infringement lawsuit within 45 days of the receipt of a Paragraph IV notice prohibits the FDA from approving the ANDA for 30 months from the receipt of notice by the patent holder; however, the FDA may approve the proposed product before the expiration of this 30-month stay if a court deems the patent unenforceable, invalid or not infringed or if the court shortens the stay period because the parties have failed to cooperate in expediting the litigation. If an RLD has new chemical entity exclusivity and the notice is given and suit filed during the fifth year of exclusivity, the 30-month stay does not begin until five years after the RLD approval.  The Hatch-Waxman Act also provides for a 180-day period of generic product exclusivity for the first generic applicant to submit an ANDA with a paragraph IV certification for a generic version of an NDA-approved drug. "Authorized generics" are generic pharmaceutical products that are introduced by innovator companies, either directly or through partnering arrangements with other generic companies. Authorized generics are equivalent to the innovator companies' brand name drugs but are sold at relatively lower prices than the brand name drugs. An authorized generic product may be marketed during the 180-day exclusivity period granted to the first manufacturer to submit an ANDA with a Paragraph IV certification for a generic version of the brand product.  19  
Section 505(b)(2) New Drug Applications. Another path to FDA approval, particularly for modifications to drug products previously approved by the FDA, is a Section 505(b)(2) NDA. The Hatch-Waxman Act created the Section 505(b)(2) pathway, which permits the submission of an NDA where some of the information required for approval comes from clinical trials not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference. The FDA interprets Section 505(b)(2) of the FDCA to permit the applicant to rely upon the FDA's previous findings of safety and effectiveness for a previously approved product that the applicant references as the RLD. The FDA requires submission of information to support any changes relative to the RLD, such as published data or new studies conducted by the applicant, including bioavailability or bioequivalence studies, or clinical trials demonstrating safety and effectiveness. The FDA may then approve the new product candidate for some or all of the labeled indications for which the RLD product has been approved, as well as for any new indication sought by the Section 505(b)(2) applicant. A Section 505(b)(2) application is subject to exclusivities for the reference product and is required to certify to the FDA regarding any patents listed for the RLD in the Orange Book as an ANDA applicant would. Therefore, approval of a Section 505(b)(2) NDA may be delayed until all the listed patents claiming the referenced product have expired, until any non-patent exclusivity listed in the Orange Book for the RLD has expired, and, in the case of a Paragraph IV certification and subsequent patent infringement suit, until the earlier of 30 months from when the patent holder receives notice or a decision or settlement in the infringement case finding the patents to be unenforceable, invalid or not infringed. Marketing Exclusivity. Certain newly-approved drugs and indications may benefit from a statutory period of non-patent marketing exclusivity under the Hatch-Waxman Act. The Hatch-Waxman Act grants five-year marketing exclusivity to the first applicant to obtain approval of an NDA for a new chemical entity, or NCE, which is an active pharmaceutical ingredient that the FDA has not previously approved. The Hatch-Waxman Act prohibits the approval of a Section 505(b)(2) NDA or an ANDA for another version of such drug during the exclusivity period, but submission of a Section 505(b)(2) NDA or an ANDA containing a Paragraph IV certification is allowed after four years, which may activate a 30-month stay of approval of the Section 505(b)(2) NDA or ANDA if the patent holder sues. The Hatch- Waxman Act also provides three years of marketing exclusivity for the approval of new and supplemental NDAs, including Section 505(b)(2) NDAs and sNDAs, if the sponsor conducts or sponsors new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability studies, and those investigations are deemed by the FDA to be essential to the approval of the application. Such clinical trials may, for example, support new indications, dosages or strengths of an existing drug. This three-year exclusivity covers only the indication, dosage, or strength associated with the new clinical investigations. Five-year and three- year exclusivity will not block the submission or approval of another "full" NDA submitted under section 505(b)(1) of the FDCA. Pediatric Exclusivity. Pediatric exclusivity is another type of non-patent marketing exclusivity in the U.S. If granted, it provides an additional six months of exclusivity to the term of any existing regulatory exclusivity or listed patent term. This six-month exclusivity may be granted based on the voluntary completion of a pediatric study that fairly responds to an FDA-issued Written Request for such a study. We plan to work with the FDA to establish the need for pediatric studies for our product candidates and may consider attempting to obtain pediatric exclusivity for some of our product candidates. Regulation of Controlled Substances  We, our third party manufacturers and certain of our products, including Zohydro ER with BeadTek, are subject to the Controlled Substances Act, which imposes registration, recordkeeping, reporting, labeling, packaging, storage, distribution and other requirements administered by the DEA. The DEA regulates handlers of controlled substances, as well as the equipment and raw materials used in their manufacture and packaging, in order to prevent loss and diversion into illicit channels of commerce. Accordingly, we and our third-party manufacturers must adhere to a number of requirements with respect to our controlled substance products including, but not limited to, registration, recordkeeping and reporting requirements; labeling and packaging requirements; security controls, procurement and manufacturing quotas; and certain restrictions on refills. The DEA regulates controlled substances as Schedule I, II, III, IV or V substances. Schedule I substances by definition have no currently accepted medical use in treatment in the U.S.  Thus, a pharmaceutical product may be controlled in Schedule II, III, IV or V. Schedule II substances are considered to present a high potential for abuse and Schedule III through V substances are considered to pose relatively decreasing potential for abuse. Zohydro ER with BeadTek is classified as a Schedule II substance. Any facility that manufactures, distributes, dispenses, imports or exports any controlled substance is required to register annually with the DEA, unless exempt from registration. The registration is specific to the particular location where controlled substances are handled, the activity engaged in, and the controlled substances utilized. For instance, the activities of importing and manufacturing require separate registrations, and each registration will indicate which schedules of controlled substances are authorized for use in the activity governed by the registration.  20   Prior to issuing a registration, the DEA may inspect a facility to evaluate whether an applicant meets registration requirements, including applicable security measures. Security requirements vary by controlled substance schedule, with the most stringent requirements applying to Schedule I and Schedule II substances. To evaluate security measures the DEA takes into consideration, among other things, the type of building construction, the type of vault, safe, and secure enclosures or storage systems, the adequacy of key control systems and electronic detection and alarm systems. The DEA also requires employers to conduct comprehensive employee screening programs. Records must be maintained for the handling of all controlled substances and periodic reports must be made to the DEA, including distribution, acquisition and inventory reports for Schedule I and II controlled substances, Schedule III substances that are narcotics and other designated substances. Reports must also be made for thefts or significant losses of controlled substances. A manufacturer/distributor must also maintain a system to detect and report suspicious orders to DEA, which are defined as orders of unusual size, orders deviating substantially from a normal pattern, and orders of unusual frequency. A registrant must follow certain requirements when disposing of controlled substances, including using certain on-site destruction methods or transferring the substances to a person registered or authorized to accept controlled substances for the purposes of destruction. Additionally, particular authorization and notification requirements apply to imports and exports. The DEA establishes annually an aggregate quota for how much certain controlled substances (including Schedule II controlled substances) may be produced in total in the United States, based on the DEA's estimate of the quantity needed to meet legitimate scientific and medicinal needs. This limited aggregate amount that the DEA allows to be produced in the United States each year is allocated among individual companies, who must submit applications annually to the DEA for individual production and procurement quotas. Manufacturers must receive an annual quota from the DEA in order to produce any Schedule II substance. The DEA may adjust aggregate production quotas and individual production and procurement quotas from time to time during the year, although the DEA has substantial discretion in whether or not to make such adjustments. Registered establishments that handle controlled substances must go through periodic inspections by the DEA. Failure to comply with applicable requirements, particularly as manifested in loss or diversion, can result in enforcement action that could have a significant negative effect on our business, results of operations and financial performance. Depending on the violation, the DEA may suspend or revoke registrations, pursue civil penalties, or pursue criminal penalties. Individual states also regulate controlled substances, and we and our contract manufacturers will be subject to state regulation concerning the manufacture and distribution of these products. Hazardous Materials  We depend on third parties to support us in manufacturing and developing certain products and do not directly handle, store or transport hazardous materials or waste products. We depend on these parties to abide by all applicable federal, state and local laws and regulations governing the use, manufacture, storage, handling and disposal of hazardous materials and waste products. We do not anticipate the cost of complying with the laws and regulations to be material. Pharmaceutical Pricing and Reimbursement  Our sales of currently marketed products and our ability to commercialize our products effectively depends substantially on the availability of sufficient coverage and reimbursement from third-party payors, including U.S. governmental payors such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs, Managed Care Organizations (MCOs) and private insurers. 
Political, economic and regulatory influences are subjecting the healthcare industry in the United States to fundamental changes. There have been, and we expect there will continue to be, legislative and regulatory proposals to change the healthcare system in ways that could impact our ability to sell our products profitably. We expect to experience pricing pressure in the U.S. in connection with the sale of our products, due to the impact of managed healthcare, the increasing influence of health maintenance organizations, additional legislative proposals to curb healthcare costs, and negative publicity regarding pricing and price increases generally. These and other factors could limit the prices that we charge for our products, limit our commercial opportunity and/or negatively impact revenues from sales of our products. 
 We anticipate that the U.S. Congress, state legislatures and the private sector will continue to consider and may adopt healthcare policies intended to curb rising healthcare costs, particularly given the current atmosphere of mounting criticism of prescription costs in the U.S. These cost containment measures include controls on government-funded reimbursement for drugs; new or increased requirements to pay prescription drug rebates to government health care programs; pharmaceutical cost transparency bills that aim to require drug companies to justify their prices; controls on healthcare providers; challenges to the pricing of drugs or limits or prohibitions on reimbursement for specific products through other means; requirements to try less expensive products or generics before a more expensive branded product is prescribed; changes in drug importation laws;  21    expansion of use of managed care systems in which healthcare providers contract to provide comprehensive healthcare for a fixed cost per person and public funding for cost effectiveness research, which may be used by government and private third party payors to make coverage and payment decisions. Any such changes could have a negative impact on revenues from sales of our products. Third party payors decide which drugs they will pay for and establish reimbursement and co-pay levels. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and services 
and examining their cost effectiveness, in addition to their 
safety and efficacy
. We may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to 
demonstrate 
the cost effectiveness of our products
. Even with 
studies, our products may be considered less effective, less safe or less cost-effective than 
other products, and third-party payors may not 
provide coverage and reimbursement for our products, in whole or in part. The 
process for determining whether a payor will provide coverage for a product may be separate from the process for setting the price or reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the product once coverage is approved. Third party payors may limit coverage to specific products on an approved list, or formulary, which might not include all of the approved products for a particular indication. For example, third party payors have started to require discounts and/or exclusivity arrangements with some drug manufacturers in exchange for including a specific product on their formularies. Any such requirements could have a negative impact on revenues from sales of our products.  Payors also are increasingly considering new metrics as the basis for reimbursement rates, such as average sales price, average manufacturer price and actual acquisition cost. The existing data for reimbursement based on these metrics is relatively limited, although certain states have begun to survey acquisition cost data for the purpose of setting Medicaid reimbursement rates. Both Medicare and Medicaid are administered by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS). CMS surveys and publishes retail community pharmacy acquisition cost information in the form of National Average Drug Acquisition Cost files for the purpose of providing state Medicaid agencies with a basis of comparison for their own reimbursement and pricing methodologies and rates. It is difficult to project the impact of these evolving reimbursement mechanics on the willingness of payors to cover our products. We participate in and have certain price reporting obligations to the Medicaid Drug Rebate program and other governmental pricing programs. Under the Medicaid Drug Rebate program, we are required to pay a rebate to each state Medicaid program for our covered outpatient drugs that are dispensed to Medicaid beneficiaries and paid for by a state Medicaid program as a condition of having federal funds being made available to the states for our drugs under Medicaid and, if applicable, Part B of the Medicare program (we currently do not market any Part B drugs). Those rebates are based on pricing data reported by us on a monthly and quarterly basis to CMS. These data include the average manufacturer price and, in the case of innovator products, the best price for each drug which, in general, represents the lowest price available from the manufacturer to any entity in the United States in any pricing structure, calculated to include all sales and associated rebates, discounts and other price concessions.  Health Care Reform (as defined below) made significant changes to the Medicaid Drug Rebate program, such as expanding rebate liability from fee-for-service Medicaid utilization to include the utilization of Medicaid MCOs as and changing the definition of average manufacturer price. Health Care Reform also increased the minimum Medicaid rebate; changed the calculation of the rebate for certain innovator products that qualify as line extensions of existing drugs; and capped the total rebate amount at 100% of the average manufacturer price. Finally, Health Care Reform required pharmaceutical manufacturers of branded prescription drugs to pay a branded prescription drug fee to the federal government. On February 1, 2016, CMS issued final regulations to implement the changes to the Medicaid Drug Rebate program under Health Care Reform, which became effective on April 1, 2016. The issuance of the final regulations, as well as any other regulations and coverage expansion by various governmental agencies relating to the Medicaid Drug Rebate program, has and will continue to increase our costs and the complexity of compliance, has been and will continue to be time-consuming to implement, and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, particularly if CMS challenges the approach we take in our implementation of the final rule. Federal law requires that any company that participates in the Medicaid Drug Rebate program also participate in the 340B program in order for federal funds to be available for the manufacturer's drugs under Medicaid and Medicare Part B. The 340B program requires participating manufacturers to agree to charge statutorily defined covered entities no more than the 340B "ceiling price" for the manufacturer's covered outpatient drugs. These 340B covered entities include a variety of community health clinics and other entities that receive health services grants from the Public Health Service, as well as hospitals that serve a disproportionate share of low-income patients. The 340B ceiling price is calculated using a statutory formula, which is based on the average manufacturer price and rebate amount for the covered outpatient drug as calculated under the Medicaid Drug Rebate program. Any changes to the definition of average manufacturer price and the Medicaid rebate amount under Health Care Reform, discussed below, could affect our 340B ceiling price calculations and negatively impact our results of operations.  22   Health Care Reform also made changes to the 340B program by expanding the list of covered entities eligible for 340B participation to include certain free-standing cancer hospitals, critical access hospitals, rural referral centers and sole community hospitals. Health Care Reform obligates the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, (HHS), to create regulations and processes to improve the integrity of the 340B program. On January 5, 2017, the U.S. Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA), an agency of the HHS issued a final regulation regarding the calculation of 340B ceiling price and the imposition of civil monetary penalties on manufacturers that knowingly and intentionally overcharge covered entities. The effective date of the regulation has been delayed until July 1, 2018. Implementation of this final rule and the issuance of any other final regulations and guidance could affect our obligations under the 340B program in ways that we cannot presently anticipate. In addition, legislation may be introduced that, if passed, would further expand the 340B program to additional covered entities or would require participating manufacturers to agree to provide 340B discounted pricing on drugs used in the inpatient setting. In order to be eligible to have our products paid for with federal funds under the Medicaid and Medicare Part B programs and purchased by certain federal agencies, we participate in the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs
, (VA), Federal Supply Schedule, (FSS), pricing program. Under this program, we are obligated to make our covered drugs (innovators and biologics) available for procurement on an FSS contract and charge a price to four federal agencies - the VA, U.S. Department of Defense, (DoD), Public Health Service (PHS) and U.S. Coast Guard - that is no higher than the statutory Federal Ceiling Price, (FCP). The FCP is based on the non-federal average manufacturer price, or Non-FAMP, which we calculate and report to the VA on a quarterly and annual basis. 
We also participate in the Tricare Retail Pharmacy program, under which we pay quarterly rebates on utilization of innovator products that are dispensed through the Tricare Retail Pharmacy network to Tricare beneficiaries. The rebates are calculated as the difference between the annual Non-FAMP and FCP
. Foreign countries that have price controls in place on pharmaceutical products may generate lower-priced product competition. Proposed federal legislation may increase consumers' ability to import lower-priced versions of competing products from Canada and elsewhere. If such proposals become law, our products may be susceptible to an increase in price competition from lower priced imported drugs. Additionally, several local and state governments have launched importation schemes for their citizens, and, absent any federal action to restrict such activities, we anticipate other states and local governments will launch importation programs. The importation of foreign products that compete with ours could adversely impact our business. Effects of Legislation on the Pharmaceutical Industry On March 23, 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, or Affordable Care Act was signed into law. On March 30, 2010, the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, or Reconciliation Act, which included a package of corrective changes to the Affordable Care Act as well as additional elements to reform healthcare in the United States, was also signed into law. We refer to the Affordable Care Act and the Reconciliation Act as Health Care Reform. The passage of Health Care Reform was intended to transform the delivery and payment for healthcare services in the U.S. The combination of these measures expanded health coverage and also provided for significant health coverage reforms that were intended to improve the ability of patients to obtain and maintain health coverage. Such measures included, for example, the elimination of lifetime caps, no rescission of policies, no denial of coverage due to preexisting conditions, a prohibition on varying premiums by more than 3:1 for age and 1.5:1 for tobacco use, a prohibition on imposing excessive waiting periods for coverage, and enhanced support for the Children's Health Insurance Program. Health Care Reform provided for implementation of this expansion in a variety of ways, including the creation of exchanges for finding health insurance policies, Medicaid eligibility expansion, tax penalties on individuals without health coverage and on certain employers who do not provide it, and tax credits to make health insurance more affordable. The expansion of healthcare coverage and these additional market reforms should result in greater access to our products. A number of provisions contained in Health Care Reform could adversely affect reimbursement for and access to our products. Some states have elected not to expand their Medicaid programs by raising the income limit to 133% of the federal poverty level. For each state choosing not to expand its Medicaid program, there may be fewer insured patients overall, which could impact our sales, business and financial condition. Health Care Reform also expanded rebate liability from fee-for-service Medicaid utilization to include the utilization of Medicaid MCOs and also limited distributions from flexible spending accounts for medicines to prescribed drugs and insulin only. Beginning in 2011, Health Care Reform also required drug manufacturers to provide a 50% discount on brand-name prescriptions filled in the Medicare Part D coverage gap, also known as the "donut hole." The legislation expands on the manufacturers' 50% discount on brand-name prescriptions and gradually closes the coverage gap, with 75% discounts on brand-name and generic drugs by 2020. The elimination of the coverage gap may result in greater access to our products for Part D beneficiaries.  23    Moreover, Health Care Reform makes a number of other revisions to the Medicare Part D program, including, for example, a reduction in Part D premium subsidies for higher-income beneficiaries, improvement in determining the Medicare Part D low-income benchmark, improved information for subsidy-eligible individuals under prescription drug plans, and funding outreach and assistance for low-income programs. Health Care Reform also required pharmaceutical manufacturers of branded prescription drugs to pay a branded prescription drug fee to the federal government and also created an Independent Payment Advisory Board, (IPAB), tasked with reducing the per capita growth rate in Medicare spending in the event that that growth rate exceeds a certain target. The IPAB is prohibited by statute from making payment reductions to certain sectors, such as hospitals until 2020. This limitation increases the risk that the IPAB would propose to limit access to certain pharmaceutical products and/or to mandate price controls for pharmaceuticals. Certain legislative changes to and regulatory changes under Health Care Reform have occurred in the 115th U.S. Congress and under the Trump Administration. For example, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act enacted on December 22, 2017, eliminated the shared responsibility payment for individuals who fail to maintain minimum essential coverage under section 5000A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, commonly referred to as the individual mandate, beginning in 2019. In addition, the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 increased the Affordable Care Act required manufacturer point-of-sale discount from 50% to 70% off the negotiated price for Medicare Part D beneficiaries during their coverage gap period beginning in 2019. Additional legislative changes to and regulatory changes under Health Care Reform remain possible. There have also been proposals to impose federal rebates on Medicare Part D drugs, requiring federally-mandated rebates on all drugs dispensed to Medicare Part D enrollees or on only those drugs dispensed to certain groups of lower income beneficiaries. If any of these proposals are adopted, they could result in us owing additional rebates, which could have a negative impact on revenues from sales of our products. The Budget Control Act, passed in 2011, created measures for spending reductions by Congress. A Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction was unable to reach required goals, triggering, among other things, automatic reductions to the budgets of federal health agencies and an automatic two-percent reduction to Medicare payments to healthcare providers. These spending reductions went into effect on April 1, 2013. Subsequent legislation extended the two-percent reduction to Medicare payments to healthcare providers through fiscal year 2025. We are unable to predict the future course of federal or state healthcare legislation and regulations, including rules and regulations that may be issued to implement or seek to roll back provisions of Health Care Reform or the outcome of any legal challenges to such legislation or regulations.  We expect that Health Care Reform, as currently enacted or as it may be amended in the future, and other healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future, could have a material adverse effect on our industry generally and on our ability to maintain or increase sales of our existing products. Health Care Reform and further changes in the law or regulatory framework that reduce our revenues or increase our costs could also have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and cash flows. Other Laws and Regulations  Pharmaceutical companies participating in federal healthcare programs like Medicare or Medicaid are subject to various U.S. federal and state laws pertaining to healthcare "fraud and abuse", including anti-kickback and false claims laws. Violations of U.S. federal and state fraud and abuse laws may be punishable by criminal, civil and administrative sanctions, including fines, damages, imprisonment, civil monetary penalties and exclusion from federal healthcare programs like Medicare and Medicaid. These laws are extremely complicated, apply broadly and may constrain our business and the financial arrangements through which we market, sell and distribute our products. Examples of these laws and regulations include, but are not limited to, the following: Anti-kickback Statute. The federal anti-kickback statute is a criminal statute that, among other things, makes it a felony for individuals or entities to knowingly and willfully offer, pay, solicit or receive, any remuneration (directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind) to induce or in return for (i) the referral of an individual to a person for the furnishing or arranging for the furnishing of any item or service for which payment may be made in whole or in part under a federal health care program, or (ii) the purchase, lease, or order of, or arranging for or recommending the purchase, lease or order of any good, facility, service or item for which payment may be made in whole or in part under a federal health care program. The term "remuneration" has been interpreted broadly to include anything of value. Both the party offering or paying remuneration and the party receiving or soliciting the remuneration are subject to liability under the statute. Some courts, as well as certain governmental guidance, have interpreted the scope of the anti-kickback statute to cover any situation where one purpose of the remuneration is to induce referrals of federal health care program business, even if there are other legitimate reasons for the remuneration. The anti-kickback statute has been applied by government enforcement officials to a number of common business arrangements in the pharmaceutical industry. There are narrow statutory exemptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting certain common activities from prosecution for violations of the anti-kickback statute, but to qualify for a safe harbor an arrangement must precisely meet each of the requirements. Failure to meet all of the requirements of a particular statutory exemption or regulatory safe harbor does not make the conduct per se illegal under the anti-kickback statute, but the legality of  24    the arrangement will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis based on the totality of the facts and circumstances. Moreover, there are no safe harbors for many common practices. The Health Care Reform clarified that neither actual knowledge of the anti-kickback statute nor specific intent is required to show a violation of the anti-kickback statute. Additionally, Health Care Reform amended the Social Security Act to provide that the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the anti-kickback statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the False Claims Act. Federal False Claims Act. The Federal False Claims Act imposes civil liability on any person or entity who, among other things, knowingly presents, or causes to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment of government funds; knowingly makes, uses, or causes to be made or used, a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim; or knowingly makes, uses, or causes to be made or used, a false record or statement material to an obligation to pay or transmit money or property to the government, or knowingly conceals or knowingly and improperly avoids or decreases an obligation to pay or transmit money or property to the government. Penalties include three times the government's damages and mandatory penalties of $10,781 to $21,563 per false claim or statement. In addition, the Federal False Claims Act permits a private individual acting as a qui tam plaintiff or "whistleblower," to file a lawsuit on behalf of the government against the person or entity that allegedly violated the law and share in any monetary recovery. Health Care Reform as well as other legislation, such as Fraud Enforcement and Recovery Act of 2009, makes it easier for the government and qui tam realtor to bring a Federal False Claims Act case. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.  The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act prohibits companies and their intermediaries from making, or offering or promising to make improper payments to non-U.S. officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or otherwise seeking favorable treatment. Similar anti-bribery laws exist in other countries where we intend to commercialize our products. For example, the U.K. Bribery Act imposes significant potential fines and other penalties for, among other things, giving, offering, or promising bribes in the public and private sectors, and bribing a foreign public official or private person. U.S. Federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) and the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). The HIPAA statute imposes criminal liability in connection with the delivery of or payment for health care benefits, items or services, for, among other things, knowingly and willfully: (i) executing a scheme or artifice to defraud any health care benefit program or to obtain, by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations or promises, any of the money of the health care benefit program, or (ii) falsifying, concealing or covering up by any trick, scheme or device, a material fact, or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statements or representations, or making or using any materially false writing or document knowing it contains any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement or entry. Further, the HIPAA statute and implementing regulations established certain standards and requirements for the privacy and security of individuals' health information, which standards and requirements were expanded by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act. In addition to HIPAA, numerous federal and state regulations, including state security breach notification laws, state health information privacy laws and federal and state consumer protection laws, govern the collection, use, disclosure, and protection of personal information. Failure to comply with such laws and regulations could result in government enforcement actions and create liability for us (including the imposition of significant penalties), private litigation and/or adverse publicity that negatively affect our business.  Also, the European Parliament has adopted the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which will become effective on May 25, 2018. This regulation replaces the EU's 1995 data protection directive and shall be the single EU standard across all member states. The GDPR takes a broad view of the types of information that are deemed covered as personal identification information and contains provisions that require businesses to protect such personal data and the privacy of EU citizens for transactions that occur within EU member states. The GDPR also regulates the exportation of personal data outside of the EU. Non-compliance with the GDPR could result in significant penalties. Many companies, including our company, are assessing the requirements of the GDPR against current business practices and preparing for compliance with this regulation once it becomes effective. Other Health Care Laws. The Social Security Act contains numerous penalties for fraud and abuse in the health care industry, such as imposition of a civil monetary penalty, a monetary assessment, exclusion from participation in federal health care programs or a combination of these penalties. The Open Payments program imposes annual reporting requirements on manufacturers of drugs, devices, or biologics for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the State Children's Health Insurance Program, of certain payments and other transfers of value to physicians and teaching hospitals made during the  25    preceding calendar year, and any ownership and investment interests held by physicians. Failure to submit required information may result in civil monetary penalties of up to an aggregate of $150,000 per year (and up to an aggregate of $1 million per year for "knowing failures") for all payments, transfers of value or ownership or investment interests not appropriately reported. Manufacturers must submit reports by the 90th day of each calendar year. Analogous state laws and regulations, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws may apply to sales or marketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by non-governmental third-party payors, including private insurers. Several states also require pharmaceutical companies to report expenses relating to the marketing and promotion of pharmaceutical products in those states and to report gifts and payments to individual health care providers in those states. Some states also prohibit certain marketing-related activities, including the provision of gifts, meals, or other items to certain health care providers. Some states restrict the ability of manufacturers to offer co-pay support to patients for certain prescription drugs. Other states and cities require identification or licensing of state representatives. In addition, several states require pharmaceutical companies to implement compliance programs or marketing codes that are consistent with the May 2003 Office of Inspector General Compliance Program Guidance for Pharmaceutical Manufacturers, and
/or the voluntary 
Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America Code on Interactions with Healthcare Professionals, or the PhRMA Code.  The PhRMA Code seeks to promote transparency in relationships between health care professionals and the pharmaceutical industry and to ensure that pharmaceutical marketing activities comport with the highest ethical standards. The PhRMA Code contains limitations on certain interactions between health care professionals and the pharmaceutical industry relating to gifts, meals and entertainment, among other things.  The pharmaceutical industry is experiencing a high level of scrutiny and regulation by government authorities and has been the subject of numerous investigations related primarily to financial arrangements with health care providers, payors and customers, regulatory compliance, and product promotional practices. Government investigations into compliance with these laws typically require the expenditure of significant resources, divert the attention of company management from operating the business and generate negative publicity. Violations of these laws or other governmental regulations may subject us to significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, imprisonment, damages, fines, exclusion from government funded health care programs such as Medicare and Medicaid, and the curtailment or restricting of business operations. Legislative changes to federal fraud and abuse laws are possible in the 115th United States Congress and under the Trump Administration, whether as part of changes to Health Care Reform or otherwise.  Employees As of December 31, 2017, we had 171 full-time employees, including a field sales force that covered 122 territories nationwide, and 49 employees engaged in management, finance, marketing, research, development, regulatory affairs, quality assurance, supply chain and administration. On January 4, 2018, we committed to and commenced a realignment plan to reduce operating costs and better align our workforce with the needs of our business in anticipation of the expiration of certain patents related to our Treximet® fixed dose combination product. We completed the realignment plan on January 5, 2018, resulting in a reduction of our workforce by 41 employees (representing approximately 22% of our workforce), the majority of which were associated with our sales force and commercial infrastructure. As a result of this restructuring we now cover 74 territories. Currently, none of our employees are subject to a collective bargaining agreement. We consider our employee relations to be good.
