Company History

Spindle, Inc. is an innovator of merchant and consumer-facing commerce solutions focused on the Small and Medium-sized Business (SMB) market. The Company was originally incorporated in the State of Nevada on January 8, 2007 as Coyote Hills Golf, Inc. We were previously an online retailer of golf-related apparel, equipment and supplies. Prior to the acquisition of the assets of Spindle Mobile, Inc. (Spindle Mobile), as described below, we generated minimal revenues from the golf-related business.

On December 2, 2011, we acquired certain assets and intellectual property from Spindle Mobile, a Delaware corporation in the business of data processing, mobile payments fields and other related fields, in exchange for approximately 80% of our issued and outstanding common stock of the Company, which shares were distributed to the stockholders of Spindle Mobile, Inc., pursuant to the terms and conditions of an Asset Purchase Agreement (the "Spindle Mobile Agreement"). 

Concurrent with the closing of the Spindle Mobile Agreement, we amended our articles of incorporation to change our name from "Coyote Hills Golf, Inc." to "Spindle, Inc." Additionally, we changed our authorized capital from 100,000,000 shares of common stock and 100,000,000 shares of preferred stock, $0.001 par value to 300,000,000 shares of common stock, $0.001 par value, and 50,000,000 preferred stock, $0.001 par value. The actions were approved on November 11, 2011, by the consent of the majority stockholders who represented 90% of our issued and outstanding common stock, and were effective on December 2, 2011.

On December 31, 2012 (the Parallel Acquisition Closing Date), pursuant to that certain Asset Purchase Agreement (the Parallel Agreement) by and between the Company and Parallel Solutions Inc., a Nevada corporation (Parallel), the Company acquired, substantially all of Parallels assets used in connection with its business of facilitating electronic payment processing services to merchants (the Parallel Assets), assumed certain specified liabilities and hired seven employees of Parallel in exchange for 538,570 unregistered shares of common stock, of which 53,857 shares (the "Parallel Indemnification Escrow") and 100,000 shares (the "Parallel Deferred Consent Escrow) were deposited in escrow with our transfer agent. The Parallel Indemnification Escrow was released on January 23, 2014. On October 29, 2013, the Parallel Deferred Consent Escrow was released to Parallel after certain specified contract assignments and residual revenue streams were assigned to the Company pursuant to the Parallel Agreement. 

On March 20, 2013 (the MeNetwork Closing Date), the Company assumed certain liabilities and acquired substantially all of the assets of MeNetwork, Inc., a Delaware corporation (MeNetwork), (2) on March 20, 2013, substantially all of the assets of MeNetwork, Inc. (MeNetwork) used in connection with its business of developing, marketing and licensing a mobile marketing platform for use by merchants and consumers (the MeNetwork Assets), pursuant to an Asset Purchase Agreement dated March 1, 2013 by and between Spindle and MeNetwork (the MeNetwork Agreement). As consideration for the assumption of the liabilities and the acquisition of the MeNetwork Assets, the Company issued an aggregate of 2,750,000 shares of common stock to the stockholders of MeNetwork, of which 350,000 were deposited in escrow with our transfer agent for the purposes of satisfying any indemnification claims. The MeNetwork Indemnification Escrow was released pursuant to the MeNetwork Agreement. On October 7, 2013, the Company issued an additional 750,000 shares of common stock to Ashton Craig Page, the former director and Chief Operating Officer of MeNetwork and a former director of the Company, pursuant to the terms and conditions of the MeNetwork Agreement. On December 12, 2014, the Company, and Ashton Craig Page, in his capacity as the representative of MeNetwork and the MeNetwork Stockholders (the Representative), entered into an Amendment and Waiver to Asset Purchase Agreement (the "Amendment), pursuant to which the Company agreed to issue and the Representative agreed to accept on behalf of MeNetwork and the MeNetwork Stockholders an acceleration of the issuance of up to an aggregate of 1,000,000 Earnout Shares on or before December 31, 2014 in full satisfaction of all obligations of the Company to issue the Earnout Shares pursuant to the Purchase Agreement during the Earnout Period. These shares were issued on December 23, 2014.

On January 3, 2014, the Company acquired substantially all of the assets of Y Dissolution, Inc., a Delaware corporation (formerly known as Yowza International, Inc.) (Yowza!!), used in connection with the business of providing retail coupons through a mobile application pursuant to an Asset Purchase Agreement, dated December 10, 2013, by and between the Company and Yowza!! in exchange for $500,000 and 1,642,000 unregistered shares of the Companys common stock issued to (1) the holders of Yowza!!s outstanding capital stock, and (2) certain executive management members and advisors of Yowza!!.

On October 23, 2015 (the Closing Date) the Company completed the acquisition of specific assets of Catalyst Business Development, Inc. (Catalyst) pursuant to an Asset Purchase Agreement, dated September 14, 2015, by and between the Company and Catalyst in exchange for 300,000 unregistered shares of the Companys common stock issued to the holders of Catalyst stock. The consideration amounted to $75,000 using a fair value of $0.25 per share at the Closing Date. The assets acquired include a white-labeled license of the Merchant Partners solution and various assets related to branding, marketing and sales. We continue to operate the gateway under the Catalyst brand.

Because we are still growing our business, we have not earned enough revenue to support our operations and we are not profitable. To date, we have funded our operations through sales of our equity securities and loans from related parties. We cannot guarantee that we will ever be profitable. 

Business Description

Spindle delivers a broad range of commerce solutions with the capability to serve merchants of all sizes.  The solutions include payment processing technology and equipment as well as integrated marketing programs. Spindles robust Catalyst platform enables us to deliver mission critical business functions such as payment processing in the US and abroad. Specifically, the functionality within Catalyst Gateway has the ability to manage transactions in more than 130 countries. Domestically, the Catalyst Gateway also has Eurocard-MasterCard-Visa (EMV) ready solutions and is fully PCI compliant. Our Catalyst digital marketing solutions link directly to payment processing scenarios enabled by our integrated components. We believe the services we provide to merchants are unique in the market, giving us distinct competitive advantages that have the potential to generate sustainable growth and profitability through enhancing consumer engagement for the merchants we serve, while driving transaction growth for merchants and Spindle alike.
Merchant Services

Spindle executed a Member Service Provider (MSP) agreement with Worldpay US, Inc. (Worldpay) and Citizen Bank, N.A. in 2016. Spindle is a registered Agent of Citizens Bank, N.A. Providence, RI.

In response to the widespread instances of fraud with consumer debit and credit cards, the card associations are actively promoting the move to the chip card infrastructure, also known as the EMV standard. The EMV standard helps reduce the instances of reproduced stolen credit cards by employing a secure interaction with the chip on the card. The card associations are driving the move to EMV by shifting the liability to merchants who accept a fraudulent card when the card was issued as an EMV card, but accepted as a mag strip transaction. It is anticipated that fraud will migrate to merchants who have not yet moved to EMV, thus increasing losses and risk for those merchants.

Integrated Payment Technology

Catalyst Gateway

Spindle acquired the Catalyst Gateway license as part of the asset acquisition from Catalyst Business Development, Inc. which was finalized on October 23, 2015. The Catalyst Gateway is a branded license of the Merchant Partners software. The gateway license was contracted for Spindle directly with WorldPay, the current domestic master license holder for the Merchant Partners gateway software. Spindle will continue to operate the gateway under the Catalyst brand delivering solutions to both direct merchants and reseller channels.

The diverse suite of commerce tools within the Catalyst Gateway delivers significant processing capabilities that were critical additions necessary to expand our service offering. The Catalyst Gateway is PCI certified through the Merchant Partners certification that applies to all resellers and private label gateways. The Catalyst Gateway has EMV-ready solutions, enabling merchants to comply with EMV standards.

The Catalyst Gateway offers the ability to board merchants with EMV compliant POS terminals from industry leading companies such as Ingenico, Verifone and others. Our gateway also enables Virtual or Web-based terminals and e-commerce transactions through integrations with leading shopping cart providers such as Magento, WooCommerce and zencart, among several others. The Catalyst Gateway Application Program Interface (API) and Software Development Kit (SDK) tools offer developers various options to enable connectivity through the majority of the top programming languages. Additionally, we can provide developers with the ability to board merchants on traditional acquiring platforms as well as through PSP programs.

Market Conditions in the Payment Processing Industry

The payment processing industry will continue to evolve and experience new market entrants with new technology and security regulations. As merchants and acquiring banks seek services to enhance their own offerings to consumers, EMV chip-based cards are required to be adopted in order to maintain current security standards. As EMV becomes more widely adopted, the industry expects a redistribution of fraud to points left vulnerable, thus there will be a need for adapted security and fraud management services, information services, and support for omni-commerce environments. To meet this evolving need, we will provide solutions and training to our merchants in order to ensure best practices for security and compliance are adopted.
Competition

Merchant Services

The merchant services business is highly competitive. Competitors range from the large acquiring banks like Bank of America Merchant Services, to Chase Paymentech, to smaller MSPs who specialize in specific verticals. It is this structural attrition forced by new technology and compliance that affords Spindle market opportunity to acquire new merchants and deliver a new value proposition through delivering marketing solutions with integrated payment technology. The most significant competitive factors in our segment are price, breadth of features and functionality, data security, system performance and reliability. 

 Payment processing services are becoming commoditized, driving MSPs, ISOs and payment processors to seek out new value-added features and benefits to add to their platforms in order to not only attract, but also retain merchants. While payment processing is a core strength, Spindle believes that the richly featured elements of our Catalyst Platform offer merchants unique services that will not only help grow their customer base, but also create the loyalty necessary to retain them. This provides us with the ability to add more sales channel partners in the payments industry that do not have the ability to create or deliver the integrated marketing solutions we can provide.

Marketing Services

Spindle believes that few competitors are capable of delivering a similar complete offering to merchants as our Catalyst commerce solutions deliver. With a focus on digital marketing, the direct response nature of digital offers will allow for better consumer segmentation, targeting, tracking of redemptions and automated attribution to specific promotional campaign spend that provides our merchants with a measurable ROI. In addition, the speed and adaptability of digital marketing allows retailers to reach and influence consumers while they are shopping. Digital marketing allows for quick edits and can modify the scale and scope of campaigns dynamically based on consumer interest and marketing budgets. This compares favorably to traditional print advertising, which requires longer lead times and represents a more manual and expensive process due to print and physical distribution requirements

Our Growth Strategy

Sales and Marketing

During 2016, Spindle focused on shifting our marketing activities from servicing the micro merchant market using our PSP - as was our focus for several years - to driving sales growth through providing merchants of all sizes with our Catalyst Platform offering, which delivers SaaS solutions encompassing marketing and integrated commerce solutions.

Our key strategic initiatives focus on leveraging our own internal marketing and sales capabilities, along with distribution channels, in order to increase merchant conversions to our platform and transactional growth for our merchant customers, resulting in increased processing revenues. We plan to:

·
 Invest in and leverage our direct sales model to drive organic sales growth;

·
 Broaden and deepen our distribution channels to grow our reseller and subsequent merchant client base;

·
 Differentiate through value-added services that address evolving client demands and provide additional cross-selling opportunities, including marketing, fraud management, ease of connection and delivery, and support for omni-channel environments; and

·
 Enter new market segments and expand sales capacity through strategic partnerships, acquisitions, and through bolstering our direct sales, marketing and service capabilities. 

Spindles plan is to attract, market to, and retain its customers though the expansion of the Catalyst platform, as well as process payments for goods and services sold through it. We will reach our merchants via direct sales and marketing and through our growing reseller channels. Direct sales are generated using Spindle employees and contract labor, web traffic, and resellers to extend our reach into specialized markets leveraging the services of the Catalyst Gateway. Our resellers fund the sales efforts and receive a wholesale buy rate or revenue share for their sales efforts and they deliver bundled solutions to their customers. Resellers will sell branded solutions to leverage the national brand identity and expand the reach of our Catalyst commerce solutions. Spindle plans to create and grow a commerce ecosystem or marketplace where consumers and merchants are connected, and in some cases, connected in a way where the consumer audience is captive.

Spindle believes that it is not simply enough to provide an ecosystem where consumers and merchants are just connected. Consumers must be driven to action and transact, or make a purchase. Without a sale, there is no commerce. With our Catalyst commerce solutions platforms, there are numerous ways to drive transactions and generate revenue. 

·
 The Catalyst digital marketing services engine will provide the ability to:
 o
 Market directly to consumers through a variety of digital mediums, including; digital video, social media, email, mobile, websites, SMS and MMS, kiosks, POS and terminal integrations:
 o
 Track consumers interests and understand the circumstances under which they make purchases: and
 o
 Use that information to create and deliver consumer-specific offers to sharply increase transaction probability and generate revenues for the Company.

·
 Spindle also plans to create verticals that service specific markets;
 o
 Such verticals could be constructed in a way that the interests of the consumers and merchants are already aligned.
 o
 For example, a sports vertical platform where coaches can manage all aspects of a teams activities can be connected to sports-themed ecommerce companies that are on the platform. Transactions can be driven by required purchases of uniforms and gear for each of the seasonal sports. 
 o
 The Catalyst digital marketing services engine can also be used to drive impulse sales in vertical markets, also generating revenues for the Company.

Acquisitions

We plan to build new business growth through organic sales with the addition of merchants boarded on our Catalyst Platform. We also look to increase our technical capabilities and revenue generation through accretive strategic acquisitions. In 2015, Spindle acquired the Catalyst Gateway license, intellectual property and other assets from Catalyst Business Development, Inc. while adding talent to our management team. We will continue to identify unique opportunities which we believe will enhance our product features and functionality, revenue goals, and market penetration. Our acquisitions have generally been consummated through the issuance of our common stock. We are targeting specific software solutions to increase our ability to market our solutions effectively and engage merchants and consumers alike in order to increase transactional growth.
Employees

We currently have five full-time employees, including executive management, client services and technical administration and implementation. We also have two contract employees engaged in channel sales and accounting. We work with outside consultants at times and we have no labor union contracts. 
Government Regulations

We are subject to regulations that affect the electronic payment industry in which our service is used. In particular, the banks and financial institutions that we provide services to are subject to regulations applicable in the United States and abroad, and, consequently, we may be affected by such regulations. Regulation of the financial services industry has seen rapid change in recent years, including the passage of the Patriot Act and the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, including the Durbin Amendment (the Dodd-Frank Act). The Dodd-Frank Act establishes regulation and oversight by the U.S. Federal Reserve Board of debit interchange rates and certain other network industry practices.

Among other things, it requires debit and prepaid interchange transaction fees (referred to in the Dodd-Frank Act as fees established, charged or received by a payment card network for the purpose of compensating an issuer for its involvement in an electronic debit transaction) to be reasonable and proportional to the cost incurred by the issuer with respect to the transaction. We believe that, as a small issuer with less than $10 billion in assets, our payment service is exempt from this provision of the Dodd-Frank Act. If at any time these regulations should change, there would be an impact on our business model due to the costs of compliance with such regulations.

Additionally, the Dodd-Frank Act provides that neither an issuer nor a payment card network may establish exclusive debit network arrangements or inhibit the ability of a merchant to choose among different networks for routing debit transactions. Under alternative rules proposed by the Federal Reserve, either (1) a debit card would meet the requirements of the Dodd-Frank Act as long as it could be used in at least two unaffiliated networks, or (2) each debit card would be required to function in at least two unaffiliated networks for each method of authorization that the cardholder could use for transactions (i.e., two signature and/or two PIN networks).

The Dodd-Frank Act also created two new independent regulatory bodies in the Financial Reserve System. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has significant authority to regulate consumer financial products, including consumer credit, deposit, payment, and similar products; although it is not clear whether and/or to what extent the Bureau will be authorized to regulate broader aspects of payment card network operations. The Financial Stability Oversight Council is tasked, among other responsibilities, with identifying systemically important payment, clearing and settlement systems that will be subject to new regulation, supervision and examination requirements, although it is not clear whether Spindle would be deemed systemically important under the applicable statutory standard. If Spindle were deemed to be systemically important, it could be subject to new risk management regulations relating to its payment, clearing, and settlement activities. New regulations could address areas such as risk management policies and procedures; collateral requirements; participant default policies and procedures; the ability to complete timely clearing and settlement of financial transactions; and capital and financial resource requirements. In addition, a systemically important payment system could be required to obtain prior approval from the U.S. Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System or another federal agency for changes to its system rules, procedures or operations that could materially affect the level of risk presented by that payment system. These developments or actions could increase the cost of operating our business and may make payment card transactions less attractive to card issuers, as well as consumers. This could result in a reduction in our payments volume and revenues.
