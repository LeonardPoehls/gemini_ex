 ITEM 1.  BUSINESS
 General
 MainSource Financial Group, Inc. (“MainSource” or the “Company”) is an Indiana corporation and bank holding company, within the meaning of the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (the “BHC Act”), that has elected to become a financial holding company (“FHC”). The Company is based in Greensburg, Indiana. As of December 31, 2016, the Company operated one banking subsidiary: MainSource Bank (“the Bank”), an Indiana state chartered bank. Through its non‑bank affiliates, the Company provides services incidental to the business of banking. Since its formation in 1982, the Company has acquired and established various institutions and financial services companies and may acquire additional financial institutions and financial services companies in the future. For further discussion of the business of the Company see Management’s Discussion and Analysis in Part II, Item 7.
 As of December 31, 2016, the Company operated 90 branch banking offices in Indiana, Illinois, Ohio and Kentucky. As of December 31, 2016, the Company had consolidated assets of $4,080,257, consolidated deposits of $3,110,871 and shareholders’ equity of $449,494.
 Through the Bank, the Company offers a broad range of financial services, including: accepting time and transaction deposits; making consumer, commercial, agribusiness and real estate mortgage loans; renting safe deposit facilities; providing personal and corporate trust services; and providing other corporate services such as letters of credit and repurchase agreements.
 The lending activities of the Bank are separated into primarily the categories of commercial, commercial real estate, residential, and consumer. Loans are originated by the lending officers of the Bank subject to limitations set forth in lending policies. The Board of Directors of the Bank monitors concentrations of credit, problem and past due loans and charge‑offs of uncollectible loans and approves loan policy. The Bank maintains conservative loan policies and underwriting practices in order to address and manage loan risks. These policies and practices include granting loans on a sound and collectible basis, serving the legitimate needs of the community and the general market area while obtaining a balance between maximum yield and minimum risk, ensuring that primary and secondary sources of repayment are adequate in relation to the amount of the loan, developing and maintaining adequate diversification of the loan portfolio as a whole and of the loans within each category and developing and applying adequate collection policies.

 Commercial loans include secured and unsecured loans, including real estate loans, to individuals and companies and to governmental units predominantly within the market area of the Bank for a myriad of business purposes.
 Agricultural loans are generated in the Bank’s markets. Most of the loans are real estate loans on farm properties. Loans are also made for agricultural production and such loans are generally reviewed annually.
 Residential real estate lending has been the largest component of the loan portfolio for many years. The Bank generates residential mortgages for its own portfolio. However, the Company elects to sell the majority of its fixed rate mortgages into the secondary market while maintaining the servicing of such loans. At December 31, 2016, the Company was servicing a $1.115 billion residential real estate loan portfolio. By originating loans for sale in the secondary market, the Company can more fully satisfy customer demand for fixed rate residential mortgages and increase fee income, while reducing the risk of loss caused by rising interest rates.
 The principal source of revenues for the Company is interest and fees on loans, which accounted for 56.1% of total revenues in 2016, 53.9% in 2015 and 53.9% in 2014. While the Company’s chief decision makers monitor the revenue streams of the various Company products and services, the identifiable segments are not material and operations are managed and financial performance is evaluated on a Company‑wide basis. Accordingly, all of the Company’s financial service operations are considered by management to be aggregated in one reportable operating segment.
 The Company’s investment securities portfolio is primarily comprised of state and municipal bonds; U.S. government sponsored entities’ mortgage‑backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations; and corporate securities. The Company has classified its entire investment portfolio as available for sale, with fair value changes reported separately in shareholders’ equity. Funds invested in the investment portfolio generally represent funds not immediately required to meet loan demand. Income related to the Company’s investment portfolio accounted for 14.7% of total revenues in 2016, 14.9% in 2015 and 16.6% in 2014. As of December 31, 2016, the Company had not identified any securities as being “high risk” as defined by the FFIEC Supervisory Policy Statement on Securities Activities.
 The primary source of funds for the Bank is deposits generated in local market areas. To attract and retain stable depositors, the Bank markets various programs for demand, savings and time deposit accounts. These programs include interest and non‑interest bearing demand and individual retirement accounts.
 Currently, national retailing and manufacturing subsidiaries, brokerage and insurance firms and credit unions are fierce competitors within the financial services industry. Mergers between financial institutions within Indiana and neighboring states, which became permissible under the Riegle-Neal Interstate Banking and Branching Efficiency Act of 1994 (the “Riegle-Neal Act”), have also added competitive pressure.
 Historically, the branches of the Bank were located in non-metropolitan areas.  For the past several years, the Company has prioritized growth in metropolitan areas, primarily Louisville, Cincinnati and Indianapolis, and within its existing market.  Since 2009, the Company has entered or expanded its presence in Columbus, Seymour, Bloomington and Indianapolis, Indiana, Cincinnati, Ohio and Louisville, Kentucky.  In these markets, in addition to competing vigorously with other banks, thrift institutions, credit unions and finance companies, the Company competes, directly and indirectly, with all providers of financial services.
 Employees
 As of December 31, 2016, the Company and the Bank had 888 full‑time equivalent employees to whom they provide a variety of benefits and with whom they enjoy excellent relations. None of our employees are subject to collective bargaining agreements. Available Information

 Regulation and Supervision
 The Company is a financial holding company within the meaning of the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended. As a FHC, the Company is subject to regulation by the Federal Reserve Board (“FRB”). The Bank is an Indiana state chartered bank subject to supervision and regulation by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) and the Indiana Department of Financial Institutions. The following is a discussion of material statutes and regulations affecting the Company and the Bank. The discussion is qualified in its entirety by reference to such statutes and regulations. Bank Holding Company Act of 1956

Generally, the BHC Act governs the acquisition and control of banks and nonbanking companies by bank holding companies. A bank holding company is subject to regulation by and is required to register with the FRB under the BHC Act. The BHC Act requires a bank holding company to file an annual report of its operations and such additional information as the FRB may require. The FRB has issued regulations under the BHC Act requiring a bank holding company to serve as a source of financial and managerial strength to its subsidiary banks. It is the policy of the FRB that, pursuant to this requirement, a bank holding company should stand ready to use its resources to provide adequate capital funds to its subsidiary banks during periods of financial stress or adversity.
 The acquisition of 5% or more of the voting shares of any bank or bank holding company generally requires the prior approval of the FRB and is subject to applicable federal and state law, including the Riegle‑Neal Act for interstate transactions. The FRB evaluates acquisition applications based on, among other things, competitive factors, supervisory factors, adequacy of financial and managerial resources, and banking and community needs considerations.
 The BHC Act also prohibits, with certain exceptions, a bank holding company from acquiring direct or indirect ownership or control of more than 5% of the voting shares of any “nonbanking” company unless the nonbanking activities are found by the FRB to be “so closely related to banking ... as to be a proper incident thereto.” Under current regulations of the FRB, a bank holding company and its nonbank subsidiaries are permitted, among other activities, to engage in such banking‑related business ventures as consumer finance, equipment leasing, data processing, mortgage banking, financial and investment advice, and securities brokerage services. The BHC Act does not place territorial restrictions on the activities of a bank holding company or its nonbank subsidiaries.
 Federal law prohibits acquisition of “control” of a bank or bank holding company without prior notice to certain federal bank regulators. “Control” is defined in certain cases as the acquisition of as little as 10% of the outstanding shares of any class of voting stock. Furthermore, under certain circumstances, a bank holding company may not be able to purchase its own stock, where the gross consideration will equal 10% or more of the company’s net worth, without obtaining approval of the FRB. Under the Federal Reserve Act, banks and their affiliates are subject to certain requirements and restrictions when dealing with each other (affiliate transactions include transactions between a bank and its bank holding company).
 Gramm‑Leach‑Bliley Financial Modernization Act of 1999
 The Gramm‑Leach‑Bliley Financial Modernization Act of 1999 (the “Modernization Act”) was enacted on November 12, 1999. The Modernization Act, which amended the BHC Act,

· | allows bank holding companies that qualify as “financial holding companies” to engage in a broad range of financial and related activities;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | allows insurers and other financial services companies to acquire banks;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
 
  5

 


· | removes various restrictions that applied to bank holding company ownership of securities firms and mutual fund advisory companies; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | establishes the overall regulatory structure applicable to bank holding companies that also engage in insurance and securities operations.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  The Company initially qualified as a financial holding company in December, 2004. Thus the Company is authorized to operate as a financial holding company and is eligible to engage in, or acquire companies engaged in, the broader range of activities that are permitted by the Modernization Act. These activities include those that are determined to be “financial in nature,” including insurance underwriting, securities underwriting and dealing, and making merchant banking investments in commercial and financial companies. If a banking subsidiary ceases to be “well capitalized” or “well managed” under applicable regulatory standards, the FRB may, among other things, place limitations on our ability to conduct these broader financial activities or, if the deficiencies persist, require us to divest the banking subsidiary. In addition, if a banking subsidiary receives a rating of less than satisfactory under the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 (“CRA”), we would be prohibited from engaging in any additional activities other than those permissible for bank holding companies that are not financial holding companies.
 Bank Secrecy Act and USA Patriot Act
 In 1970, Congress enacted the Currency and Foreign Transactions Reporting Act, commonly known as the Bank Secrecy Act (the “BSA”). The BSA requires financial institutions to maintain records of certain customers and currency transactions and to report certain domestic and foreign currency transactions, which may have a high degree of usefulness in criminal, tax, or regulatory investigations or proceedings. Under this law, financial institutions are required to develop a BSA compliance program.
 In 2001, the President signed into law comprehensive anti‑terrorism legislation known as the USA Patriot Act. Title III of the USA Patriot Act requires financial institutions, including the Company and the Bank, to help prevent and detect international money laundering and the financing of terrorism and prosecute those involved in such activities. The Department of the Treasury has adopted additional requirements to further implement Title III.
 Under these regulations, a mechanism has been established for law enforcement officials to communicate names of suspected terrorists and money launderers to financial institutions to enable financial institutions to promptly locate accounts and transactions involving those suspects. Financial institutions receiving names of suspects must search their account and transaction records for potential matches and report positive results to the U.S. Department of the Treasury Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (“FinCEN”). Each financial institution must designate a point of contact to receive information requests. These regulations outline how financial institutions can share information concerning suspected terrorist and money laundering activity with other financial institutions under the protection of a statutory safe harbor if each financial institution notifies FinCEN of its intent to share information. The Department of the Treasury has also adopted regulations intended to prevent money laundering and terrorist financing through correspondent accounts maintained by U.S. financial institutions on behalf of foreign banks. Financial institutions are required to take reasonable steps to ensure that they are not providing banking services directly or indirectly to foreign shell banks. In addition, banks must have procedures in place to verify the identity of the persons with whom they deal.
 FDIC Improvement Act of 1991
 The Federal Deposit Insurance Act, as amended (“FDIA”), requires among other things, the federal banking agencies to take “prompt corrective action” in respect of depository institutions that do not meet minimum capital requirements. The FDIA includes the following five capital tiers: “well capitalized,” “adequately capitalized,” “undercapitalized,” “significantly undercapitalized” and “critically undercapitalized.” A depository institution’s capital tier will depend upon how its capital levels compare with various relevant capital measures and certain other factors, as established by regulation. The relevant capital measures are the total risk‑based capital ratio, the Tier 1 risk‑based capital ratio, the common equity Tier 1 risk‑based capital ratio, and the leverage ratio.
 A bank will be (i) “well capitalized” if the institution has a total risk‑based capital ratio of 10.0% or greater, a Tier 1 risk‑based capital ratio of 8.0% or greater, a common equity Tier 1 risk‑based capital ratio of 6.5% or greater, and 

 
  6

 
a leverage ratio of 5.0% or greater, and is not subject to any order or written directive by any such regulatory authority to meet and maintain a specific capital level for any capital measure; (ii) “adequately capitalized” if the institution has a total risk‑based capital ratio of 8.0% or greater, a Tier 1 risk‑based capital ratio of 6.0% or greater, a common equity Tier 1 risk‑based capital ratio of 4.5% or greater, and a leverage ratio of 4.0% or greater and is not “well capitalized”; (iii) “undercapitalized” if the institution has a total risk‑based capital ratio that is less than 8.0%, a Tier 1 risk‑based capital ratio of less than 6.0%, a common equity Tier 1 risk‑based capital ratio of less than 4.5%, or a leverage ratio of less than 4.0%; (iv) “significantly undercapitalized” if the institution has a total risk‑based capital ratio of less than 6.0%, a Tier 1 risk‑based capital ratio of less than 4.0%, a common equity Tier 1 risk‑based capital ratio of less than 3.0%, or a leverage ratio of less than 3.0%; and (v) “critically undercapitalized” if the institution’s tangible equity is equal to or less than 2.0% of average quarterly tangible assets. An institution may be downgraded to, or deemed to be in, a capital category that is lower than indicated by its capital ratios if it is determined to be in an unsafe or unsound condition or if it receives an unsatisfactory examination rating with respect to certain matters. A bank’s capital category is determined solely for the purpose of applying prompt corrective action regulations, and the capital category may not constitute an accurate representation of the bank’s overall financial condition or prospects for other purposes.
 The FDIA generally prohibits a depository institution from making any capital distributions (including payment of a dividend) or paying any management fee to its parent holding company if the depository institution would thereafter be “undercapitalized.” “Undercapitalized” institutions are subject to growth limitations and are required to submit a capital restoration plan. The agencies may not accept such a plan without determining, among other things, that the plan is based on realistic assumptions and is likely to succeed in restoring the depository institution’s capital. In addition, for a capital restoration plan to be acceptable, the depository institution’s parent holding company must guarantee that the institution will comply with such capital restoration plan. The bank holding company must also provide appropriate assurances of performance. The aggregate liability of the parent holding company is limited to the lesser of (i) an amount equal to 5.0% of the depository institution’s total assets at the time it became undercapitalized and (ii) the amount which is necessary (or would have been necessary) to bring the institution into compliance with all capital standards applicable with respect to such institution as of the time it fails to comply with the plan. If a depository institution fails to submit an acceptable plan, it is treated as if it is “significantly undercapitalized.” “Significantly undercapitalized” depository institutions may be subject to a number of requirements and restrictions, including orders to sell sufficient voting stock to become “adequately capitalized,” requirements to reduce total assets, and cessation of receipt of deposits from correspondent banks. “Critically undercapitalized” institutions are subject to the appointment of a receiver or conservator.
 The appropriate federal banking agency may, under certain circumstances, reclassify a well‑capitalized insured depository institution as adequately capitalized. The FDIA provides that an institution may be reclassified if the appropriate federal banking agency determines (after notice and opportunity for hearing) that the institution is in an unsafe or unsound condition or deems the institution to be engaging in an unsafe or unsound practice. The appropriate agency is also permitted to require an adequately capitalized or undercapitalized institution to comply with the supervisory provisions as if the institution were in the next lower category (but not treat a significantly undercapitalized institution as critically undercapitalized) based on supervisory information other than the capital levels of the institution.
 The Company believes that, as of December 31, 2016, the Company and the Bank were each “well capitalized” based on the aforementioned ratios.
 Deposit Insurance Fund
 The deposits of the Bank are insured to the maximum extent permitted by law by the Deposit Insurance Fund (“DIF”) of the FDIC, which was created in 2006 as the result of the merger of the Bank Insurance Fund and the Savings Association Insurance Fund in accordance with the Federal Deposit Insurance Reform Act of 2005 (the “FDI Act”). The FDIC maintains the DIF by assessing depository institutions an insurance premium. Pursuant to the Dodd‑Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the “Dodd-Frank Act”), the FDIC is required to set a DIF reserve ratio of 1.35% of estimated insured deposits and is required to achieve this ratio by September 30, 2020.
 Under the FDIC’s risk‑based assessment system, insured institutions are required to pay deposit insurance premiums based on the risk that each institution poses to the DIF. An institution’s risk to the DIF is measured by its regulatory capital levels, supervisory evaluations, and certain other factors. An institution’s assessment rate depends upon 

 
  7

 
the risk category to which it is assigned.  Pursuant to the Dodd‑Frank Act, the FDIC will calculate an institution’s assessment level based on its total average consolidated assets during the assessment period less average tangible equity (i.e., Tier 1 capital) as opposed to an institution’s deposit level which was the previous basis for calculating insurance assessments. Pursuant to the Dodd‑Frank Act, institutions will be placed into one of four risk categories for purposes of determining the institution’s actual assessment rate. The FDIC will determine the risk category based on the institution’s capital position (well capitalized, adequately capitalized, or undercapitalized) and supervisory condition (based on exam reports and related information provided by the institution’s primary federal regulator).
 Dividends
 The Company is a legal entity separate and distinct from the Bank. There are various legal limitations on the extent to which the Bank can supply funds to the Company. The principal source of the Company’s funds consists of dividends from the Bank. State and Federal law restricts the amount of dividends that may be paid by banks. The specific limits depend on a number of factors, including the bank’s type of charter, recent earnings, recent dividends, level of capital and regulatory status. The regulators are authorized, and under certain circumstances are required, to determine that the payment of dividends or other distributions by a bank would be an unsafe or unsound practice and to prohibit that payment. For example, the FDI Act generally prohibits a depository institution from making any capital distribution (including payment of a dividend) or paying any management fee to its parent holding company if the depository institution would thereafter be undercapitalized.
 The Dodd‑Frank Act and its accompanying regulations also limit a depository institution’s ability to make capital distributions if it does not hold a 2.5% capital buffer above the required minimum risk‑based capital ratios. Regulators also review and limit proposed dividend payments as part of the supervisory process and review of an institution’s capital planning. In addition to dividend limitations, the Bank is subject to certain restrictions on extensions of credit to the Company, on investments in the stock or other securities of the Company and in taking such stock or securities as collateral for loans.
 Community Reinvestment Act
 The Community Reinvestment Act requires that the federal banking regulators evaluate the records of a financial institution in meeting the credit needs of its local community, including low and moderate income neighborhoods. These factors are also considered in evaluating mergers, acquisitions, and applications to open a branch or facility. Failure to adequately meet these criteria could result in the imposition of additional requirements and limitations on the Bank. The Dodd‑Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act
 The Dodd-Frank Act was enacted in July, 2010.  Under this law, various federal agencies are given significant discretion in drafting and implementing a broad range of rules and regulations.  While many new rules and regulation have been adopted, many more remain to be adopted.
 Certain provisions of the Dodd‑Frank Act are now effective and have been fully implemented, including the revisions in the deposit insurance assessment base for FDIC insurance and the permanent increase in coverage to $250,000; the permissibility of paying interest on business checking accounts; the removal of barriers to interstate branching and required disclosure and shareholder advisory votes on executive compensation. Recent action to implement the final Dodd‑Frank Act provisions included (i) final new capital rules, (ii) a final rule to implement the so called “Volcker rule” restrictions on certain proprietary trading and investment activities and (iii) final rules and increased enforcement action by the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau (“CFPB”).
 On February 3, 2017, President Donald J. Trump signed an executive order calling for his administration to review existing U.S. financial laws and regulations, including the Dodd-Frank Act, in order to determine their consistency with a set of “core principles” of financial policy. The core financial principles identified in the executive order include the following: empowering Americans to make independent financial decisions and informed choices in the marketplace, save for retirement, and build individual wealth; preventing taxpayer-funded bailouts; fostering economic growth and vibrant financial markets through more rigorous regulatory impact analysis that addresses systemic risk and market failures, such 

 
  8

 
as moral hazard and information asymmetry; enabling American companies to be competitive with foreign firms in domestic and foreign markets; advancing American interests in international financial regulatory negotiations and meetings; and restoring public accountability within Federal financial regulatory agencies and “rationalizing” the Federal financial regulatory framework.  It is too early at this point to predict the likelihood, scope, or timing of any changes or their impact on the existing or proposed regulations implementing the Dodd-Frank Act.
 S.A.F.E. Act Requirements
 Regulations issued under the Secure and Fair Enforcement for Mortgage Licensing Act of 2008 (the “S.A.F.E. Act”) require residential mortgage loan originators who are employees of institutions regulated by the foregoing agencies, including national banks, to meet the registration requirements of the S.A.F.E. Act. The S.A.F.E. Act requires residential mortgage loan originators who are employees of regulated financial institutions to be registered with the Nationwide Mortgage Licensing System and Registry, a database created by the Conference of State Bank Supervisors and the American Association of Residential Mortgage Regulators to support the licensing of mortgage loan originators by the states. Employees of regulated financial institutions are generally prohibited from originating residential mortgage loans unless they are registered. Regulatory Capital Requirements
 In July 2013, the federal banking agencies published the Basel III Capital Rules establishing a new comprehensive capital framework for U.S. banking organizations.  The rules implement the Basel Committee’s December 2010 framework known as “Basel III” for strengthening international capital standards as well as certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act.  
     The Basel III Capital Rules became effective on January 1, 2015 (subject to a phase-in period) and, among other things, introduced a new capital measure known as “Common Equity Tier 1” (“CET1”), which generally consists of common equity Tier 1 capital instruments and related surplus, retained earnings, and common equity Tier 1 minority interests (minus certain adjustments and deductions, as discussed below). 
     The Basel III Capital Rules provide for a number of deductions from and adjustments to CET1. These include, for example, the requirement that mortgage servicing rights, deferred tax assets arising from temporary differences that could not be realized through net operating loss carrybacks and significant investments in non-consolidated financial entities be deducted from CET1 to the extent that any one such category exceeds 10% of CET1 or all such categories in the aggregate exceed 15% of CET1.  Under the former capital standards, the effects of accumulated other comprehensive income items included in capital were excluded for the purposes of determining regulatory capital ratios.  Under the Basel III Capital Rules, the effects of certain accumulated other comprehensive items are not excluded; however, non-advanced approaches banking organizations, including the Company, may make a one-time permanent election to continue to exclude these items.  The Company and the Bank both made this election in order to avoid significant variations in the level of capital depending upon the impact of interest rate fluctuations on the fair value of the Company’s available-for-sale securities portfolio.  The Basel III Capital Rules also preclude certain hybrid securities, such as trust preferred securities, as Tier 1 capital of bank holding companies, subject to phase-out.  The Company has some trust preferred securities. Implementation of the deductions and other adjustments to CET1 began on January 1, 2015 and will be phased-in over a four-year period (beginning at 40% on January 1, 2015 and an additional 20% per year thereafter).  
     The Basel III Capital Rules prescribe a standardized approach for risk weightings depending on the nature of the assets, generally ranging from 0% for U.S. government and agency securities, to 600% for certain equity exposures. Specifics risk-weights impacting the Company’s determination of risk-weighted assets include, among other things:
    
· | Applying a 150% risk weight for certain high volatility commercial real estate acquisition, development and construction loans;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Assigning a 150% risk weight to exposures (other than residential mortgage exposures) that are 90 days past due;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     
 
  9

 


· | Providing for a 20% credit conversion factor for the unused portion of a commitment with an original maturity of one year or less that is not unconditionally cancellable; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Providing for a risk weight, generally not less than 20% with certain exceptions, for securities lending transactions based on the risk weight category of the underlying collateral securing the transaction.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

      When fully phased in on January 1, 2019, the Basel III Capital Rules will require the Company and its banking subsidiaries to maintain:
    
· | a minimum ratio of CET1 to risk-weighted assets of at least 4.5%, plus a 2.5% “capital conservation buffer” (which is added to the 4.5% CET1 ratio as that buffer is phased in, effectively resulting in a minimum ratio of CET1 to risk-weighted assets of at least 7% upon full implementation);
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | a minimum ratio of Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 6.0%, plus the capital conservation buffer (which is added to the 6.0% Tier 1 capital ratio as that buffer is phased in, effectively resulting in a minimum Tier 1 capital ratio of 8.5% upon full implementation);
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | a minimum ratio of Total capital (that is, Tier 1 plus Tier 2) to risk-weighted assets of at least 8.0%, plus the capital conservation buffer (which is added to the 8.0% total capital ratio as that buffer is phased in, effectively resulting in a minimum total capital ratio of 10.5% upon full implementation), and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | a minimum leverage ratio of 4%, calculated as the ratio of Tier 1 capital to average assets.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

      The implementation of the capital conservation buffer began on January 1, 2016 at the 0.625% level and will be phased in over a four-year period (increasing by that amount on each subsequent January 1, until it reaches 2.5% on January 1, 2019).  The capital conservation buffer is designed to absorb losses during periods of economic stress. Banking institutions with a ratio of CET1 to risk-weighted assets above the minimum but below the conservation buffer (or below the combined capital conservation buffer and countercyclical capital buffer, when the latter is applied) will face constraints on dividends, equity repurchases and compensation based on the amount of the shortfall. 
     Under the Basel III Capital Rules, the minimum capital ratios, with the capital conversation buffer, as of January 1, 2017 are as follows:
    
· | 5.75% CET1 to risk-weighted assets;
--+------------------------------------


· | 7.25% Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets; and
--+--------------------------------------------------


· | 9.25% Total capital to risk-weighted assets.
--+---------------------------------------------

      Certain regulatory capital ratios for the Company as of December 31, 2016, are shown below:
    
· | 12.4% CET1 to risk-weighted assets;
--+------------------------------------


· | 13.9% Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets;
--+----------------------------------------------


· | 14.7% Total capital to risk-weighted assets; and
--+-------------------------------------------------


· | 9.8% leverage ratio.
--+---------------------

      Certain regulatory capital ratios for the Bank as of December 31, 2016, are shown below:

      Volcker Rule
 On December 10, 2013, the Federal Reserve, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the FDIC, the CFTC and the SEC issued final rules to implement the Volcker Rule contained in section 619 of the Dodd‑Frank Act. On July 7, 2016, the FRB granted a one‑year extension to July 21, 2017 and confirm investments in and relationships with covered funds that were in place prior to December 31, 2013 (“Legacy Covered Funds”).  This was the last of the three one-year extendsions that the FRB was authorized to issue.  With respect to all other investments in and relationships with convered funds other than Legacy Covered Funds, the Volcker Rule became effective July 21, 2015.
 The Volcker Rule prohibits an insured depository institution and its affiliates from: (i) engaging in “proprietary trading” and (ii) investing in or sponsoring certain types of funds (“covered funds”) subject to certain limited exceptions. The rule also effectively prohibits short‑term trading strategies by any U.S. banking entity if those strategies involve instruments other than those specifically permitted for trading and prohibits the use of some hedging strategies.
 Under these rules and subject to certain exceptions, banking entities, including the Company and the Bank, will be restricted from engaging in activities that are considered proprietary trading and from sponsoring or investing in certain entities, including hedge or private equity funds that are considered “covered funds.” Certain collateralized debt obligations (“CDO”) securities backed by trust preferred securities were initially defined as covered funds subject to the investment prohibitions of the final rule. Action taken by the Federal Reserve in January 2014 exempted many such securities to address the concern that community banks holding such CDO securities may have been required to recognize losses on those securities. Banks with less than $10 billion in total consolidated assets, such as the Bank, that do not engage in any covered activities, other than trading in certain government agency, state or municipal obligations, do not have any significant compliance obligations under the rules implementing the Volcker Rule.
 Office of Foreign Assets Control Regulation
 The United States has imposed economic sanctions that affect transactions with designated foreign countries, nationals and others which are administered by the U.S. Treasury Department Office of Foreign Assets Control. Failure to comply with these sanctions could have serious legal and reputational consequences, including causing applicable bank regulatory authorities not to approve merger or acquisition transactions when regulatory approval is required or to prohibit such transactions even if approval is not required. Incentive Compensation
 The Dodd‑Frank Act requires the federal bank regulatory agencies and the SEC to establish joint regulations or guidelines prohibiting incentive‑based payment arrangements at specified regulated entities having at least $1 billion in total assets.  The regulations must prohibit compensation that encourages inappropriate risks by providing an executive officer, employee, director or principal stockholder with excessive compensation, fees, or benefits that could lead to material financial loss to the entity. In addition, these regulations or guidelines must require enhanced disclosure of incentive‑based compensation arrangements to regulators. The agencies proposed the regulations in April 2011, but the regulations were not finalized. In 2016 the federal agencies re-proposed these rules with some modifications.
 In June 2010, the FRB and the FDIC issued comprehensive final guidance on incentive compensation policies intended to ensure that the incentive compensation policies of banking organizations do not undermine the safety and soundness of such organizations by encouraging excessive risk‑taking. The guidance, which covers all employees that have the ability to materially affect the risk profile of an organization, either individually or as part of a group, is based upon the key principles that a banking organization’s incentive compensation arrangements should (i) provide incentives

that do not encourage risk‑taking beyond the organization’s ability to effectively identify and manage risks, (ii) be compatible with effective internal controls and risk management, and (iii) be supported by strong corporate governance, including active and effective oversight by the organization’s board of directors. These three principles are incorporated into the proposed joint compensation regulations under the Dodd‑Frank Act, discussed above. The FRB will review, as part of its regular, risk‑focused examination process, the incentive compensation arrangements of banking organizations, such as the Company, that are not “large, complex banking organizations.” These reviews will be tailored to each organization based on the scope and complexity of the organization’s activities and the prevalence of incentive compensation arrangements. The findings of the supervisory initiatives will be included in reports of examination. Deficiencies will be incorporated into the organization’s supervisory ratings, which can affect the organization’s ability to make acquisitions and take other actions. Enforcement actions may be taken against a banking organization if its incentive compensation arrangements, or related risk‑management control or governance processes, pose a risk to the organization’s safety and soundness and the organization is not taking prompt and effective measures to correct the deficiency.
 Future Legislation
 Since the U.S. federal elections in November 2016, there has been significant discussion regarding financial regulatory reform. For example, in February 2017, President Trump issued an executive order calling for his administration to review existing U.S. financial laws and regulations in order to determine their consistency with a set of “core principles” of financial policy.  Additionally, the Financial CHOICE Act, which was introduced in the House Financial Services Committee, would make changes to the Dodd-Frank Act such as providing a Dodd-Frank Act off-ramp for highly-rated banking organizations that satisfy a heightened leverage ratio requirement, repealing the Volcker Rule and Durbin Amendment, revamping the CFPB and eliminating or substantially modifying the federal banking agencies’ authority to exercise extraordinary powers during a financial crises.
 In addition to the specific legislation described above, various additional legislation is currently being considered by Congress. This legislation may change banking statutes and the Company’s operating environment in substantial and unpredictable ways and may increase reporting requirements and governance. If enacted, such legislation could increase or decrease the cost of doing business, limit or expand permissible activities, or affect the competitive balance among banks, savings associations, credit unions, and other financial institutions. The Company cannot predict whether any potential legislation will be enacted and, if enacted, the effect that it, or any implementing regulations, would have on its business, results of operations, or financial condition.
