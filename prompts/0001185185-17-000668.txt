Item 1.   Description of Business
 
Description of business, principal products, services and their markets
 
Acacia Diversified Holdings, Inc. (“we”, “us”, the “Company”, or the “Parent Company”) was incorporated in Texas on October 1, 1984 as Gibbs Construction, Inc. (“Gibbs”). The Company changed its name from Gibbs Construction, Inc. to Acacia Automotive, Inc. effective February 20, 2007. On October 18, 2012, the Company changed its name from Acacia Automotive, Inc. to Acacia Diversified Holdings, Inc. in an effort to exemplify the Company’s desire to expand into alternative industries as well as more diversified service and product offerings.  
 
On January 15, 2016, the Company acquired the assets and businesses of the MariJ Group of companies that included MariJ Agricultural, JR Cannabis Industries, LLC and Canna-Cures Research & Development Center, LLC.  The transaction has an effective date of January 4, 2016. On January 19, 2016 the Company filed a Current Report on Form 8-K announcing the acquisition. The Company subsequently filed expanded and updated information relating to that acquisition on its Amended Current Report on Form 8-K/A on April 25, 2016.  That document is available for viewing on the Company’s website at http://www.acacia.bz/sec/sec.htmand on the SEC website at:

Following the acquisition, the Company formed two new subsidiaries to conduct its new medical cannabis business activities, being MariJ Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (“MariJ Pharma”) and Canna-Cures Research & Development Center, Inc. (“Canna-Cures”).
 
MariJ Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

The impetus of the MariJ Pharma subsidiary, among many other initiatives, is its proprietary mobile CO2, supercritical cannabis oil extraction unit which was USDA certified Organic on September 28th, 2016, by OneCert, under the US National Organic Program; 7 CFR PART205. MariJ Pharma extracts and processes very high quality, high-cannabinoid profile content medical grade cannabis oils from medicinal cannabis plants.  MariJ specializes in organic strains of the plant where available, setting itself apart from the general producers of non-organic products.  

Currently, the Company is transacting business in the state of Colorado where its activities are deemed legal under the laws of such state.
 
Canna-Cures Research & Development Center, Inc.
 
The Company’s wholly-owned Canna-Cures Research & Development Center, Inc. subsidiary (Canna-Cures) engages in research and development activities as well as retail and wholesale distribution of medical cannabis products and dietary supplements.  As a part of its R&D efforts, Canna-Cures will seek to align itself with institutions of higher learning in working to develop new products and to identify and develop additional uses for its medical cannabis products.
 
Canna-Cures launched its first research and development center in Colorado. In conjunction with that opening, Canna-Cures officially launched the Dahlia’s Botanicals Endocannabinoid Nutraceuticals product line.  A portion of the proceeds from our Dahlia’s Botanicals line are awarded to the Canna Moms 501(c)(3) organization in support of its continuing public education and awareness campaign.
 
Distribution methods of the products and services
 
MariJ Pharma extracts and processes a very high quality, high-cannabinoid profile content medical grade cannabis oils from medicinal cannabis plants in its propriety mobile CO2, supercritical cannabis oil extraction unit which was USDA certified Organic on September 28th, 2016, by OneCert, under the US National Organic Program; 7 CFR PART205. The finished product is then delivered to its customers.
 
Canna-Cures sells medical cannabis oils, oil-infused products, and other merchandises primarily through its retail dispensaries in Colorado.

Status of any publicly announced new products or services
 
The Company’s business plan includes developing its proprietary GeoTrackingTechnology that is fully compliant with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability standard (“HIPAA”) utilizing its “plant to patient” solution. This GeoTraking Technology is designed to provide a full-channel patient care tracking system that is fully compliant under today’s strict HIPAA regulations that require privacy and security of the patient’s information. Beginning with RFID labeling and tracking of every single seed employed in the grow program and continuing through the sale of prescription products in a sophisticated retail Point of Sale delivery system, the GeoTraking Technology will be the most advanced system available.
 
 The Company also plans to enter into research and development projects with institutions of higher learning in efforts to:  (i) develop new and better strains of medical cannabis related products for dispensing as medications, nutraceuticals, cosmeceuticals, and potential dietary supplements; and (ii) provide private label packaging services; and (iii) sell additional medical cannabis oils, oil-infused products, and other merchandise through its web-based portal or retail dispensaries planned for that purpose; and (iv) sell cosmeceutical and nutraceutical products and dietary supplements containing its high-quality cannabis oil extracts.
 
The Company currently does not have sufficient working capital to pursue our business plan in its entirety as described herein. Our ability to implement our business plan will depend on our ability to obtain sufficient working capital and to fund our operations. No assurance can be given that we will be able to obtain additional capital, or, if available, that such capital will be available at terms acceptable to us, or that we will be able to generate profit from operations, or if profits are generated, that they will be sufficient to carry out our business plans, or that the plans will not be modified.


Competitive business conditions and the Company’s competitive position in the industry and methods of competition
 
Any industry served by the Company is likely to be highly competitive across the entire United States and the rest of the world. In particular, the cannabis industry, being the impetus of all the Company’s attention at this juncture, is very highly competitive and has drawn thousands of competing entities.  While the Company believes its technology, programs, and plans place it in a posture to compete at the highest levels, the sheer numbers of competitors must be recognized. The Company has elected to devote the majority of its efforts on production and sales of its products and services within the continental United States, but may institute operations in diverse countries.  Even so, the Company must be considered as currently competing with other companies in diverse countries that can potentially produce and sell competitive products at lower prices.  While the Company believes that there are other hurdles for those foreign entities to overcome, including the high cost of international shipping to U.S. buyers, we believe that they nonetheless can compete with us in our markets.  We will potentially compete with a variety of companies, both domestic and international, and as such will be subject to various levels of competition. There is no assurance the Company will be able to adhere to its plans or to engage in any acquisitions or mergers.  The Company will consider potential opportunities to buy, sell or distribute its products in other countries.
 
Sources and availability of raw materials and the names of principal suppliers
 
One of the ingredients used in the extraction process is carbon dioxide. MariJ Pharma depends on a supplier to supply high quality carbon dioxide. This supplier produces the highest quality carbon dioxide for the cannabis industry. If MariJ Pharma was not able to obtaining carbon dioxide from this supplier, it would need to look to other suppliers to supply this critical ingredient. However, the quality of the ingredient would suffer and the Company may not be able to obtain it at reasonable cost. At the present time, the Company is not anticipating a disruption of service by this supplier, whose identity we choose to keep confidential.
 
Dependence on one or a few major customers
 
In November 2016, MariJ Pharmaceuticals, Inc. entered into a service provider agreement with a USDA organic farm in northern Colorado.  The company has concluded its first 500lb contract and has executed a second 500lb contract, producing what the company believes to be the first USDA certified organic Hemp oil produced in America today.
 
During the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company’s revenues were concentrated on two customers who accounted for approximately 72% and 23%, of the total consolidated revenues, respectively.
 
Patents, trademarks, licenses, franchises, concessions, royalty agreements or labor contracts, including duration
 
The Company currently has patents pending, trademarks pending, and no franchises, concessions, royalty agreements or labor contracts. The Company intends to acquire, through its MariJ Pharma subsidiary, portions or complete ownership of licenses and grow operations in one or more states and is seeking to cultivate, organically extract and process its medicinal cannabis crops year around in indoor facilities.  The acquisition of these licenses is anticipated to provide the Company with the opportunity to compound medicinal products using mixtures of high cannabinoid profile oils that have very little hallucinogenic properties but have significantly improved medicinal properties.

Effect of existing or probable governmental regulations on the business
 
 A majority of the states that have legalized the growing, production, and use of cannabis oil have passed legislation authorizing the use of high-CBD content and low-THC content oils.  As a result, and in keeping with regulations and laws in those venues, the Company, through its subsidiaries, intends to concentrate on those products unless and until the laws change to facilitate a wider range of grow and production opportunities.  The Company does have the technology and capability of extracting high-THC oils in those venues that do allow it, and will provide services to growers in those areas as contracted.
 
The Company, through its new subsidiaries, will operate in the medical cannabis sector.  In order to help our shareholders better understand the products we intend to employ in our business plans, we have provided certain explanations and definitions below.
 
The Company will initially extract and process a derivative of the cannabis plant known as CBD oil. CBD is one of dozens of compounds found in cannabis plants that belong to a class called cannabinoids. Of these compounds, CBD, CBG, CBN, CBC and THC are usually present in the highest concentrations, and have the most common practical applications in the medical field.  The Company’s subsidiaries currently give most attention to high-CBD/low-THC products.  Marijuana, unlike most modern day medicine, contains a wide range of chemical compounds. Scientists have identified to date, over 114 unique molecules in cannabis known as cannabinoids, which include THC and CBD. Many other non-cannabinoid compounds are produced by the plant, but these are the compounds that are most addressed as having a use by the medical community.
 
Terpenes, the molecules responsible for marijuana’s smell, among other things, have been shown to block some cannabinoid receptor sites in the brain while promoting cannabinoid binding in others. As a result, terpenes are believed to affect many aspects of how the brain takes in THC or CBD, while offering various therapeutic benefits of their own. In fact, while THC has gotten most of the attention, studies suggest many of the compounds in marijuana work together to produce a synergy of effects. This is known as the “entourage effect.”
 
CBD and THC levels tend to vary between different strains and varieties of cannabis.  By using selective breeding techniques, certain growers have managed to create varieties with high levels of CBD, CBG and THC, being the varieties currently employed for oil production by the Company’s MariJ Pharmaceuticals subsidiary.  That subsidiary also specialized in extracting oil from certified organic plants, rather than the standard non-organic varieties.
 
Unlike THC; CBD, CBG, CBC, and CBN do not cause a high or hallucinogenic effect. The reason why CBD is non-psychoactive is due to its lack of affinity for CB1 receptors, such as are found in high concentrations in the brain, and which become the channels through which THC is able to port its psychoactive effects.
 
Like most other companies in this industry, we are subject to various business regulations, permits and licenses. The Company, through its new subsidiaries, has entered a new business realm that may entail considerably more regulation than its previous endeavors, and faces uncertainties related to federal laws that are in conflict with state laws in which the Company’s subsidiaries now operate or may operate in the future. It is possible that the federal government will ease its regulations relating to the cannabis industry, or even legalize the operation of and transporting of products resulting from business operations in that sector.  However, it is also possible that the government may decide to harden its stance against cannabis related products.  In the event the federal government takes a harder stance against cannabis-related products, the Company could suffer impairment of its operations and could sustain substantial losses.  The Company cannot foresee what direction the federal government may take in these matters, if any, but sees continuing evidence that various states are legalizing cannabis products, both high-CBD/low-THC compounds as well as compounds containing high levels of THC for medicinal values. The Company believes that it has complied with appropriate state requirements for operations and believes it has obtained all permits necessary to function under the current state regulations where we have business operations.
 
The medical cannabis industry faces very uncertain regulation in the light of the continuing deregulation of cannabis products in many states, either as high-CBD/low-THC products, or as high-THC products, but the continuing regulation of the cannabis industry by the federal government.  While the federal government has for several years chosen to not intervene in the cannabis business conducted legally within the states that have legislated such activities, there is nonetheless the potential that the federal government may at any time choose to begin enforcing its laws against the manufacturing, possession, or use of cannabis-based products.  Similarly, there is the possibility that the federal government may enact legislation or rules that authorize the manufacturing, possession or use of those products under specific guidelines.  In the event the federal government was to tighten its regulation of the industry, the Company would likely suffer substantial losses.  In the event the federal government was to loosen or change its rules or laws in favor of the industry, the Company would have an opportunity to benefit substantially if it were properly positioned to take advantage of the new opportunities.

Inherent risks currently exist in this industry as a result of the determination by many nationally-chartered banks that they would be operating outside the federal laws by accepting deposits from cannabis oil producers.  Many states have legalized the growing, production, sale, and consumption of various cannabis related products, but the federal government has continued to take the position that such activities are not legal.  However, the federal government has taken the posture for years that it will defer to the states in those matters insofar as certain products, such as those containing a high concentration of THC, are not transported across state lines.  As such, many nationally-chartered banks fear prosecution under money-laundering or other statutes, relegating some businesses to maintain large sums of cash on hand, and meeting payrolls and accounts payable obligations with cash rather than checks.  As a result, those businesses are placed at high risk of internal and external theft and crimes relating to the lack of controls and security afforded by transactional banking.  The Company is currently utilizing various financial institutions for its deposit needs, but this still creates risks when the proceeds at diverse production locations, often themselves in cash due to the same issues, cannot be deposited in nearby accessible depositories.  The Company has acquired an armored vehicle for use in the transport of cash and cannabis products, but believes those risks will not be minimized until national depository institutions allow cannabis-related businesses to utilize their facilities.
 
Estimate of the amount of money spent during each of the last two fiscal years on research and development
 
The Company spent a de-minimus amount on research and development during its last two fiscal years.
 
Costs and effects of compliance with environmental laws
 
The cannabis industry, just like other industries, impacts our environment. Environmental laws relating to water rights, energy consumption, pollution, and overall carbon footprint all can and do impact the cannabis industry.
 
While some areas of environmental law focus on the protection of the environment, others are designed to control human use of natural resources by setting up a system of environmental approvals. Environmental laws cover topics such as chemicals and pesticides, climate change and energy, coastal, marine and fisheries management, farming and private land management, forestry, clearing vegetation, trees, marine, pollution, water, just to name a few. Given all the facets of both indoor, outdoor, and greenhouse cultivation, in addition to chemical-intensive extractions and infusions of marijuana products, it is easy to see why environmental laws are coming into play in the marijuana industry.
 
One of the most common environmental law issues for the cannabis industry is waste management. Most states that legalize some form of cannabis consumption strictly dictate the disposition and storage of the cannabis by-products, as well as the types of pesticides, soil amendments, and fertilizers that can be safely applied to marijuana crops.
 
However, fewer states have enacted laws dealing with the industry’s impact on water and air quality, but the industry is certainly under more scrutiny. In certain states, producers and processors must pay a fee to their local or state government and submit an application for a permit, provide information on odor control equipment for producing, growing, or processing and solvent usage information for each type.
 
Energy consumption by cannabis growers is also becoming an important issue. The significant use of electricity in indoor cannabis production has caused concerns for the carbon-footprint of its production. States may pass legislatures to regulate energy consumption by passing the cost of such effects and consumption onto the cannabis industry by instituting licensing and permitting fees.
 
Outdoor growers are not completely free of environmental concerns. They are also facing pressure under environmental laws because outdoor growing has led to deforestation, loss of wildlife, and erosion, and it often requires large amounts of water and pesticides.
 
Number of total employees and number of full-time employees
 
As of December 31, 2016, the Company had a total of eight employees, six of which are full time.
