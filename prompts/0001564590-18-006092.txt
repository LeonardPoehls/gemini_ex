ITEM 1. | BUSINESS
--------+---------

 RLJ Entertainment, Inc. (RLJE or the Company) is a premium digital channel company serving distinct audiences through its proprietary subscription-based digital channels, Acorn TV and UMC or Urban Movie Channel. Acorn TV features high-quality British and international mysteries and dramas. UMC showcases compelling urban programming including feature films, documentaries, original series, stand-up comedy and other exclusive content for African-American and urban audiences. The digital channels have consistently experienced substantial year-over-year growth rate since launch in 2011 and 2015, respectively. The table below shows quarterly subscriber growth from December 2015 to December 2017.

We exclusively control, co-produce, and own a large library of content primarily consisting of British mysteries and dramas, independent feature films and urban content. In addition to supporting our digital channels, the value of our content library is monetized through our intellectual property (or IP) licensing and wholesale distribution operations. These activities allow us to control all windows of exploitation of our content. Our IP licensing operations consist of content that we own and includes our 64% investment in Agatha Christie Ltd. (or ACL), while our wholesale distribution operations consist of content we license from others.
 Strategic Growth of the Company
 We expect to increase our subscriber growth to one million subscribers within 12 to 18 months. To that end, our growth initiatives include the following:
  
• | Development and acquisition of compelling, exclusive and original programming targeted to distinct audiences;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Continued promotional support of our digital channels and program releases;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Expansion of the distribution and geographic footprint of our digital channels; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Continued enhancement of our subscribers’ experience through continuously improving mobile apps and digital platforms.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We believe that the convergence of television (TV) and the internet will promote the continued migration of consumers from bundled offerings to a la carte subscriptions significantly benefitting digital over-the-top (or OTT) platforms like Acorn TV and UMC. As a result, we have aligned our goals to (i) continue to develop unique brands that appeal to and capture dedicated audiences, (ii) develop strong content offerings that consumers are willing to purchase and (iii) provide superior service. Our goal is to continue to develop strong media brands that are a preferred destination and a “must-have” subscription for our audiences.

Investments in Content
 We develop or acquire content that is intended to satisfy the desire of our niche audiences. We also acquire finished programs through long-term exclusive contracts. We invest in content that we believe will increase our digital channel subscribers’ interests and subscriptions as well as exceed our internal return-on-investment.
Sales and Marketing
 We maintain our own sales force and also direct selling relationships with the majority of our broadcast and cable/satellite partners and retail customers. Our in-house marketing department manages promotional efforts across a wide range of off-line and online platforms. 
Segments
 Management views our operations based on three distinct reporting segments: (1) the Digital Channels segment; (2) the IP Licensing segment; and (3) the Wholesale Distribution segment. Operations and net assets that are not associated with any of these operating segments are reported as “Corporate” when disclosing and discussing segment information. The Digital Channels segment distributes film and television content through our proprietary subscription-based digital channels, Acorn TV and UMC. The IP Licensing segment includes intellectual property rights that we own, produce and then license; and includes our 64% ownership of ACL. Our Wholesale Distribution segment consists of the worldwide exploitation of exclusive content in various formats including digital (download-to-rent and electronic sell-through, or EST), television video on demand (VOD) through cable and satellite, broadcast, streaming, and DVD and Blu-ray through third-party media and retail outlets. The Wholesale Distribution and IP Licensing segments exploit content to third parties such as Amazon, Best Buy, iTunes, Netflix, Target and Walmart.

Our Primary Brands 
 We focus on compelling British mystery and drama television, action and thriller independent feature films and diverse urban content, and documentaries. We exploit our titles through our various brands as follows:

Known for specializing in the best of British television, Acorn Media Group (or Acorn) monetizes high-quality dramas and mysteries via our digital channel Acorn TV in the United States (or U.S.) and Canada and to the broadcast/cable and home video windows within the North American, U.K. and Australian markets. In addition to consistently receiving strong national public relations coverage, our primary marketing to consumers is through Acorn TV offering viewers thousands of hours of compelling content including Acorn TV original productions and exclusive premieres of popular series. We further leverage the Acorn brand through a marketing and wholesale partnership with direct-to-consumer specialist Universal Screen Arts (or USA). USA purchases wholesale inventory from us and pays us a license fee for the exclusive right to publish a branded Acorn direct-to-consumer catalog and website (acornonline.com), which market and sell Acorn content on DVD and Blu-ray alongside complementary merchandise. Our Acorn brand generates revenues that are reported in the Digital Channels, IP Licensing (Agatha Christie revenues) and Wholesale Distribution segments (digital download and home video sales).

The bestselling novelist of all time, Agatha Christie has sold more than 2 billion books, and her work contains a variety of short story collections, more than 80 novels, 19 plays and a film library of over 100 TV productions. Acorn is known for mystery and drama franchises and has been releasing TV movie adaptations featuring Agatha Christie’s two most famous characters, Hercule Poirot and Miss Marple, for over a decade with both series ranking among our all-time bestselling lines. Through ACL, we manage the vast majority of Agatha Christie publishing and television/film assets worldwide and across all mediums and actively develop new content and productions. In addition to film and television projects, in 2014, ACL published its first book since the death of Agatha Christie, The Monogram Murders, and has subsequently published its second book, Closed Casket, in 2016.

The above-referenced trademarks, among others, are registered with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office and various international trademark authorities. In general, trademarks remain valid and enforceable as long as the marks are used in connection with the related products and services and the required registration renewals are filed. We believe our trademarks have value in the marketing of our products. It is our policy to protect and defend our trademark rights. 
 Outsourced Services
 Under a Distribution Services and License Agreement with Sony Pictures Home Entertainment (or SPHE), SPHE acts as our exclusive manufacturer in North America to meet our physical goods manufacturing requirements (DVD and Blu-ray) and to provide related fulfillme
nt and other logistics services in exchange for certain fees. Our agreement with SPHE expires in August 2019. SPHE also provides certain operational services, including credit and collections, merchandising, returns processing and certain information technology (IT) functions. Under our relationship with SPHE, we are responsible for the credit risk from the end customer with respect to accounts receivable and also the risk of inventory loss with respect to the inventory they manage on our behalf.
 On June 24, 2016, we entered into a licensing agreement with USA whereby USA took over our Acorn U.S. catalog/ecommerce business and became the official, exclusive, direct-to-consumer seller of Acorn product in the U.S. 
 In the U.S., we outsource our video delivery, streaming services and cloud hosting for our web portfolio and digital channels.
 In the U.K., we have a fulfillment and logistics services arrangement with Sony DADC UK Limited, which is similar to the arrangement we have with SPHE in North America. Australian fulfilment and logistics are provided by Regency Media Pty Ltd. 
 Seasonality
 Our subscriber growth and our Wholesale Distribution segment revenues exhibit a seasonal pattern. For our Digital Channels segment, the seasonality exists because of variations in when consumers buy internet-connected screens and when they tend to increase their viewing. For our Wholesale Distribution segment, the release timing of certain high-profile content as well as the holiday season impact the revenue stream. The fourth quarter typically represents our strongest quarter in terms of Wholesale Distribution segment revenues.
Competition 
 The market for entertainment video is intensely competitive and subject to rapid change. We face competition from other digital channels with similar genre and target audiences, independent distribution companies, major motion picture studios and broadcast and internet outlets in securing exclusive content distribution rights. 
 We also face competition from online and direct-to-consumer retailers, as well as alternative forms of leisure entertainment, including video games, the internet and other computer-related activities. Consumers can choose from a large supply of competing entertainment content from other suppliers. The success of any of our titles depends upon audience acceptance of a given program in relation to consumer tastes and cultural trends as well as the other titles released into the marketplace at or around the same time. Many of these competitors are larger than us. 
 Sales of digital downloading, streaming, VOD and other broadcast formats are largely driven by what is visually available to the consumer, which can be supported by additional placement fees or previous sales success. Programming is available online, delivered to smartphones, tablets, laptops, personal computers, or direct to the consumers’ TV set through multiple internet-ready devices, cable or satellite VOD and other subscription-based digital channels. For our physical wholesale distribution, our DVD and Blu-ray products compete for a finite amount of brick-and-mortar retail and rental shelf space.
 Our ability to continue to successfully compete in our markets is largely dependent upon our ability to develop and secure unique and appealing content, and to anticipate and respond to various competitive factors affecting the industry, including new or changing program formats, changes in consumer preferences, regional and local economic conditions, discount pricing strategies and competitors’ promotional activities.

According to The Digital Entertainment Group (or DEG), consumer home entertainment spending in calendar 2017 exceeded $20.5 billion, up 5% from 2016. This increase was driven by the 20% increase in total digital spending showing that consumers are continuing to build their digital film libraries.
 Total digital-format revenues include EST (digital ownership), VOD (digital rental) and subscription-based streaming. EST revenues for 2017 increased by 6% compared to 2016. VOD revenues decreased 7% in 2017 compared to 2016. Total subscription VOD increased by 31% in 2017 compared to 2016.
