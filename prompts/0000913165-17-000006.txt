ITEM 1. BUSINESS
We develop, manufacture, market, distribute and sell orthopaedic implant devices, related surgical instrumentation and biologic services to hospitals and physicians in the United States and internationally. Exactech was founded by an orthopaedic surgeon in November 1985, and is incorporated under the laws of the State of Florida. Our U.S. sales and distribution activities are conducted by our wholly owned subsidiary Exactech U.S., Inc. Our international development, sales and distribution activities are conducted by our wholly owned subsidiary Exactech International Operations, AG based in Bern, Switzerland. Our revenues are principally derived from sales and distribution of our joint replacement systems, including knee, hip, and extremity implant systems, and distribution of biologic products and services and bone cement materials used in orthopaedic surgery and dental procedures.
We manufacture some components of our knee, extremity, and hip joint replacement systems at our facility in Gainesville, Florida, utilizing modern, highly automated computer aided manufacturing equipment. Our cell-based manufacturing processes, which are organized in groups, or cells, are dedicated to specific product lines to minimize change-over and increase efficiency, and are designed to help us reduce our production cycle times while permitting flexibility to adjust quickly to changes in demand. To supplement our manufacturing of components, we have formed strategic alliances with suppliers and business partners to externally manufacture some components. Additionally, we acquire and distribute other products and services through exclusive agreements, such as our agreement with Tecres® S.p.A, (Tecres), and non-exclusive agreements, such as with RTI Surgical, Inc., (RTI), and Biomatlante SARL, (Biomatlante).
Orthopaedic Products Industry 
According to a research report published in 2016 by Orthoworld, Inc., the worldwide market for orthopaedic products in 2015 was estimated to be nearly $46.6 billion, which represented an increase of 1.2% from the previous year. According to this research report, the markets for the three primary market segments in which we offer our products and services, reconstructive devices, orthobiologics and other products (which includes instrumentation and other orthopaedic products), were estimated to be $16.5 billion, $4.6 billion and $6.2 billion, respectively, during 2015. According to this report, continued increases in population and rapidly-growing international markets, will continue to drive the need for musculoskeletal care and the growth in sales volumes. However, pricing pressures and the volatility of other currencies compared to the U.S. dollar negated much of the growth in the volume of procedures during 2015. Management continues to believe that the industry will continue to grow due to an aging population in much of the world. Increasing life spans and lifestyles impact the number of individuals with joints subject to failure, thereby increasing demand for joint replacement procedures. 
Products 
Our joint replacement products are used by orthopaedic surgeons to repair or replace joints that have deteriorated as a result of injury or disease. Reconstructive joint surgery involves modification of the area surrounding the affected joint and insertion of a set of manufactured implant components to replace or augment the joint. During surgery, the surgeon removes damaged cartilage and a portion of the bones that comprise the joint, prepares the remaining bone surfaces and surrounding tissue and then installs the implant. When necessary, the surgeon uses biologic solutions to repair bone defects and provide an environment to stimulate new growth. In many joint replacement procedures, acrylic bone cement is used to affix implant components to the prepared bone surfaces. Biologic solutions can be one of the treatments used in conjunction with the other implants to enhance the potential for a successful result.

Extremities Products. The Equinoxe® Platform Shoulder System continues to be one of the fastest growing shoulders on the market by delivering clinically relevant solutions with streamlined instrumentation. The product family includes treatment options for both degenerative disease (anatomic and reverse total shoulder systems) as well as trauma (platform fracture stem and fracture plate).
Our anatomic system utilizes a patented replicator plate, which allows for independent adjustment of all four anatomic parameters in situ (assembled inside the body). The Equinoxe is a platform system, convertible to a reverse without removal of a well-fixed stem. In keeping with our philosophy of delivering clinical results, a multicenter study found that, compared to our competitors, our reverse shoulder achieved a sevenfold reduction in scapular notching, which is one of the main complications of the procedure.
We offer unique bone preserving glenoid solutions that further differentiate our system, including our newest option - the superior/posterior augment baseplate.
In 2015, we began implanting the Humeral Reconstruction Stem, which is a specialized solution for oncology and revision settings.  This stem, when combined with our reverse components, offers surgeons the only reverse solution for patients with massive bone loss in the proximal humerus. During 2016, we fully launched this stem in the United States.
In 2016, we received our CE mark and performed the first ExactechGPS shoulder surgeries in Europe, which we believe is an exciting advance for surgeons and patients. Surgeons can pre-operatively plan a surgery and then take that plan into the operating room, visualize the patients CT scan, as well as adjust and execute the plan intra-operatively with computer assistance.
Knee Products. Exactech Knee Systems provide comprehensive solutions for partial, primary and revision total knee arthroplasty. With clinically proven implant designs, proprietary materials, intuitive instrumentation and computer-assisted surgical technology, these systems empower orthopaedic surgeons to personalize their workflow and manage a wide variety of clinical challenges for reproducible results, case after case.
All of our knee implant systems feature design elements that have been proven for more than four decades, as well as proprietary, net compression molded polyethylene inserts, which are designed to minimize surface damage and wear rates, and ultimately improve the longevity of the knee prosthesis.
For primary knee replacement, the Optetrak Logic® system offers implant solutions for both posterior stabilized, or PS, and cruciate retaining, or CR, approaches. The bone-preserving PS system is designed to maximize stability and range of motion while providing surgeons an easier, faster and more consistent notch preparation. The CR system enables surgeons to plan and perform total knee replacement based on the anatomical and functional integrity of the posterior cruciate ligament; the system features a unique Posterior Cruciate Referencing Technique (PCRT) and CR Slope® technology. The portfolio also offers two constrained inserts, PSC and CRC, to allow surgeons to easily transition to increased constraint without additional bone preparation, and for surgeons who prefer a non-cemented option, a press-fit femoral component with a unique 3-D structural lattice of irregular shaped particles is available. 
3

In order to better meet the demand for revision surgeries, we began our initial launch of a new revision knee system in 2015. In 2016, we continued to expand the platform with the addition of offset couplers for proper component alignment and metaphyseal cones for easier bone defect management. The comprehensive system offers implant choices orthopaedic surgeons need to address the unique challenges in revision knee arthroplasty, and the system additionally provides an efficient approach to aligning components to deliver reproducibility using a more streamlined technique. The new and improved system incorporates the clinically proven design philosophies found in the primary system, and its intuitive instrumentation features easy-to-read laser markings, which are designed to provide surgeons with visual, audible and tactile feedback throughout each case. 
We continue to expand the applications to support ExactechGPS® Guided Personalized Surgery, a compact computer assisted surgery system that delivers efficiency and reproducibility in total joint replacement. In 2016, we began to pilot the RTKA application that complements our revision knee system. The next generation features a new tablet-sized computer and touch screen unit, merging sophisticated technology with innovative instrumentation to offer a real-time, patient-specific solution for improved patient outcomes. In addition, we provide a comprehensive range of advanced instrumentation options, including low profile instrumentation (LPI®), patella preparation, posterior referencing and a ligament balancing system (LBSIII).
We also continue to support our classic Optetrak® knee system, a cruciate ligament sparing, posterior stabilized and a high flexion component, a unicondylar system and a constrained condylar design for revision surgery. Internationally, we continue our expansion of the Optetrak Logic system including the rotating bearing knee system-Optetrak Logic RBK®.
Hip Products. Our hip solutions address the continuum of hip arthroplasty. For primary hip reconstruction, the Novation® system features both splined and tapered press-fit femoral stems as well as collared, matte finish cemented stems. The Novation CFS® cemented and press-fit femoral components, as well as unipolar and bipolar endoprostheses, are often used for the treatment of hip fractures as well as for complex primary hip surgery. They use the same core instruments that support Novation tapered and splined preparation, which allows for simple preparation and utilization of the same instrumentation for both low- and high-demand stems.
We expanded our hip portfolio with the introduction of the Alteon® brand, and now encompasses two new femoral solutions-the Tapered Wedge Femoral Stem and Neck Preserving Femoral Stem. The Tapered Wedge is a single taper, wedge-style stem. It incorporates specific design features to achieve immediate axial and rotational mechanical stability between the medial and lateral cortices of the femoral canal. The Neck Preserving Stem is a short femoral stem that shares the proven features of conventional stems, but designed to conserve more bone. These two stems share a set of core femoral instruments, allowing for an easier transition and reduced instrumentation in the operating room.
Our Novation Element® wedge stem features Exactech's signature neck geometry and is designed to provide surgeons with excellent initial stability and long-term fixation when paired with our standard instrumentation or A+ Instrumentation™ for the direct anterior approach.
The Crown Cup® acetabular system for primary, complex primary and revision hip arthroplasties features our third generation porous material, InteGrip™, which is manufactured with a titanium alloy through a unique manufacturing method known as Electron Beam Melting. Exactech was the first U.S. orthopaedic device company to offer FDA-cleared orthopaedic implants manufactured through this proprietary process. Crown Cup also features GXL polyethylene liners, which minimize wear debris. The Novation ceramic AHS® Crown Cup is designed to minimize osteolysis by utilizing an alumina ceramic bearing that provides significantly lower wear debris generation over traditional bearing surfaces.
In 2015, Exactech launched the Alteon Monobloc Revision Stem. This stem is a press-fit, distally fixed, one-piece tapered, splined titanium stem. It incorporates specific philosophies designed to improve surgical experiences and clinical outcomes. The Monobloc Revision Femoral Stem intends to achieve axial and rotational mechanical stability and operative predictability through a carefully engineered combination of design features. 
Biologics and Spine. We manufacture and distribute various products and services designed for the healing and regeneration of bone and soft tissue, including products which contain human allograft.  We have maintained a distribution relationship with RTI since 1998 for the marketing of its Opteform® and Optefil® product lines of Demineralized Bone Matrix.
Additionally, we market a platform of Demineralized Bone Matrix products, under the brand name Optecure®.  The product also contains a synthetic bioabsorbable polymer carrier material initially licensed from Genzyme Corp. 
4

Additionally, a product line extension was introduced to the Optecure brand that combines Demineralized Bone Matrix with additional allograft product within the formulation (Optecure®+CCC). We market OpteMx®, a Tri-Calcium Phosphate/Hydroxyapatite based synthetic bone graft substitute, licensed under a non-exclusive U.S. distribution agreement with Biomatlante.
Accelerate® is a platelet concentrating system that offers high platelet yields through gentle centrifugal action, which preserves the fragile buffycoat layer. This easy-to-use system provides a fast and convenient method for processing PRP at the point of care from a small amount of patient’s blood (PRP/PRP-S systems) or concentrating cells at the point of care from a patient’s bone marrow (BMC system).
We also distribute Ossigen®, a 3D matrix of collagen and an organic bone mineral processed into blocks for surgical implantation for the repair of bony defects in the spine, extremities and pelvis that may be hydrated with autogenous bone marrow at the point of use.
Ossilix®, a next generation calcium phosphate bone cement indicated for filling bony defects in cancellous bone, is one of the newer biologics solutions distributed by Exactech.
Effective January 31, 2017, we sold our spine assets and discontinued the sale of spine products domestically. Our Spine Division was focused on the development and commercialization of products intended to stabilize spinal motion segments for the purpose of promoting spinal fusion.
Other Products. The Cemex® bone cement system features a unique, self-contained delivery system that has been clinically proven in Europe for more than three decades. By integrating bone cement powder and liquid into an enclosed mixing system, Cemex is designed to offer surgeons and operating room personnel simplicity, safety and reliability. Product offerings include Cemex Genta, a bone cement containing antibiotics and Cemex Fast, a quick-set cement, with or without antibiotic. The InterSpace® hip, knee and shoulder spacers are used in two stage revision procedures and provide orthopaedic surgeons with a unique and convenient way to treat this difficult problem, including a high release antibiotic version of the InterSpace hip, knee and shoulder spacers. We distribute Cemex in the United States and Canada under an exclusive distribution agreement with the Italian manufacturer, Tecres.
The AcuDriver® Automated Osteotome System is an air-driven impact handpiece that surgeons can use during joint implant revision procedures to effectively remove failed prostheses and bone cement. The AcuDriver accomplishes this by providing the surgeon with precise positioning without the inconvenience and inconsistency of striking the osteotome, a cement removal tool, with a mallet.
Marketing and Sales 
We market our orthopaedic implant products in the United States through Exactech U.S., Inc., which operates through a network of independent sales agencies and direct sales representatives. These organizations, along with their independently contracted personnel, serve as our sales representatives. Internationally, Exactech International Operations markets our products through a network of independent distributors and our wholly owned foreign subsidiaries that distribute products and services in more than 35 countries. The customers for our products are hospitals, surgeons and other physicians and clinics.
We generally have contractual arrangements with our independent sales organizations that grant the exclusive right to sell our products in a specified territory. In turn, we require that the sales organizations meet certain sales quotas. We typically pay our sales agencies a commission based on net sales. We are highly dependent on the expertise and customer service effectiveness of our independent sales force. Our U.S. sales organization is managed by Regional Vice Presidents of Sales who are assigned to regions throughout the United States. We currently offer our products in all fifty states, Puerto Rico, and the District of Columbia. Our international subsidiaries purchase inventory from Exactech International Operations, our international headquarters, and utilize a network of employees and independent sales representatives to distribute our products and services in their respective territories outside the United States.
We provide our U.S. sales organizations inventories of our products, which remain in their possession until sold or returned to us. These inventories are necessary for sales representatives to market our products and fill customer orders. Because the size of a particular component for a specific patient is typically not known with certainty until the time of surgery, a minimum of one of each size of each component in the system to be used must be available to the surgeon at the time of each particular surgery. Accordingly, we must incur significant expenditures in order to maintain the necessary levels of inventory. Our failure to maintain required levels of inventory could have a material adverse effect on our operations. Because we must maintain substantial levels of inventory, we are subject to the risk of inventory obsolescence. In the event that a substantial portion of our inventory becomes obsolete, it would have a 
5

material adverse effect on our results of operations and liquidity. Because we also must maintain all sizes of surgical implants, we have implant sizes that are slow moving, and may become obsolete or expire, and as such we record an allowance charge for the slow moving inventory. We review our inventory for obsolescence on a regular basis and record an allowance to reduce the carrying value of our inventory when necessary. 
Similar to the U.S. operations, we generally have contractual arrangements with our international distributors that grant them the exclusive right to market our products in a specified territory, and we require that these distributors meet certain sales quotas. International distributors typically purchase product inventory and instruments from us for their use in marketing, consigning inventory for surgery, and filling customer orders. We have wholly owned subsidiaries operating in China, France, Japan, Spain, Germany, Taiwan, Switzerland, Australia and the United Kingdom.
Financial Information about Geographic Areas
For the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, international sales accounted for $80.8 million, $73.7 million, and $82.8 million, respectively, representing approximately 31%, 30% and 33%, respectively, of our net sales. We intend to expand our sales in international markets in which there is increasing demand for orthopaedic implant products. We anticipate increasing our reliance on direct sales efforts through subsidiaries. Total inventory and long-lived assets held outside the United States as of December 31, 2016 and 2015 aggregated $73.3 million and $71.2 million, respectively.
Manufacturing and Supply 
Early in our history, third-party vendors manufactured all of our component parts, while we internally performed product design, quality assurance and packaging. For the past fifteen years, our strategy has been to develop and expand our own internal manufacturing and supply chain capabilities. We have done this through strategically creating state-of-the-art cell-based manufacturing processing, and utilizing highly automated, computer-aided production and inspection equipment.
Our manufacturing process typically involves the final machining of semi-completed raw materials of both our metal and polyethylene, or compression molded plastic, components that make up our joint replacement systems. After parts are machined, they are inspected and processed for final polishing and finishing as needed. Prior to packaging, our parts are inspected again to ensure that they are within approved specifications. Packaged finished parts are then made sterile and ready for surgery through gamma irradiation performed by an outside vendor.
We currently manufacture approximately 64% of our knee, hip, and shoulder implant components at our facility and headquarters in Gainesville, Florida, and in two facilities we operate in Sarasota, Florida, which is slightly lower than the 66% manufacturing percentage in 2015, and represents an actual increase in total volume of products manufactured. With the increase of internal manufacturing, we have experienced a greater degree of control in reducing production costs, while improving response time, flexibility, and other time-saving activities related to continuous process improvement, and we expect this trend to continue. We also continually assess the quality, manufacturing capabilities, on time delivery and cost-effectiveness of our existing and potential vendors in an attempt to secure our supply chain and decrease dependency on key suppliers. For the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, we purchased approximately 20%, 23% and 24%, respectively, of our externally sourced component requirements from our top three suppliers. We typically do not maintain supply contracts with most of our manufacturers and we instead purchase components pursuant to purchase orders placed from time to time in the ordinary course of business. We continue to develop alternative sources for components. While we do not anticipate encountering difficulties in obtaining adequate supplies of components, we cannot provide assurance that we will continue to be able to obtain components under acceptable terms and in a timely manner. Order backlog is not a material aspect of our business. 
Our internal manufacturing, assembly, packaging and quality control operations are conducted at our principal offices in Gainesville, Florida. Components received from suppliers, as well as those manufactured internally, are examined by our personnel throughout the process and prior to assembly or packaging to ensure that our specifications and standards are maintained. 
Additionally, in two leased properties in Sarasota, Florida, we produce our net compression molded polyethylene bearings used in our Optetrak knee replacement system, as well as other instrument and implant components. These facilities are included in our ISO 13485:2003 certification.

Patents and Proprietary Technology; License and Consulting Agreements 
We hold U.S. and international patents covering several of our implant components, biologic materials technologies and some of our surgical instrumentation with lives ranging from five to seventeen years. We believe that patents and intellectual property will continue to be important to our business and in the orthopaedic industry overall. In this regard, we defend our intellectual property rights and believe that our patents and products do not and will not infringe patents or violate proprietary rights of others, however, it is possible that our existing patent rights may not be valid or that infringement of existing or future patents or proprietary rights may occur. If some of our intellectual property and/or agreements relating to our products were deemed invalid, then such invalidation could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. 
In connection with the development of our knee implant systems, we pay royalties to Dr. William Petty and Dr. Gary Miller, who are executive officers and principal shareholders of the Company. Dr. Petty also serves as the Chairman of our Board of Directors. Employment agreements entered into between us and each of Drs. Petty and Miller provide for the continuation of the royalty payments in addition to their regular compensation as executive officers. Compensation associated with these agreements is the only compensation paid by the company to Drs. Petty and Miller. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we paid royalties in the aggregate of $300,000, pursuant to these consulting agreements. 
We also pay royalties to a significant hospital customer, pursuant to a license agreement we entered into for its assistance in the development and promotion of our knee implant systems as well as the training of persons in the use of such systems. 
Research and Development 
During 2016, 2015 and 2014, we incurred $21.4 million, $19.4 million, and $18.4 million, respectively, in research and development expenses and we anticipate that research and development expenses will continue to increase. Our research and development efforts contributed to the successful release of product line extensions to the Novation and Alteon hip stem systems, Equinoxe shoulder systems, and the Optetrak knee system, and numerous new spine products, as well as design improvements targeted to improving internal manufacturing efficiency. Our research and development efforts continue to focus on implant product line extensions, advanced biologic materials, and extremity joint reconstruction.
As an important part of our research and development efforts to improve surgical effectiveness and efficiency, we were a party to a license and distribution agreement with Blue Ortho SAS ("Blue Ortho") to bring computer based technology to the surgical techniques used with our products. Blue Ortho is a France-based computer-assisted surgical technology development and manufacturing firm. We launched the primary knee application of this technology under the trade name Exactech GPS® (Guided Personalized Surgery) during 2013, and will be launching the revision knee and shoulder applications during 2017, and intend to develop shoulder and hip applications in the future. We acquired Blue Ortho in January 2015.
We believe that our purchase of intellectual property and product-line assets, augmented by additional development, provides a cost-effective and efficient way to bring products to market, and we expect to continue to do so in the future to complement our internal product development. 
Competition 
The orthopaedic device industry is highly competitive and dominated by a number of large companies with substantially greater financial and other resources. Our largest competitors in the orthopaedic market are DePuy Synthes, Inc., a division of Johnson and Johnson, Zimmer Biomet Inc., Stryker Corporation, and Smith and Nephew plc. According to “The Orthopaedic Industry Annual Report” for the year ended December 31, 2015, by Orthoworld, Inc., in 2015 these four companies had an estimated 55% of the total orthopaedic market share, including an estimated 79% of the global joint replacement segment. 
Companies in the industry compete on the basis of product features and design, innovation, service, the ability to maintain new product flow, and the strength of their distribution network and price. While price is a key factor in the orthopaedic market, there are other significant factors, including: surgeon preference, ease of use, clinical results, and service provided by us and our representatives.
7

Product Liability and Insurance 
We are subject to potential product liability risks that are inherent in the design, manufacture and distribution of orthopaedic implants and surgical instrumentation. We have implemented strict quality control measures and currently maintain product liability insurance in amounts that we believe are typical in the industry for similar companies. For our most recent three fiscal years, we experienced stable insurance premiums as a percentage of sales. We evaluate our levels of product liability insurance annually, as well as the amount of retention carried compared to other companies in the industry. Due to the volatility of the insurance marketplace, the value of the product liability insurance products delivered and the small number of providers of these products, there can be no guarantees as to whether we will be able to secure such coverage in the future at a reasonable cost, or at all. 
Government Regulation 
Healthcare Regulation
Healthcare is heavily regulated by the federal government and by state and local governments. The federal laws and regulations affecting healthcare change regularly thereby increasing the uncertainty and risk associated with any healthcare-related venture. During 2010, Congress enacted the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (jointly, the Affordable Care Act), and the government is in the process of implementing that legislation. The Affordable Care Act significantly affects device manufacturers, most notably through the imposition of a 2.3% medical device excise tax on the first sale or use of products within the United States and the Physician Payment Sunshine Act, which requires medical device manufacturers, among others, to annually report to the federal government any "payment or other transfer of value" to physicians and teaching hospitals. On December 18, 2015, the President signed into law the "Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes Act of 2015," which imposes a two-year moratorium on the medical device excise tax effective for sales made after December 31, 2015. The 2.3% excise tax on certain medical devices is scheduled to be reinstated for sales transacted after December 31, 2017.
The federal government regulates healthcare, in general, and Exactech, in particular, through various agencies, including but not limited to the following: (i) the FDA, which administers the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FD&C Act, as well as other relevant laws; (ii) the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, which administers the Medicare and Medicaid programs; (iii) the Office of Inspector General, or OIG, which enforces various laws aimed at curtailing fraudulent or abusive practices, including by way of example, the Anti-Kickback Statute, the physician self-referral prohibition, commonly referred to as the Stark law, the False Claims Act, the Anti-Inducement Law, the Civil Money Penalty Law, and the laws that authorize the OIG to exclude health care providers and others from participating in federal healthcare programs; and (iv) the Office of Civil Rights which administers the privacy aspects of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA. All of the aforementioned are agencies within the Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS. Healthcare is also provided to or regulated by, as the case may be, the Department of Defense through its TriCare program, the Department of Veterans Affairs under, among other laws, the Veterans Health Care Act of 1992, the Public Health Service within HHS under the Public Health Service Act, the Department of Justice through the Federal False Claims Act and various criminal statutes, and state governments under the Medicaid program and their internal laws regulating all healthcare activities.

I. | FDA Regulates the Design, Manufacture, and Distribution of Our Medical Devices

The FDA regulates medical devices and classifies medical devices into one of three classes. Devices are subject to varying levels of regulatory control depending on their class. In the United States, a company generally can obtain permission to distribute a new device in two ways. The first applies to Class I and II devices that are substantially equivalent to a device first marketed prior to May 28, 1976 or to another device marketed after that date, but which was substantially equivalent to a pre-May 28, 1976 device. To obtain FDA permission to distribute the device, a company generally must submit a pre-market notification application (a section 510(k) submission), and receive an FDA order finding substantial equivalence to a predicate device (pre-May 28, 1976 or post-May 27, 1976 device that was substantially equivalent to a pre-May 28, 1976 device) and permitting commercial distribution of that device for its intended use. If clinical data from human clinical trials are required to support the 510(k) submission, these data must be gathered in compliance with investigational device exemption (IDE) regulations. The FDA review process for pre-market notifications submitted pursuant to section 510(k) should take on average about 90 days, but recently it has taken longer and it can take substantially longer if the agency has concerns, and there is no guarantee that the agency will “clear” the device for marketing, in which case the device cannot be distributed in the United States. Nor is there any guarantee that the agency will deem the article subject to the 510(k) process, as opposed to the more rigorous pre-market approval (“PMA”) process described below.
8

The PMA process applies to a new device that is not substantially equivalent to a pre-May 28, 1976 product, is an implantable device, or is to be used in supporting or sustaining life or preventing impairment. These devices are normally Class III devices. Two steps of FDA approval generally are required before a company can market a product in the U.S. that is subject to approval as opposed to clearance. First, a company must comply with IDE regulations in connection with any human clinical investigation of the device. Second, the FDA must review the company's pre-market approval (PMA) application, which contains, among other things, clinical information acquired under the IDE. The FDA will approve the PMA application if it finds there is reasonable assurance the device is safe and effective for its intended use. The PMA process takes substantially longer than the 510(k) process.
We currently market medical devices that have been cleared for marketing by the FDA under the 510(k) process and approved for marketing through the PMA process. FDA approval or clearance, as the case may be, is always uncertain. The agency may refuse to clear or approve a device or it may do so, but restrict its intended uses to such a degree that manufacturing and distributing the device is not commercially viable.
We are registered with the FDA as a device establishment. As a result, we are subject to periodic inspection by the FDA for compliance with the FDA's Quality System Regulation requirements and other regulations. The Medical Device Reporting regulations require that we provide information to the FDA whenever there is evidence to reasonably suggest that a device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or, if a malfunction were to occur, could cause or contribute to a death or serious injury. In addition, the FDA prohibits us from promoting a medical device for unapproved or non-cleared indications. The FDA, in the course of enforcing the FD&C Act, may subject a company to various sanctions for violating FDA regulations or provisions of the Act, including requiring recalls, issuing Warning Letters, seeking to impose civil money penalties, seizing devices that the agency believes are non-compliant, seeking to enjoin distribution of a specific type of device or other product, seeking to revoke an approval or clearance, seeking disgorgement of profits, and seeking to criminally prosecute a company and its officers and other responsible parties.
In many of the foreign countries in which we market our products, we are subject to local regulations affecting, among other things, design and product standards, packaging requirements and labeling requirements. Many of the regulations applicable to our devices and products in these countries are similar to those of the FDA. The member countries of the European Union have adopted the European Medical Device Directive, which creates a single set of medical device regulations for products marketed in all member countries. Compliance with the Medical Device Directive and certification to a quality system enable the manufacturer to place a CE mark on its products. To obtain authorization to affix the CE mark to a product, a recognized European Notified Body must assess a manufacturer's quality systems and the product's conformity to the requirements of the Medical Device Directive. We are subject to inspection by the Notified Bodies for compliance with these requirements. It should be noted that countries within the EU also retain jurisdiction to impose additional requirements on a device manufacturer.
There are also requirements of state, local and foreign governments that we must comply with in the manufacture and marketing of our products.

II. | Medicare and Medicaid Reimbursement Levels Are Uncertain and Subject to Change

Medicare reimburses for medical devices in a variety of ways depending on where and how the device is used. Under Medicare prospective payment system, devices sold to hospitals and used in connection with treating an inpatient are not separately reimbursable by Medicare. Reduction in payments to hospitals under Medicare Part A (inpatient) or restrictions in coverage for those procedures using our devices would adversely affect us. Usually, Medicaid pays less than Medicare, assuming that the state covers the service. In addition, private payers, including managed care payers, increasingly are demanding discounted fee structures and the assumption by healthcare providers of all or a portion of the financial risk. Efforts to impose greater discounts and more stringent cost controls upon healthcare providers, e.g., physicians, by private and public payers are expected to continue.
Significant limits on the scope of services covered or on reimbursement rates and fees on those services that are covered could have a material adverse effect on our ability to commercialize our products and therefore, on our liquidity and financial condition.
On November 24, 2015, CMS published its Comprehensive Care for Joint Replacement Payment Model for Acute Care Hospitals Furnishing Lower Extremity Joint Replacement Services, or CJR Rule, which dramatically affects the way in which Medicare pays hospitals for joint replacement surgery, which is the type of surgery that uses many of our devices, such as hips and knees. Under this Rule, hospitals will receive a single bundled payment to cover both inpatient surgical and outpatient post-surgical services, such as rehabilitation. The CJR Rule is supposed to test whether bundled payments to acute care hospitals for lower extremity joint replacement episodes of care will reduce Medicare expenditures while preserving or enhancing the quality of care for Medicare beneficiaries. Although device 
9

manufacturers are not directly included in the CJR Rule, as are rehabilitation facilities and skilled nursing homes, it is likely that this Rule will have an economic impact on those that manufacture hips, knees and devices related to their surgical implantation. We are in the process of evaluating the impact of the CJR Rule on our business.

III. | We Must Comply with Anticorruption, Anti-Fraud and Abuse Rules Which Are Vigorously Enforced Throughout the World

There are extensive federal and state laws and regulations prohibiting fraud and abuse in the healthcare industry, the violation of which can result in significant criminal and civil penalties, including exclusion from participation in federal reimbursement programs that can materially affect us. These federal laws include, by way of example, the following:

• | The Anti-Kickback Statute (Section 1128B(b) of the Social Security Act) prohibits certain business practices and relationships that might affect the provision and cost of healthcare services reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs, including the payment or receipt of remuneration for the referral of patients whose care will be paid in whole or in part by Medicare or other governmental programs;


• | Most countries in which we operate have some form of an anti-corruption law, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act in the United States and the UK Bribery Act in the United Kingdom. These laws generally prohibit payments to foreign government officials or others to assist in obtaining or retaining business; 


• | The physician self-referral prohibition (Ethics in Patient Referrals Act of 1989, as amended, commonly referred to as the Stark Law, Section 1877 of the Social Security Act), which prohibits referrals by physicians of Medicare or Medicaid patients to providers of a broad range of designated healthcare services in which the physicians (or their immediate family members) have ownership interests or with which they have certain other financial arrangements;


• | The anti-inducement law (Section 1128A(a)(5) of the Social Security Act), which prohibits providers from offering anything to a Medicare or Medicaid beneficiary to induce that beneficiary to use items or services covered by either program;


• | The False Claims Act (31 U.S.C. § 3729 et seq.), which prohibits any person from knowingly presenting or causing to be presented false or fraudulent claims for payment to the federal government or federal contractor or grantee (including the Medicare and Medicaid programs); and


• | The Civil Monetary Penalties Law (Section 1128A of the Social Security Act), which authorizes the United States Department of Health and Human Services to impose civil penalties administratively for fraudulent or abusive acts.

Sanctions for violating these federal laws include criminal and civil penalties that range from punitive sanctions, damage assessments, money penalties, imprisonment, to denial of Medicare and Medicaid payments, or exclusion from the Medicare and Medicaid programs or both.
Many states have adopted or are considering legislative proposals similar to the federal fraud and abuse laws, some of which extend beyond the Medicare and Medicaid programs to prohibit the payment or receipt of remuneration for the referral of patients and physician self-referrals regardless of whether the service was reimbursed by Medicare or Medicaid. Many states have also adopted or are considering legislative proposals to increase patient protections, such as limiting the use and disclosure of patient specific health information. These state laws also impose criminal and civil penalties similar to the federal laws.
In the ordinary course of their business, medical device manufacturers and suppliers have been and are subject regularly to inquiries, investigations and audits by federal and state agencies that oversee these laws and regulations. Recent federal and state legislation has greatly increased funding for investigations and enforcement actions which have increased dramatically over the past several years. This trend is expected to continue. See Item 1A. Risk Factors for discussion on our compliance activities related to the Corporate Integrity Agreement with the OIG. Private enforcement of healthcare fraud also has increased due in large part to amendments to the civil False Claims Act in 1986 that were designed to encourage private persons to sue on behalf of the government.
As federal and state budget pressures continue, federal and state administrative agencies may also continue to escalate investigation and enforcement efforts to control fraud and abuse in governmental healthcare programs. A violation of any of these federal and state fraud and abuse laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on a suppliers' liquidity and financial condition. An investigation into the use of a device by physicians may dissuade physicians from 
10

either purchasing or using the device. This could have a material adverse effect on our ability to commercialize the device.

IV. | We May be Compelled to Comply with the Privacy Provisions of HIPAA

HIPAA, among other things, protects the privacy and security of individually identifiable health information by limiting its use and disclosure. HIPAA directly regulates “covered entities” (healthcare providers, insurers, and clearinghouses) and indirectly regulates “business associates” with respect to the privacy of patients' medical information. All entities that receive and process protected health information are required to adopt certain procedures to safeguard the security of that information. It is uncertain whether we would be deemed to be a covered entity under HIPAA, and, based on our current business model, it is unlikely that we would be a business associate. However, HIPAA was amended on February 17, 2009, as part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, to broaden the requirements imposed on covered entities and business associates, to authorize the imposition of civil money penalties and other penalties on those who violate HIPAA, and to authorize States to institute suit to protect the privacy under HIPAA of their citizens. Irrespective of whether we are deemed to be a covered entity or a business associate, we will likely be contractually required to physically safeguard the integrity and security of any patient information that we receive, store, create or transmit. Moreover, many states have privacy statutes that might apply to our operations, even if HIPAA does not. 
Environmental Law Compliance 
Our operations are subject to numerous and increasingly stringent federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations in the United States and other countries in which we operate concerning, among other things, the generation, handling, storage, transportation, treatment and disposal of toxic and hazardous substances and the discharge of pollutants into the environment. Environmental permits and controls are required for some of our manufacturing operations, and these permits are subject to modification, renewal and revocation by the issuing authorities. We do not have underground storage tanks, and we believe that our facilities are in material compliance with our permits and environmental laws and regulations. We do not believe that future environmental compliance will have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Our environmental capital expenditures and costs for environmental compliance may increase in the future as a result of changes in environmental laws and regulations or as a result of increased manufacturing activities at our facilities. We could be materially adversely affected by any failure to comply with environmental laws, including the costs of undertaking a clean-up at a site to which our wastes were transported.
Employees 
As of December 31, 2016, we employed 733 full-time employees. We have no union contracts and believe that our relationship with our employees is good.
