Item 1. Business.
Overview
 
We are engaged in the purchase, sale and distribution of semi-finished aluminum and steel products to a diverse customer base located in the Americas, Europe, Australia and New Zealand. We sell our products through our own marketing and sales personnel as well as through commission based independent sales agents located in North America and Europe. We purchase products from suppliers located throughout the world. Our three largest suppliers, PT. Alumindo Light Metal Industry Tbk (“PT. Alumindo”), Hulamin Ltd., Southeast Aluminium, furnished approximately 53% of our products during 2016 as compared to 56% of our products during 2015. While we generally place orders with our suppliers based upon orders that we receive from our customers, we also purchase material for our own stock, which we typically use for shorter term deliveries to our customers.

Growth Strategy
 
We believe that our long-term growth will depend upon understanding our customers’ particular requirements and delivering a high-level of service and quality products that meet those requirements consistently. Our growth and profitability will also depend upon our ability to continue building our market knowledge and in particular our understanding of the production capabilities of our suppliers. We will also need to maintain, strengthen and expand our supplier relationships in light of continued pricing pressures. Finally, we will need to succeed in identifying and executing opportunities to provide our customers additional value added offerings, in both our existing markets and product offerings as well as in broader or new product groups and geographic areas.
 
Our strategy for growth consists of the following key elements:
 
Provide Customers with a High Level of Service and Cost Effective, Quality Products.  We work closely with our customers to understand their specific requirements. This work enables us to provide each customer with cost-effective, quality materials, matching that customer’s particular needs. We also provide various ancillary services to our customers, such as arranging for products to be stored in warehouse facilities for release to them on a just-in-time delivery basis, providing them with timely information about market trends and product development, arranging for subsequent metal processing or finishing services and making material available from our own stock to meet our customers’ short term requirements.  Our services are described more fully under “Sales, Marketing and Customer Service” below.
Expand Volumes and Product Breadth with Existing Suppliers and Customers. We continually seek to build on our market knowledge. We try to maintain a current understanding of our suppliers’ production capabilities and of our customers’ needs and markets. This understanding enables us to recognize opportunities to introduce new product lines to our customers and to increase volume from our suppliers.
Strengthen and Expand Our Supplier Relationships. We endeavor to continue building our supply sources, both by expanding our relationships with existing suppliers and by adding new suppliers. In cultivating supplier relationships, we emphasize our combination of market knowledge and customer base, which we believe makes us an effective marketing and distribution channel for our suppliers. Conversely, we believe that our supplier relationships position us to offer our customers a wider range of products and services.
Provide Increasingly Efficient and Cost-Competitive Handling and Delivery Services. We utilize our own warehouse and distribution facility in Baltimore County, Maryland that serves the dual purpose of providing depot/warehousing capacity for just-in-time delivery and providing handling capability and inventory control at the Baltimore, Maryland port of entry, our most active import location. This arrangement reduces freight and handling expenses, while increasing efficiency. It also enables us to monitor deliveries and serve customers more effectively.
Provide Additional Products and Value Added Services. We may add capability to provide our customers with additional value-added services such as processing, financing, warehousing and distribution services.
 
The Industry
 
The industry in which we operate is the sale and distribution of semi-finished aluminum and steel products. These products are manufactured worldwide by rolling facilities, some of which are owned by large integrated companies and others by independent producers. The majority of the products we purchase are in turn sold to distributors, who sell to varied metal working industries including the automotive, housing and packaging industries.
 
Although demand for aluminum products in the U.S. has been cyclical, over the longer-term, demand has continued to increase. We believe that this growth reflects general population and economic growth, and the advantages of aluminum products, including light weight and a high degree of formability, recyclability and resistance to corrosion. Demand for steel in the U.S. has been cyclical as well, and was negatively impacted in recent years by depressed construction markets and general economic conditions.
 
The metals distribution industry in which we operate is a highly fragmented industry. According to IBISWorld Inc. during 2016 the U.S. metals wholesale business generated revenues of approximately $153 billion, a 24% decline over 2015 revenues as metal prices declined approximately 17%. Our largest market area is the U.S., and our sales for the year ended 2016 were $339 million, a very small percentage of the overall market size.

Although trends within the industries above may impact overall demand for our products, we do not view our aluminum and steel sales in an industry specific manner (other than aluminum versus steel) or analyze our financial results or generate growth strategy with an eye toward specific industries. Most of our significant customers are general distributors who resell our products into various industries. They generally do not provide us with data regarding where they resell our products. Our sales are affected by the level of our distributors’ inventory and their ability to resell such inventory, which in turn is affected by industry trends. Our marketing and growth strategies are aimed at meeting the needs of distributors and providing whatever products they may need at any given time rather than targeting any one particular product or seeking to expand our sales into any particular industry.
 
Within the semi-finished aluminum and steel products industry, we believe that we occupy a specialized niche as an alternative supplier with prices generally lower than those of our competitors. More specifically, our customers generally purchase semi-finished aluminum and steel products from several sources besides us, and our products generally comprise a smaller percentage of the aluminum and steel products purchased by our customers. In addition, we offer customers visibility into the general wholesale metals’ marketplace that our larger competitors do not, since many of these competitors are vertically integrated, selling metal products they may have mined and manufactured. We also offer our customers products from independent sources, which allow our customers to lessen their dependence on an increasingly concentrated domestic supply chain. We believe the fact that most of our customers find it important to retain us as an alternative supplier, coupled with our generally discounted prices and a high level of service, has shielded us from the potential negative impact of volatility in metal prices that affects our industry as a whole. When metal prices previously increased, our customers generally did not reduce their purchases from us, although they may have reduced such purchases from other suppliers. See Risk Factors “Our future operating results could be impacted by the volatility of the prices of metals, which could cause our results to be adversely affected” on page 11.
 
On the supply side, suppliers to our industry include local mills and foreign suppliers. In addition, many of our largest competitors are vertically integrated, selling metal products they may have mined and manufactured. Maintaining and expanding our access to aluminum and steel supply is critical given the high demand for the aluminum and steel products we purchase. Since we purchase mainly from foreign suppliers, the major factors influencing our supply is our ability to maintain and expand our existing relationships with suppliers and add new suppliers, in particular through the services we provide as described under “Suppliers” below.
 
Our Products
 
We derive our revenues from the sale of semi-finished aluminum and stainless steel products, which are produced by processing primary aluminum or steel and/or aluminum or steel scrap. A product is considered “semi-finished” if it has not yet been converted into a final end-product. Semi-finished products include aluminum sheet, coil, plate and foil, rod, bar and wire, extruded and cast products. We offer many of these forms of semi-finished products to our customers, for use as follows:

· | Aluminum Sheet/Coil. Aluminum sheet/coil is used in many diverse industries, including transportation, construction and food service. Common applications include road signs, roofing, food wrappers, after-market automotive, and gas tanks for trailers. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Aluminum Plate. One of the primary industries for aluminum plate is transportation. Common applications include ship building, automobiles and truck and dump bodies. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Aluminum Treadplate. Aluminum treadplate with a bright finish, better known as “treadbright,” is used both for its cosmetic appearance and its durability. Common uses are for industrial toolboxes, automotive runners and trimming. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Aluminum Foil. Aluminum foil is used primarily in the packaging industry. Common applications include candy/gum wrappers as well as decorative wrapping for gifts. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Stainless Steel. Stainless steel coil, sheet and plate products are widely utilized in applications in which aseptic and non-corrosive surfaces are essential. Common applications include the food service and marine-related industries. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Carbon Steel. The uses of flat rolled carbon steel products span a myriad of applications including construction, automotive and consumer-related uses. Products currently supplied by us include hot rolled coils and plates, cold rolled and coated products such as painted, galvanized and galvalume materials.

During the year ended December 31, 2016, approximately 90% and 10% of our revenues were derived from the sale of aluminum products and steel products, respectively.
 
Demand for our products is not generally seasonal.
 
Sales, Marketing and Customer Service
 
We sell our products primarily through our own marketing and sales personnel. In addition, we sell less than 10% of our products through independent sales agents. We currently utilize seven independent sales agents, three of whom are located in the United States.  These sales agents are compensated pursuant to individually negotiated terms, with exact compensation generally tied to a fixed rate and the amount of products they actually sell.
 
Our inventory is comprised of material that has been ordered by customers and is in transit or is being held pending delivery to such customers and material that we stock to meet shorter delivery times to our customers.
 
We endeavor to support and grow our distribution capabilities by providing customers with quality products, access to alternative sources of supply, and customer service. We offer customers a range of services, including:
 

· | sourcing products from the appropriate supplier in order to meet pricing and delivery requirements; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | handling foreign exchange transactions for purchases and sales in local currency; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | assuming responsibility for the shipment and timely delivery of the product to the customer; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | assisting customers in identifying materials and matching their particular needs; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | where necessary, arranging for subsequent metal processing and/or finishing services that may be required by the customer; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | arranging for materials that have been ordered by a customer (and are subject to a firm purchase commitment) to be stored at an appropriate warehouse for release to the customers on a just-in-time delivery basis; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | providing customers with information concerning market trends and product development; and 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | making available material from our own local stocks to meet customers’ short term requirements. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
We carefully monitor the timing and processing of orders to meet customers’ needs and commit to deliver orders within a time-period mutually agreed with the customer, generally within a 30-day window. We maintain constant and ongoing communication with our suppliers in order to ensure that these delivery dates are met and that customers are apprised of the delivery status of their orders.
 
Customers
 
We serve more than 300 customers in diverse industries, such as distribution, transportation, automobile, housing, appliances and packaging. In the year ended December 31, 2016, our top ten customers represented approximately 41% of our total revenues, with one customer, Ryerson, Inc. accounting for 11.5% of total revenues. In the year ended December 31, 2015, our top ten customers represented approximately 37% of our total revenues, with one customer, Ryerson Inc. accounting for 10% of total revenues. These ten customers included eight full-service distribution centers (i.e., distributors that have the capacity to provide additional processing services), as well as two producers of various consumer and industrial products. Our customers are principally located throughout the Americas, Australia, New Zealand and Europe. Our U.S. customer base is not regional and with no significant geographic concentration in one state or region. During the year ended December 31, 2016, our revenues were attributable to the following countries and regions: U.S. - 74%; Canada – 8%; Australia/New Zealand – 7%; Europe 10% and Latin America – 1%.

Customers generally place an order with us by submitting a purchase order setting forth their desired products, specifications and date and location of delivery. We confirm the transaction with our sales contract, which contains our standard terms and conditions, including a disclaimer of warranties, indemnification of us by the buyer and certain protections in case of insolvency or potential insolvency by the buyer (e.g., the right to terminate the contract and accelerate payments thereon) or the occurrence of certain contingencies that prevent us from fulfilling the contract on time. Typically the risk of loss passes to the customer upon shipment or delivery. Pricing is negotiated for each sales contract.
 
Suppliers
 
We maintain distribution arrangements and/or ongoing commitments with several foreign mills.  We act as bulk purchasers for these suppliers, which provides them with the following benefits:

· | we serve as an integrated marketing, distribution, and service channel for volume that our suppliers wish to export; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | we purchase bulk capacity from suppliers; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | we typically assume responsibility for transporting the products that we purchase; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | we eliminate foreign currency risks for suppliers; and 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | we ensure prompt payment to suppliers for materials purchased. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
We strive to maintain long-term relationships with our suppliers and to be a significant distributor for them. As a result, we are often able to obtain competitive pricing and to influence quality standards and delivery practices.  We continuously work with our existing suppliers and explore other sources to strengthen our position in the market.  Our principal suppliers are PT. Alumindo, Hulamin Ltd. And Southeast Aluminium (China) Co., Ltd. We have written agreements with PT. Alumindo Light Metal Industries and Hulamin Ltd., the material terms of which are summarized below:
 
PT. Alumindo Light Metal Industries. Our supply agreement with PT. Alumindo and its affiliates provides for the supply to us of a minimum of 5,000 metric tons of aluminum cold rolled coil per month, plus or minus 15% upon our written consent, to our specifications as set forth in our purchase orders. Under this supply agreement, the suppliers are also required to use their reasonable efforts to deliver to us an additional 500 metric tons of aluminum hot/cold rolled coil per month, plus or minus 15% upon our written consent. The suppliers’ obligations to third parties will at all times be subject to their ability to produce sufficient supply for us to meet the minimum quantities set forth above. The price of the product shall be determined at least 60 days prior to the quarter in which the product is to be manufactured. The suppliers must provide the products to us at the lowest price at which they offer the same products to any third party in North America in equal or smaller quantities, and they are required to immediately lower existing prices if a lower price is offered to any such third party. We were also a party to a pre-payment advance agreement with PT. Alumindo and its affiliates pursuant to which we advanced a total of $10 million to these suppliers in order to augment their manufacturing capabilities. The pre-payment advance became repayable to us beginning on January 1, 2013 in monthly installments of $277,777.78 and was fully repaid as of December 31, 2015. The supply agreement’s initial term ended on the date that the pre-payment advance was fully repaid, but the supply agreement automatically renews for additional one year terms unless terminated by mutual written consent or in writing by either party at least 60 days prior to the termination date of the then current term. We have the right to terminate the supply agreement upon certain events of default, including the suppliers’ breach of the agreement, failure to supply the product as specified in our purchase orders, becoming the subject of certain governmental demands, investigations or determinations involving illegal or trade-related acts, insolvency, bankruptcy or similar events, default under any loan or indebtedness or material adverse change in financial or other condition, or ability to perform under the agreement.
Hulamin Ltd. Our agreement with Hulamin Ltd. is a letter of understanding which states that Hulamin Ltd. will work closely with us in satisfying market requirements, recognizing that we remain an important customer. The letter permits Hulamin Ltd. to sell its products directly to customers in North America, except for foil products and certain bright tread products, for which we remain the exclusive importer and distributor. Additionally, we are the exclusive importer and distributor of Hulamin’s rolled products in Australia and New Zealand.

Transportation
 
We arrange for transportation and delivery of the products purchased by customers.  When we purchase products from an overseas supplier, we accept delivery either at the port in the supplier’s home country or at the port of destination. If we take delivery at a foreign port, we will generally arrange for transportation to the port of destination on regularly scheduled port-to-port, sea-going transportation. Upon delivery of the products at the destination port, we use trucking and rail services to deliver the products to our customers.
Competition
 
Our principal competitors are global aluminum producers and rolling mills.  Alcoa Inc., and Aleris Rolled Products, Inc. dominate the aluminum industry in North America and are significantly larger than us, have significantly greater financial resources, and are active in significantly more areas of the aluminum products business than we are, including mining, refining, smelting and recycling. These companies also have access to material produced and imported from their own subsidiaries, which compete with us. There are also independent importers of aluminum and steel products which serve the North American aluminum and steel distribution industry. We compete with these other importers, as well as agents that act for or purchase from foreign aluminum producers including one of our suppliers, Hulamin Ltd. Our principal means of competition is market knowledge, customer service, and the ability to offer competitive terms and product quality, including providing value-added services to our customers and providing a full range of product offerings. We also believe that agents of foreign mills are generally less capable of providing the same value-added services to our customers, because these agents are generally captive to a single foreign source and often lack the flexibility and range of product offerings that we offer our customers. We further believe that by offering our customers a full range of products from independent sources, we enable our customers to avoid dependency in an increasingly concentrated domestic supply chain.
Government Regulation
 
As our products are typically imported, we are subject to governmental regulations governing imports, in particular regulations governing the imposition of tariffs and antidumping and other duties. For the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, approximately 35% and 17%, respectively, of our purchases of aluminum products were from countries whose exports were eligible for preferential tariff treatment for import into the U.S. under the African Growth and Opportunity Act (“AGOA”) and the Generalized System of Preferences (“GSP”) which had expired in 2013 and was reauthorized through December 31, 2017 in July 2015. Imports from such suppliers may be subjected to a tariff instead of the duty-free treatment and to the extent that these increased costs could not be passed on to our customers, our profit margins could suffer.
 
The products we import could also be subject to antidumping or other increased duties, tariffs or taxes. For example, under U.S. law, an antidumping duty may be imposed on any imports if two conditions are met. First, the Department of Commerce must decide that the imports are being sold in the U.S. at less than fair value. Second, the International Trade Commission must determine that the U.S. industry is materially injured or threatened with material injury by reason of the imports. The International Trade Commission’s determination of injury involves a two-prong inquiry: first, whether the industry is materially injured, and second, whether the dumping, not other factors, caused the injury. The International Trade Commission is required to analyze the volume of imports, the effect of imports on U.S. prices for like merchandise, and the effects the imports have on U.S. producers of like products, taking into account many factors, including lost sales, market share, profits, productivity, return on investment, and utilization of production capacity. Should such a determination be made, in the U.S. or in any of the countries in which we operate, we could subject to additional costs imposed on the affected imports.
 
Employees
 
As of December 31, 2016, we had approximately 60 full time employees. We also have independent sales representatives located in the U.S. and in Europe. None of our employees is represented under a collective bargaining agreement.
 
History
 
We were incorporated in the State of Delaware in 1990 under the name Integrated Technology USA, Inc. Until September 17, 1999, we were in the business of designing, developing and marketing products for emerging computer related markets.
 
On September 17, 1999, we merged with Empire Resources, Inc. (“Empire”), a distributor of value added, semi-finished aluminum products. Since the merger, we have continued the business of Empire under the name of Empire Resources, Inc.
