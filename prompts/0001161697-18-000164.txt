ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Background Information

AlphaPoint Technology, Inc. (“AlphaPoint”) was incorporated in the State of Delaware on November 13, 2008. On October 14, 2015, AlphaPoint executed a Share Exchange Agreement (“SEA”) for the acquisition of all the issued and outstanding shares of Strategy to Revenue, Ltd. (“STR Ltd.”), a United Kingdom (“UK”) company based in London (“the STR acquisition”). AlphaPoint’s legacy business has been helping companies manage their IT assets.

Subsequently, the parties to the SEA believe that the intended benefits have not been realized, and agreed to unwind the transaction and negotiated and finalized the terms of an Unwind Agreement (the “Unwind”). The agreement became effective on May 31, 2016, which essentially unwound the SEA.

AlphaPoint management is currently seeking alternative opportunities in line with their original strategy of acquiring a business in the technology sector that is capable of growth and development.

Business Operations

AlphaPoint’s principal objective is to partner with innovative technology focused companies that are interested in pursuing growth through the public markets. We are aggressively assembling a portfolio of high-quality businesses and establishing a sustainable business model, to achieve superior and sustainable financial results.

We intend to accomplish these objectives through targeted strategic acquisitions and partnerships. We seek companies that either strategically fit within our existing business portfolio, or expand our business into new and attractive target markets. Given the rapid pace of technological development and the specialized expertise typical of our served markets, acquisitions also provide us important access to new technologies and domain expertise.

AlphaPoint’s business units will typically operate as stand-alone operations, but are supported by a seasoned executive team and a shared technology and administrative infrastructure. While the circumstances of every transaction are unique, we prefer to partner with top caliber executives, and skilled management teams of middle-market businesses and support them with the necessary tools to build each company into a leader in its segment. We believe this philosophy enables us to combine talents and technologies, share services and benefit from a range of centrally managed initiatives while maintaining the uniqueness and brand equity and culture of each unit and a decentralized decision-making structure.

 AlphaPoint leverages the vast experience that its executive team has amassed in creating the suitable financial architecture. Including its expertise in the public sector, follow-on offerings, private placements, other financial know-how as well as, the organizational frameworks (executive strategy and leadership, key C-level and technical staffing, supply chain development, etc.), that are critical, yet often beyond the means and experience of private companies.

All references to the previously acquired business Operations, Technology, Development, Sales / Marketing, Alliances and Customers, have been removed for this annual report.

We rely on a combination of trademarks, copyrights, service marks, trade secrets, confidentiality procedures, contractual provisions and other similar measures to protect our proprietary information and intellectual property.

Our customer agreements include restrictions intended to protect and defend our intellectual property rights. We also require our employees, contractors and many others with whom we have business relationships to sign confidentiality agreements.

While our trademarks and copyrights are an important part of our success, our business as a whole is not materially dependent on any one trademark, copyright or on a combination of any or all of our proprietary technology.
