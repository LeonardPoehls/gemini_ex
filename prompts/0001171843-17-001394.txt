Forward-Looking Statements
 
This Annual Report on Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. For a discussion of forward-looking statements, see the section captioned “Forward-Looking Statements” in Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
 
Reverse Stock Split
 
On January 30, 2015, we effected a reverse stock split of our common stock at a ratio of one share-for-every three shares of the outstanding common stock. The change in the number of shares resulting from the reverse stock split has been applied retroactively to all shares and per share amounts presented in this report, including the financial statements and accompanying notes included herein.
Overview
 
STR Holdings, Inc. and its subsidiaries (“we”, “us”, “our” or the “Company”) commenced operations in 1944 as a plastics and industrial materials research and development company. Based upon our expertise in polymer science, we evolved into a global provider of encapsulants to the solar industry. Encapsulant is a critical component used to protect and hold solar modules together.
 
We were the first to develop ethylene-vinyl acetate (“EVA”) based encapsulants for use in commercial solar module manufacturing. Our initial development effort was conducted while under contract to the predecessor of the U.S. Department of Energy in the 1970s. Since that time, we have expanded our solar encapsulant business, by investing in research and development and global production capacity.
 
In September 2011, we sold our Quality Assurance (“QA”) business, which provided consumer product development, inspection, testing and audit services that enabled our retail and manufacturing clients to determine whether products met applicable safety, regulatory, quality, performance and social standards, to Underwriters Laboratories, Inc. (“UL”) for $275.0 million in cash, plus assumed cash. The historical results of operations of our former QA business have been recast and presented as discontinued operations in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Further information about our divestiture of the QA business is included in Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, and Note 4, Discontinued Operations, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
 
Our net sales and profitability have declined significantly in recent years. We attribute these declines primarily to a rapid shift of solar module production from the United States and Europe to Asia, particularly China, the loss of our largest customer in 2013, financial distress of certain of our key customers, intensified competition and steep price declines resulting from cyclical or periodic excess capacity throughout the solar manufacturing industry.
 
Recent Developments
 
Manufacturing Facility Fire
 
During October 2016, a portion of the production facility within our manufacturing plant located in Shajiabang, Jiangsu, China was damaged by a fire. No employee injuries have been reported. As of the date of this report, our China facility has 50% of its on-site, pre-fire production capacity available. The damage was mainly to certain ancillary equipment and related systems as well as one production line, which has been determined to be a total loss. Through the date of this report, we have been able to continue to fulfill customer orders utilizing our alternative capacity. However, we have recorded a $0.9 million loss related to the fire. We carry both casualty and property insurance for our facilities and equipment, as well as business interruption insurance, and we continue to work with our insurance carriers to complete the filing of our claims.
Zhenfa Module-for-Encapsulant Swap Transaction
 
During the second quarter of 2015, we entered into a module-for-encapsulant swap transaction with Zhenfa  Energy Group Co. Ltd. (“Zhenfa”) and Zhejiang ReneSola Jiangsu Co., Ltd. (“ReneSola”) to settle outstanding accounts receivable due from ReneSola. As part of this three-party transaction, we agreed to accept solar modules as settlement of approximately $7.5 million of outstanding receivables from ReneSola, and Zhenfa agreed to purchase these modules from us for $7.5 million. During the third quarter of 2016, we increased the amount due by approximately $1.2 million to reflect an inadvertent overpayment of modules made by ReneSola to Zhenfa. In October 2016, we received bank acceptance notes and cash from Zhenfa for approximately $3.2 million as full payment of the balance due under these arrangements.

2014 Transaction with Zhenfa
 
In 2014, we entered into certain definitive agreements with Zhenfa and its indirect wholly-owned subsidiary, Zhen Fa New Energy (U.S.) Co., Ltd., a Nevada corporation (“Zhenfa U.S.”).
Purchase Agreement and Special Dividend
 
On August 11, 2014, we entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”) with Zhenfa U.S., pursuant to which we agreed to issue and sell to Zhenfa U.S., and Zhenfa U.S. agreed to purchase from us, an aggregate of approximately 9.2 million shares (the “Purchased Shares”) of our common stock for an aggregate purchase price (“Purchased Price”) of approximately $21.7 million, or $2.35 per share (the “Transaction”). The Purchased Shares represented approximately 51% of our outstanding shares of common stock upon the closing of the Transaction (the “Closing”), which occurred on December 15, 2014.
 
In connection with the Closing, we declared a special dividend (the “Special Dividend”) on December 11, 2014 to be paid to all of our stockholders of record (other than Zhenfa U.S.) in an amount equal to $2.55 per common share on January 2, 2015. The cash used to fund the Special Dividend was paid to our transfer agent as of December 31, 2014.
 
Sales Service Agreement 
 
In connection with the execution of the Purchase Agreement, Specialized Technology Resources, Inc., our wholly owned subsidiary, entered into a sales service agreement (the "Sales Service Agreement") with Zhenfa, whereby Zhenfa agreed, among other things, to assist us in a number of endeavors, including, without limitation, marketing and selling our products in China, acquiring local raw materials, hiring and training personnel in China, and complying with Chinese law. The Sales Service Agreement also provides us an option to lease a Zhenfa-owned manufacturing facility rent free for a period of five years, which option expired on December 15, 2016. The Sales Service Agreement became effective on the date of the Closing, had an an initial term of two years, and is automatically extended for one year periods unless terminated earlier. The Sales Service Agreement may also be terminated by either party at such time as Zhenfa and its affiliates own less than 10% of our outstanding Common Stock. As of the date of this filing, the Sales Service Agreement has not been terminated by either party.
Execution with Zhenfa and Assessment of Strategic Alternatives
 
Our net sales from our China operations were essentially flat in 2016 compared to 2015, with an increasing amount of such sales to India, despite our ongoing efforts to increase our share in the strategically important Chinese market. Within China, we have experienced difficulty attracting large, creditworthy customers on acceptable pricing and payment terms for volumes necessary to achieve profitable scale, even with Zhenfa’s assistance. As a result of these challenges, we have continued to operate at a loss in China.
Encapsulant Business Restructuring
 
In light of continued difficulties in the China market, we have decided to wind down our China manufacturing operations substantially by the end of the first quarter of 2017. We plan to keep a small staff in our China factory for some time beyond that date to manage an orderly wind down, which may include limited continued production for the purpose of servicing local creditworthy customers who may rely on our products, and to consume our remaining inventory of raw materials. We are currently working with our tolling partners to assure uninterrupted supply to our valued customers in the local market.
 
Given that our China factory has been manufacturing encapsulants for sale outside of China, we are currently working to accommodate production in the primary export market, namely India.
 
Our customers in India have generally paid according to terms. Although pricing in India is also very aggressive, we believe that the India market represents opportunity of sufficient scale to support profitable production operations within India, though we cannot assure that this will be the case. We have been working for several months to qualify a tolling partner in India and plan to launch commercial-scale production of our products within India during the second quarter of 2017.
 
We expect to continue to operate our Spanish facility in 2017 and to continue to occupy our headquarters in Enfield, Connecticut.

Since ceasing production in Malaysia in 2015, we have sold certain production and ancillary equipment, and have entered into a Purchase and Sale Agreement (“P&S”) to sell the building and related property rights. Our P&S, having been duly executed by both buyer and seller as of November 18, 2016, is subject to the approval of the Johor Port Authority (“JPA”), pending their review to be held at a meeting of the JPA Board of Directors. The timing of such review is subject to inclusion on the agenda of said meeting. We are not able to accurately predict the date of such review or the likelihood or timing of JPA approval.
 
In summary, we are considering the reorganization of our encapsulant business to better align with customer geography, to reduce the cash burn related to unprofitable locations and to convert assets to cash for potential redeployment into more profitable endeavors.
 
Assessment of Entry into Downstream Solar
 
We have recently made a detailed assessment of the solar downstream market and may consider participation in this field, if given a reasonable entry point, among our other strategic options. Our immediate focus, however, is on reducing our operating losses and positioning assets for redeployment.
Compliance With OTCQX Marketplace Listing Standards
 
Our common stock trades on the OTCQX Marketplace (“OTCQX”) under the symbol “STRI.” On December 1, 2016, we were notified by the OTCQX that the Company did not meet the OTCQX Requirements for Continued Qualification found in Section 3.2 of the OTCQX Rules for U.S. Companies due to the Company failing to maintain a market capitalization of at least $5.0 million for at least one of every 30 consecutive calendar days. The OTCQX has granted us a 60 day extension beginning on January 3, 2017 with a re-evaluation on or after February 28, 2017. Following that re-evaluation, if our market capitalization has not returned to at least $5.0 million, our stock will move to trading on the OTCQB market. As of the date hereof, our stock continues to trade on the OTCQX.
Solar Energy Market Overview 
 
Solar energy has emerged as one of the most rapidly growing sources of renewable energy. A number of different technologies have been developed to harness solar energy. The most prevalent technology comprises interconnected photovoltaic (“PV”) cells to generate electricity directly from sunlight. Solar energy has many advantages over other renewable and non-renewable electricity sources relative to environmental impact, delivery risk, distributed generation, matching of peak generation with demand, predictable generation costs without fuel-cost volatility, low maintenance and installation cost at competitive prices in many global markets.
 
PV systems have been used to produce electricity for several decades. However, technological advances and production efficiencies combined with the rising costs of conventional/carbon-based electricity and the availability of government subsidies and incentives, have led to solar becoming one of the fastest growing renewable energy technologies.
 
Government incentive programs, which make solar-generated electricity more price competitive with that of other energy sources, are among the key demand drivers for PV. Historically, the largest growth in the demand for PV was in the European Union, driven by its goal of generating 20% of its electricity from renewable sources by 2020. However, Europe’s share of global demand has recently declined and is expected to continue to decline as many European Union countries, such as Germany and Italy, continue to reduce their subsidy programs in light of financing constraints, overall fiscal policy, precipitous reductions in PV system and related electricity costs, and saturation due to cumulative installed capacity. The reduction in subsidies and increased competition in the solar industry have been accompanied by a reduction in selling prices throughout the supply chain that is expected to yield future unit volume growth in new end markets as grid-parity is achieved and a price-elastic model continues to develop. We anticipate continued growth in installations of PV modules in the United States, China, India, South America, Africa and the Middle East.
 
Despite our expectations for favorable conditions for the adoption of solar electricity generation, solar energy continues to represent only a small fraction of the world’s electricity supply.
 
Solar Energy Systems
 
Solar electricity is primarily generated by PV systems comprised of solar modules, mounting structures and electrical components. PV systems are either grid-connected or off-grid. Grid-connected systems are tied to the transmission and distribution grid and feed electricity into the end-user’s electrical system and/or the grid. Such systems are commonly mounted on the rooftops of buildings, integrated into building facades or installed on the ground using support structures, and range in size from a small number of kilowatts to hundreds of megawatts. Off-grid PV systems are typically much smaller and are frequently used in remote areas where they may be the only source of electricity for the end-user.

Solar Modules
 
PV cells are semiconductor devices that convert sunlight directly to electricity by a process known as the photovoltaic effect. A solar module is an assembly of PV cells that are electrically interconnected, laminated and framed in a durable and weatherproof package.
 
There are two primary commercialized categories of solar cells: crystalline silicon and thin-film. PV devices can be manufactured using different semiconductor materials, including mono-and poly-crystalline silicon for silicon cells, and amorphous silicon, gallium arsenide, copper indium gallium selenide and cadmium telluride, among others, for thin-film cells. Crystalline silicon cells typically operate at higher conversion efficiency. Historically, crystalline silicon cells have been higher in cost due to a more complex production process and the need for more expensive raw materials. In recent years, the price of polysilicon has declined rapidly, eroding the cost advantage of thin-film cells, while the gap in conversion efficiency narrows due to more rapid improvements in the thin-film sector.
 
During the last five years, the production of solar modules has migrated rapidly from the U.S. and Europe to Asia, primarily China.
 
Encapsulants
 
Regardless of the technology used to create solar energy from a PV system, the core component of the solar cell is the semiconductor circuit. To protect and preserve that circuit, solar module manufacturers typically use an encapsulant. Encapsulants are critical to the function of solar modules, as they protect cells from the elements, bond the multiple layers of a module together and provide electrical isolation. Encapsulants must incorporate high optical transparency, stability at high temperatures and high levels of ultraviolet radiation, good adhesion to different module materials, adequate mechanical compliance to accommodate stresses induced by differences in thermal expansion and contraction between glass and cells, good dielectric properties (electrical isolation) and resistance to potential induced degradation. Even slight deterioration of any of these properties over time could significantly impair the electrical output of the solar module, which is of critical importance in the solar industry, where solar module manufacturers typically provide 20 to 25-year warranties for their products.
 
Over the years, various encapsulant materials have been used in solar modules, including EVA, polyvinyl butyral (“PVB”), polyolefin elastomer (“POE”) and poly dimethyl siloxane or silicone. We currently use EVA to make substantially all of our encapsulant products, although we are currently commercializing a range of POE encapsulants. Our encapsulants are modified with additives to increase stability for long-term outdoor applications, such as solar modules. We have also begun selling EVA interlayer to the laminated glass market to further expand our product offering.
 
During solar module assembly, encapsulation is typically accomplished by vacuum lamination, wherein a “pre-lam” stack (as depicted in the following diagram) is fashioned into a singular part comprising multiple layers. Thin sheets of EVA are positioned on either side of the PV cells, top and bottom. Heating the “sandwich” then causes the EVA to melt and then to cure, or crosslink, bonding the module into one piece. This step occurs towards the end of the manufacturing process and is critical to the entire solar module, as there is only one opportunity to laminate correctly.

Solar Module Component Stack—Crystalline Silicon



Excessive shrinkage or inadequate adhesion (associated with improperly formulated encapsulants) can occur during lamination and may result in voids or holes in the encapsulant, which are considered defects and cause for rejection of the entire panel. Upon direct exposure to the elements, encapsulants are susceptible to several performance failures, which may jeopardize the integrity and performance of the entire solar module and lead to significant warranty costs for solar module manufacturers. The most significant failures include:

• | Loss of clarity - the propensity of an encapsulant to “brown” after long-term exposure to ultraviolet (“UV”) light, leading to a permanent loss of transparency. If an encapsulant positioned above the cells loses its transparency, the power output of the module will be reduced.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Module delamination - the loss of adhesion between the encapsulant and other module layers. Delamination in the field could occur in cases where the encapsulant was improperly cured or where incompatibilities between the encapsulant and other module components exist. Most delamination observed in the field has occurred at the interface between the encapsulant and the front surface of the solar cells. Delamination is more frequent and more severe in hot and humid climates, sometimes occurring after less than five years of exposure. Delamination first causes a performance loss due to optical de-coupling of the encapsulant from the cells. Of greater concern from a module lifetime perspective is the likelihood that the void resulting from the delamination will provide a preferential location for moisture accumulation, greatly increasing the possibility of corrosion failures in metallic contacts and resulting in module failure.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Potential Induced Degradation (“PID”) - the loss of electrical output caused by sodium ion migration from the cover glass, through the encapsulant to the cell, is a factor that could adversely impact the energy yield of crystalline silicon solar modules. PID can occur in some solar module installations where a transformerless inverter is used in combination with a high negative voltage bias applied to the solar cells. The magnitude of the power loss depends upon many factors, including the applied voltage bias and the type of surface coatings on the solar cells. Specific encapsulant chemistry, such as in our recent product introductions, has been demonstrated to help inhibit power loss due to PID.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Despite the critical nature of encapsulant to solar cell applications, the encapsulant represents a small percentage of the total manufacturing cost of the solar module.
 
We typically sell our encapsulants in square meters. However, because the solar industry’s standard measurement for production volume and capacity is watts, megawatts (“MW”), or gigawatts (“GW”), we convert our capacity and production volume from square meters to approximate MW depending on the applicable conversion efficiencies specific to our customers. The conversion rate is approximately 12,500 square meters of encapsulant per MW. This rate is based on our calculations using publicly available information, our industry experience and assumptions that our management believes to be appropriate and reasonable. Certain production capacity and market metrics included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are based on these calculations. Our calculations may not be accurate, and we may change the methodology of our calculations in the future as new information becomes available. In that case, period-to-period comparisons of such metrics may not be perfectly comparable.
 
Financial Information About Our Segment and Geographic Areas
 
Financial information about our segment and geographical areas of operation is included in Item 7,-Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, and Note 19-Reportable Segment and Geographical Information, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Our Products
 
Drawing upon our considerable experience, we develop our formulations internally and work in conjunction with our customers to meet their varying requirements. Our encapsulant formulations offer a range of properties and processing attributes, including various curing times and temperatures that align with the requirements of our customers’ individual lamination processes and module constructions. Our formulations can be used in both crystalline silicon and thin-film modules.

Our Markets and Customers
 
Our customers are solar module manufacturers located primarily in North America, Europe and Asia. We typically sell our encapsulants on a purchase order basis that specifies price and delivery parameters, but can be cancelled or postponed prior to production. We also provide technical support and assist our customers when they are qualifying solar modules that utilize our products, which can take from two months to more than two years. Historically, our sales strategy has focused on developing long-term relationships with solar module manufacturers and working collaboratively during their product development efforts.
 
Over the past several years, many of our Western customers continued to lose market share to lower-cost Chinese module manufacturers, with many being forced into bankruptcy or exiting the solar business as module production migrated rapidly to Asia, primarily China. We have been actively trying to enhance our presence and improve our competitiveness in China, however, in light of the obstacles detailed herein relating to the Chinese market, we have decided to conduct an orderly wind down of our China-based manufacturing operations. Given that our China factory has been manufacturing encapsulants for sale outside of China, we are currently working to accommodate production in the primary export market, namely India.
 
Global Wedge, Inc. and Heckert Solar, each accounted for at least 10% of our net sales, and in the aggregate accounted for approximately 33% of our net sales, for the year ended December 31, 2016. In 2015, ReneSola and Global Wedge, Inc. each accounted for at least 10% of our net sales, and in the aggregate accounted for approximately 28% of our net sales, for the year ended December 31, 2015. Our top five customers accounted for approximately 51% and 49% of our net sales in 2016 and 2015, respectively.
 
Our Operations
 
Facilities and Equipment
 
We currently operate production facilities in Llanera, Asturias, Spain and Shajiabang, Changshu, Jiangsu Province, China. These production facilities are augmented by our research, development and testing laboratory in Enfield, Connecticut, which is co-located with our corporate headquarters and our pilot production facility.
 
We also own a dormant production facility in Johor, Malaysia, for which we have executed a Purchase and Sale Agreement effective November 18, 2016. The completion of the sale is subject to the approval of the Johor Port Authority.
 
Our factories currently have total annual production capacity of approximately 3.0 GW, with 2.5 GW at our Spain location and 0.5 GW at our China facility. In addition, we have informal arrangements with third-parties to augment our manufacturing capacity in China.
 
In addition to our production capacity, we have pilot production lines based in Connecticut that are operational and could be used for production to address demand within North America.
 
Our production lines incorporate our proprietary technology and processes. We rely on third-party equipment manufacturers to produce our manufacturing lines to our specifications, which we then further customize in-house. Most of our production lines are functionally equivalent, having the ability to manufacture all of our formulations and providing us with flexibility in meeting shifting trends in global demand.
 
Encapsulant Production Process
 
Our production process typically begins by mixing EVA pellets with several additives to give the encapsulant its desired properties. The mixture is then melted, homogenized, pressurized and forced through a die to create an “EVA curtain,” forming a continuous encapsulant sheet. The sheet then progresses downstream in a proprietary process and ultimately wound into rolls, slit to the desired width, and packaged for shipment to customers.
 
Our manufacturing quality program is ISO 9001 certified. We have a high level of automation at each of our facilities that includes real-time computerized monitoring of the manufacturing process. Such automation provides consistency across our facilities so we can satisfy customer orders at all of our manufacturing locations. In addition, our enterprise resource planning system allows us to efficiently plan our production by location with global, real-time visibility.
 
We test our products in real-time and at a high frequency after production. The Quality Department at all of our manufacturing facilities follows our global quality assurance program and has a mandate to disposition products that do not meet required standards.

Raw Materials
 
Resin is the primary raw material used in our process, accounting for more than half of our manufacturing costs. A number of additives as well as packaging materials represent the remainder of our raw material costs.
 
We have multiple vendors for resin. Our objective has been to carry at least a five-week supply of resin to provide protection against supply interruptions resulting from inclement weather, natural disasters and strikes. The stock is distributed among our production facilities and warehouses so that a disruptive event at one location would not affect our ability to continue production. We have qualified resin suppliers local to each of our manufacturing facilities and continue to pursue qualification of additional resin suppliers.
 
Seasonal Trends
 
Our business could be adversely affected by seasonal trends, holiday seasons and weather patterns. See Item 1A,-Risk Factors for more information.
 
Our Competition
 
We face intense competition in the solar encapsulant market and have experienced a significant decline in our global market share from approximately 30% in 2010 to 2% in 2016. We compete with a number of encapsulant manufacturers, including Bridgestone Corporation, Hangzhou First PV Material Co., Ltd., Mitsui Chemicals Group, Inc. and SK Chemical Ltd. We have also faced competition from suppliers of non-EVA encapsulants including 3M Company, Dow Chemical Corporation, Dow Corning Corporation, Dai Nippon Printing Co., Ltd., and E.I. DuPont De Nemours and Company (“DuPont”). Over the years, various alternative encapsulant materials have been used in solar modules, including POE, PVB and silicone. Many of our competitors are large, global companies with substantially more financial, manufacturing and logistical resources. Also, low-cost solar module manufacturers have emerged in Asia, primarily in China, who compete with our legacy customers in Western markets. As the China solar market matures, additional encapsulant providers from China and the greater Asian markets may compete with us. We compete on the basis of various factors, including:

• | price;
--+-------


• | product performance, including quality and technology;
--+-------------------------------------------------------


• | product innovations;
--+---------------------


• | customer service and technical support; and
--+--------------------------------------------


• | delivery timing and logistics.
--+-------------------------------

 
We expect competition in the encapsulant space to continue to be intense.
 
Qualification and Certification
 
Design certification programs for solar modules measure performance under simulated or advanced environmental conditions. In certifying their solar modules, our customers must qualify the encapsulant utilized within their product. The certification and qualification tests related to solar modules are defined in the following standards: IEC 61215 (crystalline silicon), IEC 61646 (thin-film) and UL 1703.
 
A successful qualification test program typically means that the tested models/types of solar modules have been subjected to and have passed the minimum requirements of the relevant standards. In addition, many PV module manufacturers often use internal validation tests that are beyond the scope and requirements of IEC and UL. These tests require suppliers to spend more time and investment to become approved suppliers for the module manufacturer’s bill of materials. Qualification or certification does not guarantee any performance, but is designed to provide reasonable assurance that the solar modules of the tested model or type will perform reliably under field conditions.
 
Under guidelines developed by the IEC/TC82/WG2 committee in 2000, modifications to the encapsulation system for solar modules can require retesting of the solar module. Such guidelines call for various retesting if there is any change in the chemistry of the encapsulant used in the solar module.

Employees
 
As of December 31, 2016, we employed approximately 135 people on a full or part-time basis. We maintain a non-unionized workforce, with the exception of some employees in our manufacturing facility in Spain, where unions are statutory. We have not experienced any significant work stoppages during the past five years.
Executive Officers
 
The following table sets forth the names and ages, as of March 1, 2017, of our executive officers. The descriptions below include each such person’s service as a board member or an executive officer of STR Holdings, Inc. and our predecessor.

Name | Age | | Position
--------------------+-----+----+---------
Robert S. Yorgensen | | 53 | | Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer 
Thomas D. Vitro | | 56 | | Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Accounting Officer

Robert S. Yorgensen. Mr. Yorgensen has been our Chairman since December 2014 and our President and Chief Executive Officer and a director of our board since January 2012. Prior to becoming our Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Yorgensen was Vice President of STR Holdings, Inc., and President of our Solar Division since 2007, and has been employed with us for over 31 years. Mr. Yorgensen has held a variety of positions with us, including Extruded Products Manager and Senior Technical Specialist of Materials RD&E and Specialty Manufacturing, Technical Specialist of Materials RD&E and Specialty Manufacturing and Project Leader of Development Engineering and Specialty Manufacturing. He holds a Bachelor of Technology, Mechanical Engineering degree from the University of Connecticut and an A.S. from Hartford State Technical College.
Thomas D. Vitro. Mr. Vitro has been our Vice President and Chief Financial Officer since December 2015 and is responsible for all finance and accounting functions of the Company. Previously, Mr. Vitro served in various positions with us between 1982 and 2013, most recently as Vice President, Finance from 2009 to 2013. Prior to that, he was the Corporate Controller from 1988 to 2009. Mr. Vitro has a Bachelor of Science in Accountancy from Bentley University and is a Certified Management Accountant.
 
Each executive officer holds office for a term of one year and until his successor is duly elected and qualified, in accordance with our bylaws.
 
Intellectual Property
 
Our intellectual property consists of multiple encapsulant formulations, as well as several processes and sub-processes, and our trademarks “STR®”, “PhotoCap®” and “STR Protected®.” As appropriate, we require employees, suppliers and customers to execute confidentiality agreements.
 
We own a number of trademarks, trade secrets and other intellectual property rights that relate to our products. We typically rely on trade secrets rather than patents to protect our proprietary manufacturing processes, proprietary encapsulant formulations, methods, documentation and other technology, as well as certain other business information. Patent protection requires a costly and uncertain federal registration process that would place our confidential information in the public domain. While we enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees and third parties to protect our intellectual property rights, such confidentiality provisions related to our trade secrets could be breached and may not provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets. Also, others may independently develop technologies or products that are similar or identical to ours. In such case, our trade secrets would not prevent third parties from competing with us. See Item 1A.-Risk Factors and Item 3,-Legal Proceedings.
Environmental Regulation
 
We are subject to a variety of environmental, health and safety and pollution-control laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate. The cost of compliance with these laws and regulations is not material and we do not believe the cost of compliance with these laws and regulations will be material. We use, generate and discharge hazardous substances, chemicals and wastes at some of our facilities in connection with our product development and manufacturing activities. Any failure by us to restrict adequately the discharge of such substances, chemicals or wastes could subject us to potentially significant liabilities, clean-up costs, monetary damages, fines or suspensions in our business operations. In addition, some of our facilities are located on properties with a history of use involving hazardous substances, chemicals and wastes and may be contaminated. For example, our 10 Water Street, Enfield, Connecticut location was found to contain a presence of volatile organic compounds, and we have removed contaminated soil to remediate these conditions. The estimated remaining cost we expect to pay to monitor the property is approximately $0.1 million. If we elect to sell, transfer or change the use of the facility, additional environmental testing would be required. We cannot assure that we will not discover further environmental contamination or that we would not be required to incur significant expenditures for environmental remediation in the future.
