In this annual report, unless otherwise specified, all dollar amounts are expressed in United States dollars and all references to “common shares” refer to the common shares in our capital stock.
 
As used in this annual report, the terms “we”, “us”, “our” and “our company” mean Eternity Healthcare Inc. and our wholly owned subsidiary Eternity Healthcare Inc., a British Columbia corporation, unless otherwise indicated.
 
General Overview
 
We were incorporated in the State of Nevada on October 24, 2007. On September 23, 2010, we changed our name to Eternity Healthcare Inc., and we effected a reverse split of our issued and outstanding common stock on a 10 old shares for 1 new share basis.
 
On December 13, 2010 we entered into and completed a share exchange agreement with Eternity Healthcare Inc., a British Columbia corporation, wherein we acquired Eternity BC as our wholly owned subsidiary and abandoned our former business to focus on the operations of Eternity BC.
 
On June 5, 2014 our company registered to operate within the state of Arizona with the intention to take over operations within the United States from our Canadian subsidiary. Beginning January 1, 2016 our company took over operations within the United States from Eternity Healthcare, Inc. (BC).
 
Our Current Business
 
We are a medical device company that, subject to government approval, plans to manufacture and market medical devices. Our first product to be marketed is a needle-free injection system. The products which we hope to market in the future differ from other current offerings by allowing ordinary people to perform injection of medication without the need for professionals.
 
On June 25, 2012, we entered into a marketing agreement to sell a device which does not require a needle for injection of medicine to the body from Mika Medical Company of South Korea. They provided us with the exclusivity rights for this device throughout North America, Germany, France and Spain and non-exclusive rights for the world market. In 2015, we decided to bring our own needle-free injection device with superior technology to market and cancelled our contract with Mika Medicals.

Principal Product
 
Currently, our company is focused on a new needle-free injection device technology. This product is currently under development and we hope to be able to finish by the end of 2017. We then plan to register with the regulatory authorities in various countries including in the United States with the FDA.
Needle-free Injection System Applications
 
Diabetes - It is estimated that there are 50 million diabetics in North America with 8.3% of the total population actually diagnosed. Of the diagnosed diabetic patients, approximately 6 million of those patients (20%) are receiving insulin on a daily basis. The fear surrounding their daily injection is needless as there is technology available to deliver the insulin below the skin that does not require a needle. This option results in a soft injection system that is less painful and less intimidating.
 
Pediatric Oncology – It is well known that children are horrified of the needle and as result, parents sometimes give up the use of those drugs that have to be injected with a needle and move towards oral drugs (though that is also horrible due to taste barrier), or go for intravenous catheters. There are about 20 injectable anti-cancer drugs where a needle-free injection device can be used instead of a needle. Approximately 10 million children and adolescents receive injections annually.
 
MS – Multiple sclerosis is a neurological disease affecting almost 400,000 people in the United States. Most patients receive different forms of interferons under various brand names, which are injected subcutaneously on a daily basis. Needle-free injection devices could be used by those patients who are tired of needle injection.
 
Growth Hormones - Human growth hormones are used for children suffering from lack of growth height and various other conditions and also in adults for work performance, sport performance, losing fat etc. The use of injection by needle for the growth hormones has been a cause of mental barrier for people. Needle-free injection devices are an excellent option for those who do not like needle injections.
 
Anesthetics – Local anesthetics such as lidocaine are used routinely for surface surgery, dental work and cosmetic procedures. Patients are apprehensive about needles going through their skin for desensitization, particularly where face or dental work is involved. Needle-free injection devices can deliver local anesthetic and pain killer conveniently. Over 20 million injections for local anesthetics are performed annually.
 
Vaccine - Vaccinations involving a whole range of products is a major healthcare activity. Globally over 1 billion vaccinations of different kinds are performed annually and it is estimated in the US to be about 20 million per annum. Some vaccines are given subcutaneously, some intramuscularly and some intradermally. Most vaccinations (about 90%) are carried out in children. Children become distressed when they receive needles for their vaccinations. Needle-free injection devices are a painless and preferable method of delivering vaccinations to children. .
 
Cardiovascular - Death due to cardiovascular disease and stroke today surpasses death due to cancer. There have been approximately 30 million deaths resulting from cardiovascular failures in the US. Often oral medications fail to act due to the time in which it takes a drug to get from the digestive organs to the blood. Injectable medications are clearly the better choice. The use of Needle-free injection devices for the injection of cardiovascular medication is invaluable to healthcare professionals concerned with self-contamination and other ancillary inconveniences associated with the use of needles.
 
Migraine – Migraines are severe pain conditions which are highly common among the adult population. A quick injection of anti-migraine drugs or other sorts of pain killers, including opiates, are often used. Needles are often not a desirable tool for these patients and they may be inclined to use a potentially less effective and slower working non-injection approach. Once again Needle-free injection devices can alleviate the discomfort and inconvenience of needles while providing similar benefits.

Market
 
Intended and Current
 
Retail Pharmacies
 
Currently, the needle-free injectors are not available for sale to individuals. The pharmacists in various countries do not acknowledge a demand for the product. There appears to be a complete lack of knowledge of these devices at the retail level.
Hospitals
 
Hospitals contain trained professionals who are expected to handle sharps. The pricing model of the two modalities (needle/injector) will need to be much closer together before hospitals agree to use injectors. The US hospital system lends itself well to new technologies and this offers us a huge opportunity in that country.
Physician Offices
 
Physicians are looking for anything that saves them time. The needle-free injectors offer patients an option and may be considered in this setting. Children have a high level of anxiety with needles.
Corrections
 
The ability to remove sharps in correctional facilities is considered a major advantage.
 
Military
 
The military tends to have mass injection programs and if the injectors can prove to reduce injection time, increase personnel safety or reduce cost, it would be considered as a primary vehicle for vaccine injections.
Corporate Health
 
This is an upscale market that may appreciate the perceived benefit and advancement that injectors convey.
 
US Public Health
 
Public health clinics serve 87 million citizens in the United States and handle most of the immunization needs for these patients. Competitors, such as PharmaJet, got their start in the public health arena in 2009 by providing needle-free injections for the broad H1N1 flu shot campaign in the state of New Jersey. This led to interest from other locations, including Los Angeles County, which is standardizing the PharmaJet needle-free system.
Cosmetic Applications
 
There may be opportunities with dermatologists, clinics and other health care professionals that perform plastic and/or other surgeries.
 
Veterinary Medicine
 
There are also applications for veterinary medicine. Currently, more robust “backpack” versions of injectors using hoses are used with large animals/herds. A small unit of Needle-free injection device (with another brand name) may be useful in a local veterinarian office. This can be investigated when resources and/or the market warrants the focus.

Conclusions:
 

● | The needle-free market has advantages; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | There are specific areas where needle-free holds important advantages; 
● | Professional support will be crucial to success; 
● | There are many applications for needle-free technology, although each must be investigated and the largest payoff areas will be attempted first. 

Unintended Markets:
 
It appears that there are other groups of patients that may try to use the Needle-free injection device in areas it is not intended for. Chat rooms for bodybuilders discuss various methods of steroid injection and needle-free technology is discussed. As we move into the marketplace we need to be aware that the product may not be used according to manufacturer’s intentions. There may also be applications around tattoo parlors and piercings.
Patient Barriers to Needles
 
Increasing demand for painless drug delivery will drive the growth of this market. The advent of biologics and biotechnology-based compounds that need to be delivered using specialized delivery systems has also fueled the demand for innovative and effective delivery devices. Needles have one advantage, cost. With increased demand for needle-free technology, new materials discovered and increased production volumes, the costs will drop and that advantage will be lost.
Competition 
 
Around the world, needle-free jet injectors have an established market among diabetic patients. In the United States, more than a dozen needle-free jet injectors have been licensed by the FDA and are on the professionals market. A few of these devices are being used in physicians’ offices. The most competitive product to ours is Injex™ which is marketed both to professionals and patients at a cost of $900. In Europe, needle-free injectors have become very popular with about 50% of insulin users utilizing needle-free jet injectors. Currently, each manufacturer makes its own type of cartridge that holds the vaccine which is attached to the device before injection.
 
AdvantaJet
 
The AdvantaJet is in its 25th year of production. They claim a durable life-long device with clients still using the jet injector after 20 years of use. They also claim they have studies and have shown increased efficacy over needle injections. Specifically:
 

● | It is the most economical delivery system for insulin for all type 1 diabetics; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | It is the only system that provides a lifetime commitment to replace and repair the product; 
● | It is the most accurate delivery system providing the most precise dosage; 
● | It is the most comfortable system with the least skin abrasions and contusions. 

 
They offer a custom made jet that can be supplied to the patient’s specific needs. Changes to orifice design and power settings decrease due to the increased absorption. There is no data to support this and it is interesting they discuss cost considering the unit cost shown below.
 
Proven Effective
 
AdvantaJet injection technology was tested and determined to be an effective method of managing diabetes in both humans and companion animals.

● | They focus on the bigger market of needle-free delivery, not just jet injectors. 

Injex
 
Injex Pharma AG is a wholly owned subsidiary of Paketeria AG as of December 16, 2011. It markets and sells the Injex 30 System worldwide. The Injex 30 is a syringe without a needle used in multiple medical, cosmetic and anesthetic applications. It is interesting to note that Injex is expanding into cosmetic and launching Shireen Beauty system focused on the rejuvenation of the skin. Fluid is sprayed with high pressure within a small distance of the skin via a pore-jet allowing the fluid open access to pores contained in the upper layers of the skin. Injex is casting as wide a market as possible targeting diabetes, local and dental anesthetics, allergy and fertility treatments, vaccinations, veterinary use, erectile dysfunction and growth hormones.
Conclusions:
 

● | Injex is expensive both the device and nozzles; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Injex has an agreement for Canadian and US distribution; 
● | Injex should be an immediate competitor; 
● | Injex foray into beauty may hurt/help, further study is needed. 

Pharmajet
 
Pharmajet is based in Golden, Colorado. They are focused on a safer workplace, lower needle reuse, and to help children avoid needle anxiety.
 
Pharmajet was founded by Kathy Callender who insisted her device be cost competitive with the cheapest needles. Her goal is that poor countries can afford needle free technology but this has also led to the ability to underbid rivals to supply pharmaceutical companies. She has raised $14 million from investors. In March 2011 Pharmajet completed unspecified B round financing. It seems their plan is to build sales volume in the U.S. vaccination market through public-health departments and pharmacy chains, then among consumers who self-inject at home; and doctor’s offices here and abroad. That way, PharmaJet expects to approach a production volume of 50 million cartridges a year which would allow it to compete on a price level with needles in developing countries. Pharmajet received FDA clearance last year for the use of their needle-free injection device for vaccination purposes.

It is a single use, disposable jet injector that comes prefilled with the proper drug dose. It can be administered in a few seconds by a care giver or the patient themselves.
 
Penjets are tailored for each specific drug it delivers. Exclusive licenses for particular drugs are available. An exclusive license offers pharmaceutical firms a sustainable competitive advantage in a patented, low cost, needle-less drug delivery system.
 
Conclusions:
 

● | Penjet does not seem to be very active; 
--+--------------------------------------------
● | Penjet is disposable. 

Consort Medical plc
 
Consort Medical is the manufacturer of Bespak Injectables’ reusable needle-free jet injectors. Bespak’s innovation focus is on drug delivery and point-of-care diagnostic consumables. Their competitive product is a spring powered injector. Consort produces:

● | MHP-1 Needle-free Jet Injector which incorporates a 2-step actuation mechanism, electronic dose setting; adaptable for specific formulations, concentrations and dosing systems (e.g. volumetric or gravimetric) digital, easy-to-read dose display; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | SQ-PEN Needle-free Jet Injector which incorporates push actuation mechanism, analogue dose setting; 
● | SQ-X Needle-free Jet Injector which incorporates button-based actuation mechanism, analogue dose setting. 

Conclusions:
 

● | This company is not found on the partial list of needle-free injectors and was added as an example of how many other manufacturers there are. This has led to the conclusions below. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Competitive Landscape Conclusions
 
Antares cites as competition, The Medical House plc. Medical House developed the Cool.clickTM2 needle-free injector for Merck Serono. However it had revenue results for the year ended April 30, 2012 of £1.4 million (USA $2,169,197) representing a growth by 25%. They are included here as an example of the many niche companies that are pairing up with pharmaceutical companies.
 
There is also competition from internal groups within large pharmaceutical companies and various design houses which complete the design of devices for companies but don’t have manufacturing management capabilities. There are a number of companies that are relatively inactive, focused on peripheral markets or concentrated on certain geographic areas.
 
This leaves us with our perceived competitors at launch. Our company will focus on diabetes and begin forging alliances to strategically place itself squarely in this area.
 
Government Regulations
 
Government authorities in the United States and Canada, at the federal, state and local levels, and other countries extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacturing, labeling, promotion, advertising, distribution, marketing and export and import of medical devices such as needle-free injection systems. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent substantial compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources.

We are required to obtain two sets of license for the sale and marketing of medical devices. In Canada, as in the United States and Europe, needle-free injection systems are classified as medical devices and require the following licenses: 1) Product License; and 2) Establishment License.
 
Product License: Needle-free injection systems are classified internationally as Class I or II and in the United States are subject to 510-k regulatory filing fee.
 
Description of Different Classes
 
Class I includes products of which several examples are already approved and marketed in Canada or USA. As long as the basic science remains the same, the application for approval of a new product is straight forward. One product in this category would be a pregnancy test or regular needle/syringes.
 
Class II products are those which do not need to be injected (the device itself) or inserted into the patient (non-invasive). Often these products are approved and sold throughout the world. The products which we are currently focusing on distributing all belong to Class II. In order to secure the necessary license for these products, we are required to submit all the documentation which will lead to the approval of the products in other countries. In our case, our products are already approved in Europe, Canada, etc. As far as for FDA compliance is concerned, we are required to submit all of the scientific data, results, approval process and certificates of good quality management pursuant to ISO 13485 and ISO 21649-2006. Usually, products which have the ISO accreditation and CE Mark easily obtain FDA approval.
 
Environmental Regulations
 
We are not aware of any material violations of environmental permits, licenses or approvals that have been issued with respect to our operations. We expect to comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations relating to our business, and at this time, we do not anticipate incurring any material capital expenditures to comply with any environmental regulations or other requirements.
 
While our intended projects and business activities do not currently violate any laws, any regulatory changes that impose additional restrictions or requirements on us or on our potential customers could adversely affect us by increasing our operating costs or decreasing demand for our products or services, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.
 
Employees 
 
As of April 30, 2017 we had two full time employees and two consultants, working on our business. We plan (within next twelve months) to hire one new full-time employee and one additional consultant to work for us on marketing, distribution, commercialization of our products.
REPORTS TO SECURITY HOLDERS
 
We are required to file annual, quarterly and current reports, proxy statements and other information with the Securities and Exchange Commission and our filings are available to the public over the internet at the Securities and Exchange Commission’s website at http://www.sec.gov. The public may read and copy any materials filed by us with the Securities and Exchange Commission at the Securities and Exchange Commission’s Public Reference Room at 100 F Street N.E. Washington D.C. 20549. The public may obtain information on the operation of the Public Reference Room by calling the Securities and Exchange Commission at 1-800-732-0330. The SEC also maintains an Internet site that contains reports, proxy and formation statements, and other information regarding issuers that file electronically with the SEC, at http://www.sec.gov.
