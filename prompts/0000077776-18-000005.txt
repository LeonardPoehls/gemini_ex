Item 1. Business
Overview 

Background
We were incorporated in 1953 as a Maryland corporation. For periods between April 30, 1997 and February 1, 2005, we were a wholly owned subsidiary of Cendant Corporation (now known as Avis Budget Group, Inc.) and its predecessors and provided mortgage banking services, facilitated employee relocations and provided vehicle fleet management and fuel card services. On February 1, 2005, we began operating as an independent, publicly traded company pursuant to our spin-off from Cendant. On July 1, 2014, we sold our Fleet Management Services business and began operating as a stand-alone mortgage business. 
Our mortgage business has provided outsourced mortgage banking services to a variety of clients, including financial institutions and real estate brokers throughout the U.S. and focused on originating, selling, servicing and subservicing residential mortgage loans through our wholly-owned subsidiary, PHH Mortgage Corporation and its subsidiaries (collectively, “PHH Mortgage”). In March 2016, we announced that Management and our Board of Directors were undertaking a comprehensive review of all strategic options for our company. The strategic actions resulting from that review process include transitioning our operations into a capital-light business model comprised of subservicing and portfolio retention services and are described below. 
Proposed Merger with Ocwen Financial Corporation
On February 27, 2018, we entered into a definitive Agreement and Plan of Merger with Ocwen Financial Corporation (“Ocwen”), and POMS Corp (“MergerSub”) pursuant to which all of PHH’s outstanding common stock will be acquired by Ocwen in a merger of PHH with and into MergerSub with PHH surviving (the “Merger”) in an all cash transaction valued at approximately $360 million, or $11.00 per share on a fully-diluted basis. Our Board of Directors has unanimously approved the Merger. The Merger is subject to, in addition to various other customary closing conditions; approval by our stockholders; antitrust, state licensing, and other governmental and regulatory approvals; and PHH maintaining cash and adjusted net worth above certain thresholds. 
See “Part I—Item 1A. Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Strategies—"We may fail to consummate the proposed Merger, and uncertainties related to the consummation of the Merger may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows, and negatively impact the price of our Common stock." in this Form 10-K. 
2017 Strategic Actions 
We made significant progress on executing our strategic actions throughout 2017 as outlined in more detail below: 

• | In November 2016, we announced our intentions to exit our Private Label Services origination business ("PLS") and we incurred operating losses related to PLS of $93 million during the year ended December 31, 2017. We estimate that we will incur additional operating losses in the Mortgage Production segment related to PLS in 2018, including maintaining the support and compliance infrastructure needed to comply with both regulatory and contractual requirements during the exit from the PLS business. We accepted our last application from our PLS clients during the fourth quarter of 2017, and we expect to be substantially complete with the wind-down of the PLS business by the end of the first quarter of 2018, subject to certain transition support requirements. 


• | During 2017, we completed the delivery of $661 million of Mortgage servicing rights ("MSRs") and advances under our sale agreements with New Residential Mortgage, LLC ("New Residential") and Lakeview Loan Servicing LLC ("Lakeview"), and pursuant to ordinary course sales to other third parties. As part of these sales, we increased our subservicing and portfolio retention units through agreements with New Residential. As of December 31, 2017, we have $149 million of MSRs and advances committed for sale with New Residential and other third parties, and the completion of these sales are subject to a number of approvals and other closing requirements. 


• | Between August 2017 and December 2017, we completed the sale of certain assets of PHH Home Loans, LLC (“PHH Home Loans”) to Guaranteed Rate Affinity, LLC (“GRA”), a new joint venture established by Guaranteed Rate, Inc. and Realogy Holdings Corp. (“Realogy”). In total, we received $70 million of cash for the asset sales during 2017, and we recognized a pre-tax gain on sale of $35 million in our financial statements for our 50.1% share. Under the terms of the agreement, the cash received from these asset sales is shared pro-rata with the minority interest holder. We expect to 

3

liquidate the residual assets of PHH Home Loans, and we have agreed to purchase Realogy's membership interests at book value on or before March 19, 2018. At the completion of these actions, we expect to discontinue the operations of our Real Estate channel.

• | From the actions described above, and our efforts to reduce our shared service infrastructure to our targeted staffing levels, we have reduced our headcount from approximately 3,500 at the end of 2016 to approximately 1,365 at the end of 2017.

We continue our transition to a capital-light business comprised of our subservicing and portfolio retention businesses. A successful transition is contingent upon completing our exit from the PLS business and Real Estate channel, restructuring our remaining business and shared services platform to our targeted cost structure and achieving certain growth objectives and assumptions. Additional information regarding these actions, risks specific to our ability to achieve these actions and risks related to the potential outcomes of these actions and our future business model is provided in “Part II—Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Executive Summary.” 
Also, refer to “Part I—Item 1A. Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Strategies—We are exposed to risks related to our continued efforts towards executing our remaining strategic actions, and any failures to execute anticipated actions, in whole or in part, any variances from our estimate of proceeds or costs, or any losses realized from related contractual contingencies, could materially and adversely affect our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows, and there can be no assurance that such actions will be beneficial to our shareholders." and "Our operations have not been profitable in recent years, and we have changed the focus of our business to subservicing and portfolio retention activities to improve our financial results. The industry in which we operate in is highly competitive, and our success depends on our ability to attract and retain clients to achieve scale and meet competitive challenges, which may be negatively impacted by client perceptions of a lack of history operating as a focused player in this market, as well as from our actions, including any past or future efforts towards executing our strategic actions. We may not be able to fully or successfully execute or implement our business strategies or achieve our objectives, and our actions taken may not have the intended result." in this Form 10-K. 

Segments


Our business activities are organized and presented in two operating segments: Mortgage Production and Mortgage Servicing. A description of each operating segment is presented below with further details and discussions of each segment’s results of operations presented in “Part II—Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Results of Operations”. Also refer to Note 18, 'Segment Information' in the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of our Net revenues, Segment profit or loss and Total assets attributable to each segment. 
Mortgage Production
Throughout 2017, our Mortgage Production segment provided private label mortgage services to financial institutions and real estate brokers, and portfolio retention services to subservicing clients. As we are exiting our PLS business and Real Estate channel, our future mortgage originations will be sourced solely through portfolio retention services. We believe we will be in a position to substantially exit the PLS business and Real Estate channel by the end of the first quarter of 2018, subject to certain transition support requirements associated with our PLS clients. 
We generate revenue through fee-based mortgage loan origination services and the origination and sale of mortgage loans into the secondary market, which are referred to as saleable loans. PHH Mortgage generally sells all saleable mortgage loans that it originates to secondary market investors within 30 days of origination. During 2017, 44% of our mortgage loans were sold to, or were sold pursuant to, programs sponsored by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac or Ginnie Mae and the remaining were sold to private investors. While purchase activity is subject to seasonal trends that reflect the pattern in the national housing market of home sales typically rising during the spring and summer seasons and declining during the fall and winter seasons, refinance activity is less impacted by seasonality since it is primarily driven by prevailing mortgage rates relative to borrowers’ current interest rate, home prices and levels of home equity. 
During the year ended December 31, 2017, our mortgage loan originations were derived from the following significant client relationships, all of which are part of the PLS business and Real Estate channel:

• | 30% through a PLS relationship with Morgan Stanley Private Bank, N.A.;


• | 15% through a PLS relationship with HSBC Bank USA ("HSBC"); and

4


• | 28% through the Company's relationship with Realogy and its affiliates, substantially all of which was originated by PHH Home Loans.

A summary of our platforms and channels follow, with the percentage of our loan closing dollars that each represent:

• | Retail - Portfolio Retention (6% in 2017 compared to 3% in 2016)

We record portfolio retention results in our PLS channel. Portfolio retention services are a product offered to our subservicing clients in an effort to mitigate potential MSR runoff with the replenishment of new MSRs for our clients, which allows us to subservice the new loan. Originations under our portfolio retention services are sold into the secondary market as saleable loans, and include both purchase and refinance closings.
We provide portfolio retention services to New Residential and another key client associated with our significant subservicing client relationships, which represented a combined 77% concentration of our total subservicing portfolio as of December 31, 2017. Our portfolio defense agreements cease upon the termination of the related client subservicing relationship, or as units transfer out of our servicing portfolio to a new servicer. In addition, for a majority of our solicitable portfolio, we are authorized to seek refinance of mortgage loans on a non-exclusive basis, which may further limit our future mortgage loan originations since we must compete with other originators. 
We compete to refinance or provide new mortgages to borrowers whose mortgages are in our existing servicing portfolio. We face intense competition in most areas, including product offerings, rates, fees and customer service. The reputation of our origination and servicing businesses and the quality of experience a borrower may have had within our servicing platform have become increasingly important factors.  In addition, over the past several years, there have been many new market participants who are trying to reinvent certain aspects of the financial industry and mortgage experience. As a result, the origination industry could become even more competitive if new market participants are successful in capturing market share. We believe our competitive strengths arise from our role as a mortgage servicer, which provides us with an existing customer relationship to capture refinance or purchase volume from our servicing portfolio, and from the quality of our servicing platform and customer service experience.
For more information, see "—Risk Management—Counterparty and Concentration Risk" and “Part I—Item 1A. Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Strategies—Our remaining business will be focused on subservicing and portfolio retention activities, and we have significant client concentration risk related to the percentage of subservicing and portfolio retention activities from agreements with New Residential Mortgage, LLC and Pingora Loan Servicing, LLC. Further, the terms of a significant portion of our subservicing agreements allow the owners of the servicing to terminate the subservicing agreement without cause which would also terminate any related portfolio defense agreements." 

• | Retail - Private Label (66% in 2017 compared to 76% in 2016)

Our PLS business includes offering mortgage outsource solutions to wealth management firms, regional banks and community banks. All loans originated in this channel are originated and funded in the private label clients' names. We principally generate revenue from the PLS business through the receipt of origination assistance fees from our private label clients, earned as a stated amount per loan for all fee-based and saleable loans, as well as the gain on loans sold into the secondary market for saleable loans, earned as a percentage of the unpaid principal balance sold. Once the exit of this channel is complete, the PLS business will not be part of our future operations. 

To facilitate our PLS exit, in March 2017, we closed our transaction with LenderLive Network, LLC ("LenderLive") to transfer our lease interests in Jacksonville, Florida along with the sale of information technology and other equipment and fixtures. We entered into a master services agreement to outsource certain processing, underwriting and closing services that we are contractually obligated to provide to certain of our PLS clients to LenderLive. In December 2017, we provided notice to LenderLive to terminate this agreement effective on March 31, 2018.

• | Retail - Real Estate (28% in 2017 compared to 20% in 2016)

Within our Real Estate channel, substantially all of the saleable loans were originated through PHH Home Loans. PHH Home Loans sells its loan originations to third parties on a servicing-released basis or to PHH Mortgage. PHH Mortgage sells loans to, or pursuant to programs sponsored by, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and Ginnie Mae, or to private investors. The Real Estate channel principally generates revenue from the receipt of origination and application fees, earned on a per loan basis, as well as the gain on sale of loans sold into the secondary market, earned as a percentage of the unpaid principal balance of loans sold. 
5

We provided mortgage origination services for brokers associated with brokerages owned or franchised by Realogy and other third-party brokers, through our joint venture with Realogy, PHH Home Loans. Through our affiliations with real estate brokers, we have access to home buyers at the time of purchase.  Substantially all of the originations through the real estate channel are originated from Realogy and brokers associated with Realogy's franchised brokerages. See Note 17, 'Variable Interest Entities' in the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
Sale of PHH Home Loans assets. On February 15, 2017, we entered into agreements with GRA to sell certain assets of PHH Home Loans and its subsidiaries, including its mortgage origination and processing centers and the majority of its employees. We have executed on the transaction through five asset sale closings, and we intend to exit the existing joint venture relationship with Realogy through our purchase of their interests in the entity in the first quarter of 2018. Once the wind-down of the remaining mortgage pipeline at December 31, 2017 is complete, the Real Estate channel will not be part of our future operations.


• | Wholesale/Correspondent (0% in 2017 compared to 1% in 2016)

There was no activity in this channel during 2017. We exited the Wholesale/Correspondent channel in the second quarter of 2016 due to its subpar profitability and our intentions to reduce our investment in MSRs. 

Mortgage Servicing
Our Mortgage Servicing segment services mortgage loans originated by PHH Mortgage where we retained the MSRs and where we act as a subservicer for clients that own the underlying servicing rights. During 2017, through the completion of MSR sales, we shifted the composition of our servicing portfolio to primarily subserviced loans. According to Inside Mortgage Finance, PHH Mortgage was the 5th largest mortgage loan subservicer at September 30, 2017.
We service loans on behalf of the investors or owners of the underlying mortgage or MSRs, and because we do not hold loans for investment purposes, we only have exposure to credit risk to the extent we are required to make servicing advances. Our subservicing agreements generally contain provisions that require the subservicing client to pre-fund advances on the subserviced loans or to reimburse us for those advances on a periodic basis. Servicing consists of collecting loan payments, remitting principal and interest payments to investors, managing escrow funds for the payment of mortgage-related expenses such as taxes and insurance, performing loss mitigation activities on behalf of investors and otherwise administering our mortgage loan servicing portfolio. Our Mortgage Servicing segment is generally not subject to seasonal trends.
For a discussion of the geographic concentrations of properties in our total servicing portfolio, see “Part II—Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Risk Management—Counterparty and Concentration Risk—Servicing.”
The following description provides a summary of our servicing activities for our expanding subservicing portfolio and activities related to our capitalized servicing portfolio. The Servicing portfolio statistics below are shown as either portfolio unpaid principal balance (UPB) or based on units, depending on the revenue driver of each respective activity:

• | Subservicing (approximately 629,000 units for 2017, compared to 265,000 from 2016)

We service loans on behalf of our clients who own the underlying servicing rights. Since we do not own the right to service the loan, we do not recognize an asset in our Consolidated Financial Statements, except where we sold MSRs that did not qualify for sale accounting treatment and are accounted for as a secured borrowing. We principally generate revenue based upon a stated fee per loan that varies based on the delinquency status. Subservicing fee revenue is generally less than the servicing fee received by the owner of the MSR; however, subservicers generally do not retain interest rate exposure and related revenue volatility from MSR fair value changes, or the obligation to fund curtailment interest expense and payoff-related costs. Additionally, our exposure to foreclosure-related costs and losses is generally limited in our subservicing relationships as those risks are retained by the owner of the MSR. 
We have significant client concentration risk related to the percentage of our subservicing portfolio that is under agreements with a small group of key clients. As of December 31, 2017, we had significant subservicing concentrations with New Residential and Pingora Loan Servicing, LLC which represented 58% and 19%, respectively, of our subservicing portfolio units. The terms of a substantial portion of our subservicing agreements allow the owners of the servicing to terminate the subservicing agreement without cause, or to otherwise significantly decrease the number of loans we subservice on their behalf, at any time, without cause, and with limited notice and negligible compensation. We expect the transfer of 
6

approximately 115,000 subservicing units off of our platform between May 2018 and April 2019, based upon receipt in February 2018 of formal notices and verbal indications from two of our largest subservicing clients. Approximately 65,000 of these units are subject to a portfolio defense agreement and will no longer be solicitable units upon transfer to a new servicer. There can be no assurances that our subservicing agreements or relationships will not be subject to further change.
For more information, see "—Risk Management—Counterparty and Concentration Risk" and “Part I—Item 1A. Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Strategies—Our remaining business will be focused on subservicing and portfolio retention activities, and we have significant client concentration risk related to the percentage of subservicing and portfolio retention activities from agreements with New Residential Mortgage, LLC and Pingora Loan Servicing, LLC. Further, the terms of a significant portion of our subservicing agreements allow the owners of the servicing to terminate the subservicing agreement without cause which would also terminate any related portfolio defense agreements." 
The subservicing target market is comprised of independent mortgage bankers, community banks, credit unions and other mortgage investors. The size of the subservicing market is dependent on the following: (i) the rate of prepayment speeds and the size of the home purchase market; (ii) lack of operational scale for smaller MSR owners who may need a subservicing partner to keep pace with consumer, regulatory and investor requirements; and (iii) MSR ownership by financial investors who do not have in-house servicing capability. We believe that we are well positioned to grow commensurate with the overall market due to the quality of our subservicing platform, established compliance management system and portfolio retention services offering. 
The subservicing market in which we operate is highly competitive. We compete with non-bank servicers, such as Cenlar FSB, Dovenmuehle Mortgage, Inc., LoanCare and Nationstar Mortgage Holdings, Inc., and we face competition related to pricing and service delivery. Competition in the industry is also driven by compliance with local, state, federal and investor regulations or requirements, technology and the maintenance of appropriate scale. While subservicers generally are not exposed to interest rate risk, they are exposed to portfolio runoff that needs to be managed through client growth, flow arrangements for new loans or additions through portfolio retention services. We continue to believe there will be growing demand for subservicing and that we are well positioned in this market based upon the quality of our subservicing platform, established compliance management system and portfolio retention services offering. We also believe that our portfolio retention offering can differentiate us from our competition. 

• | Owned Capitalized Servicing ($8.6 billion of UPB for 2017, a 90% decline from 2016)

We own the right to service loans owned by investors, which typically result from the sale and securitization of loans we originate. We recognize an MSR asset in our Consolidated Financial Statements and have elected to mark this portfolio to fair value each quarter. We principally generate revenue through contractual fees earned from our MSRs, which are a stated percentage of the unpaid principal balance of current performing loans. As the MSR owner, there are several instances where we are obligated to make servicing advances to fund scheduled principal, interest, tax and insurance payments that the mortgage loan borrower has failed to make and to cover foreclosure costs and various other items that are required to preserve the assets being serviced.  These servicer advance obligations require significant capital and liquidity in order to fund the advances until we are contractually authorized to be reimbursed from the loan investor. As described above, the decline in owned capitalized servicing during 2017 was due to the completion of a significant portion of our MSR sales, which shifted the composition of our servicing portfolio to primarily subserviced loans. 
We do not anticipate retaining a significant amount of capitalized MSRs in the future. As of December 31, 2017, we have commitments to sell MSRs and related advances, representing $6.5 billion of unpaid principal balance, for $39 million in MSR fair value and $110 million of related servicing advances. The final net proceeds we may receive from the remaining MSR sales is dependent on the amount of investor and origination source consents received, the portfolio composition and servicing advances outstanding at each transfer date and transaction costs. 
Our sales of MSRs and sale or collection of advances generated $727 million of total cash inflows during the year ended December 31, 2017. Significant sales of MSRs during 2017 included the following:
Lakeview Sale.  In November 2016, the Company entered into an agreement to sell substantially all of its Ginnie Mae ("GNMA") MSRs and related advances to Lakeview. In a series of three transactions, we sold a total of $107 million GNMA MSRs and related advances to Lakeview, representing $13.2 billion of UPB. The subservicing responsibilities with respect to these MSRs were transferred to a third party and we have no continuing involvement with these loans. 
7

New Residential Sale. On December 28, 2016, the Company entered into an agreement to sell substantially all of its portfolio of MSRs and related advances, excluding the GNMA MSRs sold to Lakeview, to New Residential. The agreement provided that we will perform the subservicing for these loans for an initial period of three years, subject to certain transfer and termination provisions. Between June 2017 and December 2017, we sold a total of $501 million MSRs and related advances to New Residential, representing $54.0 billion of UPB. All of the sales with New Residential were accounted for as a secured borrowing arrangement due to the long-term nature of the subservicing agreement.

Legal and Regulatory Environment


Our business is subject to extensive federal, state and local regulation. Our loan origination and servicing activities are primarily regulated at the state level by state licensing authorities and administrative agencies, with additional oversight from the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection (the “CFPB”). The CFPB has rule-making, supervision and examination authority and is responsible for enforcing federal consumer protection laws. In addition to state licensing requirements, we are required to comply with various federal consumer protection and other laws, including but not limited to:

• | the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, which requires us to maintain privacy regarding certain consumer data in our possession and to periodically communicate with consumers on privacy matters;


• | the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, which regulates the timing and content of debt collection communications;


• | the Truth in Lending Act, or TILA, and Regulation Z, which requires certain disclosures be made to mortgagors regarding the terms of their mortgage loans;


• | the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, or RESPA, and Regulation X, which require, among other things, certain disclosures to mortgagors regarding the costs of mortgage loans, the administration of escrow accounts, the transferring of mortgage loans, lender-placed insurance and other customer communications;


• | the TILA-RESPA Integrated Mortgage Disclosure Rule, or TRID, which mandates specific origination and settlement documents and processes;


• | the Fair Credit Reporting Act, which regulates the use and reporting of information related to the credit history of consumers;


• | the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and Regulation B, which prohibit discrimination on the basis of age, race and certain other characteristics in the extension of credit;


• | the Homeowners Protection Act, which requires, among other things, the cancellation of private mortgage insurance once certain equity levels are reached;


• | the Servicemember’s Civil Relief Act of 2003, which provides military members with certain protections;


• | the Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991, which protects consumers from unwanted auto-dialed or pre-recorded telemarketing calls;


• | the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act and Regulation C, which require reporting of certain public loan data; and


• | the Fair Housing Act, which prohibits discrimination in housing on the basis of race, sex, national origin, and certain other characteristics.

We are also subject to periodic reviews and audits from the Federal Housing Finance Authority (FHFA), Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, Ginnie Mae, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, other federal, state and local agencies, various investors and regulators of our clients. Because we are not a depository institution, we do not benefit from a federal exemption to state mortgage banking or loan servicing licensing and regulatory requirements. We must comply with state licensing requirements and varying compliance requirements in all states that we operate in, and we are sensitive to regulatory changes that may increase our costs through stricter licensing laws, disclosure laws or increased fees or that may impose conditions to licensing that we may be unable to meet. In addition, we are subject to periodic examinations by state regulators, which can result in refunds to borrowers of certain fees earned by us, and we may be required to pay substantial penalties imposed by state regulators due to compliance errors. 
By agreement with our PLS and certain of our subservicing clients, we are required to comply with additional laws and regulations to which our clients are subject. While we are not a bank, our business subjects us to both direct and indirect banking supervision and each client may require a unique compliance model, which creates complexities and potential inefficiencies in our operations. Laws and regulations we are exposed to through our client relationships include, but are not limited to, the Bank Service Company Act, which permits the regulators of federal financial institutions to examine vendors that provide outsourced services to such regulated financial institutions. 
8

In the ordinary course of business, we manage through various regulatory investigations, examinations and inquiries related to our mortgage origination and servicing practices. Our experience is consistent with other companies in the mortgage industry. We defend our positions and/or appeal matters as appropriate when we believe we have meritorious defenses. Alternately, we may engage in settlement discussions on certain matters in order to avoid the additional monetary costs and other business impact of engaging in litigation. For more information, see Note 13, 'Commitments and Contingencies' in the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 
In recent years, there has been heightened regulatory and public scrutiny with regard to origination and servicing practices and there has been a number of developments in laws and regulations and other financial reform legislation that have impacted, or are expected to impact, our business. We continue to work diligently to assess and understand the implications of the recent developments in the regulatory environment. We have devoted substantial resources towards implementing all of the new rules to ensure we continue to maintain regulatory compliance, while, at the same time, working towards meeting the needs and expectations of our clients and the borrowers whose loans we service. 
We expect that the continued legislative and regulatory focus on mortgage origination and servicing practices will result in elevated legal, compliance and servicing related costs as well as heightened potential regulatory fines and penalties. For more information, see “Part I—Item 1A. Risk Factors—Legal and Regulatory Risks—Our business is complex and heavily regulated, and there have been continual developments in regulations that impact our businesses. In addition, we are subject to litigation and regulatory investigations, inquiries and proceedings, and we may incur fines, penalties, increased costs, and other consequences that could negatively impact our business, results of operations, liquidity and cash flows or damage our reputation. Any failure of ours to comply with applicable laws, rules, regulations or the terms of agreements with regulators could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows.” in this Form 10-K.
The cybersecurity regulatory environment is also evolving, and there have been developments in laws and regulations that have impacted, or are expected to impact, our business. Specifically, the New York Department of Financial Services ("NYDFS") issued final Cybersecurity Requirements for Financial Services Companies that requires financial services and other institutions regulated by the NYDFS, including us, to establish and maintain a cybersecurity program designed to protect consumers and ensure the safety and soundness of New York State’s financial services industry. 
See “Part I—Item 1A. Risk Factors—Other Risks—A failure in or breach of our technology infrastructure or information protection programs, or those of our outsource providers, could result in the inadvertent disclosure of the confidential personal information of our customers, as well as the confidential personal information of the customers of our clients.  Any such failure or breach, including as a result of cyber-attacks against us or our outsource partners, could have a material and adverse effect on our business, reputation, financial position, results of operations or cash flows." for more information.

Employees

As of December 31, 2017, we employed approximately 1,365 persons in total. We expect to further reduce our employee headcount during 2018 to our expected future staffing levels of approximately 1,250 employees in 2018. Management considers our employee relations to be satisfactory. None of our employees were covered under collective bargaining agreements during the year ended December 31, 2017.
