ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Corporate History
K2M, Inc. was incorporated in 2004 and began working with leading spine surgeons for the purpose of designing, developing and commercializing innovative and proprietary complex spine technologies and techniques. Between 2005 and 2010, we continued to develop our product portfolio while expanding our business, including through the investment of venture capital from Ferrer Freeman & Company, LLC. On August 12, 2010, K2M Group Holdings, Inc., an entity then controlled by Welsh, Carson, Andersen & Stowe, acquired K2M, Inc. Welsh, Carson, Anderson & Stowe XI, L.P. and certain of its affiliated funds are referred to herein as “WCAS,” and WCAS, together with the other owners of K2M Group Holdings, Inc. prior to our May 2014 initial public offering, are collectively referred to as our “pre-IPO owners.” Since 2010, we have continued to invest in our business by expanding our global distribution network, including through the investment of additional capital raised from our pre-IPO owners, our initial public offering in May 2014, subsequent public offerings in February and July 2015 and issuance of convertible senior notes in August 2016. 
Overview
We are a global leader of complex spine and minimally invasive solutions focused on achieving three-dimensional Total Body Balance™. Our complex spine products are used by spine surgeons to treat some of the most difficult and challenging spinal pathologies, such as deformity (primarily scoliosis), trauma and tumor. We believe these procedures typically receive a higher rate of positive insurance coverage and often generate more revenue per procedure as compared to traditional degenerative spine surgery procedures. We have applied our product development expertise in innovating complex spine technologies and techniques to the design, development and commercialization of an expanding number of proprietary minimally invasive surgery (“MIS”) products. These proprietary MIS products are designed to allow for less invasive access to the spine and faster patient recovery times as compared to traditional open access surgical approaches. We have also leveraged these core competencies in the design, development and commercialization of an increasing number of products for patients suffering from degenerative spinal conditions.
Our products consist of implants, disposables and instruments which are marketed and sold primarily to hospitals for use by spine surgeons. As of December 31, 2016, our product portfolio contains 83 product lines that are used in complex spine, MIS and degenerative surgeries, enabling us to effectively compete in the $10.5 billion global spinal surgery market. We believe many of our products offer simplified surgical techniques and promote improved clinical outcomes for patients, although their quality, safety and efficacy are not yet supported by long-term clinical data. 
Our focus on our core competences of complex spine and MIS is highlighted by the fact that, for the year ended December 31, 2016, 55.6% of our revenue in the United States was derived from the use of our products in complex spine and MIS surgeries. We believe this represents a greater proportion of total revenue devoted to these markets as compared to our competitors. We further believe the proportion of our international revenue derived from complex spine and MIS is even higher than in the United States.
We have also leveraged our core competences of complex spine and minimally invasive offerings into Balance ACS™, a platform of products, services, and research designed to help surgeons achieve three-dimensional spinal balance across the axial, coronal and sagittal planes, with the goal of supporting the entire clinical care continuum to help facilitate quality patient outcomes. The Balance ACS platform, in combination with the Company’s technologies, techniques and leadership in the 3D-printing of spinal devices, enables us to compete favorably in the global spinal surgery market.

• | tifix: a locking technology integrated into a number of our interbody and plate implants which provides surgeons with the flexibility to insert screws at various angles and lock them to an implant with a one-step locking mechanism that eliminates the need for a secondary locking feature.

We have grown our revenue to $236.6 million in 2016 from $118.0 million in 2011, representing a five-year Compounded Annual Growth Rate (“CAGR”) of 15.0%. For 2016, 2015 and 2014 our net loss was $41.7 million, $39.2 million and $59.6 million, respectively, and our Adjusted EBITDA was $0.6 million, $(0.1) million and $(8.8) million, respectively. For information about how we calculate Adjusted EBITDA, see Non-GAAP Financial Measures below. We expect to continue to incur additional losses as we invest in the global expansion of our business. As of December 31, 2016, our accumulated deficit was $211.1 million.
We continue to develop and maintain an expanding portfolio of intellectual property, which included 415 issued patents globally and 228 pending patent applications globally as of December 31, 2016. In addition to our current product offerings, we continue to invest in the research and development necessary to design, develop and commercialize new surgical solutions for unmet clinical needs. Our highly efficient product development process utilizes an integrated design team approach that involves collaboration among select teams of leading surgeons in their respective specialties, our product management team, our engineers and our clinical and regulatory personnel. We believe that utilizing these integrated design teams enables us to develop innovative and differentiated technologies and techniques that meet the needs of the market and allow surgeons and hospitals to better serve their patients. As of December 31, 2016, our product portfolio contains 83 product lines, which include our EVEREST, MESA and CASCADIA technologies, demonstrating our ability to leverage our product development process to rapidly innovate new products.
We currently market or sell our products in the United States, including the territory of Puerto Rico, and 38 other countries. In 2016, international sales represented approximately 23.5% of our revenue. We have made significant investments in building a global hybrid sales organization consisting of direct sales employees, independent sales agencies and distributor partners. As of December 31, 2016, our U.S. sales organization consisted of 140 direct sales employees and 86 independent sales agencies and our international distribution network consisted of 39 direct sales employees, nine independent sales agencies and 26 independent distributorships. We expect to continue to invest in the expansion of our global hybrid sales organization. We believe the continuing expansion of our global sales force will provide us with significant opportunities for future growth as we increase our penetration of existing geographic markets and enter new ones. We do not sell our products through or participate in PODs.
Industry Background
Overview of Spine Anatomy
The spine is the central core of the human skeleton and provides structural support, balance and flexibility to the body. It consists of 24 interlocking bones, called vertebrae, which are stacked on top of one another. The spine is comprised of five 
 6

regions, of which there are three primary regions: cervical, thoracic and lumbar. There are seven vertebrae in the cervical, or neck, region of the spine, 12 vertebrae in the thoracic, or central, region of the spine, and five vertebrae in the lumbar, or lower back which is the primary load-bearing region of the spine. The bottom of the spine, comprised of the sacrum and the coccyx, consists of naturally fused vertebrae connected to the hip bones to provide support for the spine. A healthy spine has a natural curvature when viewed from the side and is straight when viewed from the front or back. The cervical and lumbar regions contain forward convex curves referred to as lordosis while the thoracic region contains a backward concave curve referred to as kyphosis. Between each pair of vertebrae is an intervertebral disc that acts as a shock absorber during movement. Vertebrae are paired as motion segments, or levels, and are connected to each other by facet joints in the rear region of the spine that provide flexibility and enable the spine to bend and twist. The back, or posterior, part of each vertebra is comprised of a bony arch called the lamina and the spinous process. Soft tissues, including ligaments, tendons and muscles are attached to these structures, which provide stability to the spinal column and facilitate movement of the spine. The largest load bearing bony structure, which is in the front, or anterior, and middle part of each vertebra, is referred to as the vertebral body. These collective spinal elements serve as a protective cage for the spinal cord, which runs through the center of the spine, or spinal canal, carrying nerves that exit through openings between the vertebrae, or foramen, which run from every area of the body to the brain, delivering sensation and control to the entire body.
Overview of Spine Disorders
Complex spine pathologies and back pain related to spine disorders affect more than 31 million people in the United States and are a leading driver of healthcare costs globally. Spine disorders range in severity from mild discomfort and numbness, to curvatures of the spine, extreme pain and paralysis. Spine disorders can be categorized as either complex, which consists of deformity (primarily scoliosis), trauma and tumor, or degenerative.
Spine deformity is any variation in the natural curvature of the spine. The most common form of spine deformity is 
 7

scoliosis which is either a lateral, or side-to-side curvature of the spine, or an extreme rotation of the vertebral body. Other common types of deformity include hyperlordosis, which is an over-extension of the normal convex curvature of the cervical and lumbar spine, and hyperkyphosis, which is an over-flexion of the normal concave curvature of the thoracic spine.

Front | Side

Spine deformity can be further grouped into the following four categories, which are known to have different spine characteristics:

• | Pediatric infantile scoliosis, presents in children under 10 years of age as a result of conditions present at birth or congenital conditions;


• | Adolescent scoliosis, presents in patients between the ages of 10 and 18 as a result of congenital conditions, neuromuscular conditions such as cerebral palsy or muscular dystrophy, or other unknown previously existing conditions;


• | Adult scoliosis, presents in patients between the ages of 19 and 64 as a result of scoliosis, which typically starts after the age of 40 due to arthritis or other conditions of aging, or as a result of scoliosis that started when the patient was younger; and


• | Aging spine, presents in patients 65 years of age or older as a result of a pre-existing deformity that has progressed or the onset of severe degenerative spine disorders.

Spine trauma is often the result of impact from a fall, car accident or other external forces. Spine traumas include fractures, dislocations, soft tissue damage and other musculoskeletal and nervous system injuries.
Spine tumors are relatively rare. Benign tumors are typically removed surgically while malignant tumors are more difficult to treat and often originate in other areas of the body such as the lungs, thyroid or kidneys.
Degenerative spine disorders are typically the result of repetitive stresses experienced during the normal aging process and are the most common type of spine disorders. Degenerative spine disorders occur when the intervertebral disc at a motion segment weakens and loses its normal height, thereby compressing the spinal nerves. Compression of the spinal nerves often leads to pain and/or loss of feeling in the arms, back and legs.
Treatment Alternatives for Degenerative Spine Disorders
 8

Treatment for degenerative spine disorders usually begins with conservative therapies, including observation to determine if the spine disorder is progressing, lifestyle changes such as exercise and weight loss, anti-inflammatory and pain medication and physical therapy. If and when conservative therapies fail to provide adequate quality of life improvements, patients may ultimately require spine surgery.
The goals of spine surgery are to reduce patient pain and restore structural support and balance while maintaining natural flexibility within the spine, if possible. Surgical options for degenerative spine disorders vary greatly depending on each patient’s unique pathology and include procedures that either (1) do not use spinal implants or (2) use spinal implants. Decompression procedures are typically performed earlier in the continuum of care and may or may not include the use of spinal implants. These procedures include discectomies and laminectomies, which involve the removal of part of a damaged disc or lamina in order to relieve pressure on the spinal nerves. Decompression procedures may occasionally result in spinal instability due to the removal of these spinal elements and as a result require the utilization of spinal implants.
In the case of advanced degenerative spine disorders, treatment often turns to procedures that involve the use of spinal implants, the most common of which is a fusion procedure. The goal of fusion is to permanently decompress the spinal nerves exiting the spine by restoring the natural height of the disc and eliminating motion at the affected level. A fusion procedure involves the surgical removal of bone and/or diseased or damaged disc material that is believed to be the source of the pain and insertion of spinal implants to the spine to stabilize the affected vertebrae. Spinal implants used in fusion procedures include interbody devices that replace the disc space between the vertebrae, as well as spinal implants such as Rails, stabilization rods, screws, plates and biomaterials that provide stability and promote fusion between the vertebrae. Treatments for degenerative spine disorders may also include motion preservation technologies such as cervical and lumbar disc replacement, dynamic stabilization, annular closure, nucleus replacement and facet arthroplasty devices. In some instances, degenerative spine disorders may progress to complex spine disorders, depending on the severity and advancement of the pathology or structural deformity.
Treatment Alternatives for Complex Spine Disorders
Treatments for complex spine disorders, such as deformity, address patients with severe curves in their spine seeking to prevent curve progression and obtain curve correction. The treatment pathway for deformity cases may begin with bracing or casting which are designed to slow or correct the progression of the adverse curvature of the spine. Bracing and casting are typically used as the first course of treatment in young children who are still growing. If a child’s curve has shown progression despite bracing or casting, surgery is often considered. Surgical treatment for deformity conditions in young patients that have not stopped growing, such as pediatric infantile scoliosis, typically seek to correct the deformity while avoiding long fusions of the spine. These procedures include the use of spinal implants, such as pedicle screws and expandable rods that are periodically lengthened, to control the spine deformity while still allowing for the spine to grow until the child reaches an appropriate size or age for a more permanent solution, such as spinal fusion. When these patients mature and reach spinal maturity, spinal fusions are typically considered.
Treatment of more intricate complex spine disorders, such as traumas and tumors, may require the use of one or several procedural alternatives, such as (1) decompression, (2) fusion or (3) corpectomy techniques, where the vertebral body may be completely removed and replaced by a vertebral body replacement device.
The indications for surgical treatment of complex spine disorders such as deformity are determined by anatomical angle measurements that are established and well defined among hospitals, physicians and third-party payors. Conversely, fusion procedures for degenerative conditions are typically indicated when the source of the patient’s pain originates from the vertebral level in question and a diagnostic confirmation of degenerative disc disease is made. Current techniques to identify the source of a patient’s degenerative back pain are imprecise and it may be difficult to locate the source of pain. Third-party payors typically require a confirmed diagnosis of degenerative disc disease in order to reimburse for surgical procedures. We believe complex spine procedures typically receive a higher rate of positive insurance coverage and often generate more revenue per case, as compared to degenerative procedures.
MIS Treatment Alternatives for Complex and Degenerative Spine Disorders
Traditional approaches for complex spine and degenerative spine surgery require large incisions in order to provide surgeons with access to, and visibility of, the spine and surrounding areas. Consequently, traditional surgical procedures are considered highly invasive and are often associated with several limitations including significant blood loss, extensive soft tissue disruption, long operative times, extended hospital stays and lengthy patient recovery times.
Over time, there has been significant increase in surgeon and patient interest for less invasive surgical techniques for treating both complex and degenerative spine disorders. MIS techniques are designed to allow for less invasive access to 
 9

the spine and, as a consequence, faster patient recovery times as compared to traditional open access surgical techniques. The figures below illustrate the different incision sizes in a multi-level deformity case utilizing both traditional open and MIS surgical techniques.
Biomaterials Treatment Alternatives for Complex and Degenerative Spine Disorders
Biomaterial treatments are typically derived from human bone or synthetic sources and come in a variety of forms. These biomaterials are used by spine surgeons during the surgical treatment of certain complex spine and degenerative pathologies to augment spinal implants and to promote fusion by accelerating or substituting for the normal regenerative capacity of bone.

Overviews of the global spine markets in which we compete, and their associated growth drivers, are as follows:
Complex Spine
The approximately $1.6 billion global complex spine market includes technologies used to treat cases of spine deformity, trauma and tumor, including those treated through a minimally invasive approach. While many advancements in the treatment of complex spine disorders have been made, considerable challenges and limitations associated with performing complex spine surgery remain. For example, many of the spinal implants and instruments currently used to perform complex spine surgeries are not designed to sufficiently address the variable and unpredictable nature of complex spine surgeries caused by the different sizes, shapes, densities and growth characteristics of each individual spine. It is not always possible for spine surgeons to anticipate which of these variables will be present in any given spine surgery, which may result in suboptimal patient outcomes and longer procedure times if they do not have the proper spinal implants and instruments readily available during the procedure. Further, many existing complex spine surgery implants, instruments and surgical approaches are not designed to concurrently access multiple levels of the spine through a MIS approach.
We believe the global complex spine market has been underserved and underdeveloped by major spine market competitors, which generally focus on the larger degenerative spine market. As a result, we believe the complex spine patient population has and will continue to benefit from innovative technologies and techniques that enable simplified surgical procedures, MIS approaches and surgical treatment earlier in the continuum of care.
MIS
The approximately $1.4 billion global MIS market includes technologies used in treating degenerative spine disorders through minimally invasive approaches to the spine.
These technologies and techniques include MIS pedicle screws that are affixed to the spine through either percutaneous, or puncture-like, incisions or retractors that provide direct visualization of the spine with a smaller incision than traditional open procedures. The MIS market also includes minimally invasive interbody devices, including posterior, transforaminal and lateral lumbar interbody fusion (“LLIF”) devices. LLIF devices are inserted from the side and are associated with less disruption to the soft tissues of the back. We believe the vast majority of surgeons and patients, when given the option, will utilize MIS procedures rather than traditional open procedures due to the advantages of MIS approaches, which often include less soft tissue disruption, reduced frequency of surgical morbidity, faster operating times, reduced scarring and, as a consequence of these advantages, shorter patient recovery times. Finally, we believe the overall improvement to the standard of care resulting from the introduction of new MIS products will increase global demand for MIS technologies and techniques.
Degenerative Spine
The approximately $6.5 billion global degenerative spine market includes technologies and techniques used to treat degenerative spine disorders. These technologies and techniques include products such as cervical, thoracic and lumbar spinal fusion devices, interbody devices, motion preservation technologies and vertebral compression fracture devices. We believe that several factors will continue to influence the growth in the global degenerative spine market, including aging patient demographics, increased life expectancies, the desire for maintaining and/or improving lifestyles and demand from patients and surgeons for innovative technologies and techniques that enable simplified surgical procedures, faster procedure times and improved clinical outcomes.

Product Pipeline
In addition to our comprehensive commercialized product portfolio, we plan to continue developing innovative new technologies and techniques to enhance our robust product pipeline. Our next generation product development efforts will remain focused on the complex spine and MIS markets, as well as creating three-dimensional solutions across the entire episodic care continuum to help drive quality outcomes for spine patients. 
We will continue with the expansion of the MESA 2, EVEREST and NILE Alternative Fixation Spinal Systems to address complex adolescent and adult deformities.  
In the MIS market, we will continue the rollout of the EVEREST MI XT Spinal System, intended to treat patients with degenerative disc disease and spondylolisthesis through a minimally invasive approach.  We plan further additions to this product line in 2017, including implants and instruments to address more complicated pathologies. 
Our product development efforts in the degenerative spine market includes the further expansion our CASCADIA Interbody Systems, featuring Lamellar 3D Titanium Technology, and additional implant options for TL, AN, Lateral, AN Lordotic Oblique, and Cervical designs.  In 2017, we expect this expansion to continue with additional implant footprints and lordotic designs.  Overall, we expect to introduce five to eight new product or product line extensions during 2017.

In addition to our product development efforts focused on spinal implants and instrumentation, we will continue to develop a variety of enabling technologies in the areas of preoperative planning, intraoperative support and postoperative patient care, with the goal of correcting the spine in all three anatomical planes and improving short- and long-term outcomes.
Research and Product Development
We have made significant investments in our product development capabilities to enhance our product lines, and believe that ongoing research and development efforts are essential to our success. Our product design teams consist of surgeon advisors, product managers, engineers and clinical and regulatory personnel who work closely together in an integrated product development process to design, enhance and validate our technologies and techniques.
These product design teams conceptualize technologies and then build and test prototypes utilizing in-house and third- party prototyping and testing facilities. As part of the development process, spine surgeons evaluate the implantation of the product in our cadaveric laboratory to ensure it meets the needs of both surgeons and patients. Prototypes are then quickly refined or redesigned as necessary based on the results of the product testing, allowing us to perform rapid iterations of the design-prototype-test development cycle.
Our regulatory and clinical affairs personnel allow us to anticipate and resolve any potential issues at early stages in the development cycle. In addition, they are able to submit regulatory filings shortly after the final development testing has been completed and are committed to timely and responsive communication with regulatory agencies. We have demonstrated an ability to gain rapid regulatory approvals of our technologies.
Our research and development expense was $21.5 million, $19.9 million and $16.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
Global Spine Community Involvement, Education and Training
We devote significant resources towards global surgeon education on the proper use of our technologies and techniques. This education includes approved patient indications, contra-indications and overviews of the features and clinical benefits of our products. For example, we support local, regional, national and global educational courses, intensive hands-on cadaveric training and product-based programs that include didactic sessions coupled with hands-on-lab segments to allow surgeons to learn and experience new technologies.
We believe that our success has been, and will continue to be, driven by the quality of our products and reputation within the spine surgeon community. We collaborate with spine surgeons in various aspects of our strategy and product development. These spine surgeons are compensated pursuant to written agreements with us. These agreements generally provide for compensation on an hourly-basis for time spent on our projects and may entitle such surgeons to royalties. We also work with surgeons and other healthcare professionals in the area of clinical research in order to gain a better understanding of the safety and efficacy of our products and support the necessary requirements for product clearances and registrations internationally.
As an active member of the global spine community, we support and maintain a presence in trade and industry 
 18

organizations, including the Scoliosis Research Society and the Pediatric Orthopedic Society of North America, as well as other local, regional, national and international spine societies. At these meetings, we demonstrate the clinical benefits of our products to surgeons and generate awareness among these societies as to the clinical benefits of our innovative technologies and techniques.
We provide charitable support to the medical community and the community in general. We also provide financial and product support to international medical missions in underdeveloped countries around the world and to local community charitable causes.
Sales and Marketing
We promote, market and sell our products through a global hybrid sales organization comprised of direct sales employees, including complex spine and MIS product specialists, independent agencies and distributor partners. Our hybrid U.S. sales organization consists of 140 direct sales employees and 86 independent sales agencies. Each direct sales employee and independent sales agency is assigned a defined territory. 
Our international sales organization includes over 39 direct sales employees, primarily located in the United Kingdom and Germany. In addition, we directly manage nine independent agencies in Italy and Canada and sell to 26 distributors in certain other international markets. Combined, these international distribution efforts permit us to market and sell our products in 38 countries outside the United States and the territory of Puerto Rico. To support our international sales force, we deploy a number of international market managers who leverage product fluency and local market expertise to broaden and deepen our relationships with our independent agency and distributor partners as well as to provide a direct line of communication to our surgeon customers. Our hybrid global sales organization provides us with broad geographic coverage in regions where our products are sold, including the Americas, Europe, Middle East, South Africa and Asia/Pacific. We continually evaluate new market opportunities and expect to expand our international market presence.
The contractual relationships with our independent sales agencies and distributor partners generally have terms of one to five years, with automatic renewal unless otherwise terminated. Our independent sales agents are compensated based on a commission structure while our distributor partners purchase and take title to our products and resell them to their customers. These contractual arrangements may generally be terminated by us for failure to meet certain sales quotas or minimum purchase requirements or upon breach of the agreement by the counterparty. The nature of these contractual relationships vary, with certain contracts that are exclusive, some of which have limited exceptions to the exclusivity provisions, and others that are nonexclusive.
We support the efforts of both our direct sales employees and independent agency partners through the deployment of product specialists with expertise in complex spine and MIS. These specialists provide technical expertise relating to our products and engage surgeons and hospitals directly to assist them in better understanding product capabilities, value propositions and market trends.
We have also implemented certification programs designed to ensure a sophisticated proficiency within our global sales organization in the effective promotion, marketing and selling of our complex spine and MIS products, respectively. These certification programs include in-depth training on our products and promote a detailed proficiency in and understanding of the anatomical issues, clinical pathologies and diagnosis challenges associated with complex spine surgery and MIS technologies and techniques. We make decisions on whether to be direct or utilize independent agencies or distributor partners on a market-by-market basis using a number of parameters, including the availability of sales talent with the necessary level of spinal expertise, the reputation of the sales talent with surgeons and hospitals, the results of our compliance diligence and the overall potential of the market.
We continually evaluate and refine the performance of our global sales organization using a number of tools, including metric-driven scorecards and reviews of performance relative to budgets. Our direct sales force is compensated through a combination of base salaries, individual and company-based performance bonuses, commissions and stock-based compensation. Our independent agencies are compensated with commissions and individual-based performance bonuses. Our compensation programs are designed to balance rewarding performance, incentivizing the desired sales behaviors to align with our corporate strategy and maximizing sales force retention.
Suppliers and Raw Materials
We have a strong base of more than 50 third-party suppliers located primarily in the United States, with a small number located in the European Economic Area (“EEA”), that manufacture our products. We work with these suppliers in support of our supply chain strategy, which involves minimizing our capital investment, controlling costs and shortening cycle 
 19

times. We believe this allows us to compete with larger volume manufacturers of spine surgery products. We work closely with our suppliers to ensure our inventory needs are met while maintaining high quality and reliability.
We select our suppliers carefully. Our internal quality assurance and supply chain groups conduct on-site audits of our suppliers. As suppliers meet our internal quality control standards they are added to our approved supplier list. We regularly audit our suppliers to ensure they meet FDA, International Organization for Standardization (“ISO”) and other country-specific requirements as necessary. In addition, suppliers of our biomaterials products are certified by the American Association of Tissue Banks (“AATB”). Our quality assurance and supply chain groups conduct annual audits to ensure continued compliance with our standards; our suppliers provide a certificate of compliance with every shipment of inventory that we receive in conformance with our quality control standards. Our quality control group also performs incoming inspection of our products, in-process inspections and packaging and labeling inspections on-site at our headquarters facility.
We generally do not have long-term supply contracts with our suppliers and they are not required to provide us with any guaranteed minimum production levels. In most cases, we maintain redundant manufacturing capabilities for each of our products to ensure our inventory needs are met. We do, however, have single or limited source contracts with certain suppliers, who provide our biomaterials and materials for select interbody products.
We believe our supplier relationships will be able to support our potential capacity needs for the foreseeable future. To date, we have not experienced any significant difficulty locating and obtaining the suppliers or materials necessary to fulfill our production requirements.
Intellectual Property
Our success depends upon our ability to protect our intellectual property. We proactively protect our innovations by filing
U.S. and foreign patent applications, and our growing intellectual property portfolio reflects significant investment. We have also acquired intellectual property rights via the strategic purchase and license of patents from third parties to complement our internally-developed intellectual property holdings. We utilize specialist intellectual property lawyers to oversee our intellectual property assets. As of December 31, 2016, we owned or licensed 253 issued U.S. patents and 162 issued foreign patents. We had 113 pending U.S. patent applications and 115 pending foreign patent applications. As of December 31, 2016, we also had 28 U.S. trademark registrations, 80 foreign trademark registrations, 10 pending U.S. applications to register trademarks and 11 foreign applications to register trademark registrations.
We license certain technologies used in our MESA products from Spinal LLC pursuant to an exclusive license agreement, which provides us with an exclusive license to the MESA technology and related patents and patent applications to treat diseases of or injuries to the spine until the expiration of all patents licensed pursuant to the agreement, which is expected to be in February 2024 for the material patents currently licensed under this agreement. Under this license agreement, we are required to make royalty payments equal to 6.0% of the net sales of our products that incorporate the MESA technology, subject to an annual minimum royalty payment of $0.4 million.
In addition, we license our tifix one-step locking technology from Dr. Dietmar Wolter pursuant to a license agreement, which provides us with an exclusive license to use such technology in the field of spinal surgery in the United States and a non-exclusive license to use such technology internationally until the expiration of all patents licensed pursuant to the agreement, which is expected to be in December 2019. Under the terms of this license agreement, we are required to make payments equal to 9.0% of net sales of products that incorporate tifix technology.
In 2011, we acquired certain proprietary spinal disc implant technologies that were developed and used in our RHINE™ Cervical Disc System, pursuant to an asset purchase agreement, which could require additional payments up to $12.0 million if certain milestones are met related to U.S. regulatory applications and approvals as of December 31, 2016. In addition, milestone payments of $0.5 million, $2.0 million and $4.0 million are due upon the achievement of net sales from products incorporating such proprietary technologies of $10.0 million, $25.0 million and $50.0 million, respectively. We are also required to make royalty payments equal to 7.0% of net sales from patented products, up to an aggregate amount of $20.0 million.
In 2010, we acquired all rights to certain technologies used in our EVEREST pedicle screw system from Dr. John Carbone, pursuant to an asset purchase agreement, which requires us to make payments to Dr. Carbone equal to 3.5% of the net sales from EVEREST pedicle screws and 1.5% of the net sales from any of our other products that incorporate certain elements of our EVEREST screw technology until the expiration of the last to expire U.S. patent related to such technologies, which is expected to be in August 2031, or, if no U.S. patent issues, for 10 years from product launch, except that we will have no obligation to make such payments on any sales of products made after February 23, 2031.
 20

In 2007, we acquired all rights to certain technologies used in our SERENGETI retractor system from Dr. Josef Gorek, which requires us to make royalty payments equal to 3.0% of net sales from products that incorporate the SERENGETI retractor technology, subject to a minimum annual royalty of the greater of (1) $25 for each retractor sold or used in surgery or (2) $178,375. If we market a non-disposable reusable product incorporating the SERENGETI retractor technology, we will pay to Dr. Gorek a royalty of $25 for each use of such reusable product to place a screw implant in surgery, with a minimum royalty of $100 per surgery in which such reusable product is used. We are required to make such royalty payments on the net sales of any such product until the expiration of the last to expire U.S. patent used in the SERENGETI retractor, which is expected to be in May 2029. In the event we fail to pay the minimum royalties, and do not cure such non-payment after receiving notice of such non-payment, Dr. Gorek would have the right to have one partner other than us for the assigned intellectual property.
In 2004, we acquired all rights to certain technologies used in our DENALI pedicle screw system from Fastenetix LLC and certain other persons, pursuant to an assignment agreement, which requires us to make payments to the assignors equal to 6.0% of net sales of products that incorporate our DENALI screw technology that are covered by an issued patent or described in a patent application assigned to us under this agreement until the expiration of the last to expire patent related to such technologies, which is expected to be in February 2017, and 2.0% to 3.0% of such net sales thereafter. We are also obligated to make payments to the assignors on a product-by-product basis equal to 4.0% of net sales of products that incorporate our DENALI screw technology and that are covered by intellectual property assigned to us under this agreement other than patents and patent applications until either the expiration of the last to expire issued patent relating to such intellectual property or the abandonment of all patent applications relating to such intellectual property, and 2.0% to 3.0% of such net sales thereafter. The Fastenetix parties may have the right to re-purchase the contributed intellectual property in the event we cease operations (other than due to a sale or merger) or we enter into bankruptcy, insolvency or similar proceedings.
We also rely upon trade secrets and know-how to develop and maintain our competitive position. We protect our proprietary rights in trade secrets and know-how through a variety of methods, including confidentiality agreements and proprietary information agreements with suppliers, employees, consultants, and others who may have access to our proprietary information.
Although we believe our patents are valuable, we also believe that our knowledge and experience and our trade secret information with respect to development and manufacturing processes, materials and product design have been equally important in maintaining our proprietary product lines. As a condition of employment, we generally require employees to execute a confidentiality agreement relating to proprietary information and assignment of patents and other intellectual property to us.
Seasonality
Our revenue is typically higher in the late spring and summer and in the fourth quarter of our fiscal year, driven by higher sales of our complex spine products, which is influenced by the higher incidence of adolescent surgeries during these periods to coincide with the beginning of summer vacation and holiday periods.  In addition, due to seasonal changes in mortality rates, some scarce tissues used in our biomaterials products may be, at times, in particularly short supply.
Competition
Our currently marketed products are, and any future products we commercialize will be, subject to intense competition. We believe that the principal competitive factors in our markets are:

• | the quality of outcomes for medical conditions affecting the spine;


• | acceptance by spine surgeons;


• | ease of use and reliability;


• | technical leadership and superiority;


• | effective marketing and distribution;


• | speed to market; and


• | product price and qualification for coverage and reimbursement.

 21

We also compete in the marketplace to recruit and retain qualified scientific, management and sales personnel, as well as in acquiring technologies and technology licenses complementary to our products or advantageous to our business.
We are aware of several companies that compete or are developing technologies in our current and future product areas. As a result, we expect competition to remain intense. We believe that our principal competitors include Medtronic Public Limited Company, DePuy Synthes Inc., Stryker Corporation, Globus Medical, Inc., Zimmer Biomet Holdings, Inc. and NuVasive Inc., which together represent a significant portion of the spine market. We also compete with smaller spine market participants such as Alphatec Holdings, Inc., Orthofix International N.V. and SeaSpine Holdings Corporation who generally have a smaller market share than the principal competitors listed above.
Our ability to compete successfully will depend on our ability to develop proprietary products that reach the market in a timely manner, receive adequate coverage and reimbursement, are cost effective and are safe and effective.
Government Regulation
Our products are medical devices and tissues and therefore subject to extensive regulation by the FDA under the authority of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetics Act (“FDCA”), the Public Health Service Act (“PHSA”) and the regulations promulgated under both statutes, as well as by other domestic and international regulatory bodies. These regulations govern the following activities that we and our suppliers, licensors and partners perform and will continue to perform:

• | product design and development;


• | product testing;


• | product manufacturing;


• | product labeling;


• | product storage;


• | product safety;


• | premarket clearance or approval;


• | advertising and promotion;


• | product marketing, sales and distribution;


• | postmarket surveillance; and


• | postmarket adverse event reporting.

Regulatory Clearances and Approvals
Unless an exemption applies, each medical device that we wish to commercially distribute in the United States will require prior 510(k) clearance or approval of a Pre-Market Approval Application (“PMA”) from the FDA. The FDA classifies medical devices into one of three classes. Devices deemed to pose a low or moderate risk are placed in class I or II, which requires the manufacturer to submit to the FDA a 510(k) premarket notification requesting clearance for commercial distribution, unless the device type is exempt from this requirement. Devices deemed by the FDA to pose the greatest risk, such as life-sustaining, life supporting or implantable devices or devices deemed not substantially equivalent to a previously cleared 510(k) device are placed in class III, requiring submission and approval of a PMA. Both premarket clearance and approval submissions are subject to user fees, which must be paid at the time of submission for FDA review.
To obtain 510(k) clearance, we must submit a premarket notification demonstrating that the proposed device is “substantially equivalent” to a previously cleared 510(k) device or a device that was in commercial distribution before May 28, 1976 for which the FDA has not yet called for the submission of PMAs. The FDA’s 510(k) clearance pathway usually takes from three to 12 months from the date the notification is submitted, but it can take considerably longer, depending on the extent of FDA's requests for additional information and the amount of time a sponsor takes to fulfill them. FDA requests for additional information can include clinical data that the FDA determines is necessary to make a 
 22

determination regarding substantial equivalence.
All of our commercial medical device products to date have been classified as either class I or class II devices and have been cleared for marketing and distribution through the 510(k) pathway, unless exempt.
After a device receives 510(k) clearance, any modification that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, or that would constitute a major change in its intended use, will require a new 510(k) clearance or could require premarket approval. The FDA requires each manufacturer to make this decision initially, but the FDA can review any such decision and can disagree with a manufacturer’s determination. If the FDA disagrees with a manufacturer’s decision not to seek a new premarket clearance, the FDA can require the manufacturer to cease marketing and/or recall the modified device until 510(k) clearance or premarket approval is obtained. We have made, and plan to continue to make, product enhancements that we believe do not require new 510(k) clearances. However, if the FDA requires us to seek 510(k) clearance or premarket approval for any such modifications to previously cleared products, we may be required to cease marketing or recall the modified device until we obtain this clearance or approval, and we could be subject to significant regulatory fines or penalties.
A PMA must be submitted if a device cannot be cleared through the 510(k) clearance process. A PMA application must be supported by extensive data, including, but not limited to, technical information, preclinical data, clinical trial data, manufacturing data and labeling, to demonstrate to the FDA’s satisfaction the safety and efficacy of the device for its intended use.
Once a complete PMA application is submitted, the FDA begins an in-depth review which generally takes between one and three years, but may take significantly longer. During this review period, the FDA may request additional information or clarification of information already provided. Also during this review period, an advisory panel of experts from outside the FDA may be convened to review and evaluate the application and provide recommendations to the FDA as to the approvability of the device. In addition, the FDA will conduct a pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facility to ensure compliance with quality system regulations. New PMA applications or supplements are required prior to marketing for product modifications that affect the safety and efficacy of the device. PMA supplements often require submission of the same type of information as a PMA application, except that the supplement is limited to information needed to support the changes to the device and may not require extensive clinical data or the convening of an advisory panel.
None of our existing products are currently approved under a PMA. In the future, we may decide to strategically commercialize products in the U.S. that would require a PMA but we have no plans to do so at the present time.
Clinical Trials
Clinical trials are almost always required to support a PMA and are sometimes required for a 510(k) premarket notification. In the United States, these trials often require submission of an application for an investigational device exemption, or IDE, if the investigation involves a significant risk device. The IDE application must be supported by appropriate data, such as animal and laboratory testing results, showing that it is safe to test the device in humans and that the testing protocol is scientifically sound. The IDE must be approved in advance by the FDA for a specified number of patients, unless the product is deemed a non-significant risk device and is eligible for more abbreviated IDE requirements. Clinical trials for a significant risk device may begin once the IDE application is approved by the FDA and appropriate institutional review boards, or IRBs, at the clinical trial sites.
Future clinical trials of certain types of products will most likely require that we obtain an IDE from the FDA prior to commencing clinical trials and that the trial be conducted under the oversight of IRBs at the clinical trial sites. Our clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with FDA regulations and similar federal and state regulations concerning human subject protection, including requirements for informed consent, healthcare privacy and financial disclosures by the clinical investigators. The receipt of personal information in connection with our clinical trial initiatives is subject to these human subject protection laws. These laws could create liability for us if one of our research collaborators were to use or disclose research subject information without proper consent or in violation of applicable laws. A clinical trial may be suspended by the FDA or the investigational review board at any time for various reasons, including a belief that the risks to the study participants outweigh the benefits of participation in the study. Even if a study is completed, the results of our clinical testing may not demonstrate the safety and efficacy of the device, or may be equivocal or otherwise not be sufficient to obtain clearance or approval of our products. Similarly, in the EEA, conduct of clinical studies in relation to investigational medical devices is governed by detailed regulatory obligations. These include the requirement for prior authorization by the competent authorities of the country in which the study takes place and the requirement to obtain a positive opinion from a competent Ethics Committee.
Pervasive and Continuing FDA Regulation
 23

After a device is placed on the market, numerous FDA and other regulatory requirements continue to apply. These include:

• | establishment registration and device listing with the FDA;


• | quality system regulations, which require manufacturers to follow stringent design, testing, process control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures;


• | labeling regulations, which prohibit the promotion of products for unapproved, i.e. “off-label,” uses and impose other restrictions on labeling; 


• | medical device reporting, “MDR” regulations, which require that manufacturers report to the FDA if their device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if it were to recur;


• | corrections and removal reporting regulations, which require that manufacturers report to the FDA field corrections and product recalls or removals if undertaken to reduce a risk to health posed by the device or to remedy a violation of the FDCA that may present a risk to health;


• | requirements to conduct post market surveillance studies to establish continued safety data, and other post-approval conditions; and


• | the FDA’s recall authority, whereby the agency can ask, or under certain conditions order, device manufacturers to recall from the market a product that is in violation of governing laws and regulations.

We are required to, and have, registered with the FDA and ISO as medical device manufacturers and must obtain all necessary permits and licenses to operate our business. As manufacturers, we and our suppliers are subject to announced and unannounced inspections by the FDA and European notified bodies to determine our compliance with the QSR and other applicable regulations. The FDA has inspected our former Leesburg facility on several separate occasions from 2006 through 2016. 
Failure to comply with the applicable regulatory requirements can result in enforcement action by the FDA, which may include, among other things, any of the following sanctions:

• | warning letters, fines, injunctions, consent decrees and civil penalties;


• | repair, replacement, refund or seizure of our products;


• | operating restrictions, partial suspension or total shutdown of production;


• | refusing our request for 510(k) clearance or premarket approval of new products or modifications to existing products;


• | withdrawing or suspending clearances or approvals that are already granted; and


• | criminal prosecution.

International Regulations
Many foreign countries in which we market or intend to market our products have regulatory bodies and restrictions, similar to those of the FDA. International sales are subject to foreign government regulation, the requirements of which vary substantially from country to country. The time required to obtain approval in a foreign country or a CE Certificate of Conformity may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval and the related requirements may differ. Some third-world countries accept CE Certificates of Conformity or FDA clearance or approval as part of applications of approval for marketing of medical devices in their territory. Other countries, including Australia, Japan and Canada require separate regulatory filings.
In the EEA, companies compliant with ISO requirements such as the EN ISO 13485: 2003 Medical devices-Quality management systems-Requirements for regulatory purposes, benefit from a presumption of conformity with the relevant quality system requirements laid down in the Annexes to the Medical Devices Directive. This certification process 
 24

requires that the Company’s quality system and facilities be inspected by a Notified Body for compliance with ISO requirements. Compliance with the ISO requirements can also facilitate market access in other jurisdictions.
We received ISO 13485 certification in November 2007, and we affix the CE Mark to our products concurrently with the 510(k) process in the U.S. We cannot assure that we or our original equipment manufacturer partners will be able to continue to obtain the necessary foreign government approvals or successfully comply with foreign regulations. Our failure to do so could hurt our business, results of operations and financial condition.
European Economic Area
In the EEA, our devices are required to comply with the Essential Requirements laid down in Annex I to the Medical Devices Directive. Compliance with these requirements entitles us to affix the CE mark to our medical devices. We cannot commercialize our medical devices in the EEA without the CE Mark. To demonstrate compliance with the Essential Requirements laid down in Annex I to the Medical Devices Directive and obtain the right to affix the CE mark to our medical devices, we must undergo a conformity assessment procedure, which varies according to the type of medical device and its classification. The Medical Devices Directive groups medical devices into four product classes. These classes and related rules are based on the potential risks associated with the technical design and manufacture of the medical devices that fall within their classification. The classification rules make a distinction between non-invasive, invasive, and active medical devices. A number of additional rules govern specific medical devices, such as those incorporating an ancillary medicinal substance. Except for low risk medical devices (Class I with no measuring function and which are not sterile), where the manufacturer can issue an EC Declaration of Conformity based on a self-assessment of the conformity of its products with the Essential Requirements laid down in the Medical Devices.
A conformity assessment procedure requires the intervention of a Notified Body, which is an organization designated by the competent authorities of a European Union (“EU”) country to conduct conformity assessments.
Depending on the relevant conformity assessment procedure, the Notified Body would typically audit and examine products’ Technical File and the quality system for the manufacture, design and final inspection of our devices before issuing a CE Certificate of Conformity demonstrating compliance with the relevant Essential Requirements laid down in Annex I to the Medical Devices Directive. The Notified Body issues a CE Certificate of Conformity following successful completion of a conformity assessment procedure conducted in relation to the medical device and its manufacturer and their conformity with the Essential Requirements. This Certificate entitles the manufacturer to affix the CE mark to its medical devices after having prepared and signed a related EC Declaration of Conformity. We have now successfully passed annual Notified Body audits since our original certification in November 2007. Following these audits, our Notified Body issued ISO certificates and CE Certificates of Conformity allowing us to draw up an EC Declaration of Conformity and affix the CE mark of conformity to certain of our devices. 
In September 2012, the European Commission adopted a package of legislative proposals designed to replace the existing regulatory framework for medical devices in the EEA. Among these proposals, the Medical Devices Regulation (“MD Regulation”) will replace the Medical Devices Directive and the Active Implantable Medical Devices Directive. 
On June 17, 2016, the Dutch Presidency of the Council of the European Union formally informed the Council of Ministers of the agreement that was reached, on May 25, 2016, with the European Parliament as part of the trialogue discussion concerning the text of the proposed MD Regulation. On February 22, 2017, after finalization a final linguistic review of the text and the last revisions, the final text of the MD Regulation was published on the Council of the European Union's website. The Regulation is now definitively adopted by the Council and the European Parliament would enter into force in May 2017 and will become applicable in May 2020. The MD Regulation would, among other things, impose additional reporting requirements on manufacturers of high risk medical devices, impose an obligation on manufacturers to appoint a “qualified person” responsible for regulatory compliance, and provide for stricter clinical evidence requirements, impose additional requirements on economical operators (including distributors, authorized representatives), and is expected to impose extensive changes to labeling / implant cards and other requirements. As a result of the approval of the MD Regulation certain spinal devices will be reclassified from Class IIb to Class III. Rule 8 of Annex VIII to the MD Regulation states that all implantable devices and long-term surgically invasive devices are classified as Class IIb unless they “are spinal disc replacement implants and implantable devices that come into contact with the spinal column, in which case they are in Class III with the exception of components such as screws, wedges, plates and instruments.” For us, this means rods, hooks, connectors, cervical discs, and corpectomy cages will be reclassified to Class III and will be subject to stricter requirements by the notified body.
The scrutiny imposed by notified bodies for the technical documentation related these devices will increase considerably. Some differences between requirements for Class IIb and Class III devices are summarized below:
 25


• | Class III devices undergo an additional technical documentation assessment following which the notified bodies issue a technical documentation assessment certificate.


• | Increased strength of requirement for clinical investigation and evaluation.


• | A summary of safety and clinical performance must be prepared by manufacturers for publication on the EUDAMED database for medical devices;


• | Greater expectation of “proactive” post market surveillance, and in particular, post market clinical follow up studies.


• | Review for Class III devices is not a sampling process, unlike for Class IIa and Class IIb devices which is done on a sampling basis; and


• | Notified Bodies shall notify the Commission and the newly created Medical Device Coordination Group (“MDCG”) of new applications for Class III devices as part of a mandatory clinical evaluation consultation procedure.

Further, the advertising and promotion of our products in the EEA is subject to the provisions of the Medical Devices Directive, Directive 2006/114/EC concerning misleading and comparative advertising, and Directive 2005/29/EC on unfair commercial practices, as well as other national legislation in the EEA countries governing the advertising and promotion of medical devices. These laws may limit or restrict the advertising and promotion of our products to the general public and may impose limitations on our promotional activities with healthcare professionals.
Tissue, Cellular and Tissue Based Products
Tissue-only products are regulated by the FDA as Human Cell, Tissue and Cellular and Tissue Based Products, or HCT/P. In regards to HCT/P, we are registered with FDA and subject to the regulations related only to labeling, packaging, storage and distribution. 
Human cells or tissue intended for implantation, transplantation, infusion, or transfer into a human recipient is regulated as a HCT/P. In the United States the FDA Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (“CBER”) regulates HCT/Ps under 21 CFR Part 1270 and CFR Part 1271. Parts 1270 and 1271 require tissue establishments to screen and test donors, to prepare and follow written procedures for the prevention of the spread of communicable disease, and to maintain records. FDA has published three final rules to broaden the scope of products subject to regulation and to include more comprehensive requirements to prevent the introduction, transmission and spread of communicable disease. One final rule requires firms to register and list their HCT/Ps with FDA. The second rule requires tissue establishments to evaluate donors, through screening and testing, to reduce the transmission of infectious diseases through tissue transplantation. The third rule establishes current good tissue practices for HCT/Ps. FDA’s revised regulations are contained in Part 1271 and apply to tissues recovered after May 25, 2005. The new requirements are intended to improve protection of the public health while minimizing regulatory burden.
We currently distribute VIKOS machined allograft and VESUVIUS morselized products, which are manufactured by a third-party supplier. The FDA periodically inspects tissue processors to determine compliance with these requirements. Violations of applicable regulations noted by the FDA during facility inspections could adversely affect the continued marketing of our products. We believe we comply with all aspects of the current good tissue practices, although there can be no assurance that we will comply, or will comply on a timely basis, in the future. Entities that provide us with allograft bone tissue are responsible for performing donor recovery, donor screening and donor testing and our compliance with those aspects of the current good tissue practices regulations that regulate those functions are dependent upon the actions of these independent entities.
The procurement and transplantation of allograft bone tissue is subject to U.S. federal law pursuant to the National Organ Transplant Act, or NOTA, a criminal statute which prohibits the purchase and sale of human organs used in human transplantation, including bone and related tissue, for “valuable consideration.” NOTA permits reasonable payments associated with the removal, transportation, processing, preservation, quality control, implantation and storage of human bone tissue. With the exception of removal and implantation, we provide services in all of these areas. We make payments to vendors in consideration for the services they provide in connection with the recovery and screening of donors. Failure to comply with the requirements of NOTA could result in enforcement action against us. The procurement of human tissue is also subject to state anatomical gift acts and some states have statutes similar to NOTA. In addition, some states require that tissue processors be licensed by that state. Failure to comply with state laws could also result in enforcement action against us.
Healthcare Fraud and Abuse
 26

Healthcare fraud and abuse laws apply to our business including when a customer submits a claim for an item or service that is reimbursed under Medicare, Medicaid or most other federally-funded healthcare programs. Companies operating in the health industry must comply with state and federal health care fraud and abuse regulations that have criminal, civil and administrative penalties for potential violations.
The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or paying remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, items or services for which payment may be made, in whole or in part, under federal health care programs, such as by Medicare or Medicaid. The federal Anti-Kickback Statute is subject to evolving interpretations and has been applied by government enforcement officials to a number of common business arrangements in the medical device industry. For example, the federal government has enforced the Anti-Kickback Statute to reach large settlements with device manufacturers based on allegedly sham consultant arrangements with physicians. A number of states also have anti-kickback laws that establish similar prohibitions that may apply to items or services reimbursed by government programs as well as any third-party payors, including commercial insurers. Further, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, or, collectively, the “PPACA”, among other things, clarified the intent requirements of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and the federal criminal statute governing healthcare fraud. Specifically, a person or entity can be found to have violated the statutes without actual knowledge of these statutes or specific intent to violate them. In addition, the PPACA amended the Social Security Act to provide that the government may assert that a claim for reimbursement for items or services from federal healthcare programs resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute may constitute a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal False Claims Act or federal civil money penalties statute potentially subjecting a company to treble damages and mandatory penalties for each false claim.
The civil False Claims Act prohibits, among other things, knowingly presenting or causing the presentation of a false, fictitious or fraudulent claim for payment of federal funds, or knowingly making, or causing to be made, a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government. Actions under the federal False Claims Act may be brought by the Attorney General or as a private citizen action (known as qui tams) brought by a private individual in the name of the government. Violations of the federal False Claims Act can result in very significant monetary penalties and treble damages. The federal government is using the False Claims Act, and the accompanying threat of significant liability, in its investigations of healthcare companies throughout the country for a wide variety of Medicare billing practices, as well as federal Anti-Kickback Statute violations and certain marketing practices, including off-label promotion, and has obtained multi-million and multi-billion dollar settlements under the federal False Claims Act in addition to individual criminal convictions under applicable criminal statutes. Given the significant size of actual and potential settlements, it is expected that the government will continue to devote substantial resources to investigating healthcare providers’ and suppliers’ compliance with the healthcare reimbursement rules and fraud and abuse laws.
The federal False Claims Act amendments in 2009 and 2010 expanded the scope of the liability for health care entities generally to potentially reach violations of regulatory duties, such as good manufacturing practices. There have been large settlements in the life sciences arena related to FDA regulatory violations related to promotional activities and the failure to maintain good manufacturing practices.
Even in instances where a company may have no actual liability, the federal False Claims Act private citizen provisions (qui tam) allow the filing of federal False Claims Act actions under seal and impose a mandatory duty on the U.S. Department of Justice to investigate such allegations. Most private citizen actions are declined by the Department of Justice or dismissed by federal courts. However, the investigation costs for a company can be significant and material even if the allegations are without merit.
Federal False Claims Act liability is potentially significant in the health industry because the statute provides for treble damages and mandatory minimum penalties of $5,500 to $11,000 per false claim or statement. Because of the potential for large monetary exposure, health care companies resolve allegations without admissions of liability for significant and material amounts to avoid the uncertainty of treble damages that may awarded in litigation proceedings. Many state jurisdictions have implemented state false claims act statutes that mirror the federal statute.
In addition to civil False Claims Act liability and anti-kickback liability, there are several criminal and administrative health care fraud statutes that provide for criminal and civil monetary penalties and the potential for exclusion from federal health care programs. 
If a governmental authority were to conclude that we are not in compliance with applicable laws and regulations, we and our officers and employees could be subject to severe criminal and civil penalties, including, for example, exclusion from

participation as a supplier of product to beneficiaries covered by Medicare, Medicaid and other federal health care programs.
Reimbursement Overview
Healthcare providers in the United States generally rely on third-party payors, principally private insurers and governmental payors such as Medicare and Medicaid, to cover and reimburse all or part of the cost of a spine surgery in which our products are used. We expect that sales volumes and prices of our products will continue to depend in large part on the availability of coverage and reimbursement from such third-party payors. Third-party payors perform analyses on new technologies to determine if they are medically necessary before providing coverage for them. These third-party payors may still deny reimbursement on covered technologies if they determine that a device used in a procedure was not used in accordance with the payor’s coverage policy. Particularly in the United States, third-party payors continue to carefully review, and increasingly challenge, the prices charged for surgical procedures and medical products.
Medicare coverage and reimbursement policies are developed by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (“CMS”) and its contractors. CMS establishes Medicare coverage and reimbursement policies for medical products and procedures and such policies are periodically reviewed and updated. In 2017, we believe CMS will continue to pilot “bundled payments” as will the private payers. The payers are committed to the transfer from quantity reimbursement to reimbursing and incentivizing based on quality and improved outcomes. The private payers are responding the needs of their customers and are jumping ahead of CMS bundled payment program with their own, more predicable medical costs and better quality of care for their employees. While private payors vary in their coverage and payment policies, most look upon the coverage and payment by Medicare as a benchmark by which to make their own coverage decisions. Medicare reimbursement rates for the same or similar procedures vary due to geographic location, nature of the facility in which the procedure is performed (i.e., teaching or community hospital) and other factors.
In the United States, a large percentage of insured individuals receive their medical care through managed care programs, which monitor and often require pre-approval of the services that a member will receive. Some managed care programs pay their providers on a per capita basis, which puts the providers at financial risk for the services provided to their patients by paying these providers a predetermined payment per member per month and, consequently, may limit the willingness of these providers to use our products.
The indications for surgical treatment of complex spine disorders such as deformity are defined by anatomical angle measurements that are established and well defined among hospitals, physicians and third-party payors. Conversely, fusion procedures for degenerative conditions are typically indicated when the source of the patient’s pain originates from the vertebral level in question and a diagnostic confirmation of degenerative disc disease is made. Current techniques to identify the source of a patient’s degenerative back pain are imprecise and it may be difficult to locate the source of pain. Third-party payors typically require a confirmed diagnosis of degenerative disc disease in order to reimburse for surgical procedures. We believe complex spine procedures typically receive a higher rate of positive insurance coverage as compared to degenerative procedures.
We believe that the overall escalating cost of medical products and services has led to, and will continue to lead to, increased pressures on the healthcare industry to reduce the costs of products and services. We cannot assure you that government or private third-party payors will cover and reimburse the procedures using our products in whole or in part in the future or that payment rates will be adequate. In addition, it is possible that future legislation, regulation or coverage and reimbursement policies of third-party payors will adversely affect the demand for our products or our ability to sell them on a profitable basis.
Internationally, reimbursement and healthcare payment systems vary substantially from country to country and include single-payor, government-managed systems as well as systems in which private payors and government managed systems exist side-by-side. Our ability to achieve market acceptance or significant sales volume in international markets we enter will be dependent in large part on the availability of reimbursement for procedures performed using our products under the healthcare payment systems in such markets. A number of countries may require us to gather additional clinical data before recognizing coverage and reimbursement for our products. It is our intent to complete the requisite clinical studies and obtain coverage and reimbursement approval in countries where it makes economic sense to do so.
Employees
As of December 31, 2016, we had 457 employees in the United States, including the territory of Puerto Rico. Internationally, we had 66 employees based in nine countries, with international offices located in the United Kingdom,
