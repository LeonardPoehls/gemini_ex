PART II
 
 Item 1. BUSINESS
 
We are a specialty finance company that focuses on the origination, investment and management of commercial real estate loans, primarily in the Western U.S. We provide customized, short-term loans to small and middle-market investors and developers that require speed and flexibility. We also hold investments in real estate properties. Our investment objective is to provide investors with attractive current income and long-term shareholder value.  Our Common Stock is traded on the NYSE MKT under the symbol "ORM".
 
We are externally managed and advised by Owens Financial Group, Inc. ("OFG" or the "Manager"), a specialized commercial real estate management company that has originated, serviced and managed alternative commercial real estate investments since 1951. OFG provides us with all of the services vital to our operations and our executive officers and other staff are all employed by OFG pursuant to the management agreement between the Company and the Manager (the "Management Agreement") and the Company's charter. The Management Agreement requires OFG to manage our business affairs in conformity with the policies and investment guidelines that are approved and monitored by our Board of Directors. Our Board of Directors is composed of a majority of independent directors. The Audit, Nominating and Corporate Governance and Compensation Committees of the Board are composed exclusively of independent directors.
 
The Company was incorporated in Maryland on August 9, 2012. Effective May 20, 2013, OMIF, a California Limited Partnership formed in 1984 merged with and into the Company, with the Company as the surviving corporation in the Merger, and the Company commenced conducting all of the business conducted by OMIF at the effective time of the Merger.  The Merger was conducted to reorganize our business operations so that, among other things, we could elect to qualify as a real estate investment trust (a "REIT") for federal income tax purposes. As a qualified REIT we are generally not subject to federal income tax on that portion of our REIT taxable income that is distributed to our stockholders, provided that at least 90% of taxable income is distributed and provided that certain other requirements are met. Certain of our assets that produce non-qualifying income are held in taxable REIT subsidiaries. Unlike other subsidiaries of a REIT, the income of a taxable REIT subsidiary is subject to federal and state income taxes.

OFG arranges, services and maintains the loan and real estate portfolios for the Company. Our loans are secured by mortgages or deeds of trust on unimproved, improved, income-producing and non-income-producing real property, such as condominium projects, apartment complexes, shopping centers, office buildings, and other commercial or industrial properties. No single Company loan may exceed 10% of our assets as of the date the loan is made.

--+--------------------------

Delinquencies
 
Management does not regularly examine the existing loan portfolio to see if acceptable loan-to-value ratios are being maintained because the majority of loans in our portfolio mature in a period of only 1-2 years. Management performs an internal review on a loan secured by property in the following circumstances:

· | payments on the loan become delinquent;
--+----------------------------------------


· | the loan is past maturity;
--+---------------------------


· | it learns of physical changes to the property securing the loan or to the area in which the property is located; or
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | it learns of changes to the economic condition of the borrower or of leasing activity of the property securing the loan.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


A review normally includes conducting a physical evaluation of the property securing the loan and the area in which the property is located, and obtaining information regarding the property's occupancy. In some circumstances, management may determine that a more extensive review is warranted, and may obtain an updated appraisal, updated financial information on the borrower or other information. As of December 31, 2016, we obtained updated appraisals on certain of the properties securing our trust deed investments and certain of our wholly- and majority- owned real estate properties.
 
As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, we had two and three loans, respectively, that were impaired totaling approximately $4,884,000 and $8,694,000, respectively. This included matured loans totaling $4,656,000 and $8,452,000 as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. In addition, seven loans totaling approximately $8,686,000 were past maturity but less than 90 days delinquent in monthly payments as of December 31, 2016 (combined total of impaired and past maturity loans of $13,570,000 and $8,694,000, respectively). Of the impaired and past maturity loans none were in the process of foreclosure and none involved borrowers who were in bankruptcy as of December 31, 2016 and 2015. We foreclosed on one loan during the year ended December 31, 2016 with a principal balance of $1,079,000 and obtained the property via the trustee sale. We foreclosed on no loans during the year ended December 31, 2015.
 
There were no loans modified as troubled debt restructurings during the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015.
 
During the year ended December 31, 2014, the terms of one impaired loan were modified as a troubled debt restructuring. The loan was rewritten as the borrower had paid the principal balance down partially from sale proceeds. The maturity date was extended by six months to April 2015. All other terms of the loan remained the same. Management believed that no specific loan loss allowance was needed on this modified loan given the estimated underlying collateral value. This loan was repaid in full during the fourth quarter of 2015.
 
Of the $8,694,000 in loans that were impaired as of December 31, 2015, $7,615,000 remained impaired (balance of $4,884,000 as of December 31, 2016) and one loan with a principal balance of $1,079,000 was foreclosed upon during 2016.

Following is a table representing our delinquency/impairment experience and foreclosures as of and during the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, 2014, 2013 and 2012:
 

 | 2016 | | 2015 | | 2014 | 2013 | | 2012

Percent of Delinquent Loans to Total Loans | | 3.77% | | | 8.14% | | 32.80% | | 53.98% | | 70.10% 

 
If the delinquency rate increases on loans held by us, our interest income will be reduced by a proportionate amount. If a loan held by us is foreclosed on, we will acquire ownership of real property and the inherent benefits and detriments of such ownership.
 
Compensation to the Manager
 
The Manager receives various forms of compensation and reimbursement of expenses from the Company and compensation from borrowers as set forth in the Company's charter and Management Agreement and summarized below.
 
Compensation and Reimbursement from the Company
 
Management Fees
 
Management fees are paid by the Company to the Manager monthly and cannot exceed 2.75% annually of the average unpaid balance of our loans at the end of each of the 12 months in the calendar year. Since this fee is paid monthly, it could exceed 2.75% in one or more months, but the total fee in any one year is limited to a maximum of 2.75%, and any amount paid above this must be repaid by the Manager to the Company. The Manager is entitled to receive a management fee on all loans, including those that are delinquent. The Manager believes this is justified by the added effort associated with such loans. In certain past years, the Manager has chosen not to take the maximum allowable compensation; however, in recent years, the Manager has elected to take the maximum compensation and will likely continue to take the maximum compensation for the foreseeable future.
Servicing Fees
 
The Manager may act as servicing agent on any or all of the loans held by the Company and expects to continue to service all such loans.  In consideration for acting as the servicing agent, the Manager receives from the Company a monthly servicing fee, which, when added to all other fees paid in connection with the servicing of a particular loan, does not exceed the lesser of the customary, competitive fee in the community where the loan is placed for the provision of such services on that type of loan or up to 0.25% per year of the unpaid balance of loans held by the Company at the end of each month. The Manager has historically been paid the maximum servicing fee allowable.
Reimbursement of Other Expenses
 
The Manager is reimbursed by the Company for the actual cost of goods and materials used for or by the Company and obtained from unaffiliated entities and the actual cost of services of non-management and non-supervisory personnel related to the administration of the Company (subject to certain limitations contained in our Management Agreement).
Compensation from Borrowers
 
In addition to compensation from the Company, the Manager also receives compensation from borrowers under our loans arranged by the Manager.
 
Acquisition and Origination Fees
 
The Manager is entitled to receive and retain all acquisition and origination fees paid or payable by borrowers for services rendered in connection with the evaluation and consideration of potential investments of the Company (including any selection fee, mortgage placement fee, nonrecurring management fee, and any origination fee, loan fee, or points paid by borrowers, or any fee of a similar nature). The acquisition and origination fees are paid by borrowers, and thus, are not an expense of the Company. These fees may be paid at the placement, extension or refinancing of the loan or at the time of final repayment of the loan. The amount of these fees is determined by competitive conditions and the Manager and may have a direct effect on the interest rate borrowers are willing to pay the Company.
 
 4
 
Late Payment Charges
 
The Manager is entitled to receive all late payment charges paid by borrowers on delinquent loans held by the Company (including additional interest and late payment fees).  The late payment charges are paid by borrowers and collected by the Company with regular monthly loan payments or at the time of loan payoff.  These are recorded as a liability (Due to Manager) when collected and are not recognized as an expense of the Company. Generally, on the majority of our loans, the late payment fee charged to the borrower for late payments is 10% of the payment amount. In addition, on the majority of our loans, the additional interest charge required to be paid by borrowers once a loan is past maturity is in the range of 3%-5% (paid in addition to the pre-default interest rate).
Other Miscellaneous Fees
 
We remit other miscellaneous fees to the Manager, which are collected from loan payments, loan payoffs or advances from loan principal (i.e. funding, demand and partial release fees).
 
The Manager may voluntarily accept compensation that is less than the maximum fees and compensation described above, so long as no such change will result in a significant adverse impact on the stockholders of the Company.
 
Principal Investment Objectives
 
Our principal investment objectives are to preserve the capital of the Company and to provide periodic cash distributions to stockholders. It is not our intent to provide tax-sheltered income.
 
 We invest in real estate loans primarily in the Western United States.  The loans we invest in are selected for us by OFG from loans originated by OFG or non-affiliated mortgage brokers. When OFG or a non-affiliated mortgage broker originates a loan for us, the borrower is identified, the loan application is processed and the loan is made available to us. We believe that our loans are attractive to borrowers because of the expediency of OFG's loan approval process, which is approximately ten to twenty days.
 
        We generally employ the same or similar underwriting standards as conventional lenders, such as banks. However, as a specialty finance lender, we are more willing to invest in real estate loans to borrowers that conventional lenders may have rejected for not being creditworthy.  When making these loans we attempt to mitigate the added risk by requiring greater equity in the property.  Borrowers are willing to pay us higher interest rates than conventional lenders charge to obtain these loans. In addition, we usually are able to generate higher fees and charge higher interest rates for our loans because we typically can underwrite and close a loan more rapidly than a conventional lender.  The loans we invest in are typically short in duration, usually less than three years, and bridge the acquisition or improvement of properties that undergo an economic transformation. The short maturity terms of our loans add a degree of risk, as the borrowers are forced to find suitable replacement financing or to sell their property in order to pay off the loan.
 
Investment in Real Estate Loans
 
 Our acquisition and investment policies are to invest at least 86.5% of our capital in real estate loans and activities related thereto.  Due to the declining economy and reductions in real estate values prior to 2013, we experienced increased foreclosures which resulted in our ownership of significantly more real estate than in the past. Therefore, while we initially adhered to our policies of investing at least 86.5% of our capital in real estate loans, economic conditions beyond our control have resulted in less than 86.5% of our capital being accounted for as investments in real estate loans. As of December 31, 2016, approximately 49% of our assets were classified as investments in real estate loans (net of allowance for loan losses).  Additionally, we must maintain a contingency reserve in an aggregate amount of at least 1.5% of our capital pursuant to our charter.

 5
 
Our loans are predominantly secured by first mortgage or deed of trust liens on the underlying properties purchased or developed with the funds that we make available. We sometimes refer to these real properties as the security properties. We invest primarily in loans on commercial, industrial and multi-family residential income-producing real property. Substantially all loans are arranged by OFG, which is licensed by the State of California as a real estate broker and California Finance Lender. During the course of its business, OFG is continuously evaluating prospective investments. OFG originates loans from mortgage brokers, previous borrowers, and by personal solicitations of new borrowers. We may purchase or participate in existing loans that were originated by other lenders. Such a loan might be obtained by us from a third party at an amount equal to or less than its face value. OFG evaluates all potential loan investments to determine if the security for the loan, loan-to-value ratio and other applicable factors meet our investment criteria and policies.  OFG locates, identifies and arranges virtually all loans we invest in and makes all investment decisions on our behalf.  In evaluating prospective loan investments, OFG considers such factors as the following:
 
 
· | the ratio of the amount of the investment to the value of the property by which it is secured;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the property's potential for capital appreciation;
--+---------------------------------------------------


· | expected levels of rental and occupancy rates;
--+-----------------------------------------------


· | current and projected cash flow generated by the property;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------


· | potential for rental rate increases;
--+-------------------------------------


· | the marketability of the investment;
--+-------------------------------------


· | geographic location of the property;
--+-------------------------------------


· | the condition and use of the property;
--+---------------------------------------


· | the property's income-producing capacity;
--+------------------------------------------


· | the quality, experience and creditworthiness of the borrower;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------


· | general economic conditions in the area where the property is located; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | any other factors that OFG believes are relevant.
--+--------------------------------------------------

Types of Loans
 
We invest in first, second, and third mortgage and deed of trust loans, wraparound and participating mortgage and deed of trust loans, construction mortgage and deed of trust loans on real property, and loans on leasehold interest mortgages and deeds of trust. We do not ordinarily make or invest in mortgage and deed of trust loans with a maturity of more than 15 years, and most loans have terms of one to three years. Virtually all loans provide for monthly payments of interest and some also provide for principal amortization. Most of our loans provide for payments of interest only and a payment of principal in full at the end of the loan term. OFG does not originate loans with negative amortization provisions. We do not have any policies directing the portion of our assets that may be invested in construction or rehabilitation loans, loans secured by leasehold interests and second, third and wrap-around mortgage and deed of trust loans. However, OFG recognizes that these types of loans are riskier than first deeds of trust on income-producing, fee simple properties and will seek to minimize the amount of these types of loans in our portfolio. Additionally, OFG will consider that these loans are riskier when determining the rate of interest on the loans.
First Mortgage Loans
 
First mortgage and deed of trust loans are secured by first deeds of trust on real property. Such loans are generally for terms of one to three years. In addition, such loans do not usually exceed 75% of the appraised value of improved real property and 50% of the appraised value of unimproved real property.
Second and Wraparound Mortgage Loans
 
Second and wraparound mortgage and deed of trust loans are secured by second or wraparound deeds of trust on real property which is already subject to prior mortgage indebtedness, in an amount which, when added to the existing indebtedness, does not generally exceed 75% of the appraised value of the secured property. A wraparound loan is one or more junior mortgage loans having a principal amount equal to the outstanding balance under the existing mortgage loans, plus the amount actually to be advanced under the wraparound mortgage loan. Under a wraparound loan, we generally make principal and interest payments on behalf of the borrower to the holders of the prior mortgage loans.
 
 6
 
Third Mortgage Loans
 
Third mortgage and deed of trust loans are secured by third deeds of trust on real property which is already subject to prior first and second mortgage indebtedness, in an amount which, when added to the existing indebtedness, does not generally exceed 75% of the appraised value of the secured property.
Construction and Rehabilitation Loans
 
Construction and rehabilitation loans are loans made for both original development and renovation of property. Construction and rehabilitation loans invested in by us are generally secured by first deeds of trust on real property for terms of six months to two years. In addition, if the secured property is being developed, the amount of such loans generally will not exceed 75% of the post-development appraised value. We will not usually disburse funds on a construction or rehabilitation loan until work in the previous phase of the project has been completed, and an independent inspector has verified completion of work to be paid for. In addition, we require the submission of signed labor and material lien releases by the contractor in connection with each completed phase of the project prior to making any periodic disbursements of loan proceeds. As of December 31, 2016, our loan portfolio contains twenty-two construction/rehabilitation loans with aggregate outstanding principal balances totaling $46,330,000.
Leasehold Interest Loans
 
Loans on leasehold interests are secured by an assignment of the borrower's leasehold interest in the particular real property. Such loans are generally for terms of from six months to 15 years. Leasehold interest loans generally do not exceed 75% of the value of the leasehold interest at origination. The leasehold interest loans are either amortized over a period that is shorter than the lease term or have a maturity date prior to the date the lease terminates. These loans permit OFG to cure any default under the lease. As of December 31, 2016, our loan portfolio does not contain any leasehold interest loans.
Prepayment Penalties and Exit Fees
 
Generally, the loans we invest in do not contain prepayment penalties or exit fees. If our loans are at a high rate of interest in a market of falling interest rates, the failure to have a prepayment penalty provision or exit fee in the loan allows the borrower to refinance the loan at a lower rate of interest, thus providing a lower yield to us on the reinvestment of the prepayment proceeds. While our loans do not contain prepayment penalties, many instead require the borrower to notify OFG of the intent to payoff within a specified period of time prior to payoff (usually 30 to 120 days). If this notification is not made within the proper time frame, the borrower may be charged interest for that number of days that notification was not received.
Balloon Payment
 
 As of December 31, 2016, 99.8% of our loans provide for a "balloon payment" on the principal amount due upon maturity of the loan (including both interest only and amortizing loans with a balloon payment). As of December 31, 2016, one loan (0.2% of total loans) was a fully amortizing loan with a principal balance of approximately $228,000 and a remaining term of 134 months. There are no specific criteria used in evaluating the credit quality of borrowers for loans requiring balloon payments. Furthermore, a substantial period of time may elapse between the review of the financial statements of the borrower and the date when the balloon payment is due. As a result, there is no assurance that a borrower will have sufficient resources to make a balloon payment when due. To the extent that a borrower has an obligation to pay the  loan principal in a large lump sum payment, its ability to repay the loan may be dependent upon its ability to sell the property, obtain suitable refinancing or otherwise raise a substantial amount of cash. As a result, these loans can involve a higher risk of default than amortizing loans (where principal is paid at the same time as the interest payments).
 
Repayment of Loans on Sales of Properties
 
We may require a borrower to repay a loan upon the sale of the secured property rather than allow the buyer to assume the existing loan. This may be done if OFG determines that repayment appears to be advantageous to us based upon then-current interest rates, the length of time that the loan has been held by us, the credit-worthiness of the buyer and our objectives and policies. The net proceeds from any sale or repayment are invested in new loans, held as cash or distributed at such times and in such intervals as OFG, in its sole discretion, determines.

Fixed Rate Loans
 
Approximately 92.4% ($119,876,000) and 87.0% ($92,816,000) of our loans as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, bear interest at a fixed rate. The weighted average interest rate of such loans as of December 31, 2016 and 2015 was approximately 7.9% and 8.1%, respectively.
Variable Rate Loans
 
Approximately 7.6% ($9,806,000) and 13.0% ($13,928,000) of our loans as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, bear interest at a variable rate or include terms whereby the interest rate is increased at a later date. Currently, variable rate loans use the three-month LIBOR rate (1.00% and 0.61% at December 31,  2016 and 2015, respectively) and the six-month LIBOR rate (1.32% and 0.85% at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively). OFG may negotiate spreads over these indices of 6.5% to 9.0%, although there is no assurance that spreads will not be lower or higher depending upon market conditions at the time the loan is made.
 
 It is possible that the interest rate index used in a variable rate loan will rise (or fall) more slowly than the interest rate of other loan investments available to us. OFG attempts to minimize this interest rate differential by tying variable rate loans to indices that are sensitive to fluctuations in market rates. Additionally, most variable rate loans originated by OFG contain provisions under which the interest rate cannot fall below the initial rate.
 
Variable rate loans generally have interest rate caps. We anticipate that the interest rate cap will be a ceiling that is 2% to 4% above the starting rate with a floor rate equal to the starting rate. For these loans, there is the risk that the market rate may exceed the interest cap rate.
 
Variable rate loans of five to ten year maturities are not assumable without the prior consent of OFG. We do not expect to invest in or purchase a significant amount of assumable loans. To minimize our risk, any borrower assuming an existing loan will be subject to the same underwriting criteria as the original borrower.


Debt Coverage Standard for Loans
 
Loans on commercial property generally require the net annual estimated cash flow to equal or exceed the annual payments required on the loan.
 
Loan Limit Amount
 
We limit the amount of our investment in any single loan, and the amount of our investment in loans to any one borrower, to 10% of our total assets as of the date the loan is made or purchased.
Loans to Affiliates
 
We will not provide loans to OFG or an affiliate except for in connection with any advance of expenses or indemnification permitted by our charter, bylaws and the Management Agreement.
 
Purchase of Loans from Affiliates
 
We may purchase loans deemed suitable for acquisition from OFG or its affiliates only if:
 
 
· | OFG makes or purchases such loans in its own name and temporarily holds title thereto for the purpose of facilitating the acquisition of such loans, and provided that such loans are purchased by us for a price no greater than the cost of such loans to OFG (except for compensation in accordance with the terms of the Management Agreement and the charter);
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | There is no other benefit arising out of such transactions to OFG;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------



 8
 
 
· | Such loans are not in default, and;
--+------------------------------------


· | Such loans otherwise satisfy, among other things, the following requirements:
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | We will not make or invest in loans on any one property if at the time of acquisition of the loan the aggregate amount of all loans outstanding on the property, including loans by the Company, would exceed an amount equal to 80% of the appraised value of the property as determined by independent appraisal, unless substantial justification exists because of the presence of other documented underwriting criteria.

Competition
 
Our major competitors in providing specialty finance loans are other mortgage REIT's, specialty finance companies, banks, savings and loan associations, thrifts, conduit lenders, institutional investors, and other entities.  No particular competitor dominates the market. Many of the companies against which we compete have substantially greater financial, technical and other resources than us. In addition, there are numerous mortgage REIT's with investment objectives similar to ours, and others may be organized in the future. Competition in the our market niche depends upon a number of factors, including price and interest rates of the loan, speed of loan processing, cost of capital, reliability, quality of service and support services. We are competitive in large part because OFG generates substantially all loans and is able to provide expedited loan approval, processing and funding. OFG has been in the business of making or investing in loans since 1951.
 
 Regulation of the Manager
 
We are managed by OFG. OFG, in its capacity as our Manager, is subject to the oversight of our Board of Directors pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Management Agreement and our charter. OFG's operations as a mortgage broker are subject to extensive regulation by federal, state and local laws and governmental authorities. OFG conducts its real estate mortgage business under a license issued by the State of California. Under applicable California law, the division has broad discretionary authority over OFG's activities.


Employees
 
The Company does not have employees, other than six full-time and one part-time employee that work directly for its wholly-owned subsidiaries, Brannan Island, LLC and Sandmound Marina, LLC. OFG provides all of the employees (including our officers) necessary for our operations pursuant to the Management Agreement. As of December 31, 2016, OFG had eleven full-time and six part-time employees. All employees are at-will employees and none are covered by collective bargaining agreements.
