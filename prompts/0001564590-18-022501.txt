Products and Applications
 Measurement Solutions
 Perceptron’s In-Line and Near-Line measurement solutions are based on our scanning sensors and software developed by combining Helix® and TriCam® sensors with Vector software.  Our Off-Line measurement solutions are based on a full CMM line plus measuring software.  Measurement Solutions in our fiscal year 2018, 2017, and 2016 represented 91%, 90% and 90% of total sales, respectively.
 In-Line and Near-Line
 AutoGauge®: Our dimensional gauging systems are used in assembly and fabrication plants to contain, correct and control the quality of complex assemblies. AutoGauge® systems are placed directly in the manufacturing line or near the line to automatically measure critical dimensional characteristics of parts using non-contact, laser triangulation sensors.

AutoGauge®ACF: Our near-line robotic systems utilize Perceptron’s AccuSiteTM optical tracking technology to eliminate the need to correlate to a CMM by making all measurements accurate. These systems are used in assembly and manufacturing facilities to replace traditional checking fixtures. Virtually everything about AutoGauge®ACF is automatic – from high speed data collection, to real-time reporting and analysis.  AutoGauge®ACF measures parts within minutes, greatly increasing inspection throughput compared to CMMs, ring gauges, manual tools and other optical metrology systems.  This is a newer product that we launched during our fiscal year ending June 30, 2018.
 AutoFit®: Our gap and flush systems are primarily used in automotive manufacturing plants to contain, correct and control the fit of exterior body panels. These systems automatically measure, record and display the gap and flushness of parts most visible to the automobile consumer such as gaps between front and rear doors, hoods and fenders as well as deck lids and rear quarter panels. These measurements can be conducted throughout the manufacturing process, including in the body shop during assembly of non-painted vehicles and in the final assembly area after the vehicle has been painted.  AutoFit® can measure vehicles while in motion along the assembly line or in a stationary position.  During our fiscal year ending June 30, 2018, we made significant advancements in the algorithms that we use to process the data gathered by our sensors which results in significantly improved information for our customers.
 AutoGuide®:  Our robot guidance systems are used by manufacturing companies for flexible automated assembly applications.  These systems utilize Perceptron sensors and measurement technology to guide and control robotic assembly operations.  AutoGuide® systems calculate the difference between theoretical and actual relationships of a robot to the part being assembled and communicate compensation data in six degrees of freedom to the robot.  AutoGuide® supports numerous robotic assembly applications including automotive windshield insertion, roof loading, hinge mounting, door attachment and sealant application.  During our fiscal year ending June 30, 2018, we reworked and optimized our robot guidance platform for the simpler requirements of de-racking, seam sealing and glue bead applications. The large field of view Helix®evo X300 sensor and one-glance dashboard eliminate the need for precision fixtures, large conveyors and station operators and part handlers. With the streamlined interface for these specific applications, station setup time can now be completed in hours, not days.
 Helix®evo:  Our Helix®evo sensor family takes 3D scanning to the next level, improving performance through faster measuring and increased overall system robustness. Helix®evo utilizes a green laser to measure the multitude of materials used in today’s manufacturing, such as chrome, aluminum, sheet metal and painted surfaces. Its scan acquisition provides accurate feature extraction along with the pristine scan quality required for form analysis. Helix®evo also uses a single power over ethernet cable which reduces the number of auxiliary components required and is designed for fast and accurate measurement on the plant floor. 
 Off-Line 
 Coord3®:   The Coord3 CMM product line includes bridge, gantry and horizontal style machines.  Bench-top CMM are used for small part inspection while very large CMM are used in aerospace, defense and heavy equipment industries.  CMM can be equipped with tactile scanning probes and our TouchDMIS™ measuring software.

Perceptron’s principal customers for measurement solution products have historically been automotive manufacturing companies that we either sell to directly or through manufacturing line builders, system integrators or assembly equipment manufacturers.  These products are typically purchased for installation in connection with retooling programs undertaken by these companies.  Because sales are dependent on the timing of customers’ retooling programs, sales by customer vary significantly from year to year.  For our fiscal years 2018, 2017 and 2016, approximately 41%, 36% and 34%, respectively, of our “Net Sales” on our Consolidated Statements of Operations were derived from sales directly to our four largest automotive end-user customers.  We also sell to manufacturing line builders, system integrators and assembly equipment manufacturers, who in turn sell to our automotive customers.  For our fiscal years 2018, 2017 and 2016, approximately 7%, 11% and 8%, respectively, of our net sales were to manufacturing line builders, system integrators and original equipment manufacturers for the benefit of the same four largest automotive end-user customers in each respective year.  During our fiscal years 2018, 2017 and 2016, direct sales to General Motors Company accounted for approximately 17%, 14% and 12%, respectively, and direct sales to Volkswagen Group accounted for approximately 15%, 16% and 17%, respectively, of our total net sales.  
 Manufacturing and Suppliers
 Our manufacturing operations consist primarily of final assembly and calibration of hardware components and the development, testing and integration of our software with these hardware components.  We build our products from a combination of commercially available parts and uniquely-designed and manufactured parts.  The components are primarily manufactured by third parties.  Individual components such as printed circuit boards are manufactured and supplied by third parties.  We believe a low level of vertical integration gives us significant manufacturing and inventory flexibility and minimizes total product costs.  
 We purchase certain component parts and assemblies from single and multi-source suppliers.  With respect to the majority of our components, we believe that alternative suppliers could be found if existing suppliers could not ship to us.  Many of our components are customized for our specific manufacturing needs.  Due to these specifications, various lead times would be required, based on the specific component that needed to be re-sourced.  Component supply shortages in certain industries, including the electronics industry, have occurred in the past and are possible in the future due to imbalances in supply and demand.  We use global purchasing sources to minimize the risk of part shortages.  We have not experienced significant component supply shortages from single source suppliers in recent years. However, in fiscal 2017 some of our suppliers informed us that a few of our components were at “end-of-life” and so have been discontinued.  We have launched new products that do not require these “end-of-life” components in significant quantities going forward.  Significant delays or interruptions in the delivery of components, assemblies or products by suppliers, or difficulties or delays in shifting manufacturing capacity to new suppliers, could have a material adverse effect on us.  
 International Operations
 Europe:  Our European operations contributed approximately 40%, 41% and 45%, of our net sales during our fiscal years ended June 30, 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively.  Our wholly-owned subsidiary, Perceptron Europe B.V. (“Perceptron B.V.”), formed in The Netherlands, holds a 100% equity interest in Perceptron (Europe) GmbH (“Perceptron GmbH”) and Coord3 s.r.l.

For information regarding net sales and identifiable assets of our non-U.S. based operations, see Note 19, of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, “Segment and Geographic Information”, contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
 Competition
 We believe our products provide cost-efficient and complete solutions for our customers in terms of system capabilities, level of support and competitive pricing for the value provided, which we believe are the principal competitive factors in our markets. We also believe the technology within our products is more advanced than our competition.
 There are a number of companies that sell similar and/or alternative technologies and methods into the same markets and regions as Perceptron. We believe there may be entities, some of which may be larger and have greater resources than our resources, that could develop technology and products which could prove to be competitive with us.   We also believe that certain existing or potential customers may be capable of internally developing their own technology.  See Item 1A: “Risk Factors” titled “There are a number of companies offering competitive products in our markets, or developing products to compete with our products, which could result in a reduction in our revenues through lost sales or a reduction in prices”.
