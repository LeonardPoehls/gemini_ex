Organizational Structure
 
Prior to November 29, 2005, we were known as “Cementitious Materials, Inc.” Pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated September 26, 2005 (the “Merger Agreement”), we merged with NaturalNano Research, Inc. on November 29, 2005. Immediately following the Merger, we changed our name to NaturalNano, Inc. NaturalNano, located in Pittsford, New York, was engaged in the development and commercialization of material science technologies with an emphasis on additives to polymers and other industrial and consumer products by taking advantage of technology advances developed in-house. The Company’s current activities are directed toward research, development, production and marketing of its proprietary technologies relating to the treatment and separation of nanotubes from halloysite clay and the development of related commercial applications for:

On June 23, 2016 (the "Effective Date"), it entered into a Share Exchange Agreement (the "Exchange Agreement") with all of the shareholders of Omni Shrimp, Inc., a Florida corporation ("OMNI"), pursuant to which the shareholders exchanged with the Company all of the outstanding shares of stock of OMNI and OMNI thereupon became a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. In consideration for the exchange of those OMNI shares, the Company issued 28,500 shares of a newly created Series E Preferred Stock of the Company (the "Series E Preferred Stock"). For accounting purposes, the transaction was accounted for as a merger, and OMNI was deemed the surviving entity
 
As a result of their ownership of the Series E Preferred Stock, the Omni shareholders acquired the right to vote 95% of the voting control of the Company. The Series E Preferred Stock is also convertible into common stock which, in the aggregate, would represent up to 95% of the outstanding common stock after the conversion. In addition, on the Effective Date, the holders of all of the Company's outstanding Series B and Series D Preferred Stock, including James Wemett, who is a director of the Company and was an officer and principal shareholder of the company prior to the effective date, as the holder of the Series D shares, surrendered those shares to the Company.
 
On April 6, 2017, Omni merged into NaturalNano, Inc. which was the surviving entity in the merger, and the Company changed its name to Omni Shrimp Inc.
 
Management Changes during 2016
 
Commensurate with the Exchange Agreement, on June 21, 2016, Colm Wrynn was elected as a director of the Company and was named Chief Executive Officer.
 
On June 21, 2016, James Wemett resigned as an officer of the Company and Colm Wrynn, the President of Omni became the President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company, and Daniel Stelcer, a Vice President of Omni became the Secretary and Chief Operating Officer of the Company. Mr. Stelcer was named a Director of Omni at that time. Ms. Giampietro is a Vice President of the Company.
Products
 
The Company is a marketer of seafood, primarily in the United States.
 
Shrimps come in many varieties which are differentiated by their color.
 
The highest quality shrimp are called “pinks” and are primarily located in American waters off the Florida coast. The Company specializes in these “Key West pinks” which are enjoyed as “peel and eat” or in a wide variety of recipes. The harvesting season for pinks is from November through June. Throughout the year, Omni also harvests “brown” and “white” shrimp.
 
Omni believes that it differentiates itself from its competitors not only by the quality of its product but its relationships with distributors allowing it to get its product to market as quickly as possible in order to guarantee freshness and taste. Our boats have refrigeration units on board which lock in freshness, and we use a processor in Louisiana which allows our haul to get out to the dining public within two to three days of catch resulting in as tasty a dining experience as possible.

Marketing Plan
 
In essence, our marketing plan is the product.   The demand for shrimp is great and the demand for chemical free, United States wild caught shrimp continues to increase as the American public becomes more educated and concerned with the origin and potential hazards associated with the handling of seafood products, including hazardous chemicals especially from imported shrimp. Currently, 90% of the shrimp we eat is imported, but less than two percent of imports get inspected by U.S. regulatory agencies.  Imported shrimp, more than any other seafood, has been found to be contaminated with banned chemicals, pesticides etc.  To date the Company has found a ready market for all the shrimp it produces.  Through, a network of distributors, Omni arranges for sale of all its catch through many channels including direct to restaurants, Universities as well as multiple super market chains located throughout the United States.
Competition
 
The shrimp market is fragmented with many providers. The main competition comes from farm raised imports.  However, the U.S. Shrimp Association is pleased with the two recent trade-related executive orders signed by President Donald Trump in late March which should help level the playing field against importers dumping shrimp on the market and not paying duties. 
Market Size
 
According to the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration (“NOAA”) of the United States Department of Commerce, in 2014 ( the most recent year for which data is available) , per capita domestic consumption of fish was about 14.5 pounds and represented a market of approximately $90 billion annually. Amongst shellfish, shrimp is the second most caught product after crabmeat with a total catch of approximately 300 million pounds. However, total domestic demand is about 1.7 billion pounds and the majority of fish are imported.
Employees
 
As of April 28, 2017, the Company employed three executive officers. All other services are provided by outside contractors. We offer no health coverage plan for our employees.
