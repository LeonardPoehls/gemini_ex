Item 1. | Business.
--------+----------

General
 T Bancshares, Inc. (the “Company,” “we,” “us,” or “our”) was incorporated under the laws of the State of Texas on December 23, 2002 to serve as the bank holding company for T Bank, N.A., a national association (the “Bank”), which opened on November 2, 2004. The Bank operates through a main office located at 16200 Dallas Parkway, Dallas, Texas. Other than its ownership of the Bank, the Company conducts no material business.
 The Bank is a full-service commercial bank offering a broad range of commercial and consumer banking services to small- to medium-sized businesses, single-family residential and commercial contractors and consumers. Lending services include commercial loans to small to medium-sized businesses and professional concerns as well as consumers. The Bank offers a wide range of deposit services including demand deposits, regular savings accounts, money market accounts, individual retirement accounts, and certificates of deposit with fixed rates and a range of maturity options. The Bank also offers wealth management and trust services. These services are provided through a variety of delivery systems including automated teller machines, mobile banking and Internet banking.
 As of December 31, 2016, the Company had, on a consolidated basis, approximately $213.1 million in assets, $158.7 million in total loans and $174.7 million in deposits.
 Definitive Agreement with Tectonic Acquisition, Inc.
 On November 10, 2016, the Company entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”) with T Acquisition, Inc. (“Parent”), and joined in by Tectonic Advisors, LLC (“Tectonic”), pursuant to which Parent will acquire the Company through the merger of a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent with and into the Company (the “Merger”), with the Company surviving the Merger.
 In connection with the Merger, holders of the Company’s common stock will be entitled to receive an amount in cash consisting of two payments that, based on the Company’s Adjusted Equity (as defined in the Merger Agreement) at December 31, 2016, would have totaled approximately $10.3036 per share:
   
· | Special Dividend. The first payment is a special dividend to be paid by The Company to each holder of record of common stock as of a date just prior to closing in an amount by which the Company’s Adjusted Equity as of a date just prior to closing exceeds $20,000,000. Based on the Company’s estimated, unaudited shareholders’ equity as of December 31, 2016, the special dividend would have equaled approximately $2.2761 per share. The special dividend will increase (or decrease) based on the Company’s net income (or net losses) from December 31, 2016 to a date just prior to closing. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Per Share Merger Consideration. The second payment is the per share merger consideration to be paid by Parent for each share of T Bancshares common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effect time of the Merger equal to approximately $8.0275 per share, subject to adjustment.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



The Merger was approved by shareholders of the Company on March 10, 2017 and is subject to customary closing conditions, including the receipt of regulatory approvals.

The Merger is currently expected to be completed in the second quarter of 2017.
 Market Area
 Our principal banking markets include Dallas, Tarrant, Denton, Collin and Rockwall counties which encompass an area commonly referred to as the Dallas/Fort Worth Metroplex. We currently operate through a main office located at 16200 Dallas Parkway, Dallas, Texas. We also serve on a national scale certain niche markets that include loans to dentists and small business lending under programs through the U.S. Small Business Administration and the U.S. Department of Agriculture.
Competition
 The market for financial services is rapidly changing and intensely competitive and is likely to become more competitive as the number and types of market entrants increases. The Bank competes in both lending and attracting funds with other commercial banks, savings and loan associations, credit unions, consumer finance companies, pension trusts, mutual funds, insurance companies, mortgage bankers and brokers, brokerage and investment banking firms, asset-based nonbank lenders, government agencies and certain other non-financial institutions, including retail stores, which may offer more favorable financing alternatives than the Bank.

Lending Services
 Lending Policy
 We offer a full range of lending products, including commercial loans to small- to medium-sized businesses and professional concerns, real estate loans and consumer loans. We compete for these loans with competitors who are well established in our primary market area and have greater resources and lending limits. As a result, we currently offer more flexible pricing and terms to attract borrowers.
 The Bank’s delegations of authority, which are approved by the Board of Directors, provide for various levels of officer lending authority. The Bank has an independent review that evaluates the quality of loans on a periodic basis and determines if loans are originated in accordance with the guidelines established by the Board of Directors. Additionally, our Board of Directors has formed a Directors’ Loan Committee with members determined by board resolution to provide the following oversight:
  
· | ensure compliance with loan policy, procedures and guidelines as well as appropriate regulatory requirements;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | approve loans with net bank exposure over $2,000,000; 
· | monitor delinquent, non-accrual loans and classified loans; 
· | monitor loan portfolio concentrations and quality through a variety of metrics; 
· | monitor our loan servicing and review systems; and 
· | review the adequacy of the loan loss reserve. 


We follow a conservative lending policy, but one which we believe permits prudent risks to assist businesses and consumers in our lending market. Interest rates vary depending on our cost of funds, the loan maturity, the degree of risk and other loan terms. The Bank does not make any loans to any of its directors, executive officers or their affiliates.
 Lending Limits
 The Bank’s lending activities are subject to a variety of lending limits. Differing limits apply based on the type of loan or the nature of the borrower, including the borrower’s relationship to the Bank. In general, however, the Bank is able to loan any one borrower a maximum amount equal to either:

· | 15% of the Bank’s capital and surplus and allowance for loan losses; or 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | 25% of its capital and surplus and allowance for loan losses if the amount that exceeds 15% is secured by cash or readily marketable collateral, as determined by reliable and continuously available price quotations; or
· | any amount when the loan is fully secured by a segregated deposit at the Bank and the Bank has perfected its security interest in the deposit. 


These legal limits will increase or decrease as the Bank’s capital increases or decreases as a result of its earnings or losses, among other reasons. 
 Credit Risks
 The principal economic risk associated with each category of loans that the Bank makes is the creditworthiness of the borrower. Borrower creditworthiness is affected by general economic conditions and the strength of the relevant business market segment. General economic factors affecting a borrower’s ability to repay include interest, inflation and employment rates, as well as other factors affecting a borrower’s customers, suppliers and employees. The well-established financial institutions in our primary service area currently make proportionately more loans to medium- to large-sized businesses than the Bank. Many of the Bank’s anticipated commercial loans will likely be made to small- to medium-sized businesses that may be less able to withstand competitive, economic and financial pressures than larger borrowers.
Commercial and Industrial Loans
 Loans for commercial purposes in various lines of businesses are a major component of the Bank’s loan portfolio. The targets in the commercial loan markets are retail establishments, professional service providers, in particular dentists, and small-to-medium-sized businesses. The terms of these loans vary by purpose and by type of underlying collateral, if any. The commercial loans primarily are underwritten on the basis of the borrower’s ability to service the loan from income and their creditworthiness. The Bank will typically make equipment loans for a term of ten years or less at fixed or variable rates, with the loan fully amortized over the term. Loans to support working capital will typically have terms not exceeding one year and will usually be secured by accounts receivable, inventory or personal guarantees of the principals of the business. For loans secured by accounts receivable or inventory, principal will typically be repaid as the assets securing the loan are converted into cash, and for loans secured with other types of collateral, principal will typically be repaid over the term of the loan or due at maturity.

Commercial lending generally involves greater credit risk than residential mortgage or consumer lending, and involves risks that are different from those associated with commercial real estate lending. Although commercial loans may be collateralized by equipment or other business assets, the liquidation of collateral in the event of a borrower default may represent an insufficient source of repayment because equipment and other business assets may, among other things, be obsolete or of limited use. Accordingly, the repayment of a commercial loan depends primarily on the creditworthiness and projected cash flow of the borrower (and any guarantors), while liquidation of collateral is considered a secondary source of repayment. On some of these loans, the Bank takes a security interest in real estate as a prudent practice and measure and not as the principal collateral for the loan.
 Real Estate Loans
 The Bank makes owner occupied and non-owner occupied commercial real estate loans, residential and commercial construction and development loans, and residential real estate loans. 
  
· | Commercial real estate. Commercial real estate loan terms generally are limited to 25 years or less. Interest rates may be fixed or adjustable, although rates typically are not fixed for loans with maturity dates exceeding 10 years. The Bank generally requires personal guarantees from the principal owners of the property supported by a review by the Bank’s management of the principal owners’ personal financial statements. Risks associated with commercial real estate loans include fluctuations in the value of real estate, tenant vacancy rates and the quality of the borrower’s management. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | Construction and development loans. We make construction and development loans on owner occupied real estate, pre-sold or leased, and speculative basis. If the borrower has entered into an agreement to sell or lease the property prior to beginning construction, then the loan is considered to be pre-sold or leased. If the borrower has not entered into an agreement to sell or lease the property prior to beginning construction, then the loan is considered to be speculative. Construction and development loans are generally made with a 12 to 18 months and interest is paid monthly. The ratio of the loan principal to the value of the collateral as established by independent appraisal typically will not exceed industry standards and applicable regulations. Speculative loans are based on the borrower’s financial strength and cash flow position. Loan proceeds will be disbursed based on the percentage of completion and only after the project has been inspected by an experienced construction lender or third-party inspector. Risks associated with construction loans include, without limitation, fluctuations in the value of real estate, the financial condition of the buyer on a presold basis and of the borrower on a speculative basis, and the ability of the borrower and/or the borrower’s contractor(s) to complete the project timely and within the estimated budget.
· | Residential real estate. The Bank’s residential real estate loans consist of loans to acquire and renovate existing homes for subsequent re-sale, residential new construction loans, residential loans purchased in the secondary market, residential rental properties, and on a limited basis, traditional mortgage lending for one-to-four family owner occupied property. All loans are made in accordance with the Bank’s appraisal and loan policy with the ratio of the loan principal to the value of collateral as established by independent appraisal generally not exceeding 80%. We believe these loan-to-value ratios are sufficient to compensate for fluctuations in real estate market value and to minimize losses that could result from a downturn in the residential real estate market. 

Government Enhanced Small Business Lending
 The Bank originates and services commercial and real estate loans under programs guaranteed by the U.S. Small Business Administration and the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The principal balance of these loans is generally guaranteed 75% by these agencies. These loans generally offer borrowers more flexible terms and conditions not available for conventional commercial loans. Examples of more flexible terms include longer amortization periods, lower required down payments, and less borrower operating history. These loans are generally secured by equipment, real estate, and other tangible collateral. Loan-to-value ratios may, in some instances, be higher than conventional loans. Loans secured by business assets that do not include real estate have terms that are generally ten years or less and are fully amortizing. Loans secured by real estate as the principal collateral are generally twenty five years or less and are also fully amortizing. Most loans are adjustable rate loans but may be fixed for the term of the loan. Repayment of the loans is based on an analysis of the borrower’s ability to generate sufficient income from operations. This analysis may rely more heavily on projected future earnings than on conventional loans. The Bank also analyzes the industry sector to determine the feasibility of the projected income.
 There is an active secondary market for the guaranteed portion of these loans. Because the guaranteed portion carries the full faith and credit guarantee of the U.S. Government, the lower investor required yield on that portion of the loan generally creates a premium at the time of the sale.

Consumer Installment Loans
 On a limited basis, the Bank makes loans to individuals for personal, family and household purposes, including secured and unsecured installment and term loans. These loans are typically to the principals and employees of our business customers. Repayment of consumer loans depends upon the borrower’s financial stability and is more likely to be adversely affected by divorce, job loss, illness and personal hardships than repayment of other loans. Because many consumer loans are secured by depreciable assets such as boats, cars and trailers, the loan should be amortized over the useful life of the asset. The loan officer will review the borrower’s past credit history, past income level, debt history and, when applicable, cash flow and determine the impact of all these factors on the ability of the borrower to make future payments as agreed. The principal competitors for consumer loans are the established banks and finance companies in our market.
Portfolio Composition
 The following table sets forth the composition of the Bank’s loan portfolio at December 31, 2016. Loan balances do not include undisbursed loan proceeds, unearned income, sold guaranteed portions of loans held for sale, or allowance for loan losses.

 | Portfolio Percentage at December 31, 2016 | 
---------------------------+--------------------------------------------+----
Commercial and industrial | | 51 | %
Real Estate – residential | | 4 | %
Real Estate - commercial | | 12 | %
Real Estate – construction | | 4 | %
SBA 7a | | 19 | %
SBA 504 | | 6 | %
USDA | | 2 | %
Consumer installment | | 2 | %
 | | 100 | %

Investments
 The Bank invests a portion of its assets in U.S. Treasuries, U.S. government agency securities, mortgage-backed securities, direct obligations of quasi government agencies including Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and the Federal Home Loan Bank, Property Assessed Clean Energy assets and federal funds sold. No investment in any of those instruments exceeds any applicable limitation imposed by law or regulation. The Bank’s investments are managed in relation to loan demand and deposit growth, and are generally used to provide for the investment of excess funds at minimal risks while providing liquidity to fund increases in loan demand or to offset deposit fluctuations. The Bank’s Asset-Liability Committee reviews the investment portfolio on an ongoing basis in order to ensure that the investments conform to the Bank’s policy as set by the Board of Directors.
Deposit Services
 Deposits are the major source of the Bank’s funds for lending and other investment activities. Additionally, we also generate funds from loan principal repayments and prepayments. Scheduled loan repayments are a relatively stable source of funds, while deposit inflows and outflows and loan prepayments are influenced significantly by general interest rates and market conditions. The Bank considers the majority of its regular savings, demand, NOW, and money market deposit accounts to be core deposits. These accounts comprised approximately 55% of the Bank’s total deposits at December 31, 2016. The Bank’s remaining deposits were composed of time deposits less than $100,000, which comprised 2% of total deposits, and time deposits of $100,000 and greater, which comprised approximately 43% of total deposits at December 31, 2016. The Bank believes it is very competitive in the types of accounts and interest rates we offer on deposit accounts, in particular money market accounts and time deposits. We actively solicit these deposits through personal solicitation by our officers and directors, through deposit referral services, and through our Internet banking strategy.
Trust Services
 The Bank offers traditional fiduciary services, such as serving as executor, trustee, agent, administrator or custodian for individuals, nonprofit organizations, employee benefit plans and organizations. The Bank’s trust department works with our customers and their financial advisors to define objectives, goals and strategies for their investment portfolios and tailor their investment portfolios accordingly. As of December 31, 2016, the Bank had approximately $1.2 billion in trust assets under management.

Other Banking Services
 Other banking services currently offered or anticipated include cashier’s checks, travelers’ checks, direct deposit of payroll and Social Security payments, bank-by-mail, remote check deposits, automated teller machine cards and debit cards. The Bank offers full service personal and business internet banking which includes remote deposit for both consumers and businesses, bill payment, electronic transfer of funds between financial institutions, as well as traditional internet services such as balance inquiries and internal funds transfers. The Bank provides a courier and mobile banking concierge service throughout the Dallas/Fort Worth Metroplex and offers its customers free usage of any automated teller machine in the world through its debit card.
Employees
 The success of the Bank depends, in significant part, on its ability to attract, retain and motivate highly qualified management and other personnel, for whom competition is intense. The Bank currently has 42 full-time equivalent employees. None of the Bank’s employees are represented by a collective bargaining agreement. The Bank believes that its relations with its employees are good.

 SUPERVISION AND REGULATION
 General
 Set forth below is a description of the significant elements of the laws and regulations applicable to the Company and the Bank. The description is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the statutes, regulations and policies that are described. Moreover, notwithstanding the recent presidential election, these statutes, regulations and policies are continually under review by the U.S. Congress and state legislatures and federal and state regulatory agencies. A change in statutes, regulations or regulatory policies applicable to the Company or its principal subsidiary, the Bank, could have a material effect on our business.
Regulatory Agencies 
 As a registered bank holding company, the Company is subject to the supervision and regulation of the Federal Reserve and, acting under delegated authority, the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas (the “Reserve Bank”) pursuant to the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (the “Bank Holding Company Act”). As a national bank, the Bank is subject to the supervision and regulation of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (the “Comptroller”).
Bank Holding Company Regulation
 Bank Holding Company Act. As a registered bank holding company, the Company is required to furnish to the Federal Reserve annual and quarterly reports of its operations and may also be required to furnish such additional information and reports as the Federal Reserve or the Reserve Bank may require.

Under the Bank Holding Company Act, the Company must obtain the prior approval of the Federal Reserve or, acting under delegated authority, the Reserve Bank before (1) acquiring direct or indirect ownership or control of any class of voting securities of any bank or bank holding company if, after the acquisition, the Company would directly or indirectly own or control 5% or more of the class; (2) acquiring all or substantially all of the assets of another bank or bank holding company; or (3) merging or consolidating with another bank holding company. 
 Under the Bank Holding Company Act, any company must obtain approval of the Federal Reserve prior to acquiring control of the Company or the Bank. For purposes of the Bank Holding Company Act, “control” is defined as ownership of 25% or more of any class of voting securities of the Company or the Bank, the ability to control the election of a majority of the directors, or the exercise of a controlling influence over management or policies of the Company or the Bank. 
 Change in Bank Control Act. The Change in Bank Control Act of 1978, as amended (the “Change in Bank Control Act”), and the related regulations of the Federal Reserve require any person or groups of persons acting in concert (except for companies required to make application under the Bank Holding Company Act), to file a written notice with the Federal Reserve or, acting under delegated authority, the appropriate Federal Reserve Bank, before the person or group acquires control of the Company. The Change in Bank Control Act defines “control” as the direct or indirect power to vote 25% or more of any class of voting securities or to direct the management or policies of a bank holding company or an insured bank. A rebuttable presumption of control arises under the Change in Bank Control Act where a person or group controls 10% or more, but less than 25%, of a class of the voting stock of a company or insured bank which is a reporting company under the Exchange Act, such as the Company, or such ownership interest is greater than the ownership interest held by any other person or group.
 Permitted Activities. The Bank Holding Company Act also limits the investments and activities of bank holding companies. In general, a bank holding company is prohibited from acquiring direct or indirect ownership or control of more than 5% of the voting shares of a company that is not a bank or a bank holding company or from engaging directly or indirectly in activities other than those of banking, managing or controlling banks, providing services for its subsidiaries, and various non-bank activities that are deemed to be closely related to banking. The activities of the Company are subject to these legal and regulatory limitations under the Bank Holding Company Act and the implementing regulations of the Federal Reserve.
 A bank holding company may also elect to become a “financial holding company,” by which a qualified parent holding company of a banking institution may engage, directly or through its non-bank subsidiaries, in any activity that is financial in nature or incidental to such financial activity or in any other activity that is complementary to a financial activity and does not pose a substantial risk to the safety and soundness of depository institutions or the financial system generally. A bank holding company will be able to successfully elect to be regulated as a financial holding company if all of its depository institution subsidiaries meet certain prescribed standards pertaining to management, capital adequacy and compliance with the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977, as amended (the “Community Reinvestment Act”), such as being “well-capitalized” and “well-managed,” and must have a Community Reinvestment Act rating of at least “satisfactory.” Financial holding companies remain subject to regulation and oversight by the Federal Reserve. The Company believes that the Bank, which is the Company’s sole depository institution subsidiary, presently satisfies all of the requirements that must be met to enable the Company to successfully elect to become a financial holding company. However, the Company has no current intention of seeking to become a financial holding company. Such a course of action may become necessary or appropriate at some time in the future depending upon the Company’s strategic plan.
 Source of Strength. Under the Federal Reserve’s “source of strength” doctrine, a bank holding company is required to act as a source of financial and managerial strength to any subsidiary bank. The holding company is expected to commit resources to support a subsidiary bank, including at times when the holding company may not be in a financial position to provide such support. A bank holding company’s failure to meet its source-of-strength obligations may constitute an unsafe and unsound practice or a violation of the Federal Reserve’s regulations, or both. The source-of-strength doctrine most directly affects bank holding companies in situations where the bank holding company’s subsidiary bank fails to maintain adequate capital levels. This doctrine was codified by the Dodd-Frank Act, but the Federal Reserve has not yet adopted regulations to implement this requirement.
 Sound banking practice. The Federal Reserve also has the power to order a bank holding company to terminate any activity or investment, or to terminate its ownership or control of any subsidiary, when it has reasonable cause to believe that the continuation of such activity or investment or such ownership or control constitutes a serious risk to the financial safety, soundness, or stability of any subsidiary bank of the bank holding company.
 Bank holding companies are not permitted to engage in unsound banking practices. For example, the Federal Reserve’s Regulation Y requires a bank holding company to give the Federal Reserve prior notice of any redemption or repurchase of its own equity securities, if the consideration to be paid, together with the consideration paid for any repurchases in the preceding year, is equal to 10% or more of the company’s consolidated net worth. There is an exception for bank holding companies that are well-managed, well capitalized, and not subject to any unresolved supervisory issues. The Federal Reserve may oppose the transaction if it believes that the transaction would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice or would violate any law or regulation. As another example, a holding company could not impair its subsidiary bank’s soundness by causing it to make funds available to non-banking subsidiaries or their customers if the Federal Reserve believed it not prudent to do so.
 
9
 

The Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act of 1989 (“FIRREA”) expanded the Federal Reserve’s authority to prohibit activities of bank holding companies and their non-banking subsidiaries which represent unsafe and unsound banking practices or which constitute violations of laws or regulations. FIRREA increased the amount of civil money penalties which the Federal Reserve can assess for activities conducted on a knowing and reckless basis, if those activities caused a substantial loss to a depository institution. The penalties can be as high as $1.0 million for each day the activity continues. FIRREA also expanded the scope of individuals and entities against which such penalties may be assessed.
 Dividends. Consistent with its policy that bank holding companies should serve as a source of financial strength for their subsidiary banks, the Federal Reserve has stated that, as a matter of prudent banking, a bank holding company generally should not maintain a rate of distributions to shareholders unless its available net income has been sufficient to fully fund the distributions, and the prospective rate of earnings retention appears consistent with the bank holding company’s capital needs, asset quality, and overall financial condition. In addition, we are subject to certain restrictions on the making of distributions as a result of the requirement that the Bank maintain an adequate level of capital as described below. As a Texas corporation, we are restricted under the Texas Business Organizations Code from paying dividends under certain conditions. Under Texas law, we cannot pay dividends to shareholders if the dividends exceed our surplus or if after giving effect to the dividends, we would be insolvent.
 Anti-tying restrictions. Bank holding companies and affiliates are prohibited from tying the provision of services, such as extensions of credit, to other services offered by a holding company or its affiliates.
 Bank Regulation
 Federal and state laws and regulations that govern banks have the effect of, among other things, regulating the scope of business, investments, cash reserves, the purpose and nature of loans, the maximum interest rate chargeable on loans, the amount of dividends declared, and required capitalization ratios. 
 National Banking Associations. Banks organized as national banking associations under the National Bank Act are subject to regulation and examination by the Comptroller. The supervision and regulation by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (the “OCC” or “Comptroller”) of banks is primarily intended to protect the interests of depositors. The National Bank Act: 

· | requires each national banking association to maintain reserves against deposits, 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | restricts the nature and amount of loans that may be made and the interest that may be charged, and
· | restricts investments and other activities. 

Deposit Insurance. The FDIC insures the deposits of federally insured banks, such as the Bank, and thrifts, up to prescribed statutory limits for each depositor through the Deposit Insurance Fund (DIF) and safeguards the safety and soundness of the banking and thrift industries. The Dodd-Frank Act set the standard maximum deposit insurance amount to $250,000. The amount of FDIC assessments paid by each insured depository institution is based on its relative risk of default as measured by regulatory capital ratios and other supervisory factors. In accordance with the Dodd-Frank Act, the FDIC insurance premium is based on an institution’s total assets minus its Tier 1 capital.
 In October 2010, the FDIC adopted a new DIF restoration plan to ensure that the fund reserve ratio reaches 1.35% by September 30, 2020, as required by the Dodd-Frank Act. In August 2016, the FDIC announced that the DIF reserve ratio had surpassed 1.15% as of June 30, 2016. As a result, beginning in the third quarter of 2016, the range of initial assessment ranges for all institutions were adjusted downward. After the effect of potential base-rate adjustments, the total base assessment rate was reduced for insured institutions of less than $10 billion in total assets to a range of 1.5 to 30 basis points on an annualized basis. This adjustment resulted in a slightly lower cost for the Bank in 2016.
 At least semi-annually, the FDIC will update its loss and income projections for the DIF and, if needed, will increase or decrease assessment rates, following notice-and-comment rulemaking, if required. If there are additional bank or financial institution failures or if the FDIC otherwise determines to increase assessment rates, the Bank may be required to pay higher FDIC insurance premiums. 
 Under the FDIA, the FDIC may terminate deposit insurance upon a finding that the institution has engaged in unsafe and unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations, or has violated any applicable law, regulation, rule, order or condition imposed by the FDIC. 
 Payment of Dividends. The Company is a legal entity separate and distinct from the Bank. The Company receives most of its revenue from dividends paid to the Company by the Bank. Described below are some of the laws and regulations that apply when the Bank pays or paid dividends. 
 
10
 

National banks are required by federal law to obtain the prior approval of the OCC to declare and pay dividends if the total of all dividends declared in any calendar year would exceed the total of (1) such bank’s net profits (as defined and interpreted by regulation) for that year plus (2) its retained net profits (as defined and interpreted by regulation) for the preceding two calendar years, less any required transfers to surplus. In addition, these banks may only pay dividends to the extent that retained net profits (including the portion transferred to surplus) exceed bad debts (as defined by regulation). 
 To pay dividends, the Bank must maintain adequate capital above regulatory guidelines. In addition, if the applicable regulatory authority believes that a bank under its jurisdiction is engaged in, or is about to engage in, an unsafe or unsound practice (which, depending on the financial condition of the bank, could include the payment of dividends), the regulatory authorities may require, after notice and hearing, that such bank cease and desist from the unsafe practice. The FDIC and the OCC have each indicated paying dividends that deplete a bank’s capital base to an inadequate level would be an unsafe and unsound banking practice. The Federal Reserve, the Comptroller and the FDIC have issued policy statements that recommend that bank holding companies and insured banks should generally only pay dividends to the extent net income is sufficient to cover both cash dividends and a rate of earnings retention consistent with capital needs, asset quality and overall financial condition. No undercapitalized institution may pay a dividend. 
 Capital Requirements
 The federal banking agencies have adopted risk-based capital guidelines for bank holding companies and banks that are expected to provide a measure of capital that reflects the degree of risk associated with a banking organization’s operations for both transactions reported on the balance sheet as assets, such as loans, and those recorded as off-balance sheet items, such as commitments, letters of credit and recourse arrangements. The risk based guidelines apply on a consolidated basis to bank holding companies with consolidated assets of $1.0 billion or more. Under these capital guidelines, banking organizations are required to maintain certain minimum capital ratios, which are obtained by dividing its qualifying capital by its total risk-adjusted assets and off-balance sheet items. In general, the dollar amounts of assets and certain off-balance sheet items are “risk-adjusted” and assigned to various risk categories. In addition to such risk adjusted capital requirements, banking organizations are also required to maintain an additional minimum “leverage” capital ratio, which is calculated on the basis of average total assets without any adjustment for risk being made to the value of the assets. Qualifying capital is classified depending on the type of capital as follows:

· | “Tier 1 capital” consists of common equity, retained earnings, qualifying non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock, a limited amount of qualifying cumulative perpetual preferred stock and minority interests in the equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries, less goodwill and certain other intangible assets. In determining bank holding company compliance with holding company level capital requirements, qualifying Tier 1 capital may count trust preferred securities, subject to certain criteria and quantitative limits for inclusion of restricted core capital elements in Tier 1 capital provided that the bank holding company has total assets of less than $15.0 billion and such trust preferred securities were issued before May 19, 2010;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | “Tier 2 capital” includes, among other things, hybrid capital instruments, perpetual debt, mandatory convertible debt securities, qualifying term subordinated debt, preferred stock that does not qualify as Tier 1 capital, and a limited amount of allowance for loan and lease losses; and 
· | “Tier 3 capital” consists of qualifying unsecured subordinated debt. 


Pursuant to federal regulations, banks and bank holding companies, with more than $1 billion in consolidated assets, must maintain capital levels commensurate with the level of risk to which they are exposed, including the volume and severity of problem loans. The federal banking agencies may change existing capital guidelines or adopt new capital guidelines in the future and have required many banks and bank holding companies subject to enforcement actions to maintain capital ratios in excess of the minimum ratios otherwise required to be deemed well capitalized, in which case the affected institution may no longer be deemed well capitalized and may be subject to restrictions on various activities, including a bank’s ability to accept or renew brokered deposits.
 On July 2, 2013, the Federal Reserve, and on July 9, 2013, the FDIC and OCC, adopted a final rule that implements the Basel III changes to the international regulatory capital framework, referred to as the “Basel III Rules.” The Basel III Rules apply to both depository institutions and (subject to certain exceptions not applicable to the Company) their holding companies. Although parts of the Basel III Rules apply only to large, complex financial institutions, substantial portions of the Basel III Rules apply to the Company and our subsidiary bank. The Basel III Rules include requirements contemplated by the Dodd-Frank Act as well as certain standards initially adopted by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision in December 2010.
 The Basel III Rules include higher risk-based and leverage capital ratio requirements and redefine what constitutes “capital” for purposes of calculating those ratios. Among the most important changes are stricter eligibility criteria for regulatory capital instruments that would disallow the inclusion of instruments, such as trust preferred securities (other than grandfathered trust preferred securities such as those issued by the Company), in Tier 1 capital going forward and new constraints on the inclusion of minority interests, mortgage-servicing assets, deferred tax assets and certain investments in the capital of unconsolidated financial institutions. The Basel III Rules also introduced a common equity Tier 1 (“CET1”) risk-based capital ratio. CET1 capital consists of retained earnings and common stock instruments, subject to certain adjustments. In addition, the rule requires that most regulatory capital deductions be made from CET1 capital. 
 The Basel III Rules also establish a “capital conservation buffer” of 2.5% above the new regulatory minimum risk-based capital requirements. The conservation buffer, when added to the capital requirements, results in the following minimum ratios: (i) a common equity Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 7.0%, (ii) a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 8.5%, and (iii) a total risk-based capital ratio of 10.5%. The implementation of the capital conservation buffer began on January 1, 2016 at 0.625% of risk-weighted assets and will increase by that amount each subsequent January 1 until fully implemented on January 1, 2019. An institution would be subject to limitations on certain activities including payment of dividends, share repurchases and discretionary bonuses to executive officers if its capital level is below the buffered ratio.

The Basel III minimum capital ratio requirements as applicable to the Company and the Bank after the full phase-in period are summarized in the table below.
 
 | BASEL III Minimum for Capital Adequacy Requirements | | | BASEL III Additional Capital Conservation Buffer | | BASEL III Ratio with Capital Conservation Buffer 
-----------------------------------------------------------------+--------------------------------------------------------+-----+---+---------------------------------------------------+-----+---------------------------------------------------
Total Risk Based Capital (total capital to risk weighted assets) | | 8.0 | % | | 2.5 | % | 10.5 | %
Tier 1 Risk Based Capital (tier 1 to risk weighted assets) | | 6.0 | % | | 2.5 | % | 8.5 | %
Tier 1 Leverage Ratio (tier 1 to average assets) | | 4.0 | % | | - | % | 4.0 | %
Common Equity Tier 1 Risk Based (CET1 to risk weighted assets) | | 4.5 | % | | 2.5 | % | 7.0 | %

 The Basel III Rules also revise the prompt corrective action framework, which is designed to place restrictions on insured depository institutions, including our subsidiary bank, if their capital levels do not meet certain thresholds. These revisions were effective January 1, 2015. The prompt correction action rules now include the CET1 capital component and increase certain other capital requirements for the various thresholds. As of January 1, 2015, insured depository institutions are required to meet the following capital levels in order to qualify as “well capitalized:” (i) a Total risk-based capital ratio of 10%(unchanged from current rules); (ii) a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 8% (increased from 6%); (iii) a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 5% (unchanged from current rules); and (iv) a CET1 risk-based capital ratio of 6.5%. Accordingly, a financial institution may be considered “well capitalized” under the prompt corrective action framework, but not satisfy the fully phased-in Basel III capital ratios. As of December 31, 2016, the Company’s regulatory capital ratios and those of the Bank are in excess of the levels established for “well capitalized” institutions under the Basel III Rules.
 The Federal Reserve may also set higher capital requirements for holding companies whose circumstances warrant it. For example, holding companies experiencing internal growth or making acquisitions are expected to maintain strong capital positions substantially above the minimum supervisory levels, without significant reliance on intangible assets. The bank regulatory agencies could impose higher capital requirements to meet “well-capitalized” standards and any future regulatory change could impose higher capital standards as a routine matter.
 The Basel III Rules set forth certain changes in the methods of calculating certain risk-weighted assets, which affects the calculation of risk-based ratios. Under the Basel III Rules, higher or more sensitive risk weights are assigned to various categories of assets, including, certain credit facilities that finance the acquisition, development or construction of real property, certain exposures or credits that are 90 days past due or on non-accrual, foreign exposures and certain corporate exposures. In addition, these Rules include greater recognition of collateral and guarantees and revised capital treatment for derivatives and repo-style transactions. 
 Prompt Corrective Action
 The federal banking agencies have issued regulations pursuant to the FDIA defining five categories in which an insured depository institution will be placed, based on the level of its capital ratios: well-capitalized, adequately-capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized, and critically undercapitalized. A bank that may otherwise meet the minimum requirements to be classified as well-capitalized, adequately capitalized, or undercapitalized may be treated instead as though it were in the next lower capital category if the appropriate federal banking agency, after notice and opportunity for hearing, determines that an unsafe or unsound condition, or an unsafe or unsound practice, warrants such treatment. Under the prompt corrective action regulations, a bank that is deemed to be undercapitalized or in a lesser capital category will be required to submit to its primary federal banking regulator a capital restoration plan and to comply with the plan. The Basel III Rules revise the prompt corrective action framework. See “Capital Requirements” above.
 
12
 

Any bank holding company that controls a subsidiary bank that has been required to submit a capital restoration plan will be required to provide assurances of compliance by the bank with the capital restoration plan, subject to limitations on the bank holding company’s aggregate liability in connection with providing such required assurances. Failure to restore capital under a capital restoration plan can result in the bank being placed into receivership if it becomes critically undercapitalized. A bank subject to prompt corrective action also may affect its parent holding company in other ways. These include possible restrictions or prohibitions on dividends or subordinated debt payments to the parent holding company by the bank, as well as limitations on other transactions between the bank and the parent holding company. In addition, the Federal Reserve may impose restrictions on the ability of the bank holding company itself to pay dividends, or require divestiture of holding company affiliates that pose a significant risk to the subsidiary bank, or require divestiture of the undercapitalized subsidiary bank. At each successive lower capital category, an insured bank may be subject to increased operating restrictions by its primary federal banking regulator.
 Interstate Banking and Branching 
 Effective June 1, 1997, the Riegle-Neal Interstate Banking and Branching Efficiency Act of 1994 amended the Federal Deposit Insurance Act and certain other statutes to permit state and national banks with different home states to merge across state lines, with approval of the appropriate federal banking agency, unless the home state of a participating bank had passed legislation prior to May 31, 1997 expressly prohibiting interstate mergers. Under the Riegle-Neal Act amendments, once a state or national bank has established branches in a state, that bank may establish and acquire additional branches at any location in the state at which any bank involved in the interstate merger transaction could have established or acquired branches under applicable federal or state law. If a state opts out of interstate branching within the specified time period, no bank in any other state may establish a branch in the state which has opted out, whether through an acquisition or de novo. 
 However, under the Dodd-Frank Act, the national branching requirements have been relaxed and national banks and state banks are able to establish branches in any state if that state would permit the establishment of the branch by a state bank chartered in that state. The Comptroller accepts applications for interstate merger and branching transactions, subject to certain limitations on ages of the banks to be acquired and the total amount of deposits within the state a bank or financial holding company may control. Since our primary service area is Texas, we do not expect that the ability to operate in other states will have any material impact on our growth strategy. We may, however, face increased competition from out-of-state banks that branch or make acquisitions in our primary markets in Texas.
 Community Reinvestment Act 
 The Community Reinvestment Act requires that, in connection with examinations of financial institutions within its jurisdiction, the FDIC and the Commissioner is to evaluate the record of each financial institution in meeting the credit needs of its local community, including low and moderate-income neighborhoods. These facts are also considered in evaluating mergers, acquisitions, and applications to open a branch or facility. Failure to adequately meet these criteria could impose additional requirements and limitations on us. Additionally, the Bank must publicly disclose the terms of various Community Reinvestment Act-related agreements. The Bank received a rating of “satisfactory” on its most recent Community Reinvestment Act examination.
 Restrictions on Transactions with Affiliates and Loans to Insiders
 The Bank is subject to the provisions of Section 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act(the “Affiliates Act”), as such provisions are made applicable to state non-member banks by Section 18(i) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act. Affiliates of a bank include, among other entities, the bank’s holding company and companies that are under common control with the bank. 
 These provisions place limits on the amount of:
  
· | loans or extensions of credit to affiliates; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | investment in affiliates; 
· | assets that may be purchase from affiliates, except for real and personal property exempted by the Federal Reserve; 
· | the amount of loans or extensions of credit to third parties collateralized by the securities or obligations of affiliates; and
· | the guarantee, acceptance or letter of credit issued on behalf of an affiliate. 


The total amount of the above transactions is limited in amount, as to any one affiliate, to 10% of the Bank’s capital and surplus and, as to all affiliates combined, to 20% of its capital and surplus. In addition to the limitation on the amount of these transactions, each of the above transactions must also meet specified collateral requirements. The Bank must also comply with other provisions designed to avoid the purchase or acquisition of low-quality assets from affiliates. The Dodd-Frank Act expanded the scope of Section 23A, which now includes investment funds managed by an institution as an affiliate, as well as other procedural and substantive hurdles.
 
13
 

The Bank is also subject to Section 23B of the Federal Reserve Act which, among other things, prohibits the Bank from engaging in any transaction with an affiliate unless the transaction is on terms substantially the same, or at least as favorable to the Bank or its subsidiaries, as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with nonaffiliated companies.
 Under federal law, the Bank is also subject to restrictions on extensions of credit to its executive officers, directors, principal shareholders and their related interests. These extensions of credit (1) must be made on substantially the same terms, including interest rates and collateral, as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with third parties, (2) must follow credit underwriting procedures at least as stringent as those applicable to comparable transactions with third parties, and (3) must not involve more than the normal risk of repayment or present other unfavorable features. The Dodd-Frank Act expanded coverage of transactions with insiders by including credit exposure arising from derivative transactions (which are also covered by the expansion of Section 23A). The Dodd-Frank Act prohibits an insured depository institution from purchasing or selling an asset to an executive officer, director, or principal shareholder (or any related interest of such a person) unless the transaction is on market terms, and, if the transaction exceeds 10% of the institution’s capital, it is approved in advance by a majority of the disinterested directors.
 Concentrated Commercial Real Estate Lending Regulations
 The federal banking agencies, including the Comptroller have promulgated guidance governing financial institutions with concentrations in commercial real estate lending. The guidance provides that a bank has a concentration in commercial real estate lending if (i) total reported loans for construction, land development, and other land represent 100% or more of total capital or (ii) total reported loans secured by multifamily and non-farm nonresidential properties (excluding loans secured by owner-occupied properties) and loans for construction, land development, and other land represent 300% or more of total capital and the bank’s commercial real estate loan portfolio has increased 50% or more during the prior 36 months. If a concentration is present, management must employ heightened risk management practices that address the following key elements: including board and management oversight and strategic planning, portfolio management, development of underwriting standards, risk assessment and monitoring through market analysis and stress testing, and maintenance of increased capital levels as needed to support the level of commercial real estate lending. On December 18, 2015, the federal banking agencies jointly issued a “Statement on Prudent Risk Management for Commercial Real Estate Lending”. As of December 31, 2016, the Company did not exceed the levels to be considered to have a concentration in commercial real estate lending and believes its credit administration to be consistent with the recently published policy statement. 
Consumer Financial Protection Bureau
 The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (“CFPB”) was created under the Dodd-Frank Act to centralize responsibility for consumer financial protection with broad rulemaking, supervision and enforcement authority for a wide range of consumer protection laws that would apply to all banks and thrifts, including the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, Truth-in Lending Act (“TILA”), Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act (“RESPA”), Fair Credit Reporting Act, Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, Truth in Savings Act, Fair Debt Collection Act, the Consumer Financial Privacy provisions of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act and certain other statutes. Banking institutions with total assets of $10.0 billion or less, such as the Bank, remain subject to the supervision and enforcement of their primary federal banking regulator with respect to the federal consumer financial protection laws and such additional regulations as may be adopted by the CFPB. 
Technology Risk Management and Consumer Privacy
 State and federal banking regulators have issued various policy statements emphasizing the importance of technology risk management and supervision in evaluating the safety and soundness of depository institutions with respect to banks that contract with outside vendors to provide data processing and core banking functions. The use of technology-related products, services, delivery channels and processes exposes a bank to various risks, particularly operational, privacy, security, strategic, reputation and compliance risk. Banks are generally expected to prudently manage technology-related risks as part of their comprehensive risk management policies by identifying, measuring, monitoring and controlling risks associated with the use of technology. 
 Under Section 501 of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, the federal banking agencies have established appropriate standards for financial institutions regarding the implementation of safeguards to ensure the security and confidentiality of customer records and information, protection against any anticipated threats or hazards to the security or integrity of such records and protection against unauthorized access to or use of such records or information in a way that could result in substantial harm or inconvenience to a customer. Among other matters, the rules require each bank to implement a comprehensive written information security program that includes administrative, technical and physical safeguards relating to customer information. 
 
14
 

Under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, a financial institution must also provide its customers with a notice of privacy policies and practices. Section 502 prohibits a financial institution from disclosing nonpublic personal information about a customer to nonaffiliated third parties unless the institution satisfies various notice and opt-out requirements and the customer has not elected to opt out of the disclosure. Under Section 504, the agencies are authorized to issue regulations as necessary to implement notice requirements and restrictions on a financial institution’s ability to disclose nonpublic personal information about customers to nonaffiliated third parties. Under the final rule the regulators adopted, all banks must develop initial and annual privacy notices which describe in general terms the bank’s information sharing practices. Banks that share nonpublic personal information about customers with nonaffiliated third parties must also provide customers with an opt-out notice and a reasonable period of time for the customer to opt out of any such disclosure (with certain exceptions). Limitations are placed on the extent to which a bank can disclose an account number or access code for credit card, deposit or transaction accounts to any nonaffiliated third party for use in marketing.
 Other Operations and Consumer Compliance Laws
 The Bank must comply with numerous federal anti-money laundering and consumer protection statutes and implement regulations, including but not limited to the Truth in Savings Act, Electronic Funds Transfer Act, Expedited Funds Availability Act, the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001, the Bank Secrecy Act, the Community Reinvestment Act, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Truth in Lending Act, the National Flood Insurance Act and various other federal and state privacy protection laws. On May 10, 2016, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network issued a final rule regarding customer due diligence requirements for covered financial institutions in connection with their Bank Secrecy Act and Anti-Money Laundering policies. The final rule adds a requirement to understand the nature and purpose of customer relationships and identify the “beneficial owner” of legal entity customers. The formal implementation date is May 11, 2018. Failure to comply in any material respect with any of these laws could subject the Bank to lawsuits and could also result in administrative penalties, including fines and reimbursements. The Company and the Bank are also subject to federal and state laws prohibiting unfair or fraudulent business practices, untrue or misleading advertising and unfair competition. These laws and regulations mandate certain disclosure requirements and regulate the manner in which financial institutions must deal with customers when taking deposits, making loans, collecting loans, and providing other services. Failure to comply in any material respect with any of these laws and regulations could subject the Bank to various penalties, including but not limited to enforcement actions, injunctions, fines or criminal penalties, punitive damages to consumers, and the loss of certain contractual rights.
 Regulation Z. On April 5, 2011, the Federal Reserve’s Final Rule on Loan Originator Compensation and Steering (Regulation Z) became final. Regulation Z is more commonly known as regulation that implements the Truth in Lending Act. Regulation Z address two components of mortgage lending, i.e., loans secured by a dwelling, and implements restrictions and guidelines for: (a) prohibited payments to loan originators and (b) prohibitions on steering. Under Regulation Z, a creditor is prohibited from paying, directly or indirectly, compensation to a mortgage broker or any other loan originator that is based on a mortgage transaction’s terms or conditions, except the amount of credit extended, which is deemed not to be a transaction term or condition. In addition, Regulation Z prohibits a loan originator from “steering” a consumer to a lender or a loan that offers less favorable terms in order to increase the loan originator’s compensation, unless the loan is in the consumer’s interest. Regulation Z also contains a record-retention provision requiring that, for each transaction subject to Regulation Z, the financial institution must maintain records of the compensation it provided to the loan originator for that transaction as well as the compensation agreement in effect on the date the interest rate was set for the transaction. These records must be maintained for two years.
 UDAP and UDAAP. Recently, banking regulatory agencies have increasingly used a general consumer protection statute to address “unethical” or otherwise “bad” business practices that may not necessarily fall directly under the purview of a specific banking or consumer finance law. The law of choice for enforcement against such business practices has been Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act—the primary federal law that prohibits unfair or deceptive acts or practices and unfair methods of competition in or affecting commerce (“UDAP” or “FTC Act”). “Unjustified consumer injury” is the principal focus of the FTC Act. Prior to the Dodd-Frank Act, there was little formal guidance to provide insight to the parameters for compliance with the UDAP law. However, the UDAP provisions have been expanded under the Dodd-Frank Act to apply to “unfair, deceptive or abusive acts or practices” (“UDAAP”), which has been delegated to the CFPB for supervision. The CFPB has published its first Supervision and Examination Manual that addresses compliance with and the examination of UDAAP.

Other regulation. The Bank’s operations are also subject to various federal and state laws such as:
  
· | the federal Truth-In-Lending Act, governing disclosures of credit terms to consumer borrowers; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act of 1975, requiring financial institutions to provide information to enable the public and public officials to determine whether a financial institution is fulfilling its obligation to help meet the housing needs of the community it serves; 
· | the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, prohibiting discrimination on the basis of race, creed or other prohibited factors in extending credit; 
· | the Fair Credit Reporting Act of 1978 and its amendment, the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act of 2003, governing the use and provision of information to credit reporting agencies; 
· | the Fair Debt Collection Act, governing the manner in which consumer debts may be collected by collection agencies; 
· | the rules and regulations of the various federal agencies charged with the responsibility of implementing these federal laws; 
· | the Right to Financial Privacy Act, which imposes a duty to maintain confidentiality of consumer financial records and prescribes procedures for complying with administrative subpoenas of financial records; and 
· | the Electronic Funds Transfer Act and Regulation E issued by the Federal Reserve to implement that act, which govern automatic deposits to and withdrawals from deposit accounts and customers’ rights and liabilities arising from the use of automated teller machines and other electronic banking services.

Regulatory Reform and Legislation
 From time to time, various legislative and regulatory initiatives are introduced in Congress and state legislatures, as well as by regulatory agencies. Such initiatives may include proposals to expand or contract the powers of bank holding companies and depository institutions or proposals to substantially change the financial institution regulatory system. Such legislation could change banking statutes and the operating environment of the Company in substantial and unpredictable ways. If enacted, such legislation could increase or decrease the cost of doing business, limit or expand permissible activities or affect the competitive balance among banks, savings associations, credit unions, and other financial institutions. The Company cannot predict whether any such legislation will be enacted, and, if enacted, the effect that it, or any implementing regulations, would have on the financial condition or results of operations of the Company. A change in statutes, regulations or regulatory policies applicable to the Company or our subsidiaries could have a material effect on the Company’s business, financial condition and results of operations.
 Effect of governmental monetary policies. 
 The commercial banking business is affected not only by general economic conditions but also by the fiscal and monetary policies of the Federal Reserve. Some of the instruments of fiscal and monetary policy available to the Federal Reserve include changes in the discount rate on member bank borrowings, the fluctuating availability of borrowings at the “discount window,” open market operations, the imposition of and changes in reserve requirements against member banks’ deposits and assets of foreign branches, the imposition of and changes in reserve requirements against certain borrowings by banks and their affiliates, and the placing of limits on interest rates that member banks may pay on time and savings deposits. Such policies influence to a significant extent the overall growth of bank loans, investments, and deposits and the interest rates charged on loans or paid on time and savings deposits. We cannot predict the nature of future fiscal and monetary policies and the effect of such policies on the future business and our earnings.
 All of the above laws and regulations add significantly to the cost of operating the Bank and thus have a negative impact on our profitability. It should also be noted that there has been a tremendous expansion experienced in recent years by certain financial service providers that are not subject to the same rules and regulations as the Company or the Bank. These institutions, because they are not so highly regulated, have a competitive advantage over us and may continue to draw large amounts of funds away from traditional banking institutions, with a continuing adverse effect on the banking industry in general.
