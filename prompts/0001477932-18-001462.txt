ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Organizational History
 
Amerinac Holding Corp. (“Amerinac” or the “Company”) was previously known as Precision Aerospace Components Inc. (“Precision”) and Jordan 1 Holdings Company (“Jordan 1”) and was incorporated in Delaware on December 28, 2005. Jordan 1 is the successor to Gasel Transportation Lines, Inc. (“Gasel”), a corporation that was organized under the laws of the State of Ohio on January 27, 1988.
 
Gasel was a trucking company that filed for bankruptcy in the Southern District of Ohio, Eastern Division, in May 2003. On December 12, 2005, a final plan of reorganization was approved by the court and the bankruptcy proceeding was dismissed.
 
Subsequent to December 30, 2005, Jordan 1 did not engage in any business activity until July 20, 2006 when it entered into an exchange agreement (the “Exchange Agreement”) pursuant to which the Company acquired all of the equity of Delaware Fastener Acquisition Corp., a Delaware corporation (“DFAC”), pursuant to an exchange agreement with the stockholders of DFAC. Contemporaneously, DFAC acquired the assets, subject to certain liabilities, of Freundlich Supply Company, Inc. (“Freundlich Supply”) pursuant to an asset purchase agreement (the “Asset Purchase Agreement”) dated May 24, 2006 among DFAC, Freundlich Supply, and Michael Freundlich. The purchase of the assets was financed by the proceeds from the sale by the Company of its securities pursuant to a securities purchase agreement (the “Securities Purchase Agreement”). As a result of the Exchange Agreement, DFAC became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. Upon completion of the foregoing transactions, the Company changed its name to Precision Aerospace Components, Inc. and DFAC changed its name to Freundlich Supply Company, Inc. (“Freundlich”). On March 13, 2009, Precision formed Tiger-Tight Corp., a Delaware corporation, as a wholly-owned subsidiary to serve as the exclusive North American master distributor of the Tiger-Tight locking washer.
 
On March 25, 2012, Precision formed two-wholly owned subsidiaries, Apace Acquisition I, Inc., a Delaware corporation, and Apace Acquisition II, Inc., a Delaware corporation. On May 25, 2012, the Company acquired the assets and certain of the liabilities of Fastener Distribution and Marketing Company, Inc., which was comprised of two fastener distribution companies, Aero-Missile Components, Inc., a Pennsylvania corporation and Creative Assembly Systems, Inc., an Ohio corporation. Apace Acquisition I, Inc. acquired all of the assets of Aero-Missile Components, Inc. and subsequently changed its name to Aero-Missile Components, Inc. Apace Acquisition II, Inc. acquired all of the assets of Creative Assembly Systems, Inc. and subsequently changed its name to Creative Assembly Systems, Inc.

On June 6, 2016, the shareholders of the Company approved a resolution to increase authorized shares of Common Stock from 100,000,000 shares to 800,000,000 so as to be able to issue the additional shares of Common Stock to PGH and C3. Also on June 6, 2016, the shareholders of the Company approved a resolution to deauthorize its Preferred A, B, and C stock. Effective June 30, 2016, the Company issued 174,028 and 85,096 shares of restricted common stock to PGH and C3, respectively, resulting in the collective ownership of 98.1%. On October 18, 2016, the Company completed a 1-for-2500 reverse stock split. No fractional shares were issued.

Overview of Business
 
The Company distributes high-quality, predominantly domestically-manufactured, technically complex, nut and bolt products and a proprietary locking washer product that are used primarily for industrial/commercial applications that require a high level of certified and assured quality. Additionally, the Company manufactures specialty stainless steel, and related products for steel mills, steel forging operations, and various metal fabrication facilities.
 
The Company’s operations are carried out through its wholly-owned distribution subsidiary Creative Assembly Systems, Inc (“Creative Assembly”) and its majority-owned subsidiary, Prime Metals Acquisition LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (“PMAL”). Until April 28, 2017, the Company’s operations were also carried out through its wholly-owned distribution subsidiary, Aero-Missile Components, Inc. (“Aero-Missile”). Creative Assembly is a value-added distributor of proprietary and specialty fasteners primarily serving the heavy truck, automotive, transportation, and infrastructure industries. Aero-Missile had stocking distributor relationships with a number of United States fastener manufacturers. Aero-Missile predominantly sold to all levels of the aviation industry original equipment manufacturers, maintenance and repair organizations, and other distributors, as well as to the United States Department of Defense (“Department of Defense”). 
 
PMAL manufactures specialty ingot and electrode products which are supplied for investment castings, forging, ring rolling, and plate production. PMAL also manufactures shot products and master alloys which are sold to other melt shops, and provides manufacturing support services. The flexible manufacturing operations at PMAL enable the Company to offer a wide range of product grades in customer specific order quantities. The primary grade types include stainless steels, tool steels, nickel-based grades, cobalt based grades and some nonferrous alloys. The Company also offers toll conversion melting services.
 
The Company’s products are manufactured, by others, to exacting specifications and are made from materials that provide the strength and reliability required for their industrial applications.
 
Industry Overview and Competition
 
The fastener distribution industry is highly fragmented. No one company holds a dominant position. This is primarily caused by the varied uses of fasteners and the size of the industry. Amerinac competes with the numerous fastener distributors which serve as authorized stocking distributors for one or more of the manufacturers in the Company’s supplier base. Amerinac believes that the depth of its inventory represents a competitive advantage. As a stocking distributor, the Company has employed a business model of maintaining levels of inventory on hand or on order with its suppliers that can satisfy its customers’ projected needs. The demanding quality, inspection, tracking and re-inspection requirements, part certifications and customer qualifications imposed on distributors of industrial fasteners by major consumers create a barrier to entry.
 
In addition to competing against other distributors, the company believes it faces competition from end users creating their own supply chain management.
 
The company believes its competitive attributes are as follows:
 
 
· | The Company’s quality system is certified to Rev. C, AS9120:2009 and ISO 9001:2008 quality measures. Since quality is an important measure of industrial suppliers, the Company strives to maintain its quality system to the highest standards in the industry. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | As an authorized stocking distributor for the premier domestic manufacturers, the Company is able to maintain relationships with customers not generally available to the industry. Many manufacturers in the past several years have consolidated their network of authorized distributors.

 
The steel foundry industry is a diverse industry. This is primarily caused by the varied sizes and shapes of metal produced, as well as, the numerous grades and quality of steel required for the end use applications. PMAL competes with the numerous mills in the United States and internationally. PMAL’s customers sell products into automotive, aerospace, medical device, as well as other industries. PMAL believes that its nimble and flexible production capabilities, and consistent high level of quality, provide competitive advantages. PMAL believes that the fixed costs needed for new entrants to the steel foundry market create very significant barriers to entry. 
 
Suppliers
 
The Company’s largest supplier, AVK, represented approximately 14.3% and 26% of product distributed for the years ending December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Amounts outstanding at December 31, 2017 and 2016 represent 17% and 34% of accounts payable, respectively. For nearly all suppliers, the Company looks to have secondary supply outlets. However, manufacturing issues with any supplier could cause temporary disruptions to the Company.
