OUR BUSINESS
 
Overview
 
We are a website creation and e-commerce enablement provider for the online presence needs of small to mid-size business retailers. Our Company is currently in the development stage. Our mission is to assist small to mid-size businesses to easily launch fully operational websites with e-commerce features without employing a team of Information Technology (“IT”) staffs or website designers. We strive to provide both the technology and support that our clients need.
 
We have developed a platform branded as “SpeedG,” which was launched in January of 2015. Our website can be viewed at http://www.speedg.com. We believe that the SpeedG Platform is a combination of easy to use products that provide solutions for our clients to establish and maintain their online presence as well as allows our clients to promote and market their businesses effectively. In addition to creating and publishing a website utilizing the SpeedG Platform, the SpeedG Platform also includes a dashboard feature (the “SpeedG Dashboard”) which our clients can utilize to manage their websites and e-commerce stores, as well as keep track of user data, such as daily views and recurring views. We have also designed a mobile application (“app”) builder for our clients to create their own mobile apps. We plan to launch a mobile app store where our clients will be able to place their apps for their customers to download. We believe we can assist our clients to establish their digital identities which enable their businesses to survive and thrive. In addition to website creation services, we also plan to provide marketing and promotional services to help the businesses of less tech-savvy retailers grow and enhance the visibility of their products.
 
We principally operate in Hong Kong. We plan to expand our business to Mainland China by the end of 2016 if sufficient capital is available to us from operations or through raising capital.
 
Our Products
 
We believe we have designed and developed a set of easy to use products in the SpeedG Platform that can enable our clients to launch an operational website, conduct online commerce activities, connect with their customers and manage their business operations. Currently, the SpeedG Platform is comprised of four utilities: (a) Website hosting; (b) SpeedG Creator; (c) SpeedG Timeline; and (d) SpeedChat.

Website Hosting
 
Our website hosting service provides our clients with access to rent or buy space on our server, which can house multiple websites. Our clients can choose to lease or buy the space from the server depending on their needs and available resources. We operate the website hosting feature in our data center in Hong Kong and we monitor, maintain, and secure the server for our clients so that they get the benefit of not actually running the server themselves.
 
In addition, we can also assist our clients to register their domain name through a third-party provider and offer Internet connectivity to the domain name they apply for.
 
SpeedG Creator
 
The SpeedG Creator allows our clients to build their own website and create their own mobile app regardless of their technical skill level or knowledge. The SpeedG Creator provides website templates for our clients to choose from to allow them to build their websites on a do it yourself basis. A client can choose from the templates and customize their websites by adding photos, text, and charts. In the SpeedG Creator, clients can also decide the specific features to be included by simply dragging and dropping the pre-designed modules to their website templates. The webpages created through the SpeedG Creator can be viewed on any screen size and on any device in standard screen resolution.
 
Through the mobile app builder feature on the SpeedG Creator, clients can also easily set up their own mobile apps. Similar to designing a website, the SpeedG Creator allows clients to upload images and edit text on their mobile apps and manage and operate their apps from both their mobile and desktop devices. The mobile apps created through the SpeedG Creator will be compatible with most Android and iOS operating systems.
 
We currently provide two templates for clients to choose from depending on their desired specifications. Clients can select either the personal or business template for their website and mobile app designs. We also provide e-commerce features for clients who wish to build an e-commerce store online. Our clients can upload their product information to their e-commerce store, and their customers will be able to purchase the products by simply clicking the “Buy” button. Selected products will be saved into their virtual shopping cart where customers will be able to complete their purchase by using a secured payment method. We are currently partnered with PayPal which allows our clients’ customers to complete their transactions through PayPal’s secured payment gateway. By adding the e-commerce features, we believe the SpeedG Creator will enable our clients to set up a fully operational e-commerce store.
 
We are also planning to develop more templates to cater to various needs of clients from different industry sectors. 
 
SpeedG Dashboard
 
The SpeedG Dashboard is a place where our clients can manage and operate their websites as well as keep track of important customer data. Clients can use the SpeedG Dashboard to edit their website content, as well as access customer statistics like the number of views their website gets, the location of website visitors, and the length of time a visitor spends viewing a particular product offered on the clients’ website. Clients can also use the SpeedG Dashboard to track their sales figures for all products they sell. With the assistance of the SpeedG Dashboard, our clients can tailor their marketing and business development strategies based on the customer data they can obtain.
 
SpeedG Timeline
 
The SpeedG Timeline is a communication tool that our clients and their customers can use to post messages and share information. Our retailer clients can use their SpeedG account to access the SpeedG Timeline, which is an official timeline with no restrictions on who can view and comment on it. In addition, individual users can also establish their own SpeedG Timeline by creating their SpeedG accounts. Individual users can send requests to add their contacts as “Friends.” Once the contacts become “Friends,” they are able to view their contacts’ timeline and comment on their friends’ posts. Both the retailer and individual users of the SpeedG Timeline can display events and activities they choose to share on the SpeedG Timeline in an organized chronological order. Users choose the information to share on their SpeedG Timeline, such as their photos, activities, interests, and contact information. In addition, there is a “Like” function on the SpeedG Timeline where individual users can “Like” the official account of the retailers, which can enhance product visibility for our clients.

SpeedChat
 
The SpeedChat is an instant messenger tool that supports both text and voice messaging. The SpeedChat has a group chat feature which allows group communication and sharing. Our clients can send messages to their customers who “Like” their SpeedG Timelines. With the assistance of the SpeedChat, our clients can interact with their customers in order to provide better customer service, answer customer inquiries, obtain feedback and provide trouble shooting services. The SpeedChat also allows our clients to send their customers the latest product information as well as upcoming discount offers.
 
The SpeedChat is available on our webpage and can also be used through the SpeedG App which can be downloaded on both iOS and Android smartphone devices.
 
SpeedG Packages
 
We offer a Basic Package and an E-commerce Package. The monthly subscription fees for the different packages can range from $12 to $60 depending on the different features to which our clients elect to subscribe.
 
The Basic Package includes the website hosting service, use of the SpeedG Creator for both personal or business templates, as well as access to the SpeedG Dashboard and the SpeedG Timeline. Under the Basic Package, retailers are able to build elegant websites irrespective of their technical skills.
 
For retailers who desire to have an e-commerce store, we offer the E-commerce Package, which includes not only all the utilities offered in Basic Package, but also the e-commerce features, including the purchase function, the virtual shopping cart, and the secured payment gateway.
 
Retailers currently enjoy a 30-day free trial of the Basic Package and the E-Commerce Package.
 
Plan of Operations
 
As a development-stage company, we continue to work to perfect the SpeedG Platform and are planning to develop a variety of products and services. In the upcoming months, we plan to develop and launch the followings:
E-mail Accounts
 
We plan to offer email accounts for our clients. We plan to design our e-mail accounts to be advertising-free and include security functionality designed to protect our clients from cyber-attacks and exposure to potential computer viruses.
 
Inventory tracking
 
We are developing our system to add a feature into the SpeedG Dashboard to keep track of inventory information for our e-commerce clients. This function will allow our clients to link their warehouse system to the SpeedG Platform in order to be able to track the flow of their products.
 
Mobile App Store
 
We plan to launch a Mobile App Store which will gather and display our clients’ mobile apps. Our client’s customers will be able to access to Mobile App Store to discover and download different types of apps from our clients.
Customer Service
 
We also plan to provide customer service to help our clients with product suggestions and technical questions. Our plan is to engage customer specialists to provide both online and phone customer support. Our customer service specialists will act as consultants to advise our clients of products that can best suit their needs and assist clients with any problems they encounter in using our products.
Consulting Services
 
In order to better serve our clients, we also plan to provide consulting and management services to clients who desire additional assistance, including consulting services to help our clients integrate third party platforms, for example, social media platforms. We expect to provide add-on services to integrate additional functions, such as accounting and billing functions, into our clients’ websites through the application programming interface (“API”) technology.

Our Value Proposition
 
Online commerce continues to grow and retailers are either seeking to, or are compelled by the market to move at least part of their businesses online. We believe our platform provides the tools for many types of retailers to build an online presence through e-commerce capable websites and allow them to better compete in the market. We believe our products will bring significant value to retailers in the following ways:
One Stop Solution
 
The SpeedG Platform is a one stop solution created to assist our clients with operating their business online. Through our platform, our clients are able to construct their own websites using the SpeedG Creator, market and promote their businesses through the SpeedG Timeline, and interact with their customers through the SpeedChat. With all of these features, we believe that the SpeedG Platform is an integrated product that provides intelligent, secure, and easy to use solutions to our clients.
Keeping Track of Business Data 
 
We not only provide a platform to create a client’s online store, but also assist clients in managing their sales through the SpeedG Dashboard. Every client will have their own dashboard that displays their sales and transaction figures in both a daily and yearly basis. The statistics can also be converted into a PDF file in order to keep the records for analysis purposes.
Accessible in All Platforms
 
The SpeedG Platform allows users to create an online store that can be accessed from desktop, mobile devices, and tablets. Moreover, SpeedG is compatible with HTML 5, Android, iOS, and Windows operating systems that are commonly used by retailers.
Our Growth Strategy
 
In order for us to compete in the market, we have tailored our strategies for our Company’s growth, including:
 
Expanding our sales team and forming strategic partnerships: To compete against our competitors in Hong Kong, we will seek to expand our sales team and initiate more marketing campaigns. We also plan to focus on developing partnerships that are able to extend our client base and enable us to enter into new markets. We are working on a partner network to allow channel partners to resell our packages. These potential partners would be business associations or any association that has access to retailers and could resell our packages. We plan to partner with software providers and local communities to promote our platform as well.
 
Developing more templates and modules for the platform: In order to be more competitive in this market, we plan to conduct research and develop more modules to enhance our platform. Additionally, we plan to engage independent developers to develop customized features using our API.
 
Our existing templates are only designed to accommodate a limited amount of industries, such as food and beverage industry and other traditional retail shops. We expect to expand out platform to be able to serve a variety of industries; therefore, we plan to design more templates within the coming months, which we believe will enable us to provide more choices for our clients and stay ahead of our competitors.
 
Marketing Strategy
 
We currently offer a 30-day free trial period for anyone who registers on our website. We believe this will attract potential clients and increase our website’s traffic. We also plan to utilize various online and offline channels to build our brand awareness. The channels we will use include traditional media advertising, online campaigns, and social media campaigns. We also plan to participate in conferences, trade shows and industry events to establish our brand.
 
Another strategy we plan to use is to host training seminars and online webinars for retailers to discuss emerging e-commerce industry developments and the online business environment. We plan to host these events based on information we gather and our clients’ needs.
 
Customers
 
Our targeted clients are those who want to create a digital identity so their customers can find, engage and transact with them online. Our targeted clients will be comprised of all kinds of small to mid-sized retail merchants in different industries. We also plan to target shopping and outlet mall retailers. Although the needs of our clients vary depending on their industries, we expect to provide all of our clients with a reliable and affordable product to fit their varied needs.

Market Opportunities
 
A 2014 report conducted by the Hong Kong Trade Development Council showed that in 2012, e-commerce sales accounted for 3.7% of total business receipts of those companies who offered e-commerce based sales. In 2013, 26.4% of Hong Kong companies had their own websites, increasing 7.1% from 2008. According to Boston Consulting Group, the Internet is expected to contribute about HK$146 billion (approximately $18.8 billion) to Hong Kong’s economy and about 7% of GDP by 2015. Therefore, the e-commerce market has a lot of room for growth as more and more people realize the importance of doing business online. However, many retailers are not expanding in this direction due to their lack of IT knowledge and lack of a sufficient budget to finance the development of their own website. We aim to target these retailers by offering them an affordable and easy way to build their website, and thus provide them with access to the online world.
Competition
 
The market for companies that provide website creation is highly competitive. Our competitors include i) Shopify; ii) Bigcommerce and iii) Bigcartel among others. However, we believe that our strengths could put us in an advantageous position against our competitors. Unlike our competitors, we do not simply provide retailers with an opportunity to create an online shop; instead we also offer our clients a combination of products which provide the clients with promotional tools through the SpeedG Timeline and an interactive communication method with their customers through the SpeedChat. Our SpeedChat stands out from other instant messenger services because it provides retailers with the ability to form a VIP group of their designated customers to send out discount information or pre-selected product offerings. In addition, within the VIP group, retailers can also establish another smaller group to allow certain customers to share relatively confidential information with each other.
 
Additionally, we believe we have an advantage in terms of our location and the market we are targeting. The Hong Kong e-commerce market is still developing and our competitors such as Shopify, Bigcartel or Bigcommerce have a relatively small market share in Hong Kong. Therefore, we believe there is an opportunity for us to expand and penetrate into the Hong Kong market. More importantly, our system supports Chinese, which makes it easier for merchants in Hong Kong to start their online business with us.
 
We are also well acquainted with the Hong Kong culture and are familiar with doing business in Hong Kong; therefore, we can better tailor solutions for our clients in the Hong Kong market than our competitors who don’t have the same experience. We integrate localized features and design templates customized to fit the Hong Kong market. We believe that assisting retailers based in Hong Kong to easily launch and set up their on-line stores gives us an edge over our competitors.
 
Security 
 
Our business faces potential security risks from hackers who wish to infiltrate the system. To mitigate these risks, we have employed various security strategies on the network topology, hardware and application system.
 
For network security, we have relied on Datacenter’s in-house security expert to assess our servers. Comprehensive firewall architecture and policies have been implemented to prevent unauthorized access to our servers.
 
In terms of application and system security, we implemented a network detection and prevention system to block malicious inbound traffic packages such as cross-site scripting exploits and phishing. Our system has been designed to apply proper authentication and authorization modules which will ensure that only authorized users will be able to perform their activities securely across multiple platforms.
 
For payment transactions, we are collaborating with Paypal in order to take advantage of its expertise in payment services. By partnering with Paypal, we are mitigating the risks involved in storing consumer payment details and the history of our e-commerce users.
 
For web security, we are using Secure Sockets Layer certificates from a well-known certificate authority. It offers high encryption strength of 2048-bit, SHA-2 Hashing Algorithm, 99.9% browser support and 24/7 customer support. Our users will be able to identify our certified website through the secure site seal and perform online transaction at our website safely.

Regulation
 
Hong Kong
 
The websites created through our platform are maintained through a server in Hong Kong. Therefore, our data usage policy and regular terms of service for retailers must comply with the applicable rules and regulations in Hong Kong. We will need to comply with the Hong Kong Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance (Cap 486). Non-compliance with such rules in Hong Kong may result in fines of up to HKD500,000 (approximately $64,511). Officers and directors of our Company may also be personally liable for the Company’s violation of Hong Kong Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance.
 
In the upcoming months, we intend to engage a third party company which specializes in compliance with the Hong Kong Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance to review our privacy policy and data protection system to ensure that the Company complies with applicable Hong Kong laws.
 
Mainland China
 
In Mainland China, the regulations that we need to comply with are the Computer Information System Safety Protection Regulation, Computer Information Global Internet Confidentiality Regulation and the Global Internet Information Protection Regulation. Prior to entering into the Mainland China market, we plan to engage local counsel and a third party management consulting firm to advise the Company regarding compliance with applicable regulations in Mainland China.
