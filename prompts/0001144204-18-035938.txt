ITEM 1 – BUSINESS
Company Overview
 
Bionik Laboratories Corp. is a robotics company focused on providing rehabilitation and mobility solutions to individuals with neurological and mobility challenges through the continuum of care from hospital to home. Our focus is “NeuroRecovery within Reach”, which is the use of the Company’s robots to assist patients to rewire a segment of their brains after injury, and is also known as neuroplasticity.
 
The Company has a portfolio of products focused on upper and lower extremity rehabilitation for stroke and other mobility-impaired individuals, including three products in the market and two products in varying stages of development. The InMotion Robots - the InMotion ARM, InMotion Wrist and the InMotion ARM/HAND– are designed to provide intelligent, adaptive therapy in a manner that has been clinically verified to maximize neurorecovery. The Company is also developing a home version of the InMotion technology, as well as a lower-body wearable assistive product based on the Company’s existing ARKE lower body exoskeleton technology, which could allow certain mobility impaired individuals to walk better, which the Company intends to launch in the consumer market.
 
The InMotion ARM, InMotion ARM/HAND, and InMotion Wrist have been characterized as Class II medical devices by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and are listed with the FDA to market and sell in the United States. The products have also been sold in over 20 other countries. In addition to these in-market products, we are also developing the InMotion Home, which is an upper extremity product that allows the patient to extend their therapy for as long as needed while rehabilitating at home. This is being developed on the same design platform as the InMotion clinical products. All of the above products are designed to provide intelligent, patient-adaptive therapy in a manner that has been clinically verified to maximize neuro-recovery.
 
More than two hundred fifty of our clinical robotic products for stroke have been sold in over 20 countries, including the United States. We have a growing body of clinical data for our products. In addition, our Massachusetts-based manufacturing facility is compliant with ISO- 13485 and FDA regulations.
 
In addition, we have the exclusive right to market and sell the Morning Walk lower body rehabilitation technology owned by Curexo Inc., a South Korean company, within the United States. The Morning Walk is a gait assistance product for rehabilitation. We plan to develop other biomechatronic solutions, including consumer-level medical assistive and rehabilitative products, through internal research and development and we may in the future further augment our product portfolio through technology acquisition opportunities, as and if we have the capital to do so.
 
We have partnered with industry leaders in manufacturing and design and have also expanded our development team through partnerships with researchers and academia. Most recently, on May 23, 2017, we entered into a Co-operative Joint Venture Contract with Ginger Capital Investment Holding Ltd. to establish a cooperative joint venture enterprise in the People’s Republic of China and on June 22, 2017 we entered into a joint development and manufacturing agreement with Wistron Medical Tech Holding Company of Taiwan to jointly develop a lower body assistive robotic product based on the ARKE technology for the consumer home market.
 
We have also entered into an agreement with Cogmedix Inc. a wholly owned subsidiary of Coghlin Companies, a world class medical device development and manufacturing company located in Worchester, MA for the production of our new InMotion robots. The initial agreement is for turnkey, compliant manufacturing with the possibility of increased volume as the Company grows.
 
We currently hold an intellectual property portfolio that includes 5 U.S. and international pending patents, as well as other patents under development. We may file provisional patents from time to time, which may expire if we do not pursue full patents within 12 months of the filing date. The provisional patents may not be filed as full patents and new provisional patents may be filed as the technology evolves or changes. Additionally, we hold exclusive licenses to three additional patents. Patented technology used in the InMotion Wrist is licensed to us from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The Company also holds the option to license certain robotic technology from the University of Texas at Dallas.
 
We have a history of net losses. We had $987,431 of revenue for the year ended March 31, 2018 (March 31, 2017 – $571,945).

Products in Market
 
InMotion Robots
 
Our suite of robotic rehabilitation products are the result of medical engineering research and development at the Newman Laboratory for Biomechanics and Human Rehabilitation at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).
 
We believe that our robotic products have exceptional capacity for measurement and immediate interactive response, which sets them apart from other therapy systems:
 

· | Senses the patient’s movement and responds to a patient’s continually-changing ability;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Robots guide the exercise treatment accordingly:
--+-------------------------------------------------


· | If the patient is unable to move, the robot assists the patient to initiate movement towards the target;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | If coordination is a problem, the robot “guides” the movement, allowing the patient to move towards the target and confirming that the patient is practicing the movement the correct way; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | As the patient gains movement control, the robot provides less assistance and continually challenges the patient; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Provides quantifiable feedback on progress and performance.
--+------------------------------------------------------------

 
InMotion Robots have been tested by leading medical centers in dozens of controlled clinical trials, including large randomized controlled clinical studies. Through research, we have determined that the best way to optimize robot therapy is by allowing the robots to focus on reducing impairments and allowing the therapist to assist on translating the gains into function.
 
We believe that our modular systems approach to neurorehabilitation is the only system designed to optimize the use of robotics in a manner that is consistent with the latest clinical research and neuroscience, taking into account the latest understanding on motor learning interference and motor memory consolidation.
 
More than two hundred fifty InMotion Robots have been sold for research and rehabilitation in over 20 countries, including the United States. Extensive research has shown the InMotion products to be effective, especially for stroke and cerebral palsy. Based on clinical trials using the InMotion ARM, the American Heart Association (AHA) Stroke council and the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs recommended, in 2010, the use of robot-assisted therapy to improve upper extremity motor coordination in individuals with some voluntary finger extension in outpatient and chronic care settings. In the trial conducted by the Department of Veterans Affairs, results demonstrated efficacy and a reduction in healthcare expenses when using the InMotion ARM when compared to non-robotic therapy.
 
The InMotion product was exclusively selected for the Robot Assisted Training for the Upper Limb after Stroke (RATULS) study that is funded by the NIHR Health Technology Assessment (HTA) Program conducted throughout the United Kingdom (the UK National Health System) that employs our InMotion upper extremity robotic systems. The study includes the enrollment of 720 stroke patients in a multi-center, randomized controlled research trial to evaluate the clinical and cost effectiveness of robot-assisted training in post-stroke care, that is expected to be completed before the end of 2018 with results to be published in 2019.
 
InMotion ARM
 
The InMotion ARM is an evidence-based intelligent interactive rehabilitation technology that senses patient movements and limitations, providing assistance as needed in real time. It allows clinicians to effectively deliver optimum intensive sensor motor therapy to the shoulder and elbow to achieve the development of new neural pathways and helps patients regain motor function following a neurological condition or injury. We recently launched a new version of the InMotion ARM, which has a 40% smaller footprint than the previous generation and has wireless report printing, among other improvements.

InMotion ARM/HAND
 
The InMotion ARM/HAND is an add-on module to be used with the InMotion ARM. The two work together to provide as needed support for reaching with grasp and release movements, or independently for focused training on individual hand movements. It allows clinicians to efficiently deliver optimum intensive sensor motor therapy to the hand to achieve the development of new neural pathways and helps patients regain motor function following a neurological condition or injury. The product is characterized as a Class II medical device by the U.S. and is listed with the FDA as 510(k) exempt, allowing the product to be marketed in the United States.
 
InMotion WRIST
 
The InMotion WRIST is an evidence based interactive rehabilitation device that senses patient movements and limitations, and provides assistance as needed. It can accommodate the range of motion of a normal wrist in everyday tasks and can be used by clinicians as a stand-alone treatment option or in addition to the InMotion ARM. The InMotion WRIST enables clinicians to efficiently deliver optimum intensive sensor motor wrist and forearm therapy to patients with neurological conditions. The product is characterized as a Class II medical device by the U.S. and is listed with the FDA as 510(k) exempt, allowing the product to be marketed in the United States.
 
Morning Walk
 
Since March 2018, we are the exclusive distributor of the Morning Walk gait rehabilitation product in the United States. The technology is owned by Curexo, Inc., a South Korean company and the exclusive distributor of our InMotion robotic systems in South Korea.
Product Pipeline
 
InMotion HOME
 
The InMotion Home is an upper extremity product that would allow patients to extend their therapy for as long as needed while rehabilitating at home, and is being developed on the same design platform as the InMotion clinical products described above. The InMotion Home is currently in development and we expect to release it commercially in 2019.
Lower Body Robotic Products
 
The ARKE is a robotic lower body exoskeleton that was under development and designed for wheelchair bound individuals suffering from spinal cord injuries, stroke and other mobility disabilities. As a result of a combination of our concentrating on the commercialization of the InMotion robots, our lack of additional funds, and changes in the marketplace, we determined to suspend the further development of the ARKE as a rehabilitation device, and instead, building on our existing ARKE exoskeleton technology, we are developing with Wistron Medical Tech Holding Company of Taiwan a lower body robotic assistive device as well as other technology targeting the consumer market, that could allow mobility impaired individuals to walk better. We intend to launch our first version of this product in 2020.
Other Prospective Products
 
We have exclusively licensed the rights to manufacture and sell products and methodologies covered by a patent for a lower limb robotic rehabilitation apparatus and method for rehabilitating gait, owned in part by Dr. Hermano Igo Krebs, one of our former directors and executive officers; however this product has not yet been developed.
 
We may from time to time expand our product offerings and enhance the strength of our Company through internal development, as well as through strategic and accretive partnerships or acquisitions from time to time.
 
Competition and Competitive Advantage
 
The medical technology equipment industry is characterized by strong competition and rapid technological change. There are a number of companies developing technologies that are competitive to our existing and proposed products, many of them, when compared to our Company, having significantly longer operational history and greater financial and other resources.
 
The primary competitor for the InMotion product line of upper-body rehabilitation robots as well as the Morning Walk is Hocoma, a Swiss-based company. Other competitors include AlterG, Aretech and Reha Technology We believe that the InMotion product line’s primary advantage over Hocoma is the evidence based, research proven data that supports each of our products. Evidence based, research proven data is used to support reimbursement from health systems, insurance companies and governments.
 
The prime competitors for our lower body robotics assistive device in development are Honda and Cyberdyne. We expect it, once developed, to compete as a personal choice physical enhancement consumer product.
 
Our challenge will be achieving rapid market awareness and adoption of our emerging technology in rehabilitation and mobility centers throughout the U.S., Canada and any other market we may enter. Our existing InMotion products and technologies are expected to significantly help with our clinical trials and our ability to launch our lower-extremity development products into the market, as we intend to leverage clinical data on our rehabilitative products and international distributorships and relationships with rehabilitation centers around the world.
 
Robotic technology and its use in clinical settings is a new and emerging industry and is regulated by medical device regulatory agencies (such as the US Food and Drug Administration). We believe that we will face challenges of increased regulatory scrutiny, possible changes in regulator’s requirements, meeting quality control standards of various government regulators, increased competition in the future based on other new technologies, additional features and customizability, reduced pricing, clinical outcomes and other factors. Our strength in this market will depend on our ability to achieve market acceptance, develop new technologies, develop new products, implement production plans, develop marketing strategies, secure regulatory approvals, secure necessary data for reimbursement, protect our intellectual property and have sufficient funding to meet all these challenges.

The market for the Company’s other prospective products also has competition and is subject to rapid technological change and regulatory requirements. There can be no assurance that the Company will be in a strong position to respond quickly to potential acquisitions and other market opportunities, new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements. Failure to maintain and enhance our competitive position could materially affect the business and our prospects.
 
Market Strategy
 
The Company’s current products are designed to be rehabilitation products and mobility solutions for patients in hospitals and clinics. We currently have three robotic products that listed with the FDA, which are the products sold through our own sales team in the United States, as well as through third party distributors around the world. Our business plan in part relies on broad adoption of upper and lower body robotic rehabilitation products to provide neuro-rehabilitation to individuals who have suffered a neurological injury or disorder.
 
The sales of our clinical and proposed products could depend, in part, on the extent to which healthcare providers and facilities or individual users are reimbursed by government authorities, private insurers and other third-party payers for the costs of our products or the services performed with our products. The coverage policies and reimbursement levels of third-party payers, which can vary among public and private sources and by country, may affect which products are purchased by customers and the prices they are willing to pay for those products in a particular jurisdiction. Reimbursement rates can also affect the acceptance rate of new technologies. Legislative or administrative reforms to reimbursement systems in the United States or abroad, or changes in reimbursement rates by private payers, could significantly reduce reimbursement for procedures using the Company’s products or result in denial of reimbursement for those products, which would adversely affect customer demand or the price customers may be willing to pay for such products. The change expected in October 2018 under certain US government plans to reimburse SNF’s (Skilled Nursing Facilities) to be followed by ORF’s (Inpatient Rehabilitation Facilities) based on outcome data, is expected to be beneficial to the Company in its sales efforts.
 
We expect that InMotion Home, our planned home version of our InMotion product line, will be released to the market in 2019. Our market strategy will be the development of hospital and clinic relationships that will allow us to gain acceptance of the technology among experts and patients. We are also seeking a number of government grants in collaboration with various hospitals and clinics to allow us to partially fund trials and research projects. We expect to gain traction among the doctors and experts involved in the distribution and buying groups that are established within those selected partner hospitals. We expect to also conduct clinical trials in other countries for the purpose of gaining traction in those markets.
 
We currently sell our products or can introduce customers to a third party finance company to lease at a monthly fee over term or other fee structure for our products to hospitals, clinics, distribution companies and/or buying groups that supply those rehabilitation facilities. We are also considering other revenue models.
 
Our market strategy also relies on identifying and entering into joint venture arrangements with third parties that can assist us with the development, commercialization and distribution of our technologies and products. For instance, we have entered into a relationship with Wistron Medical Tech Holding Company of Taiwan to develop a lower body robotic assistive product for the consumer home market based on our ARKE technology, and with Curexo Inc. of South Korea to distribute our InMotion robots to that market. Additionally, we established a cooperative joint venture enterprise with Ginger Capital Investment Holding Ltd. for the purpose of selling and distributing our InMotion products in the People’s Republic of China.
 
The distribution of the Morning Walk in the US market is expected to be through our existing sales force and infrastructure that is used to sell the InMotion robots, as we believe the Morning Walk is a complementary product to our existing offerings and the customers are generally within the same segments.
 
Intellectual Property
 
We use intellectual property developed, acquired or licensed, including patents, trade secrets and technical innovations to provide our future growth and to build our competitive position. We have 5 U.S. and international patents pending and other patents under development. As we continue to expand our intellectual property portfolio, it is critical for us to continue to invest in filing patent applications to protect our technology, inventions, and improvements. However, we can give no assurance that competitors will not infringe on our patent rights or otherwise create similar or non-infringing competing products that are technically patentable in their own right.
 
Our patents pending, all of which are expected to expire in 2033 or 2034, are as follows:
 

Algorithms & Control Systems | Filed US & International
-----------------------------+-------------------------
Sensory Technology | Filed US & International
Robotics | Filed US & International
Robotics | Filed US & International
Robotics | Filed US & International

 
We may file provisional patents from time to time, which may expire if we do not pursue full patents within 12 months of the filing date. The provisional patents may not be filed as full patents and new provisional patents may be filed as the technology evolves or changes.

To date, we have not determined whether we intend to commercialize the patent relating to the pelvis.
 
Dr. Krebs, a former director and former executive officer and a founder of IMT, is a co-licensor pursuant to an Agreement dated June 8, 2009, of patent #8,613,691, pursuant to which we are required to pay Dr. Krebs and Caitlyn Joyce Bosecker an aggregate royalty of 1% of sales based on such patent. As this product connected to the patent is not yet commercialized, no sales have been made.
 
We have to date and generally plan to continue to enter into non-disclosure, confidentially and intellectual property assignment agreements with all new employees as a condition of employment. In addition, we also generally enter into confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements with consultants, manufacturers’ representatives, distributors, suppliers, investors, financial partners and others to attempt to limit access to, use and disclosure of our proprietary information.
 
Research and Development
 
Our research and development programs are pursued by engineers and scientists employed by us in Toronto and Boston on a full- time basis or hired as per diem consultants. InMotion products are based on research and development originally done at MIT. Our InMotion Wrist product is based on a patent that we license from MIT.
 
We also work with advisors who are industry leaders in manufacturing and design and researchers and academia. Our leading robotic advisor is Dr. Neville Hogan of MIT. We are also working with subcontractors in developing specific components of our technologies. The primary objective of our research and development program is to advance the development of our existing and proposed products, to enhance the commercial value of such products.
 
In March 2017, we entered into an option agreement with The University of Texas at Dallas (“UT Dallas”) with respect to certain of UT Dallas’ novel robotics and control systems technologies. The agreement establishes a one-year period in which we can evaluate these technologies, and grants to us an exclusive option to negotiate an exclusive, worldwide license under certain patent rights owned by UT Dallas, as well as an option to negotiate a non-exclusive license under certain technology rights owned by UT Dallas. We are continuing to evaluate these technologies to determine whether they can be used to enhance our planned assistive product line expansion. The Company committed $1,000 per month through March 31, 2018, as well as payment of patent related expenses from time to time, to give us time to decide if we want to license the technology. We expect a decision as to whether to exercise the option will be made by the end of the second fiscal quarter of 2019.
 
For the fiscal years ended March 31, 2018 and March 31, 2017, the Company incurred $2,825,200 and $2,633,146, respectively, in research and development costs.
 
Government Regulations
 
General
 
Our medical technology products and operations are subject to regulation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) and various other federal and state agencies, as well as foreign governmental agencies in Canada, Europe, South America and Asia. These agencies enforce laws and regulations that govern the development, testing, manufacturing, labeling, advertising, marketing and distribution, and market surveillance of our medical device products.
 
In addition to the below, other regulations we encounter are the regulations that are common to all businesses, such as employment legislation, implied warranty laws, and environmental, health and safety standards, to the extent applicable. We will also encounter in the future industry-specific government regulations that would govern our products, if and when developed for commercial use. It may become the case that other regulatory approvals will be required for the design and manufacture of our products and proposed products.
 
We do not expect our planned lower body robotic assistive device to be subject to FDA or other regulations as a medical or rehabilitative device.

U.S. Regulation
 
Under the U.S. Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, medical devices are classified into one of three classes — Class I, Class II or Class III — depending on the degree of risk associated with each medical device and the extent of control needed to ensure safety and effectiveness. The InMotion products are classified as Class II products. Class II devices require a 510(k) premarket submission to the US FDA. Equivalent agencies in other countries also require similar submissions prior to the device being marketed. The InMotion clinical products have been characterized as Class II medical devices by the FDA. We are evaluating the classifications of our development products, which we expect to be categorized as Class I, as they will be marketed as consumer products. In addition, our manufacturing facility in Boston is compliant with ISO-13485 and FDA regulations.
 
We also are required to establish a suitable and effective quality management system, which establishes controlled processes for our product design, manufacturing, and distribution. We are doing this in compliance with the internationally recognized standard ISO 13485:2013 Quality Management Systems. Following the introduction of a product, the FDA and foreign agencies may engage in periodic reviews of our quality systems, as well as product performance and advertising and promotional materials. These regulatory controls, as well as any changes in FDA or other foreign agencies’ policies, can affect the time and cost associated with the development, introduction and continued availability of new products. Where possible, we anticipate these factors in our product development processes. These agencies possess the authority to take various administrative and legal actions against us, such as product recalls, product seizures and other civil and criminal sanctions.
 
Foreign Regulation
 
In addition to regulations in the United States, we will be subject to a variety of foreign regulations governing clinical trials and commercial sales and distribution of our products in foreign countries. InMotion products have also been designated as Class I devices with Health Canada. Whether or not we obtain FDA clearance for the marketing, sale and use of a product, we must obtain approval of a product by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries before we can commence clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries. The process varies from country to country, and the time may be longer or shorter than that required by the FDA. The requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary greatly from country to country.
 
The policies of the FDA and foreign regulatory authorities may change and additional government regulations may be enacted which could prevent or delay regulatory approval of our products and could also increase the cost of regulatory compliance. We cannot predict the likelihood, nature or extent of adverse governmental regulation that might arise from future legislative or administrative action, either in the United States or abroad.
 
Employees
 
As of June 25, 2018, we had 27 full-time employees, 3 part-time employees and 3 consultants who are based in our principal executive office located in Toronto, Canada, and our Watertown, Massachusetts facility. These employees oversee day-to-day operations of the Company supporting management, engineering, research and development, sales and marketing and administration functions of the Company. As required, we also engage consultants to provide services to the Company, including quality assurance and corporate services. We have no unionized employees.
 
Subject to available funds, we plan to hire up to 5 additional full-time employees within the next 12 months whose principal responsibilities will be the support of our research and development, clinical development, production, sales and marketing and commercialization/ business development activities.
 
We consider relations with our employees to be satisfactory.
