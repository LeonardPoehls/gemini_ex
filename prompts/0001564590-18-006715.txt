Overview 
 We are a global biopharmaceutical company dedicated to the discovery, development and commercialization of novel therapies for the treatment of cancer. Our mission is to improve the lives of cancer patients by creating more effective, safer and tolerable treatments. We have generated our clinical product candidates through our Orascovery and Src Kinase Inhibition research platforms, which are based on our understanding of human absorption biology and novel approaches to inhibiting kinase activity, respectively. We believe that our ability to overcome the challenges of oral delivery of chemotherapy and limitations associated with IV delivery, via our P-gp inhibitor, offers significant potential benefits to patient outcomes by allowing patients to stay on therapy longer and extending the potential opportunities to combine with other agents, including targeted therapies and immunotherapies that would otherwise be too toxic in combination with IV chemotherapy. We have assembled a leadership team and have established operations in the U.S. and China across the pharmaceutical value chain to execute our mission to become a global leader in bringing innovative cancer treatments to the market and improve health outcomes. 
 Common treatments for cancer include surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, and such newer methods as targeted therapy; however, chemotherapy remains one of the key treatment options for cancer patients and is traditionally administrated intravenously. A major part of cancer treatment consists of IV chemotherapy. The limitations of IV chemotherapy involve repeated painful IV line insertions, potential anaphylactic reactions, expensive hospital visits, toxic side effects and poor quality of life for cancer patients. To address this unmet medical need, development of oral chemotherapy that is more effective and more tolerable, can be taken easily orally at home, avoiding weekly IV infusions and hospital visits (e.g. paclitaxel) is urgently needed. Oral administration of many IV chemotherapy drugs has been unsuccessful because human intestinal cells have a P-gp pump that pumps out chemotherapy drugs (e.g. paclitaxel, doxetaxel, irinotecan etc.) before they can be absorbed. Many attempts at new drug development of P-gp inhibitors failed clinically because of lack of clinical efficacy or significant toxicities. 
 We believe that oral administration can overcome key limitations and challenges around IV administration of certain cytotoxic chemotherapies, and that our Orascovery platform will establish a new paradigm in the use of oral anti-cancer drugs for cancer treatments. Our Orascovery platform is based on the novel P-gp pump inhibitor molecule HM30181A, which we in-licensed in 2011 from Hanmi, a major Korean pharmaceutical company focusing on research and development. The P-gp pump is a plasma membrane protein on the cells of the gut which forms a localized drug transport system and prevents oral absorption at therapeutic levels of many well-known, widely used P-gp substrate cancer chemotherapeutic drugs such as paclitaxel, irinotecan and docetaxel, limiting their current delivery to IV. These chemotherapy agents are widely used to treat multiple types of cancer. A cancer patient’s inability to tolerate IV chemotherapies has limited the effectiveness of IV anti-cancer therapies. Co-administration of HM30181A with oral paclitaxel is designed to facilitate the oral absorption of paclitaxel by blocking P-gp in intestinal cells and enables oral dosing at therapeutic blood levels which have not been successfully and safely achieved to date without the use of HM30181A. We have learned through clinical studies that this technology allows for certain active chemotherapeutic agents to be absorbed into the blood orally as compared to IV, and may enable some patients to tolerate many cycles of treatment. Oraxol, our leading Orascovery drug candidate is composed of HM30181A co-administered with an oral dosage form of paclitaxel. We have three other major clinical product candidates in this platform, Oratecan, Oradoxel and Oratopo, which include HM30181A co-administered with an oral formulation of the widely used IV-administered chemotherapeutic agents, irinotecan, docetaxel and topotecan, respectively. In December 2017, we also announced that we have initiated the preparation of an IND for oral eribulin co-administered with HM30181A. 
 Oral administration can overcome key limitations and challenges around IV administration of certain cytotoxic chemotherapies, such as dosing, tolerability and efficacy, and we believe the Orascovery approach will establish a new paradigm in the use of oral anti-cancer drugs for cancer treatments in at least three ways. First, with the use of HM30181A, clinicians may be able to consistently deliver oral doses of certain chemotherapeutic drugs over a greater number of cycles and duration of time. Second, we believe active drug exposure of chemotherapeutic agents in the patient over time is a critical element in determining efficacy and we can achieve greater tolerability with administration of HM30181A in combination with chemotherapeutic drugs as compared to the current IV standards of care. Third, in light of better tolerability of standard chemotherapies delivered orally, combination with immuno-oncology and targeted anti-cancer treatments can be potentially optimized compared to current treatment paradigms. 
 We are rapidly advancing our lead Orascovery drug candidate, Oraxol. In 2015, we started enrolling patients in a Phase 3 Oraxol study which combined the dosing of our 15 milligram tablet of HM30181A paired with dosing of our oral formulation of paclitaxel in a head to head comparison to IV formulation of paclitaxel. In October 2016, we entered into a clinical study collaboration with Eli Lilly and Company to evaluate Oraxol in combination with Lilly’s approved monoclonal antibody Cyramza (ramucirumab) to treat gastric, gastric-esophageal and esophageal cancer. This combination study commenced in July 2017. In January 2018, we completed the first cohort of patients in our Oraxol and ramucirumab combination study, which showed encouraging early results. We are also planning a combination study of Oraxol with Anti-PD1 in advanced malignancies. In October 2017, the Drug Safety 
 2

Monitoring Board unanimously recommended continuation of our Oraxol Phase 3 study following review of an interim analysis. In January 2018, we received positive feedback from the FDA on the design of the ongoing Phase 3 trial, which indicated that if the study meets the primary endpoint with an acceptable benefit to risk profile, it could be adequate as a single comparative trial to support registration of Oraxol in the U.S. for the indication of metastatic breast cancer. In February 2018, the enrollment of patients was on target for the Company to be able to conduct a second interim analysis in the Oraxol KX-ORAX-001 Phase 3 clinical trial in the third quarter of 2018. When interim results are available, we plan to confirm with the FDA regarding its use as the pivotal trial. If accepted, we could be able to complete all other required studies by end of 2018. If not, other studies, which could require multiple years, may be required. In addition, in June 2017, our Chinese subsidiary submitted an IND application to the China FDA, or CFDA, for Oraxol, and in January 2018, the CFDA allowed the IND application for Oraxol. Acceptance of the Oraxol IND by the CFDA allows us to commence a clinical trial program for Oraxol in China in 2018. 
 We have also developed novel small molecule compounds through our Src Kinase Inhibition platform. The Src Kinase inhibition platform refers to novel small molecule compounds that have differentiated multiple-mechanisms of actions including: (1) the inhibition of the activity of Src Kinase and (2) the inhibition of tubulin polymerization. We believe the combination of the two mechanisms of action provides a broader range of anti-cancer activity compared to either mechanism of action alone. Our three key clinical product candidates in this platform are KX-01 ointments for actinic keratosis, or AK, pre-cancerous lesions and psoriasis; KX-01 oral for solid and liquid tumors and potential skin cancer indications and pre-cancerous lesions and KX-02 for glioblastoma multiforme, or GBM. AK has an estimated prevalence of over 58 million patients, and was found in approximately 14% of patients visiting dermatologists in the U.S., while GBM has an incidence of 2 to 3 per 100,000 adults per year and accounts for 52% of all primary brain tumors. 
 We completed enrollment of an approximately 160-patient Phase 2a study of KX-01 ointment for treatment of AK across 16 sites in 2016. We commenced patient enrollment in two Phase 3 studies in September 2017 and the enrollment was completed in February 2018. AK is a common disease, with a prevalence of approximately 58 million patients in the United States. If left untreated, 10-15% of AK lesions will develop into skin cancers. Our Phase 1 clinical study and preliminary data from our Phase 2 clinical study demonstrated a complete response rate of up to 43% among subjects who received treatment on their faces, with few severe local skin reactions, or LSRs, reported with the dosing regimen studied. Currently available treatments are limited by severe local skin reactions such as vesiculation, pustulation, erosion and ulceration, with low patient compliance. We believe physicians and patients have avoided topical treatments because of the pronounced side effects of the current treatments such as ingenol mebutate, imiquimod, fluorouracil, and that an ointment product with good clinical activity and a favorable side effect profile could capture substantial new market share for treatment of this condition. In addition, in May 2017, the CFDA approved clinical trials of KX-02 in tablet form for treatment of Glioblastoma, which are being led by our partner, Xiangxue Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd. 
 In addition to our existing portfolio of clinical candidates, our research and development teams are evaluating additional applications of Orascovery, and developing new platforms based on our knowledge of absorption biology. For example, we are exploring a CYP and P-gp dual inhibitor technology to generate new product candidates.

In advance of the launch of our proprietary product candidates in the U.S., our commercial team has begun to market oncology and oncology symptom-related products to fund our infrastructure build-out. We believe it is important to minimize supply chain disruptions for high potency oncology active pharmaceutical ingredients. We have thus internalized key components of the supply chain that we believe are integral to minimizing the associated risks. We have organized our business model into three segments: Oncology Innovation Platform, Commercial Platform and Global Supply Chain Platform—with operations in both the U.S. and China. Our global operations across the three segments are shown below: 
 
Our Global Supply Chain Platform manufactures API for use internally in our research and development and clinical studies, and for sale to pharmaceutical customers globally. Our Global Supply Chain Platform includes Polymed Therapeutics, Inc. and Chongqing Taihao Pharmaceutical Co Ltd, collectively Polymed. Our Commercial Platform currently markets nine APIs produced by our Global Supply Chain Platform in the specialty and generic market segment in the U.S., 12 products by APD, and 3 products subject to Section 503B of the FDCA through our outsourcing facility. Our Commercial Platform is expected to launch an additional 13 products in the first half of 2018, including 10 products by APD and 3 products by APS. 
 Based in Buffalo, New York, we were formed in 2003 and have been funded from inception from over $250 million in private financings, $132.3 million in public offerings and public-private partnerships with an estimated aggregate value of $375 million to be funded following the achievement of certain milestones. 
 Our leadership team has been carefully assembled to capture the global commercial market opportunities in novel drug development. Our executive officers are seasoned leaders with complementary skill sets across global pharmaceutical research and development, operations, supply chain and manufacturing, capital markets and mergers and acquisitions. We believe this characteristic is unique for a U.S.-based company and we believe we will be able to utilize this strength to create long term value for cancer patients, our employees and our shareholders. Our team is excited about the prospects of creating new paradigms in the treatment of cancer in developed markets and also driving our product candidates to emerging markets where patient access to treatments has historically been limited. 
 Strategy and Mission
 We have a comprehensive and experienced leadership team who have come together under one organization to achieve our mission. Our mission is to improve the lives of cancer patients by creating more effective, safer and tolerable treatments. To achieve our mission, we intend to execute the following strategies: 
 5

Rapidly and concurrently advance our clinical product candidates. 
 We intend to pursue the fastest feasible pathways to approval of our existing novel oral absorption technology. We are currently enrolling patients in a Phase 3 clinical trial of Oraxol, which is comprised of a combination of our novel investigational absorption-enhancing tablet, HM30181A, with the oral capsule formulation of paclitaxel. We recently received a PIM designation for Oraxol in the UK from the MHRA. We plan to submit an NDA to the regulatory authorities in both New Zealand and Taiwan in the next 12-18 months. We believe that if we demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of our oral absorption technology with Oraxol, the other drug candidates paired with this technology will face a more efficient development process. In addition, we presented to the American Academy of Dermatology meeting our Phase 2 clinical study data for KX-01 ointment and we completed patient enrollment for both Phase 3 clinical studies of KX-01 ointment for AK in February 2018. We anticipate the development timeframe for our KX-02 drug candidate for GBM to be accelerated by our partnered clinical program in China. Our licensing partner in China submitted a CTA for KX-02 to the CFDA in 2016. Based on the approval that has been granted by the CFDA, we expect Xiangxue to commence Phase 1 clinical trials for KX-02 for GBM in China in 2018. We anticipate fast enrollment in China based on its large patient population, which would accelerate the overall global development timeframe. 
 Leverage our global research and development operations to continue development of an oncology-focused product pipeline. 
 We have research and development operations in both the U.S. and China that are focused on both advancing our existing product pipeline and on developing additional novel clinical drug product candidates in order to replenish our development pipeline as other candidates mature. We have developed a core competency in oral absorption technology and apply that skill to develop new methods of drug discovery and to identify new pipeline candidates, such as our recently-announced oral eribulin IND program. In addition, we may leverage our research and development capabilities to partner with others for the development of new pipeline candidates. We believe that we can create substantial long term value by pursuing a robust, ongoing research and development program. 
 Build a proprietary commercial platform and selectively leverage collaborative relationships to achieve global drug sales, marketing and distribution. 
 We have begun building our U.S. commercial operation in preparation for future FDA approvals of our proprietary product candidates. We believe that our experienced product commercialization team can build an infrastructure that leverages both our global facilities and collaborative relationships to achieve global distribution of any products approved by the FDA and regulatory authorities in other jurisdictions, as applicable, in a timely and cost-effective manner. 
 Continue to build-out our supply chain and cGMP manufacturing capabilities. 
 We believe internalization of our supply chain is uniquely suited to execute in both the U.S. and China, two of the world’s largest pharmaceutical markets. We intend to utilize cGMP manufacturing facilities from our public/private partnerships in both the China and U.S. markets as a mechanism to access both important markets and minimize supply disruptions. We intend to manufacture certain of our proprietary drugs and our partnered drugs commercialized around the world. Additionally, we expect that the expansion of our existing cGMP high potency API facilities will provide us with more flexibility, and control over high potency APIs as our drugs start to become commercialized. Our goal is to continue expanding this infrastructure and to leverage it to maintain future financial flexibility by optimizing our financial commitments and capital expenditures, which we believe will create value for shareholders. 
 Selectively pursue strategic M&A or licensing opportunities to complement our existing operations. 
 We have historically pursued acquisitions and in-licensing opportunities, and will continue to target opportunities that will complement our existing portfolio and operations to create value for shareholders and support our business strategy and mission. 
 Operating Segments 
 We operate in three segments including our Oncology Innovation Platform, dedicated to the research and development of the Company’s proprietary drugs; our Commercial Platform, focused on the sales and marketing of the Company’s specialty drugs and the market development of our proprietary drugs; and our Global Supply Chain Platform, dedicated to providing a stable and efficient supply of active pharmaceutical ingredients for our clinical and commercial efforts.

Oncology Innovation Platform
 Our Orascovery Research Platform
 We are developing a series of orally administered chemotherapeutic agents using our proprietary P-gp pump inhibitor delivery system. The technology is designed to enable the oral administration of many cancer agents, which currently are only given by IV due to poor oral absorption. Oral administration of certain cytotoxic chemotherapies can potentially overcome several key challenges in IV administration of those molecules. We believe that our Orascovery platform overcomes these challenges by allowing more frequent dosing over longer periods of time, which we believe will lead to better tolerability and allow for higher total dosage and longer time exposure to the chemotherapeutic agent. Further, we believe additional agents like immuno-oncology and targeted therapy can be better optimized with longer administration of oral chemotherapy agents. 
 Chemotherapeutic agents such as paclitaxel, irinotecan, docetaxel and topotecan are clinically proven and widely used but have historically been limited to IV administration. The combined worldwide revenue of marketed formulations of these agents is estimated to be $1.9 billion in 2015 and is expected to grow at a CAGR of 9.6% to reach $3.6 billion by 2022. We believe our pipeline products, which leverage our proprietary delivery system that enables oral administration of these chemotherapeutic agents, will substantially expand the use of these chemotherapeutic agents. Additionally, we believe that there is a substantial opportunity for our products to be used in combination with targeted therapies. Furthermore, as shown by Abraxane, novel technology applied to a traditional chemotherapy agent may achieve pricing premiums if data demonstrates superior efficacy and tolerability as compared to current standards of care. We believe our pipeline products will be able to capture a large untapped market and achieve significantly larger market potential than the revenue generated by existing formulations, due to (1) increasing adoption of oral therapy due to patient preference, (2) the potential for improved response rates through greater exposure (based on our predictive model), (3) the potential for improved tolerability (based on our predictive model), and (4) the possibility to expand the market through combination therapies with immune-oncology therapy and oral targeted treatments, of which 39% are already oral. 
 The table below shows certain clinical trials for our major Orascovery drug candidates.

HM30181A—Our Novel P-gp Pump Inhibitor 
 
Overview 
 The novel P-gp inhibition by HM30181A forms the cornerstone of our Orascovery platform, and enables the administration of oral dosing formats of paclitaxel (Oraxol), irinotecan (Oratecan), docetaxel (Oradoxel), and topotecan (Oratopo) each of which is currently under clinical development. In December 2017, we also announced that we have initiated the preparation of an IND for oral eribulin co-administered with HM30181A. The feature that distinguishes HM30181A from other small molecule P-gp inhibitors is that this novel compound is specific to P-gp, does not interfere significantly with the activity of other related transporters, and does not significantly inhibit cytochrome 3A4, an enzyme that is important in the metabolism of commonly used drugs. HM30181A is minimally absorbed following oral administration. This localizes P-gp inhibitory activity in the gastrointestinal tract, limiting the potential for interaction at additional systemic sites where P-gp is expressed. Based on the results of our HM30181A clinical development programs to date, inhibition of gastrointestinal P-gp significantly improves the absorption of chemotherapy agents to achieve systemic exposure profiles which enhance the efficacy and may reduce toxicity of these established chemotherapeutic agents. Based on its pharmacological profile and low systemic absorption, HM30181A is not expected to cause drug-to-drug interactions other than enhancement of oral absorption of medications which are P-gp substrates. 
 Background—Chemotherapy Treatments 
 IV paclitaxel is used widely for the treatment of breast, ovarian, and lung cancer. Due to its poor solubility, paclitaxel is usually dissolved in ethanol and polyethoxylated castor oil, which is a major cause of IV hypersensitivity reactions. As a result, premedication with steroids and antihistamines is required to minimize these adverse reactions. Additional common toxicities associated with IV administration of paclitaxel include neuropathy, neutropenia, and alopecia. These side effects limit dose intensification and often require reduction in dosing. 
 As a single agent or in combination, IV paclitaxel is administered at a variety of doses and regimens that are approved for therapeutic use for various indications, including 135 and 175 mg/m2 administered as both 3- and 24- hour infusions once every 3 weeks. Over the past fifteen years, there has been great interest in dose dense therapy with paclitaxel, switching from the conventional every three-week regimen to administering the drug once weekly. Dose dense treatment with paclitaxel has various advantages that can lead to an increase in the overall exposure, as measured by AUC, over a treatment cycle, while balancing the adverse event profile normally observed, such as neutropenia. This concept is consistent with the hypothesis of maintaining sufficient drug concentrations above a threshold target value for an extended duration. 
 Based on various clinical trials conducted across multiple tumor types, the weekly regimen of paclitaxel can lead to an increase in response rate, progression free survival, and overall survival. For example, in a clinical trial investigating different dosing schedules of paclitaxel for the treatment of breast cancer in the adjuvant setting, dose-dense paclitaxel given as 80 mg/m2 weekly led to an improvement in disease-free and overall survival, with a 5-year survival rate of 81.5% versus 76.9%. In addition, weekly paclitaxel (80 mg/m2) has a benefit in response rate (42% vs. 29%), time to tumor progression (TTP) (9 vs. 5 months), and median overall survival (24 vs. 12 months) over conventional 175 mg/m2 every three weeks. 
 A recent analysis compiling data from 29 clinical trials of paclitaxel given as monotherapy investigated the relationship between paclitaxel dose and dosing regimen versus safety and efficacy. This average weekly dose from the every 3-week regimen (175—210 mg/m2) of paclitaxel produced a response rate of 30%, while the weekly regimen of 80 mg/m2 showed a response rate of 37%. In another analysis, a trend towards reduced grade 3 neuropathy with weekly paclitaxel was observed. Together, several clinical trials along with analyses, which evaluated efficacy and safety for dose-dense paclitaxel, suggested a trend of larger therapeutic window and a better safety-efficacy profile for weekly paclitaxel.

Irinotecan is a potent anticancer drug that is marketed under the trade name, Camptosar. Irinotecan is mainly administered to patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC), but also in glioblastoma, lung, ovarian, cervical, upper gastrointestinal cancer, and pancreatic cancer. The active metabolite of Irinotecan, SN-38, is a type 1 DNA topoisomerase inhibitor with potent antitumor activity and wide antitumor spectrum. We believe that oral administration of irinotecan will more efficiently generate SN-38, resulting in the potential for better clinical response with reduced toxicity. Oratecan is intended for oral administration for the treatment of irinotecan-responsive cancers. 
 Docetaxel is a potent anticancer drug within the class of antimicrotubule agents that is marketed under the trade name Taxotere. Docetaxel is mainly administered to patients with breast, lung, prostate, gastric, and head and neck cancers. Docetaxel has potent activity with a wide antitumor spectrum. As a single-agent therapy, docetaxel is administered by IV infusion over 1 hour at a dose of 60-100 mg/m2 for breast cancer and 75 mg/m2 for non-small cell lung cancer given once every 3 weeks. Docetaxel is also used in combination with doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide (adjuvant treatment of breast cancer), cisplatin (lung), topical fluorouracil (head and neck and gastric), and prednisone (prostate). Docetaxel causes dose-limiting toxicities that are more common at higher doses. One significant dose-limiting toxicity is fluid retention that we believe is associated (at least in part) with the IV formulation that contains polysorbate 80, a nonionic and emulsifier frequently used in food and cosmetics. Hypersensitivity reactions may also be attributable to IV administration of polysorbate 80. We believe that oral administration of docetaxel with HM30181A will provide therapeutic exposures of the drug, and result in the potential for better clinical response with reduced toxicity. 
 Topotecan is a potent anticancer drug under the class of camptothecins that is marketed under the trade name, Hycamtin. Topotecan is mainly administered to patients with lung, ovarian, and cervical cancer. Clinical activity has been shown in combination with the taxanes, docetaxel and paclitaxel, for the treatment of a variety of tumors, including lung cancer. Topotecan causes dose-limiting toxicities. These side effects mainly include neutropenia, late onset diarrhea and nausea and vomiting. 
 Mechanism of Action of HM30181A 
 
P-gp plays an important physiologic role as a transporter protein at multiple barrier sites, including the gastrointestinal tract and the blood brain barrier. The demonstrated role of P-gp in limiting intestinal absorption of multiple cancer chemotherapies highlighted the potential utility of a small molecule P-gp inhibitor for enabling oral administration of P-gp substrate drugs otherwise restricted to IV dosing. HM30181A was originally identified by Hanmi as a highly selective and potent P-gp inhibitor, capable of elevating the oral bioavailability of paclitaxel from less than 5% (in the absence of HM30181A) to 41% in rats. Unlike previously developed small molecule P-gp inhibitors, HM30181A is designed to not be systemically absorbed in the gastrointestinal tract following oral administration, with only small amounts detectable in the plasma even after relatively high doses. This unique property made HM30181A a good candidate for co-administration with P-gp substrate drugs, such as paclitaxel, which normally exhibit poor oral bioavailability and are therefore limited to IV routes of dosing.

Pre-clinical and Clinical Development of HM30181A 
 In vitro Activity 
 HM30181A was first discovered as a novel P-gp inhibitor in 2006. A subsequent published study demonstrated selective activity against P-gp, with low nanomolar inhibitory activity reported (IC50=0.6 nM in an in vitro assay of P-gp function, where the lower the number the higher the potency) and more potent than cyclosporin A, tariquidar and elacridar, which are previously tested P-gp inhibitors, as shown in the first figure below. In similar assays, HM30181A did not inhibit the transporter proteins MRP1, MRP2, or MRP3 at the concentrations evaluated and only marginally inhibited BCRP transporter activity (IC50 = 3,717 nM, as shown in the second figure below). 

Inhibition concentration against Pgp transporter 
 
 
Compound | IC50 (nM)

Cyclosporin A | 123.1 
Tariquidar | 44.4 
Elacridar | 4.9 
HM30181A | 0.6

------------+-----------+------
MRP1 | > 5,000 | 
MRP2 | > 5,000 | 
MRP3 | > 5,000 | 
BCRP | | 2,960

In vivo Activity 
 In preclinical studies, HM30181A demonstrated poor absorption from the gastrointestinal tract following oral administration in rats and dogs. The low systemic exposure to HM30181A may at least partially account for the good tolerability observed thus far in pre-clinical toxicology studies. In a single dose rat study, no mortality was noted and there were no test article-related clinical signs or body weight changes, and no gross necropsy findings 15 days after treatment with single oral doses of HM30181A as high as 2,000 mg/kg. Likewise, the highest dose evaluated (200 mg/kg) was well tolerated in repeat dose studies in both rats and dogs (once daily up to 13 weeks), with no dose-related mortality. 
 Multiple pre-clinical studies have evaluated the in vivo pharmacologic effect of HM30181A, generally in the context of a co-administered P-gp substrate, such as paclitaxel. In each case, co-administration of HM30181A significantly enhanced systemic exposure of the co-administered substrate. In murine models of human cancer, oral co-administration of HM30181A with oral paclitaxel or docetaxel conferred anti-tumor activity comparable to the IV dosing route.

Clinical Development 
 HM30181A belongs to a new class of P-gp inhibitor that has high potency, specificity and local action at the intestine cells. Oraxol consists of two drug products, a paclitaxel capsule and a HM30181A tablet. The 15 mg HM30181A tablet has an established room temperature shelf life of 36 months. The 30 mg paclitaxel liquid-filled, hard gelatin capsule has an established room temperature shelf life of 18 months. Oratecan consists of two drug products, an irinotecan tablet and a HM30181A tablet. The irinotecan 20 mg tablet has an established room temperature shelf life of at least 18 months. 
 Phase 1 clinical trials showed HM30181A has a good clinical safety profile and was not significantly absorbed systemically in humans. It has been given in amounts of up to 900 mg as a single dose, and up to 360 mg/day for 5 days, without major toxicities. The clinical dose we use currently in our Phase 3 clinical trial is 15 mg/day. 
 In three separate PK studies of HM30181A conducted in healthy subjects, a total of 81 individuals received single oral doses of HM30181A tablets in single doses of up to 900 mg and 30 individuals were enrolled in multiple dose cohorts, with treatment groups receiving HM30181A tablets ranging from 60 to 360 mg per day for 5 days. HM30181A was well-tolerated, with mostly mild GI side effects at high doses. At the current clinical dose of 15 mg given once daily for up to 5 days, the Cmax in systemic circulation is low. 
 Our Orascovery Product Candidates 
 Oraxol (HM30181A tablet + Oral Paclitaxel) 
 Overview of Clinical Findings 
 Oraxol has been administered to approximately 180 patients through September 30, 2017 across multiple clinical studies in advanced malignances and gastric cancer. There were four completed Phase 1 and 2 clinical studies. No MTD was reached. Overall, Oraxol has been well-tolerated by cancer patients. Studies have indicated that anti-cancer activity of paclitaxel may be related to blood exposure in the patient. Oraxol administration results in similar blood concentration of paclitaxel over time as achieved with IV paclitaxel. We believe oral dosing of paclitaxel can provide a longer drug exposure over a target drug concentration than intravenous paclitaxel, which may translate to better clinical response. We have observed anti-cancer activity in a Phase 1/2 study of patients in gastric cancer with Oraxol monotherapy, where the overall survival in the study for 43 subjects was 10.7 months, which compared favorably to historical data for ramucirumab, the only FDA approved drug for second line treatment of gastric cancer, which reported 5.2 months of overall survival in a randomized, placebo controlled Phase 3 clinical study. 
Completed Clinical Studies 
 HM-OXL-101 Phase 1 MTD Study 
 The Phase 1 MTD study was conducted by Hanmi in South Korea in 24 subjects with advanced solid cancer, with a “3+3” design in which cycles were 28 days and dosing with HM30181A tablets and an oral liquid formulation of paclitaxel was given on Days 1, 8, and 15 of each cycle for three cycles. Premedication was not required prior to treatment with Oraxol. Paclitaxel doses evaluated ranged from 60 to 420 mg/m2. HM30181A doses were half of paclitaxel doses (30 to 210 mg/m2). The MTD was not reached in this study and dose escalation was stopped after 420 mg/m2 because the drug exposure at doses above 300 mg/m2 reached a plateau. 
 HM-OXL-201 Phase 2 Gastric Cancer Study 
 The Phase 1/2 gastric cancer study was conducted by Hanmi in South Korea. HM-OXL-201 was an open-label Phase 2, single-arm clinical trial of Oraxol for second line treatment of advanced gastric cancer patients. This trial included dosing Oraxol at 150 mg/m2 per day, for 2 consecutive days per week, for 3 weeks out of a 4-week cycle. A total of 46 subjects enrolled in this study. Oraxol was well tolerated by gastric cancer patients. The results of the Phase 2 portion of this clinical trial showed treatment with Oraxol resulted in a median overall survival of 10.7 months. 
ORAX-01-13-US Phase 1 MTD Study 
 We conducted this Phase 1 MTD study in the U.S. and it is clinically complete. The objective of this study was to demonstrate the MTD of Oraxol. Study ORAX-01-13-US was a standard “3+3” Phase 1b study to determine the MTD of Oraxol in subjects with advanced malignancies. Oraxol dosing was 270 mg (approximately 150 mg/m2) per day starting at the 2 days of treatment per week for 3 weeks out of a 4 week cycle. Subjects in subsequent cohorts received 3, 4 or 5 days of treatment per week for 3 weeks out of a 4 week cycle. Premedication was not required prior to Oraxol treatment. A total of 34 subjects were enrolled in this study, including 10 subjects in an expansion cohort at the highest weekly dose tested (5 days per week of dosing). The MTD was not reached in this study, showing daily oral dosing of Oraxol was well tolerated.

ORAX-01-14-NZ Phase 1 Bioavailability Study 
 This Phase 1 bioavailability study was conducted by us in conjunction with ZenRX Limited, or ZenRx, in New Zealand and is clinically complete. The objective of this study was to determine the absolute bioavailability of Oraxol, and to compare the extent of absorption of Oraxol to that of IV paclitaxel. This study showed that Oraxol can achieve blood paclitaxel concentrations over time that are comparable in total exposure to IV paclitaxel. 
 The following figure shows the mean plasma concentrations of paclitaxel following intravenous administration of 80 mg/m2, as compared to oral administrations of 274 mg/m2 orally dosed daily for two days: 
 

In this study the aggregate Oraxol AUC was 7,052 ng*hr/mL for the 274 mg/m2 dosing regimen (N=2) versus IV Taxol AUC of 6,628 ng*hr/mL (N=2). Oraxol dose escalation above 274 mg/m2 did not further increase exposure (N=2). Based on this, we chose a dose regimen of 15 mg HM30181A + 205 mg/m2 of Oraxol daily over three consecutive days each week for future study, that we believe will produce similar exposure to paclitaxel as 80 mg/m2 IV Taxol given weekly. In addition, this 3 day dosing regimen is expected to provide a longer time above the target plasma concentration and could lead to better anti-cancer efficacy. 
 Overview of Safety Observations in the four completed Oraxol Studies 
 The MTD for Oraxol was not reached in these studies. Oraxol was well tolerated by cancer patients even when given without premedication for hypersensitivity type reactions, in contrast to the premedication requirement for IV paclitaxel. No hypersensitivity type reactions were observed. No new toxicity, apart from those typically observed with paclitaxel, was observed. Infusion related reactions, including hypersensitivity type reactions, have not been observed. Additionally, severe toxicities associated with IV administration of paclitaxel, including neuropathy, neutropenia and alopecia, are expected to be at a lower incidence and grade for Oraxol. 
 In our Oraxol clinical studies to date, the serious adverse effects observed that were deemed to be possibly, likely or definitely related to Oraxol include severe neutropenia, febrile neutropenia, sepsis, septic shock, altered state of consciousness, hypokalemia and cardiac arrest, dehydration, pneumonia, death, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, fatigue, anorexia, acute gastroenteritis.

Current and Planned Clinical Studies 
 Phase 1 Bioequivalence Study 
 The Phase 1 AUC bioequivalence study is being conducted by us in conjunction with ZenRx in New Zealand and is currently ongoing. The study of approximately 40 patients was designed to compare the area under the curve of Oraxol at the estimated clinical dose to that of IV paclitaxel. We are evaluating the bioavailability, safety and tolerability of the bioequivalence of Oraxol Phase 3 dosing regimen of 15 mg HM30181A + 205 mg/m2 of Oraxol daily over three consecutive days each week. The following chart shows interim PK results from the first 6 completed patients, indicating that this dosing regimen could achieve similar exposure to weekly AUC to 80 mg/m2 of IV paclitaxel: 
 

According to findings from this study, patients treated with Oraxol demonstrated exposure that was comparable to IV paclitaxel and no grade 3-4 toxicities. These interim results were presented at ESMO Asia 2017 in Singapore, an Annual Congress organized by the European Society for Medical Oncology. 
 Phase 1 MTD Study of Oraxol in Combination with Ramucirumab 
 We are conducting a Phase 1 MTD study of Oraxol in combination with ramucirumab in patients with advanced gastric cancer in the U.S. and Asia, through a clinical trial collaboration with Lilly. We commenced a study of up to 18 patients in a dose escalation study of Oraxol in combination with a fixed dose of ramucirumab to determine the MTD in July 2017. In a published Lilly-sponsored Phase 3 study comparing ramucirumab in combination with IV paclitaxel to IV paclitaxel alone, the single agent IV paclitaxel arm of the study showed a median overall survival of 7.4 months as compared to 9.6 months with IV paclitaxel in combination with ramucirumab. 
 The following list shows overall survival rates from the randomized, Phase 3 studies for Lilly’s FDA approved drug, ramucirumab, approved in combination with IV paclitaxel for second line treatment of advanced gastric cancer: 
 
 
Phase 3 clinical study of ramucirumab vs placebo (n=355) | 5.2 months ramucirumab 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------+---------------------------------------
 | 3.8 months placebo 
Phase 3 trial of ramucirumab plus IV paclitaxel vs IV paclitaxel (n=665) | 9.6 months ramucirumab + IV paclitaxel
 | 7.4 months IV paclitaxel 

 
13

We conducted a Phase 1/2 study of single agent Oraxol dosing in end-stage gastric cancer patients at 150 mg/m2 for two consecutive days each week, three weeks on, one week off, resulting in a median overall survival of 10.7 months. The objective of our Phase 1 study is to define the MTD of daily Oraxol dosing, starting at 200 mg/m2 for 3 days in a week, three weeks on, one week off, in combination with ramucirumab, which will be dosed every other week. We expect to obtain data from this Phase 1 study in 2018. In January 2018, we announced the completion of the first cohort of patients in this study. Of the six patients in the first cohort, the Oraxol and ramucirumab combination treatment was well tolerated. Grade 4 neutropenia occurred in one patient who fully recovered and there were no patient deaths or neuropathy. Two patients had partial responses (tumor shrinkage of 34-42%) and three patients had stable diseases (with tumor shrinkage of 27% in one patient). Only one patient had progressive disease. Although early, these results are regarded as encouraging compared with previous IV paclitaxel and ramucirumab combination therapy Phase 3 clinical trial results. We are currently advancing to the second cohort with Oraxol dose escalation. 
 Phase 3 Study for Treatment of Metastatic Breast Cancer 
 Our Phase 3 study of Oraxol for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer is an open-label, randomized, multicenter study in approximately 360 adult female subjects. The study contains a screening period, a treatment period of 18-21 weeks, and a treatment extension period up to a total of 48 weeks. The study is currently being conducted in 8 countries in Central and South America and will have up to 50 sites participating. Subjects will be randomized to either Oraxol or IV paclitaxel in a 2:1 ratio. The study is designed with two interim analyses which will be conducted after 90 and 180 evaluable subjects have been treated. Tumor assessments will be performed utilizing RECIST v1.1 guidelines by a blinded central radiologist group in the U.S. The blinded U.S. radiology group will measure tumor response rates with scans at week 10, 16 and week 19. An independent Drug Safety Monitoring Board conducted and reviewed a planned interim analysis of the study in October 2017 and unanimously recommended continuation of the study. In January 2018, we received positive feedback from the FDA on the design of the ongoing Phase 3 trial, which indicated that if the study meets the primary endpoint with an acceptable benefit to risk profile, it could be adequate as a single comparative trial to support registration of Oraxol in the U.S. for the indication of metastatic breast cancer. The next expected milestone is a second interim analysis at 180 patients in the third quarter of 2018. 
 Our Oraxol dosing regimen consists of 3 days consecutive dosing, each week, of: a 15 mg tablet HM30181A one hour before dosing an oral formulation of paclitaxel of 205 mg/m2. The comparator IV paclitaxel arm is the labeled dosing regimen of 175 mg/m2 paclitaxel IV one week out of three. 
 The chart below shows the simulated comparison of one cycle of the labeled dose of IV Taxol of 175 mg/m2 and Oraxol dosed daily at 205 mg/m2 for three consecutive days per week over a similar three week period. While the expected aggregate Oraxol AUC over the cycle is similar to IV Taxol at 15,240 as compared to 15,000, the expected time exposure of Oraxol in the patient’s blood at a therapeutic level is projected to be longer. For Oraxol, the time above 40 ng/mL is forecasted to equal 108 hours per three week cycle as compared to 54 hours for IV Taxol. We believe time exposure of the active pharmaceutical ingredient in the patient’s blood is an important consideration in determining efficacy. In addition, the lower Cmax with Oraxol is believed to be associated with better long term tolerability of Oraxol.

Simulated PK comparison of Oraxol 205 mg/m2 QDx3 per week for 3 weeks vs. IV Taxol 175 mg/m2 one week out of three weeks cycle: 
 


In summary, we believe Oraxol’s longer paclitaxel exposure over time and lower Cmax (based on our predictive model) as compared to the labeled dose of IV paclitaxel could translate into superior clinical response and improved tolerability. We expect to obtain data from our Phase 3 second interim analysis in the third quarter of 2018. 
 Other Planned Clinical Development 
 We recently received a Promising Innovative Medicine, or PIM, designation for Oraxol in the UK from the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency, or MHRA. This is the first of a two-step evaluation process which aims to give patients with life threatening or seriously debilitating conditions access to medicines that do not yet have a marketing authorization when there is a clear unmet medical need. Under the Early Access to Medicines Scheme, or EAMS, MHRA will, after assessing the data available in a scientific meeting, grant a PIM designation if it considers that the product is a promising candidate for EAMS. Following the PIM designation, the applicant is expected to complete as a second step a clinical development program and continue with an application for a scientific opinion if granted, from the MHRA. In its scientific opinion the MHRA will assess the risks and benefits of the medicine based on data gathered from the patients who will benefit from the medicine. We are now qualified to apply for the scientific opinion, which would allow us to provide patients early access to Oraxol, prior to receiving marketing authorization. This scheme is voluntary and the opinion from the MHRA does not replace the normal licensing procedures for medicines. The PIM designation was given to Oraxol for the treatment for the entire class of paclitaxel-responsive cancers instead of a narrow specific cancer indication. We believe this is an important milestone that may provide a streamlined path for the development of Oraxol not just for the UK, but also for the European market as part of our planned strategy for global outreach. 
 In addition, we are also planning a combination study of Oraxol with Anti-PD1 in advanced malignancies in patients with gastric, urothelial and non-small cell carcinoma. 
 Oratecan (HM30181A Tablet + Oral Irinotecan) 
 Completed Clinical Studies 
 Hanmi conducted three Oratecan Phase 1 studies, two as monotherapy (HM-OTE-101, HM-OTE-102), and one in combination with capecitabine (HM-OTE-103), in a total of 54 Korean patients with advanced solid tumors. The tumor types in these clinical trials were mostly gastric and colorectal cancers. MTD for Oratecan as monotherapy was defined as 100 mg/m2 per 3 week cycle, either given as once daily for 5 consecutive days for 1 week (20 mg/day), or 2 weeks (10 mg/day), of a 3 week cycle. Anti-cancer activity was observed in these studies. 
 15

HM-OTE-101 Phase 1 MTD Oratecan Study 
 Oratecan was administered to 20 patients with advanced solid tumors on Days 1 to 5 during a 21-day cycle. Irinotecan daily doses ranged from 5 to 30 mg/m2, and HM30181A doses were 60 mg. MTD was identified at 20 mg/m2 per day for 5 days of a 3 week cycle. Adverse events were typical of events seen with IV irinotecan. Common adverse events included nausea (90%), diarrhea (65%), and vomiting (55%). Four subjects had dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) events (diarrhea, neutropenia, nausea/vomiting, and AST elevation). At the MTD, the SN-38 Cmax on Days 1 and 5 were 9 and 12 ng/mL. Estimated SN-38 cycle exposure (AUC) was 373 ng*hr/mL. In this study Oratecan monotherapy in patients with advanced solid tumors resulted in a disease control rate of 44%. 
HM-OTE-102 Phase 1 MTD Oratecan Study 
 Oratecan was given once daily for 5 consecutive days each week for 2 weeks during a 21-day cycle to 13 subjects with advanced solid tumors. Irinotecan doses ranged from 5 to 20 mg/m2. MTD was identified at 10 mg/m2 per day. Adverse events were similar to those observed following IV irinotecan and included diarrhea, nausea, and anorexia. Five subjects had a dose limiting toxicity, or DLT, in Cycle 1. At the MTD, the resulting SN-38 Cmax on Days 1 and 12 were 5 and 4 ng/mL. Estimated cycle exposure (AUC) for SN-38 was 423 ng*hr/mL. 
 The following table shows the rate of control of the disease following administration of Oratecan once daily for five days for two out of every three weeks.

 HM-OTE-103 Phase 1 MTD Study of Oratecan in Combination with Capecitabine 
 This study was to determine the MTD of Oratecan in combination with capecitabine. Oratecan was administered to 21 subjects on Days 1 to 5 during a 21-day cycle. Irinotecan doses ranged from 10 to 20 mg/m2 per day, with HM30181A (15 mg) in combination with capecitabine at 800-1000 mg/m2 for 14 days. The MTD of Oratecan, in combination with capecitabine at the 1000 mg/m2 dose was identified at 15 mg/m2 per day. Adverse drug reactions in the study included diarrhea, nausea, anorexia, and vomiting. At the MTD of 15 mg/m2, the SN-38 Cmax on Days 1 and 5 were 6 and 4 ng/mL. Estimated SN-38 cycle exposure (AUC) was 217 ng-hr/mL. In this study of combination of Oratecan with capecitabine in patients with a variety of solid tumors (mostly GI cancers), 10 out of 18 (56%) patients had either stable disease or a partial response. 
 Overview of Safety Observations in completed Oratecan Studies 
 In our Oratecan clinical studies to date, the serious adverse effects observed that were deemed to be possibly, likely or definitely related to Oratecan include diarrhea, rash, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, anorexia, vomiting, nausea, enteritis, asthenia, neutropenia, increased alanine aminotransferase and increased aspartate aminotransferase. 
Current and Planned Clinical Development 
 ORTE-01-14-US Phase 1 MTD Study 
 The Phase 1 MTD study is being conducted by us and is currently ongoing. This study is to determine the MTD of Oratecan, when given once every 3 weeks, in subjects with advanced malignancies. In previous studies, Oratecan was given once daily for 5 days every 3 weeks and achieved total cycle SN-38 exposure, as measured by AUC, similar to IV administration of irinotecan. This once every 3-week dosing strategy is being evaluated in order to assess if we can further increase SN-38 exposure while avoiding toxicity. 
 16

Phase 1 Bioavailability Study 
 We are currently planning a Phase 1 bioavailability study of Oratecan to be conducted in conjunction with ZenRx in New Zealand. The objective is to determine the absolute bioavailability of Oratecan and to compare the extent of absorption of Oratecan to that of IV irinotecan based on levels of SN-38 This study will allow us to determine the exposure of SN-38 following Oratecan administration that will be equivalent to the SN-38 levels observed with the IV route of administration. 
Oradoxel (HM30181A Tablet + Oral Docetaxel) 
 Preclinical Activity and Evaluation 
 The potential effectiveness of HM30181A to inhibit the P-gp pump’s ability to transport docetaxel out of cells was first observed in vitro by an increase in the potency of docetaxel by 1,788-fold in a uterine sarcoma cell line. In rat oral PK studies, the plasma concentrations of docetaxel versus time, shown below, showed a significant increase upon co-administration of HM30181A with docetaxel. In this experiment, docetaxel was formulated in the currently proposed clinical formulation. Oradoxel was tested in preclinical human prostate cancer murine model as shown in the table below. Overall, Oradoxel was more active than docetaxel given orally without a P-gp inhibitor and was similar to the efficacy of IV docetaxel administration. At a dose of 25 mg/kg docetaxel with HM30181A a percent of tumor control of 4.8% was achieved which is comparable to the standard 10 mg/kg IV dosing regimen of docetaxel (2.9%). Without P-gp pump inhibition by HM30181A, oral administration of docetaxel demonstrated less inhibition of tumor growth, with a percent of control of 50.5%, consistent with reduced absorption of oral docetaxel when dosed without HM30181A.

a | Tumor Growth Inhibition is calculated by dividing the group average tumor volume for the treated group by the group average tumor volume for the control group (T/C).
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Current and Planned Clinical Studies 
 Based on the preclinical mouse efficacy data and rat and dog toxicology data, we expect that oral administration of docetaxel together with HM30181A will be efficacious and well tolerated in the clinic. We believe it may minimize the dose-limiting toxicities associated with docetaxel therapy, such as fluid retention, and allow increasing dosing to obtain superior efficacy. 
 The U.S. FDA authorized us to proceed with a Phase 1 clinical study under an IND in the first quarter of 2016 and we received regulatory allowance for a clinical trial in New Zealand. The ongoing U.S. study is a Phase 1 dose escalation trial for Oradoxel in patients with various solid tumors with a starting dose of 35 mg/m2 given once every 3 weeks. In New Zealand, a Phase 1 study is being conducted to identify the absolute bioavailability of Oradoxel in prostate cancer patients. We expect to obtain data from this Phase 1 clinical study during 2018.

Oratopo (HM30181A Tablet + Oral Topotecan) 
 Preclinical Activity and Evaluation 
 In rat oral PK studies, the plasma concentrations of topotecan versus time, shown below, demonstrates a significant increase upon co-administration with HM30181A. This effect is evident when topotecan is formulated in saline or the marketed product, Hycamtin. In preclinical murine models with human tumor transplants, including ovarian cancer, oral topotecan in combination with HM30181A was more active than oral topotecan alone following administration at a dose of topotecan 1 mg/kg once daily for five days per week, as illustrated in the lower chart below. 
Topotecan +/- HM30181A in Ovarian Cancer Murine Model 
 
Current and Planned Clinical Studies 
 IND enabling studies have been conducted. To date, dose-range finding studies along with Good Laboratory Practice, or GLP, compliant toxicology and toxicokinetic studies following single and multiple daily doses are being conducted with oral Topotecan in combination with HM30181A. These studies have been completed to establish the maximum tolerated dose for the 5-day regimen to support our proposed clinical dosing regimen. We recently completed cGMP manufacturing of oral irinotecan formulation. We filed an IND application for oral topotecan in combination with HM30181A in February 2017 and FDA authorized us to proceed with a Phase 1 clinical study in March 2017. We are currently planning a Phase 1 clinical trial in advanced malignancies for Oratopo. 
 18

Additional Orascovery Programs 
 In addition to existing chemotherapy agents, we are utilizing HM30181A to develop cancer treatments with better efficacy, tolerability and convenience for patients. We have recently initiated pre-clinical work to prepare an IND that we expect to be filed with the FDA in late 2018 for oral eribulin co-administered with HM30181A. Eribulin is an anticancer drug used to treat certain patients with breast cancer and advanced liposarcoma marketed by Eisai Company under the trade name Halaven. Eribulin is also known as E7389 and ER-086526, and also carries the US NCI designation NSC-707389. It is a fully synthetic macrocyclic ketone analogue of the marine natural product halichondrin B. Eribulin is a mechanistically unique inhibitor of microtubule dynamics, binding predominantly to a small number of high affinity sites at the plus ends of existing microtubules. Eribulin also has both cytotoxic and non-cytotoxic mechanisms of action. We have developed a novel and efficient synthetic route for the synthesis of eribulin API which we believe will support our development of this candidate.

 KX-01 
 Mechanism of Action 
 KX-01 is a novel small molecule, which we discovered and developed, which demonstrates at least two MOAs relevant to the potential control of cancer and hyper-proliferative disorders: Src tyrosine kinase inhibition (non-ATP competitive) and tubulin polymerization inhibition. Src plays a role in regulating multiple aspects of tumor development, growth, and metastases, and its inhibition limits such tumor activity. Interfering with tubulin polymerization activity is a clinically validated mechanism for treating cancer. For both targets KX-01 binds at a novel binding site. Taken together, these two MOAs may provide for a potent means of treating cancer and other hyper-proliferative disorders. 
 19

The first MOA defined for KX-01 is Src tyrosine kinase inhibition. We have observed the correlation of KX-01 inhibition of Src auto-phosphorylation (a measure of Src activity) and cell growth during the proliferation phase of tumor cells in both c-Src527F/NIH-3T3, a cell line derived from fibroblasts with enhanced Src activity, and HT29, a cell line derived from colon cancer cells. Through in vitro tests, KX-01 has been shown to induce caspase 3 cleavage and PARP cleavage, which are both markers for cell death/apoptosis, as well as p53 induction, which is a protein involved in tumor suppression. Unlike most known Src inhibitors, KX-01 is unique in that it is not an ATP competitive inhibitor of Src but rather it is believed to be a substrate competitive inhibitor, which means high specificity for the intended binding target. A computational model for how KX-01 is predicted to bind in the peptide substrate site of Src is depicted in the figure below, as noted in a NMR/paramagnetic probe study conducted and published by Wyeth LLC. 
 
The second MOA defined for KX-01 is inhibition of tubulin polymerization, a step essential for cell growth. We have observed the ability of KX-01 to inhibit tubulin polymerization in vivo within tumors in a mouse xenograft, and synergistic activity with paclitaxel to interrupt cell proliferation. 
 The two MOAs of KX-01 are believed to have the potential to control cell growth and proliferation of cancer cell types as well as cell types involved in hyper-proliferative diseases. Specifically, KX-01 has been observed in vitro to have potent activity in controlling cell growth in keratinocytes, or skin cells (with IC50 = 32 nM). This activity demonstrates the potential of these compounds to control hyper-proliferative diseases of the skin, examples being actinic keratosis and psoriasis. 
 The following table shows the potential broad spectrum activity of KX-01 against many cancer types. GI50 represents the concentration of KX-01 that may be used to inhibit 50% of tumor cell growth. The lower the numerical value of GI50 the higher the potency of KX-01.

Research Background 
 Topical formulation development studies carried out by our licensing partner, PharmaEssentia, in Taiwan resulted in a formulation believed to be suitable for clinical testing. KX-01 topical formulations are initially being tested by PharmaEssentia in psoriasis clinical trials in Taiwan. 
 20

In parallel, we are evaluating a topical KX-01 ointment in the clinic for AK in the U.S. The most common cause of AK is exposure to ultraviolet radiation from the sun or tanning beds. This exposure can lead to oncogenic changes, such as inactivation of p53, and consequential hyper-proliferation of mutated keratinocytes. If left untreated 10-15% of AKs can progress to skin cancer. KX-01 inhibits the proliferation of keratinocytes and up-regulates p53 so its utility in clinically treating AK is of interest. Clinical trials with a KX-01 topical ointment for treating AK have produced encouraging early results. KX-01 ointment 1% has a room temperature shelf life of at least 6 months. 
 KX-01 Ointment for Topical Indications 
 Completed Clinical Study 
 Phase 1 Study 
 The Phase 1 study of KX-01 ointment for treatment of AK was conducted by us in the U.S. and is clinically complete. This is a four cohort, PK and safety study of 3 days or 5 days, with treatment of 25 cm2 or 100 cm2 applied to the forearm. The results for the Phase 1 studies showed that with 1% KX-01 ointment being applied for 5 consecutive days in on a 25 cm2 area of the forearm; 50% (4 of 8 subjects) had complete response (100% clearance). This was achieved with very good local and systemic tolerability. We believe that the high clearance rate with low skin toxicity compares well to existing treatments on the market. 
 Clinical data thus far indicate that KX-01 ointment produces a complete response without severe adverse skin reactions in some patients, as shown in the images below:

 Current and Planned Clinical Development 
 Phase 2a Study 
 We completed enrollment in 2016 of an approximately 160-patient Phase 2a clinical study in the U.S. of KX-01 ointment for treatment of AK on the face and scalp. This is an open label, two sequential cohort study of approximately 80 patients each with treatment of KX-01 ointment 1% for either 5 days or 3 days. The primary objective is to evaluate the complete response rate, which is defined as 100% clearance of such patient’s AK at Day 57 after treatment. Additionally, we seek to further investigate the findings from the Phase 1 proof of concept study indicating that KX-01 ointment has a favorable side effect profile. We expect to present final data from these clinical trials in February 2018. 
 Initial data from patients in the study shows that the KX-01 dosing regimen used in this study is well tolerated, with few LSRs. There were two Grade 4 LSRs reported thus far, one for scaly skin and one for erythema, and there was no discontinuation prior to Day 57. The below table presents preliminary data on Grade 4 LSRs reported in this study, subsequent to which the two Grade 4 LSRs were reported.

Day 1 | Day 8 | Day 57

 The images above show the experience of a subject in our Phase 2 study who experienced a 100% response experienced no severe skin reaction. Since skin toxicity is likely to be a significant consideration of clinicians and patients, especially on the face and scalp, we believe that the market is likely to expand for topical treatments options for this pre-cancerous skin condition. To the extent that skin toxicity has been limiting the market, we believe that KX-01 ointment may significantly expand the market as a result of a low skin toxicity. 
 Phase 3 Studies
We commenced patient enrollment in two Phase 3 studies of KX-01 for treatment of AK on the face and scalp at approximately 60 total sites in the United States in September 2017. Each trial is designed to enroll approximately 300 subjects. We completed patient enrollment for both Phase 3 studies in February 2018, with over 600 subjects. The endpoints of these studies are identical to those in the Phase 2 program, although, unlike the Phase 2 study, the two identical Phase 3 clinical trials each include a vehicle-treated control group and a double-blinded study design in which subjects are randomly assigned to receive either the vehicle or the KX-01 ointment. The trials, designed to assess activity and tolerability, are expected to be complete in June 2018, subject to a follow-up period. A 12-month recurrence follow-up period is expected to be complete for the last subject in June 2019, and a final clinical study report for both trials, marking official completion of the Phase 3 study, is expected to be available in the fourth quarter of 2019.

KX-01 Oral 
 Completed Clinical Studies 
 KX-01 oral capsules are available in strengths of 20 mg and 80 mg and have a room temperature shelf life of 48 months. KX-01 oral has been evaluated in several early dose finding studies against both solid and liquid tumors. Initial clinical results indicate activity against both solid and liquid tumors in patients in clinical studies. We are planning further probe studies to focus our evaluation in certain of those indications where activity was observed. 
 Phase 1 and Phase 2a US Study—Complete 
 A Phase 1 clinical trial in solid tumor patients identified the MTD for continuous twice daily oral dosing at 40 mg/dose, with a favorable PK profile, and indications of activity. In this trial, 44 patients were enrolled in 9 dose cohorts. The drug was well tolerated and the dose limiting toxicities were mainly elevated levels of aspartate transaminase, or AST, and alanine transaminase, or ALT, which were readily reversible. 11 patients had stable disease for at least 4 months, including patients with ovarian, carcinoid, papillary thyroid, prostate, pancreas and head and neck cancer. An ovarian cancer patient had stable disease for 16 months and a KX-01 oral induced a large decrease in the ovarian cancer CA-125 biomarker, which correlates well with clinical response. As shown in the table below, this patient had failed nine prior drug, and drug combination therapies, showing a clear benefit from KX-01 oral treatment.

A subsequent Phase 2a clinical study in men with bone-metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer using the twice daily 40 mg/dose was conducted. 31 patients were dosed with KX-01 oral at 40 mg/dose twice daily until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The primary endpoint was 24-week progression-free survival (PFS). The designated clinical endpoints were not met with KX-01 oral at this dose. 
 A Phase 1b clinical study in elderly AML patients was conducted using once daily dosing. The doses tested were 40, 80, 120, 140 and 160 mg of KX-01. 24 patients were recruited with a median age of 76 years (range 63 to 86 years). Most had been previously treated for their disease, generally with decitabine or azacitidine. The MTD is estimated to be 105 mg of KX-01 oral daily. 
 Overview of Safety Observations in completed KX-01 Oral Studies 
 In our KX-01 Oral clinical studies to date, the serious adverse effects observed that were deemed to be possibly, likely or definitely related to KX-01 Oral include allergic reaction, bacteremia, rash, syncope, tremor, dermatitis, neutropenic fever, hyponatremia, hypersensitivity, failure to thrive, lower extremity edema, mucositis, neutropenia, pancytopenia, thrombocytopenia, seizure and motor vehicle accident, embolic stroke, pneumonitis, fever, acute kidney injury, increased bilirubin and albumin levels, decreased blood platelet count, abdominal pain, arm pain, pyrexia, rigors, tachypenea, oxygen desaturation, pneumonia, anemia, elevated ALT and AST, dehydration and leukopenia. 
Current and Planned Clinical Development 
 Our licensing collaborator, Hanmi Pharmaceuticals is completing a Phase 1b clinical trial in South Korea, combining escalating continuous once daily doses of KX-01 with a standard Taxol IV treatment of 80 mg/m2 once weekly for 3 out of 4 weeks. This study is clinically completed and awaiting a study report. 
 Phase 1 Probe Studies in Hong Kong and Taiwan—Planned 
 We are planning pilot studies in Asia in 2018 to evaluate KX-01 oral treatment in ovarian and liquid tumors for cancer indications where previous activities were observed.

KX-02 
 Research Background 
 KX-02 is a closely related structural analog of KX-01 and has been observed to have a similar dual MOA of inhibition of Src activity and microtubule polymerization. KX-02 was designed to readily cross the blood-brain-barrier, or BBB. In vitro studies in mice have found that the KX-02 levels in the mouse brain meet or exceed the levels in the plasma at the same time points after oral dosing, indicating that KX-02 readily crosses the BBB. We believe that this ability to cross the BBB provides a rationale for investigating brain cancers and metastases in the brain as potential therapeutic applications, which are traditionally considered to be an unmet medical need. 
 Preclinical evaluation and activity 
 In Vivo Activity 
 Based on pre-clinical testing which found activity of KX-02 against a number of brain cancer cell lines, and which found BBB penetration by KX-02, KX-02 was tested orally in a mouse GBM tumor model, wherein mouse GBM tumor cells were implanted into the brains of mice with fully-competent immune systems in order to simulate human patients. When compared with TMZ, the current standard of treatment, in one particular study, KX-02 produced long term survival mice, as compared to TMZ, which extended survival but did not result in any long term survivors. Across multiple experiments, an average of approximately 30% long term survival mice were produced when dosed with KX-02 at 30 mg/kg once daily, as shown in the figure below. 
 
To visualize tumor growth in situ, animals treated with KX-02 were compared to those that had been treated with placebo alone using MRI. The KX-02 treated mice that eventually survived long term did not have tumors whereas the placebo mice have large tumors at the time points evaluated. 
 The potential role of an adaptive immune response in the responses of the mice treated with KX-02 was observed in three ways. First, when the same mouse study was repeated with mice lacking an adaptive immune system no cures were obtained. Second, when mice that had been cured by KX-02 were re-challenged with mouse GBM cells they failed to support sustained tumor growth, whereas untreated mice readily showed pernicious tumor growth. Third, a larger infiltration of lymphocytes into brain tumor tissues was seen in mice treated with KX-02 as compared to those treated with a placebo, and these lymphocytes stained as CD3 and CD8 immune 
 24

cells. Accordingly, KX-02 also appears to facilitate the immune system’s recognition of brain tumor tissues as foreign cells, in addition to its Src and tubulin-targeted activities. In our KX-02 clinical studies to date, the only serious adverse effects observed were thromboembolic events, hyperuricemia and pulmonary embolism. 
 Current and Planned Clinical Studies 
 Phase 1 Study 
 We are currently enrolling a Phase 1 study in the U.S. of KX-02 for treatment of solid tumors in order to determine the MTD, PK, and safety profile. We expect to receive data from these trials in late 2018. 
 In 2012, we out-licensed KX-02 to Xiangxue Pharmaceuticals for development and marketing in greater China and clinical trials are currently being planned. In May 2017, the CFDA allowed an IND to commence clinical trials in China. Based on the approval that has been granted by the CFDA, we expect Xiangxue to commence Phase 1 clinical trials for KX-02 for GBM in China in 2018. We anticipate this partnered clinical program in China will accelerate the development timeline of this candidate. 
 Our Src Kinase Product Candidates
 KX-01 
 KX-01 is a compound developed under our Src Kinase Inhibition platform that, as a free base, has advantageous physical properties for topical ointment formulations. A topical ointment with KX-01 has shown promising results in a proof of concept clinical trial for actinic keratosis, or AK, a pre-cancerous skin lesion. We completed enrollment of an approximately 160-patient Phase 2a study of KX-01 for treatment of AK in 2016 and we commenced two Phase 3 studies in September 2017, which completed patient enrollment in February 2018. The trials are designed to assess activity and tolerability are expected to be complete in June 2018, subject to a follow-up period. A 12-month recurrence follow-up period is expected to be complete for the last subject in June 2019, and a final clinical study report for both trials, marking official completion of the Phase 3 study, is expected to be available in the fourth quarter of 2019. An additional indication for psoriasis is being evaluated in a Phase 1 clinical trial led by our out-licensing partner. Since AK can lead to skin cancers, we are now investigating the initiation of a study in that indication, along with a study in T-cell lymphomas. These applications provide additional potential therapeutic utilities for KX-01 ointment and could represent significant potential market expansions beyond AK. We are also developing KX-01 in an oral formulation, and we have observed activity against both solid and liquid tumors in patients in clinical studies, and we are planning further studies to focus our upcoming evaluation efforts in targeted indications. 
 In December 2017, we entered into a license agreement with Almirall, pursuant to which we granted to Almirall an exclusive, sublicensable license of certain of our intellectual property for the development and commercialization of topical products containing KX-01 for the treatment of AK in the United States and substantially all European countries. We believe this partnership validates the potential of this candidate and that this partnership is an important step in the development and commercialization of KX-01 develop and commercialize this product. For additional information, please see “Business—License and Collaboration Agreements—Almirall License Agreement.” We presented data from our Phase 2 clinical trials at the American Academy of Dermatology Meeting in February 2018 and expect to complete the treatment phase of our Phase 3 trials in the first half of 2018, with topline data to be available in the third quarter of 2018. 
 KX-02 
 KX-02 is the second compound we developed using our Src Kinase Inhibition platform. Although KX-02 is an analog of KX-01, it has significantly different physical properties. These properties are designated to allow KX-02 freely cross the blood-brain-barrier such that the concentration in the brain is equal to, or somewhat greater than, that in the plasma. This trait is uncommon for oncology drugs and highlights the potential for KX-02 as a novel therapy for unmet medical needs such as brain cancers, including GBM and brain metastases. The FDA has granted Orphan Drug Designation to KX-02 for the treatment of gliomas. KX-02 is a non-ATP competitive Src Kinase inhibitor and tubulin polymerization inhibitor. Studies of KX-02 in preclinical syngeneic mouse GBM models resulted in the complete eradication, without recurrence, of the tumors in an average of approximately 30% of treated mice. KX-02’s multiple mechanisms of action, or MOAs, along with its ability to cross the blood-brain-barrier, make it a novel molecule for the treatment of brain tumors. KX-02 is currently in the early stages of a U.S. Phase 1 clinical trial in solid tumor patients and we expect to receive data from this study by late 2018. A Chinese IND has been filed by our development partner in China to start a study in primary brain tumors with KX-02 which we believe will commence in 2018. 
 25

Intranasal Granisetron (GNS) 
 The development of supportive therapy is complementary to our oncology drug platform. Chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting, or CINV, is a common side effect of cytotoxic chemotherapy treatments. Granisetron is a 5-hydroxytryptamine 3, or 5-HT3, receptor antagonist, a class of anti-emetic drugs that are commonly used in the prevention of CINV. Our subsidiary, Comprehensive Drug Enterprises, has developed intranasal formulations of granisetron for further evaluation in the clinic. 
Current Therapies and Limitations 
 Currently, granisetron is dosed in IV, oral and patch forms to treat CINV. We believe these dosing regimens have disadvantages including time to effectiveness, and lack of ability to control the symptoms effectively at home. 
Current and Planned Clinical Studies 
 We believe intranasal delivery will possess a number of advantages for the patient. These advantages may include a rapid delivery of therapeutic drug levels for quick relief of CINV as well as the ability to self-dose outside of the hospital and IV settings while experiencing CINV (when oral administration would be difficult). The intranasal route of administration of GNS leads to more rapid achievement of systemic concentrations of the drug compared to the oral route. 
 A Phase 1 parallel-group study of GNS was conducted in Taiwan to assess the PK, safety, and tolerability of GNS. A total of 50 healthy subjects, 25 male and 25 female, were divided into the following treatment groups: 1 mg Kytril administered IV over 30 seconds to 10 patients, 1 mg Kytril tablets administered orally to 10 patients, and either 0.5, 1, or 2 mg of intranasal GNS administered to 10 patients. The results showed that the drug concentrations were dose proportional following intranasal delivery of GNS and the side effects were acceptable. 
 We are presently evaluating the market opportunity in various geographies for the development of an intranasal route of delivery in order to determine the clinical development program for this drug candidate. 
 Our Research and Development 
 We are an innovative oncology company with drug discovery, drug formulation, clinical development, and API/drug product manufacturing facilities in both the U.S. and China. The U.S. drug discovery, clinical development, and formulation research facilities are largely concentrated in Buffalo, New York and Cranford, New Jersey. The range of capabilities at these facilities includes medicinal chemistry, biochemistry, cell biology, formulation, chemical manufacturing and control, quality control, pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics (PK/PD), data management, as well as pharmacovigilance, clinical development and regulatory expertise functions. Animal efficacy, PK/PD, and toxicology studies are carried out at various contract research organizations, or CROs, around the world in order to facilitate the drug research and development process. 
 In China, our research and development center in Hong Kong is integrated with our research and development center in Buffalo. This center concentrates on drug formulation development and evaluation. When we acquired Comprehensive Drug Enterprises, or CDE, in 2015, we added scale to our formulation and research personnel in Hong Kong. The clinical oral formulation of docetaxel is an example of a discovery emanating from our Hong Kong research and development center. Higher strength paclitaxel powder tablet formulations, to be introduced into our future clinical evaluations of the Oraxol drug product, are a second example of the formulation development work being successfully carried out at the Hong Kong research and development center. 
 Our proprietary Dual (CYP/P-gp) Inhibitor Program 
 We are developing a proprietary class of “dual” absorption enhancers that are intended to inhibit both the P-gp transporter and the CYP enzymes within the gastrointestinal tract. There are many barriers that limit the oral absorption of drugs in humans. The P-gp transporter is a major barrier to absorption of active chemotherapy drugs. However, certain other drugs with P-gp liabilities may also have liabilities for other barriers such as metabolizing enzymes, such as the cytochrome P450, or CYP, class of enzymes. This intestinal CYP mediated metabolisim can be a contributing factor in limiting oral absorption of certain drugs. This class of dual absorption enhancers has shown potential to significantly improve the oral bioavailability of certain other drugs in laboratory tests, and may expand the application of our oral absorption platform to drugs where the CYP barrier to oral absorption is also important. These dual absorption enhancers may lead to better performing next-generation oral medicines in our pipeline of clinical products. 
 26

The development of these dual absorption enhancers is at the preclinical stage. Proof of concept, providing increased oral bioavailability in preclinical species, has been obtained with several absorption enhancers and candidate drugs. Currently additional filters such as patentability/freedom to operate, physical-chemical characterization, pre-formulation studies, manufacturing analysis and preliminary toxicity testing are being applied to our first group of lead candidates for clinical development. In 2018, we expect to identify our lead molecule for a future IND enabling study. 
 Commercial Platform 
 We believe the value creation potential is higher for biopharmaceutical companies able to commercialize their proprietary products as compared to companies who have a partner to commercialize. The infrastructure investment and build-out of a commercial team prior to regulatory approval is typically costly and requires years of investment. In 2016, we launched a commercial platform in the U.S. to begin building out this infrastructure in advance of our launch of proprietary products. As part of our capital efficient strategy, we anticipate that our commercial team will market and sell a variety of in-licensed pharmaceutical products, which are therapeutically related to our proprietary portfolio, to cover the cost and expense of the infrastructure investment. 
 Using our resources to commercialize products in oncology may create more value for investors than marketing product rights pre-commercialization. We believe commercialization risks can be offset by establishing oncology manufacturing operations (API, Manufacturing, etc.) and commercial operations (Multi-source Oncology, Pharmacy, Hospitals, etc.). 
 Our Commercial Operations 
 Target Audiences: U.S. Oncology Market 
 The U.S. Oncology market is highly complex with Gatekeepers, Influencers and Prescribers influencing sales of oncology products. Launching a commercial operation in preparation for a proprietary drug approval is risky, difficult and expensive. Any commercial oncology organization must be able to market to Gatekeepers, Influencers and Prescribers in the oncology market at launch. Gatekeepers include hospitals (including pharmacies and therapeutics committees), buying groups, oncology managed care organizations, specialty distributors and pharmacists. Influencers in the oncology market include Key Opinion Leader physicians, regional cancer centers (as defined by the National Cancer Institute) and the U.S. government. Prescribers include oncologists and dermatologists. 
 Key hurdles in establishing Commercial Operations in the oncology market include the unpredictability of timing for U.S. FDA approval and the limited time to establish market relationships post approval, competition with companies with broader oncology offerings, and identifying key influencers in the local oncology market. Another hurdle is recruiting key senior business leaders since they are responsible for recruiting a successful Oncology Sales and Marketing team. For all these reasons, establishing commercial operations in the oncology market is risky and expensive. 
 In order to manage the risks and capture post commercial oncology economics, we plan to launch two oncology product lines in 2017—Multisource Oncology products and 503B Compounded Oncology Products. We intend to support these two product lines with a sales and marketing organization to target Gatekeepers. Our National Accounts organization will target Gatekeepers and the U.S. Government for these two oncology product lines. Regional Cancer Centers will also be targeted for Multisource Oncology and 503B Outsourced Facility products. 
 503B Outsourced Facility Products 
 We manufacture certain products in our 503B Outsourcing Facility. We expect to use our internal cGMP operations, and selected contract manufacturers to make both sterile to sterile products and products from sterilized bulk API. We plan to source certain of our API from our own internal supply chain to make products from sterile API bulk. We also plan to buy API from other sources. For sterile to sterile products, we expect to source the sterile vials and bags from national suppliers. This second oncology business is expected to further expand our offering to the U.S. oncology market. 
U.S. Specialty Pharmaceuticals 
 Our U.S. Specialty Pharmaceuticals business sources products through licensing agreements with various partners, who we collectively refer to as our Global Partner network. The company has unique commercial expertise in multisource oncology products and has developed a number of Global Partners that develop and manufacture multisource products for the U.S. market. This Global Partner network supplies the products the company markets in the U.S. Specialty Pharmaceutical business. The company is launching a commercial oncology business in the U.S. by launching multisource oncology and therapeutically related products supplied by our Global Partner network. We anticipate structuring collaborations whereby we split the profits with the Global Partners and market the products to Gatekeepers and Influencers in the U.S. oncology market. This will help the company prepare to launch proprietary oncology products into the U.S. market. 
 27

As of December 31, 2017, APD markets 12 products with 20 SKUs and has 7 products pending FDA approval. In addition, APS markets 3 products with 16 SKUs as of December 31, 2017. Our Commercial Platform, is expected to launch an additional 13 products in the first half of 2018, including 10 products by APD and 3 products by APS. 
 Agreements with key Suppliers and Marketing Partners
 Gland Agreement 
 In August 2016, we entered into two binding term sheets with Gland, pursuant to which we expect to enter into a definitive agreement for a non-exclusive license to market 21 of Gland’s products. Gland has obtained FDA approval for 8 of such products and has filed an abbreviated new drug application, or ANDA, in the U.S. for the remaining 13 products. For each of the licensed products we will pay a license fee to Gland. The maximum amount of such licenses is $7.3 million, of which $1.15 million is contingent on regulatory approval for 13 products for which Gland has filed ANDAs. We will pay a portion of such $1.15 million upon regulatory approval of each of these 13 licensed drugs. Additionally, during the terms of the agreements we have a profit sharing arrangement pursuant to which we will pay to Gland between 20% and 60% of the net profits from sales of each of the licensed products, depending on the product. The initial term of each of the of the Gland license agreements is five years from the launch of each product licensed pursuant to the agreement, subject to automatic renewal for additional two year terms, unless terminated by either party upon provision to the other party at least 90 days’ notice in advance of a renewal date. 
 In February 2017, we entered into an additional binding term sheet with Gland, pursuant to which we expect to enter into a definitive agreement for a non-exclusive license to market an additional 6 of Gland’s products. Gland has obtained FDA approval for 4 of such products and has filed an ANDA in North America for the remaining 2 products. For each of the licensed products we will pay a license fee to Gland. The maximum amount of such licenses is $3.15 million, of which $312,500 is contingent on regulatory approval for 2 products for which Gland has filed ANDAs. We will pay a portion of such $312,500 upon regulatory approval of each of these 2 licensed drugs. Additionally, during the term of the agreement we have a profit sharing arrangement pursuant to which we will pay to Gland between 25% and 40% of the net profits from sales of each of the licensed products, depending on the product. The initial term the Gland license agreement is five years from the launch of each product licensed pursuant to the agreement, subject to automatic renewal for additional two year terms, unless terminated by either party upon provision to the other party at least 90 days’ notice in advance of a renewal date. 
 In May 2017, we entered into another binding term sheet with Gland, pursuant to which we expect to enter into a definitive agreement for a non-exclusive license to market an additional 2 of Gland’s products. Gland has an ANDA in North America for each of the products. For each of the licensed products we will pay a license fee to Gland. The maximum amount of such licenses is $650,000, of which $162,500 is contingent on regulatory approval for 2 products for which Gland has filed ANDAs and the remainder is payable upon execution of the term sheet. We will pay a portion of such $162,500 upon regulatory approval of each of these 2 licensed drugs. Additionally, during the term of the agreement we have a profit sharing arrangement pursuant to which we will pay to Gland between 40% and 50% of the net profits from sales of each of the licensed products, depending on the product. The initial term the Gland license agreement is five years from the launch of each product licensed pursuant to the agreement, subject to automatic renewal for additional two year terms, unless terminated by either party upon provision to the other party at least 90 days’ notice in advance of a renewal date. 
 SunGen Agreement 
 In September 2016, we entered into a joint venture agreement with SunGen which we refer to as the SunGen Agreement, to create a joint venture to develop and commercialize certain specialty pharmaceuticals. We and SunGen have agreed to negotiate in good faith a limited liability company operating agreement to govern the joint venture, which we agreed will be owned 51% by SunGen and 49% by us. 
 Initially, SunGen has committed the sales and marketing rights for two specialty pharmaceuticals—terbutaline drug products and injectable lincomycin, as well as other related lincomycin products which are in the development stage to the joint venture. We have agreed to pay any manufacturing costs of terbutaline, our portion of the development and manufacturing costs of lincomycin, $375,000, and marketing and sales expenses for both. We have agreed to equal profit sharing of all profits of the joint venture, except for any profits arising from sales of terbutaline injectable products, which shall be allocated 75% to SunGen and 25% to us. We and SunGen launched our first product, Terbutaline Sulfate Injection, in August 2017. 
 In November 2016, we signed an addendum to the agreement to add Desmopressin Acetate Injection to the existing SunGen joint venture agreement. Through the joint venture, we and SunGen have agreed to pay to a third party an aggregate of $200,000 for the rights to the product. We and SunGen will each pay $40,000 upfront, with an additional $60,000 payable by each of us upon FDA approval of the product. In addition we and SunGen have each agreed to pay 25% of the one-time ANDA filing fee of $70,480, and 4% each of the annual FDA facility fees. The term of the addendum is ten years from the date of ANDA approval by the FDA, and 
 28

renews automatically for one year periods, unless terminated in writing six months prior to the end of the term or automatic extension. 50% of the profits from the sale of Desmopressin Acetate under this addendum will be payable to the third party, with the remaining 50% paid to the joint venture between us and SunGen. 
 The term of the SunGen Agreement shall continue for 99 years, unless the parties mutually agree to terminate it earlier. The agreement also contains customary termination rights for either party in the event of a breach of the agreement by the other party. 
 Pemetrexed, Supply Agreement Term Sheet 
 In December 2016, we entered into a binding term sheet with Nang-Kuang Pharmaceutical Co., LTD and CANDA NK-2, LLC, two affiliated pharmaceutical suppliers, pursuant to which we will enter into a definitive agreement for exclusive distribution of a generic injectable oncology product for the U.S. market. The generic product is not currently marketed in the U.S. pending the outcome of an ongoing challenge to the validity of patent protection of the branded product currently on the market. The ANDA for this product has been filed by the suppliers with the FDA and is awaiting approval. Upon signing of the term sheet, we were obligated to make a prepayment for a total of $12.0 million, of which $3.0 million was paid in January and February 2017, with the remaining $9.0 million paid in April 2017. 
 Under the agreement, we will make two additional product transfer payments, one equal to a premium between 10% and 20% over the cost incurred by the suppliers to produce and ship the product after confirmation of each purchase order of the product and, after receiving such product, we will make the other payment quarterly to the suppliers of between 40% and 60% of the earnings from sales, less certain expenses, of the product. 
 The initial term of the definitive agreement will begin on the signing date and continue through ten years after the date of our first commercial sale of the product, subject to automatic renewals of successive two-year terms, unless terminated by either party with six months’ notice prior to the expiration of the initial term or any renewal term. The agreement will also contain customary termination rights for either party in the event of a material breach of the agreement by the other party or bankruptcy or insolvency. In addition, we will be able to terminate the agreement with 30 days’ notice to the suppliers if the net profits from sales of the product, less certain expenses, equals zero or less and the parties cannot agree on reductions to the actual cost of the products. 
 Amphastar Agreement 
 In February 2017, we entered into a definitive agreement with Amphastar Pharmaceuticals, Inc., or Amphastar, to acquire 14 ANDAs and inventory for certain APIs.

Customers and Product Distribution
 We distribute our products primarily through pharmaceutical wholesalers and, to a lesser extent, specialty distributors that focus on particular therapeutic product categories, for use by a wide variety of end-users, including hospitals, integrated delivery networks and alternative site facilities. For the year ended December 31, 2017, the products we sold through our three largest wholesalers, AmerisourceBergan Corp. (“Amerisource”), Cardinal Health Inc. (“Cardinal Health”) and McKesson Corp. (“McKesson”), accounted for approximately 33%, 16% and 13 %, respectively, of the net revenue of our specialty products.

We utilize an outside third-party logistics contractor to distribute our U.S. products. Since the inception of the launch of our specialty products, the third-party logistics provider has been handling all aspects of our product logistics efforts and related services to us, including warehousing and shipment services, order-to-cash services, contract administration services and chargeback processing. Our products are warehoused and distributed through a third party logistics provider located in Memphis, Tennessee. Under our agreement with the third-party logistics provider, we maintain ownership of our finished products until sale to our customers. The initial term of the agreement is three years following the initial delivery date, and will automatically renew for successive 12-month periods, unless either we or the other party give notice of intent to terminate at least 90 days in advance of such automatic renewal. We may also have the opportunity to terminate the agreement within 30 days of receiving notice of certain price increases by the third-party logistics provider. The agreement also contains customary termination rights for either party, such as in the event of a breach of the agreement. 
 Global Supply Chain Platform 
 We believe it is important to minimize potential disruptions associated with a high potency oncology pharmaceutical supply chain. Therefore, we have begun the process of internalizing key components of the supply chain we believe are integral to minimizing these risks and retaining value for shareholders. For example, the World Health Organization lists paclitaxel as an essential medicine. Paclitaxel is derived from the bark of the Pacific yew tree and harvestable trees for the starting biomass are globally limited in supply. While current supply of the starting biomass for paclitaxel may be sufficient to meet global paclitaxel API demand, we believe future shortages are possible if we are successful in the commercialization of one of our lead drug candidates, Oraxol. We believe this increased demand could lead to shortages of paclitaxel API potentially leading to market and supply disruptions. 
 Our research group evaluated the purity and potency of some of the largest global suppliers of paclitaxel API. In 2015, we acquired one of these suppliers, Polymed Therapeutics Inc., or Polymed, and Chongqing Taihao Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd., or Taihao. Taihao is a cGMP manufacturer of high potency oncology API based in Chongqing, China and Polymed is the U.S. marketing entity for Taihao’s API in North America and Europe. Historical production and sales of API by this subsidiary were to third parties. We anticipate a greater share of Taihao’s manufacturing capacity will be used for our internal needs in the future and, therefore, sales to third parties may decrease. Historically, Polymed sold certain of these API products internationally to mostly large multi-national pharmaceutical companies. For the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, 19%, 38% and 29%, respectively, of our total revenue came from Intas Pharmaceuticals and 9%, 24 % and 17%, respectively, came from Ebewe Pharmaceuticals. 
 In 2014 we sought to obtain better control over our manufacturing of high potency oncology drugs used in global clinical studies, and in the third quarter of 2014 acquired QuaDPharma, one of our suppliers based in Clarence, New York. The number of our clinical studies has grown since the close of the acquisition. We are currently standardizing and leveraging the acquired cGMP systems and operating procedures in anticipation of developing multi-cGMP large scale manufacturing plants in both the U.S. and China. Our Commercial Platform has also initiated an assessment for a transition and potential expansion of these facilities to produce FDA shortage products. 
 Strategic Public-Private Partnerships
 New York State Partnership 
 In May 2015, we entered into an agreement with Fort Schuyler Management Corporation, or FSMC, a not-for-profit corporation owned by the State of New York, for a medical technology research, development, innovation, and commercialization alliance. Under the agreement, FSMC will pay up to $25 million for the construction of our North American headquarters and formulation lab and equipment in Buffalo, New York. We moved into the North American Headquarters in October 2015 and will lease from FSMC for a 10-year term, with an option to extend the term for an additional 10 years. For the first three years of the lease, we will pay rent to FSMC equal to 35% of FSMC’s operating costs for the space and thereafter will pay 100% of FSMC’s operating costs for the space for the remainder of the term. Under the agreement, we are obligated to spend $100 million in the Buffalo area over the initial 10-year term of the lease, and an additional $100 million during the second 10-year term, if we elect to extend the lease. We also committed to hiring 250 permanent employees in the Buffalo area within the first 5 years of completion of the project. 
 Under the same May 2015 agreement, FSMC also agreed to fund the costs of construction of a new manufacturing facility in Dunkirk, New York. Under the current arrangement, we have selected a general contractor for the project and we will oversee the development of the facility. ESD, the parent entity of FSMC, is responsible for the costs of construction and all equipment for the facility, up to an aggregate of $200 million, and FSMC, not us, will own the facility and equipment. We are entitled to lease the facility and all equipment at a rate of $1.00 per year for an initial 10-year term, and for the same rate if we elect to extend the lease for an additional 10-year term. We are responsible for all operating costs and expenses for the facility. In exchange, we have committed to spending $1.52 billion on operational expenses in our first 10-year term in the facility, and an additional $1.5 billion on operational expenses if we elect to extend the lease for a second 10-year term. We also committed to hiring 450 employees at our Dunkirk facility 
 30

within the first 5 years of operations. In September 2017, we entered into a grant disbursement agreement with ESD, whereby the State of New York will grant up to $200 million, plus any additional funds available from a previous $25 million ESD grant, to us in order to fund the construction of the Dunkirk facility. The funds will be deposited in four installments of up to $50 million each into an ESD held account, and the first $50 million installment was deposited in the third quarter of 2017. Actual disbursement of such funds to the Company will occur as the Company submits appropriate documentation verifying that expenditures on the project have been incurred. In addition, in July 2017 we entered into a 20-year payment in-lieu of tax agreement for the construction of our Dunkirk facility with the CCIDA, under which we anticipate incurring sales tax exemption savings of approximately $9.1 million during the development of the facility, and property tax savings of approximately $78 million over 20 years. 
 In November 2017, we entered into a project agreement with the CCIDA which sets forth the obligations of the parties in relation to the CCIDA’s grant to the Company of certain sales and use tax exemptions and real property tax exemptions in consideration for the Company’s agreement to complete the Dunkirk facility. The project agreement estimates the cost of the Dunkirk project at greater than $208.0 million, which exceeds the $200 million grant committed to by the State of New York, and the Company will be responsible for the difference. We are obligated to invest no less than $187.2 million in the facility prior to the completion of the project, which sum includes funds committed by the State of New York. The agreement includes commitments to comply with state and local laws in connection with the project. In December 2017, we entered into an agreement with M+W, whereby M+W will be responsible for the design and construction of the Dunkirk facility at a cost estimated between $205 million and $210 million, of which up to $200 million will be paid by a grant from the State of New York, with the remaining amount being paid by us. Payments under the December 2017 agreement will be made to M+W over time based upon completion of certain milestones under the agreement, and ESD must approve any payment from the grant funds. 
 Under the same September 2017 agreement with ESD, we must complete the construction of the facility in Dunkirk, New York in accordance with the final plans and specifications approved in writing by ESD and must maintain our business operations at the facility for a minimum of ten years after its completion. The September 2017 agreement may be subject to termination if ESD and FSMC perform their obligations under the agreement and we do not attain and or maintain certain levels of employment or spending for specified periods of time. In such event and in accordance with the May 2015 agreement, any potential liability of us would be capped at the amount of actual ESD spending on the facility in Dunkirk, New York times the percentage of required spending by us which we have not yet incurred. 
 China Partnership 
 In October 2015, we entered into an agreement with Chongqing Maliu Riverside Development & Investment Co., Ltd., or CQ, which is wholly owned by the Finance Bureau of Banan district of Chongqing, and is authorized to be responsible for investments, financing, infrastructure construction, operations and management in the Chongqing Maliu Riverside Development Zone. Our agreement with CQ provides for the construction of both a formulation plant and an API plant in the PRC. After entering into the agreement, and pursuant to its terms, we established a PRC-based subsidiary that is responsible for the operations of both facilities in July 2016. CQ is now responsible for construction of both facilities according to U.S. GMP standards. Although the agreement contemplates completion by the end of 2016, the construction of the new API plant is expected to be completed in July 2018 and we will anticipate we will begin utilizing the facility later in 2018 or in early 2019. The land and buildings will be owned by CQ, and we will lease the facilities, rent-free, for the first 10-year term, with an option to extend the lease for an additional 10-year term, during which, if we are profitable, we will pay a monthly rent of 5 RMB per square meter of space occupied. We are responsible for the costs of all equipment for the facilities, and we have committed to occupying and beginning to use the facilities within six months of the completion of construction. We have also committed to achieving certain operational, revenue and tax generation milestones within certain time periods once we commence operations. 
 Our goal is to use our public-private partnerships as a capital efficient method for large scale cGMP manufacturing within our supply chain and to facilitate market access in China. We believe our current facilities will be adequate and suitable for our operations for the foreseeable future. 
 To date, we have utilized a combination of acquisitions and public-private partnerships to internalize certain key components of our manufacturing and supply chain. We expect to continue to use a combination of collaborations and acquisitions to continue to build out elements of our supply chain where needed as a mechanism to minimize execution risk and retain value for our shareholders.

License and Collaboration Agreements 
 In-Licenses 
 Hanmi Licensing Agreements 
 In December 2011 and June 2013 we entered into two separate in-licensing agreements with Hanmi pursuant to which Hanmi granted us licenses to certain patents and know-how with respect to Hanmi’s Orascovery Program to research, discover and develop compounds that enhance or increase the oral absorption of active pharmaceutical ingredients. 
 The December 2011 agreement, which we refer to as the 2011 Hanmi Agreement, granted us an exclusive, sublicensable license for development and commercialization activities utilizing Hanmi’s patents and know-how related to the Orascovery Program in a certain territory including North America, South America, the European Union, Australia, New Zealand, Russia, Eastern Europe, Taiwan and Hong Kong, and a non-exclusive license to utilize the same intellectual property in manufacturing worldwide for sales inside those territories. The June 2013 agreement, which we refer to as the 2013 Hanmi Agreement, granted us an exclusive, sublicensable license comparable to the 2011 Hanmi Agreement solely for China. The 2011 Hanmi Agreement was amended in November 2012 to add Macau and Singapore to the territory governed by the agreement; in October 2013 to add Malaysia, Thailand, Vietnam, the Philippines and Indonesia; in March 2015 to add India; and again in March 2017 to add Japan. 
 Upon effectiveness of the 2011 Hanmi Agreement we made an upfront payment of $250,000 to Hanmi, and we will pay Hanmi tiered royalty payments in the teens based on aggregate net sales of any products using the licensed intellectual property in the territory. Such royalties will be reduced if competing generic products gain market share in the applicable country. Depending on when we receive regulatory approval of a product using the intellectual property licensed from Hanmi in the U.S. or Europe, we may be obligated to pay Hanmi a regulatory bonus worth $24,000,000, to be paid (i) upon the occurrence of a liquidity event, if the regulatory approval has already been received, or (ii) upon receipt of the regulatory approval, if such approval is received after a liquidity event. We were also required to pay Hanmi an exit bonus, in shares of our common stock at a 20% discount to the initial public offering price, worth $6,250,000 upon the completion of our initial public offering in June 2017 based on a nominal value of $5,000,000. In connection with the March 2015 amendment to the 2011 Hanmi Agreement, we made an upfront payment of $50,000 to Hanmi. Additionally, in connection with the March 2017 amendment to the 2011 Hanmi Agreement, we issued a $7.0 million convertible bond to Hanmi in lieu of an upfront payment. Hanmi elected to convert the $7.0 million principal amount of the convertible bond into 795,455 shares of our common stock, based on the agreed 20% discount to our initial public offering price, in September 2017. 
 Upon effectiveness of the 2013 Hanmi Agreement we made an upfront payment of $100,000 to Hanmi, and we will pay Hanmi tiered royalty payments in the teens based on net sales of any products using the licensed intellectual property in China. The royalties shall be reduced if competing generic products gain market share in China. We also granted to Hanmi a one-time right of first negotiation to purchase all of our rights in Oraxol or Oratecan under the agreement during development and prior that, at Hanmi’s discretion, requires us to negotiate in good faith the sale of our rights under such agreement to Hanmi at a purchase price determined by an internationally-recognized investment banking firm with an office in Hong Kong at any time prior to the earlier of (i) our first commercial sale of products using such technology or (ii) receipt by Hanmi of written notice from our company of the sublicense of the rights in an applicable product to a third party. 
 Under each agreement, we are responsible for all clinical studies and development and commercialization activities, and the related expenses, resulting from the agreements. Each of the 2011 Hanmi Agreement and the 2013 Hanmi Agreement expires on the earlier of (i) expiration of the last of Hanmi’s patent rights licensed under the agreement or (ii) invalidation of Hanmi’s patent rights which are the subject of the agreement, provided that the term will automatically be extended for consecutive one year periods unless either party gives notice to the in each case other at least 90 days prior to expiration of the patent rights licensed under the agreement or before the then-current annual expiration date of the agreement. The patent rights licensed to us under the 2011 and 2013 Hanmi Agreements have expiry dates ranging from in 2023 to 2033, unless the terms of such licensed patents are able to be extended in accordance with applicable laws and regulations. 
 Hanmi may also terminate the 2011 Hanmi Agreement if (i) we fail to file an IND with the FDA for Oraxol within 6 months of the latest of (x) our receipt from Hanmi of all English translations necessary for the filing of an IND with the FDA, (y) the date we and Hanmi agree that all studies necessary for the filing of an IND with the FDA have been completed, or (z) the date of the final study report for the last of any additional studies that are necessary for the filing of an IND with the FDA, or (ii) we fail to commence clinical studies for Oraxol within twelve months after the date of approval of an IND by the FDA. 
 The 2013 Hanmi Agreement may be terminated by Hanmi if (i) we fail to file an IND for Oraxol with the CFDA within six months after the latest of (w) completion of all Chinese translations necessary for the filing of an IND with the CFDA, (x) completion of all manufacturing and toxicology studies necessary for the filing of an IND with the CFDA, (y) the date we and Hanmi agree that all studies necessary for the filing of an IND with the CFDA have been completed, or (z) the date of the final study report for the last of any additional studies that are necessary for the filing of an IND with the CFDA, or (ii) we fail to commence clinical studies for Oraxol within twelve months after the date of approval of an IND by the CFDA. 
 32

Such clinical development milestones in respect of the termination right in both the 2011 Hanmi Agreement and the 2013 Hanmi Agreement may be extended for 12 months if we reasonably request. 
 Prior to the expiration of the term of each agreement, we may terminate the agreement in our sole discretion, by providing six months’ notice to Hanmi. Subject to certain conditions. The agreements also contain customary termination rights for either party, such as in the event of a breach of the agreement or the initiation of bankruptcy proceedings by the other party or by mutual agreement. 
 Out-License 
 Hanmi Licensing Agreements 
 In April 2011, we entered into a license agreement with Hanmi, which we refer to as the Hanmi Out-License, pursuant to which we granted to Hanmi an exclusive, sublicensable license to use certain of our intellectual property for development and commercialization of products containing KX-01 in certain territory including South Korea, China, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, the Philippines, Indonesia and Vietnam. We also granted to Hanmi a right of first refusal for any KX-01 related formulation or pharmaceutical that we develop and intend to grant an exclusive license for in the territory covered by the Hanmi Out-License. Hanmi is responsible for all development, manufacturing and commercialization, and the related costs and expenses, of any product candidates resulting from the agreement. 
 We received an upfront payment of $1.5 million from Hanmi upon effectiveness of the agreement, and we may be entitled to receive an aggregate of $4.0 million in additional development and regulatory milestone payments. We are also eligible to receive tiered royalty payments in the teens on net sales of each product commercialized by Hanmi utilizing the intellectual property subject to the Hanmi Out-License. Such royalties will be reduced as competing generic products gain market share in the applicable country. 
 The term of the Hanmi Out-License expires on the earlier of (i) expiration of the last of our patent rights licensed under the agreement or (ii) invalidation of our patent rights which are the subject of the agreement, provided that in each case the term will automatically be extended for consecutive one-year periods unless either party gives notice to the other at least 90 days prior to expiration of the patent rights licensed under the agreement or before the then-current annual expiration date of the agreement. Prior to the expiration of the term of the agreement, Hanmi may terminate the agreement in its sole discretion by providing six months’ notice to us. Subject to certain conditions, we may also terminate the agreement if Hanmi fails to comply with certain development timelines set forth in the Hanmi Out-License. The agreement also contains customary termination rights for either party, such as in the event of a breach of the agreement or the initiation of bankruptcy proceedings by the other party. 
 In September 2012, we entered into a memorandum of understanding with Hanmi, related to the Hanmi Out-License, pursuant to which we agreed to jointly enter into an agreement with a contract manufacturing organization to manufacture KX-01 for our and Hanmi’s needs, and to determine cost-sharing between us and Hanmi for such services. We have subsequently sourced certain clinical supplies from Formex L.L.C., pursuant to this agreement. 
 ZenRx License Agreement 
 In April 2013, we entered into a license agreement with ZenRx, which we refer to as the ZenRx License, pursuant to which we granted to ZenRx an exclusive, sublicensable license to use certain of our intellectual property to develop and commercialize Oratecan and Oraxol in Australia and New Zealand, and a non-exclusive license to manufacture a certain compound, but only for use in Oratecan and Oraxol. ZenRx is responsible for all development, manufacturing and commercialization, and the related costs and expenses, of any product candidates resulting from the agreement. 
 We received a $50,000 payment from ZenRx upon effectiveness of the agreement, and we may be entitled to receive up to an aggregate of $1.4 million in additional development, regulatory and sales milestone payments. We will also be eligible to receive tiered royalties in the mid-teens on net sales of each product commercialized by ZenRx utilizing the intellectual property that is the subject of the ZenRx License. Such royalties will be reduced by 40% when competing generic products have 30% of the market share in the applicable country, and will be eliminated entirely when competing generic products have 60% of the market share in the applicable country. 
 As an incentive to ZenRx to further development and commercialization of Oratecan and Oraxol in the territory, if ZenRx obtains certain regulatory approvals in the territory prior to regulatory approval of those products in either the U.S. or South Korea, we may be required to make payments to ZenRx, at ZenRx’s option, either up to $600,000 in cash or $350,000 in cash plus $250,000 worth of our common stock. 
 33

The term of the ZenRx License expires on the earlier of (i) expiration of the last of our patent rights licensed under the agreement or (ii) invalidation of our patent rights which are the subject of the agreement, provided that the term will automatically be extended for consecutive one year periods unless either party gives notice to the other at least 90 days prior to expiration of the patent rights licensed under the agreement or before the then current annual expiration date of the agreement. Prior to the expiration of the term of the agreement, ZenRx may terminate the agreement in its sole discretion, by providing three months’ notice to us. Subject to certain conditions, we may also terminate the agreement if ZenRx fails to comply with certain development timelines set forth in the ZenRx License. The agreement also contains customary termination rights for either party, such as in the event of a breach of the agreement or the initiation of bankruptcy proceedings by the other party. 
 PharmaEssentia License Agreements 
 In December 2011 and December 2013, we entered into two separate out-licensing agreements with PharmaEssentia Corp., or PharmaEssentia, pursuant to which we granted to PharmaEssentia certain licenses to our intellectual property for use in development and commercialization of certain products in specific territories. 
 The December 2011 agreement, which we refer to as the 2011 PharmaEssentia Agreement, granted an exclusive, sublicensable license to use any pharmaceutical preparation containing KX-01 or KX-02 for use in treating psoriasis or other non-malignant skin conditions in a territory that includes China, Taiwan, Macau, Hong Kong, Singapore and Malaysia. In December 2016, we agreed to amend the 2011 PharmaEssentia Agreement such that the field under the license agreement does not include AK for any country in the territory except Taiwan. 
 We received a $40,000 payment from PharmaEssentia upon effectiveness of the 2011 PharmaEssentia Agreement, and we may be entitled to an aggregate of up to $1.6 million in additional development and regulatory milestone payments, $250,000 of which may be paid in the form of PharmaEssentia stock. PharmaEssentia has discretion to offer to make such payment in the form of its stock, and we have discretion as to whether to accept such payment in the form of its stock. We will also be eligible to receive tiered royalties ranging from the high single-digits to teens on net sales of each product commercialized by PharmaEssentia utilizing the intellectual property that is the subject of the 2011 PharmaEssentia Agreement. Such royalties will be reduced by 40% when competing generic products have 30% of the market share in the applicable country, and will be eliminated entirely when competing generic products have 60% of the market share in the applicable country. 
 The December 2013 agreement, which we refer to as the 2013 PharmaEssentia Agreement, granted an exclusive, sublicensable license for development and commercialization of Oraxol and Oratecan in Taiwan and Singapore. Under the agreement, PharmaEssentia may also have the right to expand its license to include China, if Hanmi does not exercise its right of first refusal to such a product candidate under the Hanmi Out-License. In December 2016, we agreed to amend the 2013 PharmaEssentia Agreement to also include Vietnam in the territories covered by the license, provided that, if PharmaEssentia has not completed a submission for regulatory approval in Vietnam by 2021, the rights under the license in Vietnam will be returned to us. 
 We received a $50,000 payment from PharmaEssentia upon effectiveness of the 2013 PharmaEssentia Agreement and a $500,000 payment upon the initiation of a 505b2 strategy registration study in the first quarter of 2017 and we may be entitled to an aggregate of up to $1.5 million in additional development, regulatory and sales milestone payments, and we may also be obligated to pay PharmaEssentia an aggregate of $1.0 million in incentives if PharmaEssentia achieves certain milestones within designated timeframes. We will also be eligible to receive tiered royalties in the mid-teens on net sales of each product commercialized by PharmaEssentia utilizing the intellectual property that is the subject of the 2013 PharmaEssentia Agreement.

Guangzhou Xiangxue License Agreement 
 In May 2012, we entered into a license agreement with Guangzhou Xiangxue New Drug Discovery and Development Company Limited, or Xiangxue, which we refer to as the Xiangxue License, pursuant to which we granted to Xiangxue an exclusive, sublicensable license to use certain of our intellectual property to develop and commercialize products containing KX-02 in all indications for brain tumors in China, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Singapore. Xiangxue is responsible for all development, manufacturing and commercialization, and the related costs and expenses, of any product candidates resulting from the agreement. 
 We received a $750,000 payment from Xiangxue upon effectiveness of the agreement and in 2013 received a further $750,000 payment upon meeting the first regulatory milestone under the agreement. We may be entitled to receive an aggregate of up to $4.5 million in additional development and regulatory milestone payments. We will also be eligible to receive royalties in the teens on net sales of each product commercialized by Xiangxue utilizing the intellectual property that is the subject of the Xiangxue License. Such royalties will be reduced by 40% when competing generic products have 30% of the market share in the applicable country, and will be eliminated entirely when competing generic products have 60% of the market share in the applicable country. 
 The term of the Xiangxue License expires on the earlier of (i) expiration of the last of our patent rights licensed under the agreement or (ii) invalidation of our patent rights which are the subject of the agreement, provided that the term will automatically be extended for consecutive one year periods unless either party gives notice to the other at least 90 days prior to expiration of the patent rights licensed under the agreement or before the then current annual expiration date of the agreement. Prior to the expiration of the term of the agreement, Xiangxue may terminate the agreement in its sole discretion, by providing six months’ notice to us. Subject to certain conditions, we may also terminate the agreement if Xiangxue fails to comply with certain development timelines set forth in the Xiangxue License. The agreement also contains customary termination rights for either party, such as in the event of a breach of the agreement or the initiation of bankruptcy proceedings by the other party. 
 Eli Lilly and Company Agreement 
 In October 2016, we entered into a Clinical Trial Collaboration and Supply Agreement with Eli Lilly and Company, which we refer to as the Lilly Agreement, under which we and Lilly will conduct a Phase 1b trial of Oraxol in combination with Lilly’s ramucirumab in patients with gastric, gastro-esophageal and esophageal cancers. Under the terms of the Lilly Agreement we will act as the sponsor of the study and will hold the IND/CTA relating to the study, while all clinical data generated under the study will be jointly owned by us and Lilly. Other than Lilly’s obligation to supply ramucirumab to us, we will be responsible for all other costs associated with the conduct of the study. 
 The Lilly Agreement will remain in effect until the study contemplated by the agreement has been completed. The agreement also contains customary termination rights for either party, such as in the event of a breach of the agreement by the other party, or in the event a regulatory authority takes any action against or raises any objection to the study. 
 Almirall License Agreement 
 In December 2017, we entered into a license agreement with Almirall pursuant to which we granted to Almirall an exclusive, sublicensable license of certain of our intellectual property for the development and commercialization of topical products containing KX-01 to treat and prevent skin disorders and diseases in humans (including AK), or the Field, in a specified territory, which includes the United States and substantially all European countries (including Russia and Turkey), or the Licensed Territory. We also granted Almirall a right of first negotiation to license from us in the territory covered by the Almirall license any compound (other than KX-01) that we may develop in the future with the same mechanism of action as KX-01 for topical treatment of skin disorders and diseases if we decide to collaborate with a third party regarding that newly developed compound. Under the license agreement, Almirall also grants us an exclusive, sublicensable license to use certain of its intellectual property related to the products containing our licensed KX-01 for use in the Field in order to commercialize such products outside of the Licensed Territory and outside of the Field in the Licensed Territory, and to commercialize other products containing KX-01 for indications outside the Field. If we decide to sublicense that license from Almirall for certain additional products or indications, we will negotiate with Almirall to allow them to reasonably participate in the commercial benefit of such sublicense. 
 35

In March 2018, we received an upfront payment of $30 million from Almirall under this agreement, and we expect to receive other near-term payments of up to $25 million. We may also be entitled to receive an aggregate of $65 million in additional milestone payments, as well as sales milestone payments we estimate will likely total $155 million. Almirall will reward Athenex with additional sales milestones, should the sales exceed the currently projected amounts. In addition, we are eligible to receive tiered royalty payments for a certain period starting at 15% based on annual net sales of the topical products commercialized by Almirall utilizing the intellectual property subject to the license agreement, with incremental increases in royalty rates commensurate with increased sales. Additionally, under certain circumstances starting after one year following regulatory approval of certain licensed products in the United States, we would have the option to co-promote such licensed products under pre-negotiated terms and conditions with Almirall. 
 The term of the Almirall license began in February 2018 when antitrust approval was obtained, and the license continues for the entire life of the licensed topical products on a country-by-country basis. Prior to the expiration of the term of the agreement, Almirall may terminate the agreement in its entirety or with regard to a certain territory in its sole discretion by providing six months’ notice to us. Almirall may also terminate the agreement upon written notice during a 45-day evaluation period if Almirall does not find certain clinical data we provide to them to be satisfactory, upon which we may be required to reimburse Almirall $5 million of its upfront fee. We may also be required to reimburse Almirall $5 million in the event Almirall provides notice that certain other clinical endpoints under the agreement are not met. In addition, Almirall may terminate the agreement effective immediately if the licensed topical products cannot be marketed in the territory due to significant safety concerns, if regulatory approval is finally and irrevocably denied in a territory, or if an approved product label is less favorable than the product label submitted to the regulatory authorities in a way that would materially affect the commercial value of the product. 
 The agreement also contains customary termination rights for both parties, such as in the event of a breach of the agreement or if the other party defaults in performance of its obligations under the agreement. 
 Competition 
 The biopharmaceutical industry and the oncology subsector are characterized by rapid evolution of technologies, fierce competition and strong defense of intellectual property. Any product candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize will have to compete with existing therapies and new therapies that may become available in the future. While we believe that our product candidates, platforms and scientific expertise in the field of biotechnology and oncology provide us with competitive advantages, a wide variety of institutions, including large biopharmaceutical companies, specialty biotechnology companies, academic research departments and public and private research institutions, are actively developing potentially competitive products and technologies. We face substantial competition from biotechnology and biopharmaceutical companies developing oncology products. These competitors generally fall within the following categories: 
Oral administration: Taxol, Abraxane, Cynviloq, Camptosar, Onivyde, Taxotere and Hycamtin; 
 Src Kinase inhibitors: Picato and Temodar. 
 Many of our competitors, either alone or with strategic partners, have substantially greater financial, technical and human resources than we do. Accordingly, our competitors may be more successful than us in obtaining approval for treatments and achieving widespread market acceptance, rendering our treatments obsolete or non-competitive. Accelerated merger and acquisition activity in the biotechnology and biopharmaceutical industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. These companies also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel, establishing clinical study sites and patient registration for clinical studies, acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs and for sales in the API business. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. Our commercial opportunity could be substantially limited in the event that our competitors develop and commercialize products that are more effective, safer, less toxic, more convenient or less expensive than our comparable products. In geographies that are critical to our commercial success, competitors may also obtain regulatory approvals before us, resulting in our competitors building a strong market position in advance of our products’ entry. We believe the factors determining the success of our programs will be the efficacy, safety and convenience of our product candidates and our access to supply of API. 
 Intellectual Property
We strive to protect and enhance the proprietary technologies, inventions, products and product candidates, methods of manufacture, methods of using our products and product candidates, and improvements thereof that are commercially important to our business. We protect our proprietary intellectual property position by, among other things, filing patent applications in the U.S. and in jurisdictions outside of the U.S. covering our proprietary technologies, inventions, products and product candidates, methods, and improvements that are important to the development and implementation of our business. We also rely on trade secrets, know-how, 
 36

continuing innovation, and licensing opportunities to develop, strengthen and maintain our proprietary intellectual property position. As of December 31, 2017, we owned more than 100 granted patents and more than 40 pending patent applications worldwide. In addition, we have in-licensed patents and patent applications relating to our Orascovery platform technology from Hanmi. In our Orascovery platform, the lead compound is covered as composition-of-matter in granted patents in the U.S. and other territories, such as China and Europe. These patents will expire in October 2023 or 2024, excluding any potential patent term adjustments and/or patent term extensions that may be available. The lead compounds in our Src Kinase Inhibition platform are covered as composition-of-matter in granted patents in the US and other territories, including China and Europe. These patents will begin to expire in December 2025, excluding any potential patent term adjustments and/or patent term extensions that may be available. 
 The term of individual patents depends upon the laws of the countries in which they are obtained. In most countries in which we file, the patent term is 20 years from the earliest date of filing of a non-provisional patent application. In the U.S., the term of a patent may be lengthened by patent term adjustment to compensate the patentee for administrative delays by the USPTO in examining and granting the patent, or may be shortened if the patent is terminally disclaimed over an earlier-filed patent. In addition, a patent term may be extended to restore a portion of the term effectively lost as a result of FDA regulatory review. However, the restoration period cannot be longer than five years and cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the date of FDA approval, and only one patent applicable to an approved drug may be extended. Similar extensions as compensation for regulatory delays are available in Europe and other jurisdictions. We intend to seek patent term extensions where these are available. However there is no guarantee that the applicable authorities, including the FDA in the U.S., will agree with our assessment of whether such extensions should be granted, and we cannot predict the length of the extensions even if they are granted. The actual protection afforded by a patent varies on a claim-by-claim basis, from country-to-country, and depends upon many factors, including the type of patent, the scope of its coverage, the availability of regulatory-related extensions, the availability of legal remedies in a particular country, and the validity and enforceability of the patent. For a granted patent to remain in force most countries require the payment of annuities or maintenance fees, either yearly or at certain intervals during the term of a patent. If an annuity or maintenance fee is not paid, the patent may lapse irrevocably. 
 As of December 31, 2017, we owned 17 granted patents in the U.S. and 110 granted patents in other countries relating to our Src Kinase Inhibition technology. In addition, as of the same date we owned 36 pending applications relating to the Src Kinase Inhibition technology in the U.S. and other countries. These patents and pending patent applications contain composition-of-matter claims to our lead product candidates and their analogs, claims to pharmaceutical compositions comprising such candidates, and claims to methods of making and method of treatment using such candidates. Not accounting for any patent term adjustment, patent term extension or terminal disclaimer, and assuming that all annuity and/or maintenance fees are paid, the patents and, if granted, patent applications, will expire from 2025 to 2038. 
 In addition, we have one pending patent application in each of the Patent Cooperation Treaty, or PCT, the Gulf Cooperation Council, Jordan and Taiwan. The PCT application can be filed worldwide by entering national stage in various member states by January 21, 2018. These pending patent applications relate to therapeutic combinations of orally administered paclitaxel and a P-gp inhibitor. Not accounting for any patent term adjustment, patent term extension or terminal disclaimer, and assuming that all annuity and/or maintenance fees are paid, the patent applications, if granted, will expire in 2036. 
 Government Regulation and Product Approval 
 Governmental authorities in the U.S., at the federal, state and local level, and other countries extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, approval, quality control, labeling, packaging, promotion, storage, advertising, distribution, post-approval monitoring, marketing and export and import of products such as those we are developing. Our therapeutic drug candidates must be approved by the FDA through the NDA process before they may be legally marketed in the U.S. and will be subject to similar requirements in other countries prior to marketing in those countries. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and compliance with applicable federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. 
U.S. Government Regulation 
 In the U.S., the FDA regulates drugs under the FDCA and its implementing regulations. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development or approval process, or after approval, may subject an applicant to administrative or judicial sanctions, any of which could have a material adverse effect on us. These sanctions could include: 

• | refusal to approve pending applications;
--+-----------------------------------------


• | withdrawal of an approval;
--+---------------------------


• | imposition of a clinical hold;
--+-------------------------------

 37

 
• | warning or untitled letters;
--+-----------------------------


• | seizures or administrative detention of product;
--+-------------------------------------------------


• | total or partial suspension of production or distribution; or
--+--------------------------------------------------------------


• | injunctions, fines, restitution, disgorgement, refusal of government contracts, or civil or criminal penalties.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 NDA approval processes 
 The process required by the FDA before a therapeutic drug product may be marketed in the U.S. generally involves the following: 
  
• | completion of extensive nonclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies conducted according to GLPs, and other applicable regulations;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission to the FDA of an IND, which must be authorized before human clinical trials may begin;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials according to Good Clinical Practices, or GCPs, to establish the safety and efficacy of the product candidate for its intended use;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission to the FDA of an NDA;
--+---------------------------------


• | satisfactory completion of an FDA pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the product candidate is produced to assess readiness for commercial manufacturing and conformance to the manufacturing-related elements of the application, to conduct a data integrity audit, and to assess compliance with cGMPs to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the product candidate’s identity, strength, quality and purity;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | potential FDA audit of the clinical trial sites that generated the data in support of the NDA; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | FDA review and approval of the NDA.
--+------------------------------------

 Once a pharmaceutical candidate is identified for development, it enters the preclinical or nonclinical testing stage. Nonclinical tests include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, toxicity and formulation, as well as animal studies. Such studies must generally be conducted in accordance with the FDA’s GLPs. An IND sponsor must submit the results of the nonclinical tests, together with manufacturing information and analytical data, to the FDA as part of the IND. Some nonclinical testing may continue even after the IND is submitted. In addition to including the results of the nonclinical studies, the IND will also include a protocol detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated if the first phase lends itself to an efficacy determination. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA, within the 30-day time period, places the IND on clinical hold. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before clinical trials can begin. A clinical hold may occur at any time during the life of an IND and may affect one or more specific studies or all studies conducted under the IND. 
 The manufacture of investigational drugs for the conduct of human clinical trials is subject to cGMP requirements. Investigational drugs and API imported into the U.S. are also subject to regulation by the FDA relating to their labeling and distribution. Further, the export of investigational drug products outside of the U.S. may be subject to regulatory requirements of the receiving country as well as U.S. export requirements under the FDCA. 
 All clinical trials must be conducted under the supervision of one or more qualified investigators in accordance with GCP requirements, which include, among other things, the requirements that all research subjects provide their informed consent in writing for their participation in any clinical trial. Investigators must also provide certain information to the clinical trial sponsors to allow the sponsors to make certain financial disclosures to the FDA. Clinical trials must be conducted under protocols detailing the objectives of the trial, dosing procedures, research subject selection and exclusion criteria and the safety and effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. Each protocol, and any subsequent material amendment to the protocol, must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND, and progress reports detailing the status of the clinical trials must be submitted to the FDA annually. Sponsors also must report to the FDA serious and unexpected adverse reactions in a timely manner. Reporting requirements also apply to, among other things, any clinically important increase in the rate of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigator’s brochure and any findings from other studies or animal or in vitro testing that suggest a significant risk in humans exposed to the product candidate. An institutional review board, or IRB, at each institution participating in the clinical trial must review and approve the protocol before a clinical trial commences at that institution and must also approve the information regarding the trial and the consent form that must be provided to each research subject or the subject’s legal representative, monitor the study until completed and otherwise comply with IRB regulations. There are also requirements governing the reporting of ongoing clinical trials and completed clinical trial results to public registries within a certain timeframe for public dissemination on the National Institutes of Health clinicaltrials.gov website. 
 38

Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined. 
  
• | Phase 1—The product candidate is initially introduced into healthy human subjects and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution and elimination. In the case of some therapeutic candidates for severe or life-threatening diseases, such as cancer, especially when the product candidate may be inherently too toxic to ethically administer to healthy volunteers, the initial human testing is often conducted in patients.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 2—Clinical trials are performed on a limited patient population intended to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 3—Clinical trials are undertaken to further evaluate dosage, clinical efficacy and safety in an expanded patient population at geographically dispersed clinical study sites. These studies are intended to establish the overall risk-benefit ratio of the product and provide an adequate basis for product labeling.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 A pivotal study is a clinical study that adequately meets regulatory agency requirements for the evaluation of a product candidate’s efficacy and safety such that it can be used to justify the approval of the product. Generally, pivotal studies are also Phase 3 studies but may be Phase 2 studies, with the agreement of FDA, if the trial design provides a reliable assessment of clinical benefit, particularly in situations where there is an unmet medical need. 
 In the case of a 505(b)(2) NDA, which is a marketing application in which the sponsor may rely on investigations that were not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference or use from the person by or for whom the investigations were conducted, some of the above-described studies and nonclinical studies may not be required or may be abbreviated. The applicant may rely upon the FDA’s prior findings of safety and efficacy for a previously approved product or on published scientific literature in support of its application. Bridging studies, including clinical studies, may be needed, however, to demonstrate the applicability of the studies that were previously conducted by other sponsors to the drug that is the subject of the marketing application. 
 Human clinical trials are inherently uncertain and Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 testing may not be successfully completed or may not be completed at all. The FDA or the sponsor may suspend a clinical trial at any time for a variety of reasons, including a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the product candidate has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients. 
 During the development of a new product candidate, sponsors are given opportunities to meet with the FDA at certain points; specifically, prior to the submission of an IND, at the end of Phase 2 and before an NDA is submitted. Meetings at other times may be requested. These meetings can provide an opportunity for the sponsor to share information about the data gathered to date and for the FDA to provide advice on the next phase of development. Sponsors typically use the meeting at the end of Phase 2 to discuss their Phase 2 clinical results and present their plans for the pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial that they believe will support the approval of the new therapeutic. If a Phase 3 clinical trial is the subject of discussion at the end of Phase 2 meeting with the FDA, a sponsor may be able to request a Special Protocol Assessment, or SPA, the purpose of which is to reach agreement with the FDA on the Phase 3 clinical trial protocol design and analysis that will form the primary basis of an efficacy claim. The agreement will be binding on the FDA and may not be changed by the sponsor or the FDA after the trial begins except with the written agreement of the sponsor and the FDA or if the FDA determines that a substantial scientific issue essential to determining the safety or efficacy of the product candidate was identified after the testing began. 
 Post-approval trials, sometimes referred to as “Phase 4” clinical trials, may be required after initial marketing approval. These trials are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication. 
 Concurrent with clinical trials, sponsors usually complete additional animal safety studies, develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the product candidate and finalize a process for manufacturing commercial quantities of the product candidate in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and the manufacturer must develop methods for testing the quality, purity and potency of the product candidate. Additionally, for NDA products, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its proposed shelf-life. 
 39

The results of product development, nonclinical studies and clinical trials, along with descriptions of the manufacturing process, analytical tests and other control mechanisms, proposed labeling and other relevant information are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA requesting approval to market the product. Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, as amended, each NDA must be accompanied by a significant user fee. The FDA adjusts the PDUFA user fees on an annual basis. PDUFA also imposes an annual product fee for products and an annual establishment fee on facilities used to manufacture prescription drug products. Fee waivers or reductions are available in certain circumstances, such as where a waiver is necessary to protect the public health, where the fee would present a significant barrier to innovation, or where the applicant is a small business submitting its first human therapeutic application for review. Product candidates that are designated as orphan drugs are also not subject to user fees unless the application contains an indication other than an orphan indication. 
 Within 60 days following submission of the application, the FDA reviews a NDA submitted to determine if it is substantially complete before the agency accepts it for filing. The FDA may refuse to accept any NDA that it deems incomplete or not properly reviewable at the time of submission, and may request additional information. In this event, the NDA must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application also is subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review of the NDA. The FDA reviews an NDA, whether the product is safe and effective for its intended use, and in each case, whether the product is being manufactured in accordance with cGMP. The FDA may refer applications for novel products or products that present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations when making decisions. 
 During the product approval process, the FDA also will determine whether a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, plan is necessary to assure the safe use of the product. If the FDA concludes that an REMS plan is needed, the sponsor of the NDA must submit a proposed REMS plan prior to approval. The FDA has authority to require an REMS plan under the Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act of 2007 (the “FDAAA”) when necessary to ensure that the benefits of a drug outweigh the risks. In determining whether an REMS plan is necessary, the FDA must consider the size of the population likely to use the drug, the seriousness of the disease or condition to be treated, the expected benefit of the drug, the duration of treatment, the seriousness of known or potential adverse events, and whether the drug is a new molecular entity. A REMS plan may be required to include various elements, such as a medication guide or patient package insert, a communication plan to educate health care providers of the risks, limitations on who may prescribe or dispense the drug, or other measures that the FDA deems necessary to assure the safe use of the drug. In addition, the REMS plan must include a timetable to assess the strategy at 18 months, three years, and seven years after the strategy’s approval. 
 The FDA may also require an REMS plan for a drug that is already on the market if it determines, based on new safety information, that an REMS plan is necessary to ensure that the product’s benefits outweigh its risks. 
 Before approving a NDA, the FDA will inspect the facilities at which the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve the product unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving a NDA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure that the clinical trials were conducted in compliance with IND trial requirements and GCP requirements. To assure cGMP and GCP compliance, an applicant must incur significant expenditure of time, money and effort in the areas of training, record keeping, production and quality control. 
 Notwithstanding the submission of relevant data and information, the FDA may ultimately decide that the NDA does not satisfy its regulatory criteria for approval and deny approval. Data obtained from clinical trials are not always conclusive and the FDA may interpret data differently than the applicant. If the agency decides not to approve the NDA in its then present form, the FDA will issue a complete response letter that describes all of the specific deficiencies in the NDA identified by the FDA. The deficiencies identified may be minor, for example, requiring labeling changes, or major, for example, requiring additional clinical trials. Additionally, the complete response letter may include recommended actions that the applicant might take to place the application in a condition for approval. If a complete response letter is issued, the applicant must either resubmit the NDA, addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter, withdraw the application, or request an opportunity for a hearing. 
 Even if a product receives regulatory approval, the approval may be significantly limited to specific indications and dosages or the indications for use may otherwise be limited, which could restrict the commercial value of the product. Further, the FDA may require that certain contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling. The FDA may impose restrictions and conditions on product distribution, prescribing, or dispensing in the form of a risk management plan, or otherwise limit the scope of any approval. In addition, the FDA may require post marketing clinical trials, sometimes referred to as “Phase 4” clinical trials, designed to further assess a drug’s safety and effectiveness, and testing and surveillance programs to monitor the safety of approved products that have been commercialized. 
 40

Expedited Review and Approval 
 The FDA has various programs, including Fast Track, priority review, accelerated approval and breakthrough therapy designation, which are intended to expedite or simplify the process for reviewing therapeutic candidates, or provide for the approval of a product candidate on the basis of a surrogate endpoint. Even if a product candidate qualifies for one or more of these programs, the FDA may later decide that the product candidate no longer meets the conditions for qualification or that the time period for FDA review or approval will be lengthened. Generally, therapeutic candidates that are eligible for these programs are those for serious or life-threatening conditions, those with the potential to address unmet medical needs and those that offer meaningful benefits over existing treatments. For example, Fast Track is a process designed to facilitate the development and expedite the review of therapeutic candidates to treat serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions and fill unmet medical needs. Priority review is designed to give therapeutic candidates that offer major advances in treatment or provide a treatment where no adequate therapy exists an initial review within six months as compared to a standard review time of ten months. 
 Although Fast Track and priority review do not affect the standards for approval, the FDA will attempt to facilitate early and frequent meetings with a sponsor of a Fast Track designated product candidate and expedite review of the application for a product candidate designated for priority review. Accelerated approval, which is described in Subpart H of 21 CFR Part 314, provides for an earlier approval for a new product candidate that is (1) intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition; (2) generally provides a meaningful advantage over available therapies; and (3) demonstrates an effect on either a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, or IMM, and is reasonably likely to predict an effect on IMM or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. A surrogate endpoint is a laboratory measurement or physical sign used as an indirect or substitute measurement representing a clinically meaningful outcome. As a condition of approval, the FDA may require that a sponsor of a product candidate receiving accelerated approval perform post-marketing studies to verify and describe the predicted effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical endpoint, and the product may be subject to accelerated withdrawal procedures. 
 In the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act, or FDASIA, which was signed into law in July 2012, the U.S. Congress encouraged the FDA to utilize innovative and flexible approaches to the assessment of therapeutic candidates under accelerated approval. The law required the FDA to issue related guidance and also promulgate confirming regulatory changes. In May 2014, the FDA published a final Guidance for Industry titled “Expedited Programs for Serious Conditions—Drugs and Biologics,” which provides guidance on FDA programs that are intended to facilitate and expedite development and review of new therapeutic candidates as well as threshold criteria generally applicable to concluding that a product candidate is a candidate for these expedited development and review programs. 
 In addition to the Fast Track, accelerated approval and priority review programs discussed above, the FDA’s “Expedited Programs” guidance also describes the breakthrough therapy designation. A breakthrough therapy is defined as a drug that is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or conditions, and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints. Drugs designated as breakthrough therapies are eligible for, among other things, the Fast Track designation, intensive guidance on an efficient drug development program, and a commitment from FDA to involve senior managers and experienced review staff in a proactive collaborative, cross-disciplinary review. 
 In December 2016, the 21st Century Cures Act, or Cures Act, was signed into law. The Cures Act included numerous provisions that may be relevant to our product candidates, including provisions designed to speed development of innovative and breakthrough therapies. The Cures Act amends the FDCA and the Public Health Service Act, or PHSA, to reauthorize and expand funding for the National Institutes of Health, or NIH, and to authorize FDA to increase spending on innovation projects. Central to the Cures Act are provisions that enhance and accelerate FDA’s processes for reviewing and approving new drugs and supplements to approved NDAs. These include, but are not limited to, provisions that (i) require FDA to establish a program to evaluate the potential use of real world evidence to help to support the approval of a new indication for an approved drug and to help to support or satisfy post-approval study requirements, (ii) provide that FDA may rely upon qualified data summaries to support the approval of a supplemental application with respect to a qualified indication for an already approved drug, (iii) require FDA to issue guidance for purposes of assisting sponsors in incorporating complex adaptive and other novel trial designs into proposed clinical protocols and applications for new drugs, (iv) affirm that FDA should continue to expedite the approval of breakthrough therapies, and (v) require FDA to establish a process for the qualification of drug development tools for use in supporting or obtaining FDA approval for investigational use of a drug. The Cures Act also includes a provision which requires certain manufacturers or distributors of an investigational drug to make their policies on the availability of certain expanded access programs publicly available. Because the Cures Act was enacted recently and the FDA may take several years to develop these policies, it is difficult to know whether or how the Cures Act will directly affect our business.

Abbreviated New Drug Applications for Generic Drugs 
 NDA applicants are required to list with the FDA each patent with claims covering the applicant’s product or method of using the product. Upon approval of a drug, each of the patents listed in the application for the drug is then published in the FDA’s Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations, commonly known as the Orange Book. Drugs listed in the Orange Book can, in turn, be cited by potential generic or 505(b)(2) applicants in support of approval of an abbreviated new drug application, or ANDA, or a 505(b)(2) application. An ANDA provides for marketing of a drug product that has the same active ingredients in the same strengths and dosage form as the listed drug and has been shown to be bioequivalent to the listed drug. Other than the requirement for bioequivalence testing, ANDA applicants are not required to conduct, or submit results of, pre-clinical or clinical tests to prove the safety or effectiveness of their drug product. Drugs approved in this way can often be substituted by pharmacists under prescriptions written for the original listed drug. 
 The ANDA or 505(b)(2) applicant is required to make a certification to the FDA concerning any patents listed for the approved NDA product in the FDA’s Orange Book. Specifically, the ANDA or 505(b)(2) applicant must certify that: (i) the required patent information has not been filed; (ii) the listed patent has expired; (iii) the listed patent has not expired, but will expire on a particular date and approval is sought after patent expiration; or (iv) the listed patent is invalid or will not be infringed by the new product. The ANDA applicant may also elect to submit a section viii statement certifying that its proposed ANDA labeling does not contain (or carves out) any language regarding the patented method-of-use rather than certify to a listed method-of-use patent. If the applicant does not challenge the listed patents, the ANDA or 505(b)(2) application will not be approved until all the listed patents claiming the referenced product have expired. 
 A certification that the ANDA or 505(b)(2) product will not infringe the already approved product’s listed patents, or that such patents are invalid, is called a Paragraph IV certification. If the ANDA or 505(b)(2) applicant has provided a Paragraph IV certification to the FDA, the applicant must also send notice of the Paragraph IV certification to the NDA and patent holders once the ANDA or 505(b)(2) application has been received by the FDA. The NDA and patent holders may then initiate a patent infringement lawsuit in response to the notice of the Paragraph IV certification. The filing of a patent infringement lawsuit within 45 days of the receipt of a Paragraph IV certification automatically prevents the FDA from approving the ANDA or 505(b)(2) application until the earlier of 30 months, expiration of the patent, settlement of the lawsuit or a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the ANDA applicant. 
 The ANDA or 505(b)(2) application will not be approved until any applicable non-patent exclusivity listed in the Orange Book for the referenced product has expired. 
 Patent Term Restoration and Marketing Exclusivity 
 Depending upon the timing, duration and specifics of FDA approval of the use of our drug candidates, some of our U.S. patents may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, commonly referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Act. The Hatch-Waxman Act permits a patent restoration term of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review process. However, patent term restoration cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the product’s approval date. The patent term restoration period is generally one-half the time between the effective date of an IND and the submission date of an NDA plus the time between the submission date of an NDA and the approval of that application, except that this review period is reduced by any time during which the applicant failed to exercise due diligence. Only one patent applicable to an approved product is eligible for the extension and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent. The USPTO, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration. In the future, if available, we intend to apply for restorations of patent term for some of our currently owned patents beyond their current expiration dates, depending on the expected length of the clinical trials and other factors involved in the filing of the relevant NDA; however, there can be no assurance that any such extension will be granted to us. 
 Market exclusivity provisions under the FDCA can also delay the submission or the approval of certain applications. The FDCA provides a five-year period of non-patent marketing exclusivity within the U.S. to the first applicant to gain approval of an NDA for a new chemical entity. A drug is a new chemical entity if the FDA has not previously approved any other new drug containing the same active moiety, which is the molecule or ion responsible for the action of the drug substance. During the exclusivity period, the FDA may not accept for review an abbreviated new drug application, or ANDA, or a 505(b)(2) NDA submitted by another company for another version of such drug where the applicant does not own or have a legal right of reference to all the data required for approval. However, an application may be submitted after four years if it contains a certification of patent invalidity or non-infringement. The FDCA also provides three years of marketing exclusivity for an NDA, 505(b)(2) NDA or supplement to an existing NDA if new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability studies, that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant are deemed by the FDA to be essential to the approval of the application, for example, new indications, dosages or strengths of an existing drug. This three-year exclusivity covers only the conditions of use associated with the new clinical investigations and does not prohibit the FDA from 
 42

approving ANDAs for drugs containing the original active agent. Five-year and three-year exclusivity will not delay the submission or approval of a full NDA. However, an applicant submitting a full NDA would be required to conduct or obtain a right of reference to all of the preclinical studies and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials necessary to demonstrate safety and effectiveness. 
 Orphan Drug Designation 
 Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant Orphan Drug Designation to therapeutic candidates intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally a disease or condition that affects either (1) fewer than 200,000 individuals in the U.S., or (2) or more than 200,000 individuals in the U.S. and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making available in the U.S. a product candidate for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales in the U.S. for that product candidate. Orphan Drug Designation must be requested before submitting an NDA. We have received Orphan Drug Designation for KX-02. After the FDA grants Orphan Drug Designation, the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Orphan Drug Designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process. 
 If a product candidate that has Orphan Drug Designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease for which it has such designation, the product candidate is entitled to orphan product exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug for the same indication, except under limited circumstances, for seven years. Orphan drug exclusivity, however, could also block the approval of one of our therapeutic candidates for seven years if a competitor obtains approval of the same drug as defined by the FDA or if our product candidate is determined to be contained within the competitor’s product candidate for the same indication or disease. 
 Pediatric Exclusivity and Pediatric Use 
 Under the Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act (the “BPCA”), certain therapeutic candidates may obtain an additional six months of exclusivity if the sponsor submits information requested in writing by the FDA, referred to as a Written Request, relating to the use of the active moiety of the product candidate in children. Although the FDA may issue a Written Request for studies on either approved or unapproved indications, it may only do so where it determines that information relating to that use of a product candidate in a pediatric population, or part of the pediatric population, may produce health benefits in that population. 
 In addition, the Pediatric Research Equity Act, or PREA, requires a sponsor to conduct pediatric studies for most therapeutic candidates, for a new active ingredient, new indication, new dosage form, new dosing regimen or new route of administration. Under PREA, original NDAs and supplements thereto must contain a pediatric assessment unless the sponsor has received a deferral or waiver. The required assessment must assess the safety and effectiveness of the product candidate for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product candidate is safe and effective. The sponsor or FDA may request a deferral of pediatric studies for some or all of the pediatric subpopulations. A deferral may be granted for several reasons, including a finding that the product candidate is ready for approval for use in adults before pediatric studies are complete or that additional safety or effectiveness data needs to be collected before the pediatric studies begin. The law requires the FDA to send a PREA Non-Compliance letter to sponsors who have failed to submit their pediatric assessments required under PREA, have failed to seek or obtain a deferral or deferral extension or have failed to request approval for a required pediatric formulation. It further requires the FDA to post the PREA Non-Compliance letter and sponsor’s response. 
 As part of the FDASIA, the U.S. Congress made a few revisions to the BPCA and PREA, which were slated to expire on September 30, 2012, and made both laws permanent. 
 Post-Approval Requirements 
 Once an approval is granted, the FDA may withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory requirements is not maintained or if problems occur after the product candidate reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product candidate may result in restrictions on the product candidate or even complete withdrawal of the product candidate from the market. After approval, some types of changes to the approved product candidate, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes and additional labeling claims, are subject to further FDA review and approval. In addition, the FDA may under some circumstances require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the effect of approved therapeutic candidates that have been commercialized, and the FDA under some circumstances has the power to prevent or limit further marketing of a product candidate based on the results of these post-marketing programs. 
 43

Any therapeutic candidates manufactured or distributed pursuant to FDA approvals for prescription drugs are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things: 
  
• | reporting and record-keeping requirements;
--+-------------------------------------------


• | reporting of adverse experiences with the product candidate;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------


• | providing the FDA with updated safety and efficacy information;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------


• | product sampling and distribution requirements;
--+------------------------------------------------


• | notifying the FDA and gaining its approval of specified manufacturing or labeling changes; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | complying with FDA promotion and advertising requirements, which include, among other things, standards for direct-to-consumer advertising, restrictions on promoting products for uses or in patient populations that are not described in the product’s approved labeling, limitations on industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities and requirements for promotional activities involving the internet.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Therapeutic manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved therapeutic products are required to register their establishments with the FDA and obtain licenses in certain states and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and some state agencies for compliance with cGMPs and other laws. The FDA periodically inspects manufacturing facilities to assess compliance with cGMP, which imposes extensive procedural, substantive and record-keeping requirements. In addition, changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated, and, depending on the significance of the change, may require FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations would also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon us and any third-party manufacturers used. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain compliance with cGMP and other aspects of regulatory compliance. 
 Disclosure of Clinical Trial Information 
 Sponsors of clinical trials of FDA-regulated products, including drugs, are required to register and disclose certain clinical trial information, which is publicly available at www.clinicaltrials.gov. Information related to the product, patient population, phase of investigation, study sites and investigators, and other aspects of the clinical trial is then made public as part of the registration. Sponsors are also obligated to disclose the results of their clinical trials after completion. Disclosure of the results of these trials can be delayed under certain limited circumstances. Competitors may use this publicly available information to gain knowledge regarding the progress of development programs. The government recently released a regulation and policy to expand and enhance the requirements related to registering and reporting the results of which may result in greater enforcement of these requirements in the future. 
Regulation of Compounding Pharmacies 
 Compounding is a practice in which a licensed pharmacist, a licensed physician, or in the case of an outsourcing facility, a person under the supervision of a licensed pharmacists, combines, mixes, or alters ingredients of a drug to create a medication tailored to the needs of an individual patient. We are engaged in the compounding of sterile drugs as an outsourcing facility registered with FDA. The Compounding Quality Act, or CQA, allows an entity that compounds sterile drugs to register as an outsourcing facility. Once registered (including payment of a fee), an outsourcing facility must meet certain conditions in order to be exempt from the FDCA’s approval requirements and the requirement to label products with adequate directions for use. Under the CQA, a drug must be compounded in compliance with CGMP by or under the direct supervision of a licensed pharmacist in a facility registered pursuant to Section 503B of the FDCA in order to be so exempt. The outsourcing facility must also report specific information about the products that it compounds, including a list of all of the products it compounded during the previous six months, and information about the compounded products, such as the source of the active ingredients used to compound pursuant to Section 503B(b)(2). If the outsourcing facility compounds using bulk drug substances, the bulk drug substances must either appear on a list established by FDA of bulk drug substances for which there is a clinical need, or be used to compound drugs that appear on a list established by FDA of drugs for which there is a shortage. Although FDA has not yet established a list of bulk drug substances for which there is a clinical need, FDA has announced an interim policy pursuant to which bulk drug substances may be nominated for inclusion on such list and, provided certain conditions are met, outsourcing facilities may compound with such bulk drug substances pending evaluation of the substances for inclusion on FDA’s list of bulk drug substances for which there is a clinical need. 
 In addition, an outsourcing facility must meet other conditions described in the CQA, including reporting adverse events pursuant to Section 503B(b)(5) of the FDCA, and labeling its compounded products with certain information pursuant to Section 503B(a)(10). Registered outsourcing facilities are prohibited from selling compounded drugs through a wholesale distributor, or from compounding drugs that are essentially copies of FDA-approved drugs. Registered outsourcing facilities are subject to FDA inspection, and FDA conducts inspections on a risk-based frequency under Section 503B(b)(4).

Pharmaceutical Coverage, Reimbursement and Pricing 
 Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any products for which we may obtain regulatory approval. In the U.S., sales of any products for which we may receive regulatory approval for commercial sale will depend in part on the availability of coverage and reimbursement from third-party payors. Third-party payors include government authorities such as Medicare, Medicaid, TRICARE and the Veterans Administration, managed care providers, private health insurers and other organizations. 
 The Medicaid Drug Rebate Program requires pharmaceutical manufacturers to enter into and have in effect a national rebate agreement with the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services as a condition for states to receive federal matching funds for the manufacturer’s outpatient drugs furnished to Medicaid patients. Effective in 2010, the ACA made several changes to the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, including increasing pharmaceutical manufacturers’ rebate liability by raising the minimum basic Medicaid rebate on most branded prescription drugs from 15.1% of average manufacturer price, or AMP, to 23.1% of AMP, and adding a new rebate calculation for “line extensions” (i.e., new formulations, such as extended release formulations) of solid oral dosage forms of branded products, as well as potentially impacting their rebate liability by modifying the statutory definition of AMP. The ACA also expanded the universe of Medicaid utilization subject to drug rebates by requiring pharmaceutical manufacturers to pay rebates on Medicaid managed care utilization as of 2010 and by expanding the population potentially eligible for Medicaid drug benefits. CMS will expand Medicaid rebate liability to the territories of the United States as well, beginning in 2017, if the territories elect to enroll in the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program. In addition, the ACA provides for the public availability of retail survey prices and certain weighted average AMPs under the Medicaid program. The implementation of this requirement by CMS may also provide for the public availability of pharmacy acquisition cost data, which could influence our decisions related to setting product prices and offering related discounts. 
 In order for a pharmaceutical product to receive federal reimbursement under the Medicare Part B and Medicaid programs or to be sold directly to U.S. government agencies, the manufacturer must extend discounts to entities eligible to participate in the 340B drug pricing program. The required 340B discount on a given product is calculated based on the AMP and Medicaid rebate amounts reported by the manufacturer. Effective in 2010, the ACA expanded the types of entities eligible to receive discounted 340B pricing; although, under the current state of the law, with the exception of children’s hospitals, these newly eligible entities will not be eligible to receive discounted 340B pricing on orphan drugs when used for the orphan indication. In addition, as 340B drug pricing is determined based on AMP and Medicaid rebate data, the revisions to the Medicaid rebate formula and AMP definition described above could cause the required 340B discount to increase. 
 The process for determining whether a payor will provide coverage for a product is typically separate from the process for setting the reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the product. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific products on an approved list or formulary which might not include all of the FDA-approved products for a particular indication. Also, third-party payors may refuse to include a particular branded drug on their formularies or otherwise restrict patient access to a branded drug when a less costly generic equivalent or other alternative is available. However, under Medicare Part D—Medicare’s outpatient prescription drug benefit—there are protections in place to ensure coverage and reimbursement for oncology products and all Part D prescription drug plans are required to cover substantially all anti-cancer agents. However, a payor’s decision to provide coverage for a product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be available. Adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development. 
 Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the price and examining the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of medical products and services, in addition to their safety and efficacy. In order to obtain coverage and reimbursement for any product that might be approved for sale, we may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of any products, in addition to the costs required to obtain regulatory approvals. Our drug candidates may not be considered medically necessary or cost-effective. If third-party payors do not consider a product to be cost-effective compared to other available therapies, they may not cover an approved product as a benefit under their plans or, if they do, the level of payment may not be sufficient to allow a company to sell its products at a profit. 
 The U.S. government and state legislatures have shown significant interest in implementing cost containment programs to limit the growth of government-paid health care costs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products for branded prescription drugs. Further, the ACA, contains provisions that may reduce the profitability of drug products, including, for example, increased rebates for drugs reimbursed by Medicaid programs and the extension of Medicaid rebates to Medicaid managed care plans. Several other provisions of the ACA focused on cost containment include: 
  
• | The Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute, which was established to identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research. The research conducted by the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute may affect the market for certain pharmaceutical products.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 45

 
• | The Independent Payment Advisory Board which, since 2014, has had authority to recommend certain changes to the Medicare program to reduce expenditures by the program when spending exceeds a certain growth rate and such changes could result in reduced payments for prescription drugs. Under certain circumstances, these recommendations will become law unless Congress enacts legislation that will achieve the same or greater Medicare cost savings. However, as of late 2016, the President has yet to nominate anyone to serve on the board.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation within CMS to test innovative payment and service delivery models to lower Medicare and Medicaid spending, potentially including prescription drug spending. Funding has been allocated to support the mission of the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation from 2011 to 2019.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Effective in 2011, the ACA imposed an annual, nondeductible fee on any entity that manufactures or imports certain branded prescription drugs, apportioned among these entities according to their market share in certain government healthcare programs, although this fee would not apply to sales of certain products approved exclusively for orphan indications.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Effective in 2011, the ACA imposed a requirement on manufacturers of branded drugs to provide a 50% discount off the negotiated price of branded drugs dispensed to Medicare Part D patients in the coverage gap (i.e., the “donut hole” or the period of consumer payment for prescription medicine costs which lies between the initial coverage limit and the catastrophic—coverage threshold).
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The adoption of government controls and measures, and tightening of restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could also limit payments for pharmaceuticals. 
 The marketability of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale may suffer if the government and third-party payors fail to provide adequate coverage and reimbursement. Coverage policies and third-party reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which we receive regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future. 
 Generic Drugs 
 Given that we manufacture and market generic drug products, our business may be impacted by laws and policies governing the coverage, pricing, and reimbursement of generic drugs. Generic drugs are the same active pharmaceutical ingredient as initial innovator medicines and are typically more affordable in comparison to the innovator’s products. Sales of generic medicines have benefitted from policies encouraging generic substitution and a general increasing acceptance of generic drugs on the part of healthcare insurers, consumers, physicians and pharmacists. However, while the U.S. generics market is one of the largest in the world, with generic prescription sales of approximately $70 billion in 2016, the recent trend of rising generic drug prices has drawn scrutiny from the U.S. government. Specifically, beginning in 2014 generic drug pricing became the subject of Congressional inquiries and media attention, and many generic drug manufacturers became the targets of government investigations. 
 In addition, under amendments to the Medicaid Drug Rebate Statute in 2015, generic drug manufacturers are now required to pay an inflation penalty if price increases on generic drugs exceed the rate of inflation. Specifically, the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 (“BBA ‘15”) amended section 1927(c)(3) of the Social Security Act to require manufacturers of non-innovator multiple source (N) drugs to pay additional Medicaid rebates if a drug’s AMP increases at a rate that exceeds the rate of inflation. Manufacturers of generic drugs must calculate the additional Medicaid rebates for noninnovator drugs beginning with the rebates that are calculated for the first quarter of 2017. 
 Also, the ACA revised the methodology for setting Medicaid generic drug reimbursement in order to further limit the reimbursement of generic drugs under the Medicaid program. Specifically, effective April 1, 2016, the Federal Upper Limit (“FUL”), which establishes the government’s maximum payment amount for certain generic drugs, is no less than 175% of the weighted average of the most recently reported monthly AMPs for pharmaceutically and therapeutically equivalent multiple source drug products that are available for purchase by retail community pharmacies on a nationwide basis. Similarly, reimbursement for generic drugs is also limited in Medicare Part B, as the Average Sales Price (the metric upon which reimbursement is based) for multiple-source drugs included within the same multiple-source drug billing and payment code is the volume-weighted average of the various manufacturers’ ASPs for those drug products. 
 46

Laboratory Testing Services Coverage and Reimbursement 
 Given that we market medical devices in the form of in vitro diagnostic devices, or IVDs, used in the performance of clinical laboratory tests, currently limited to drugs of abuse, pregnancy, and alcohol testing in the U.S., and cardiac marker and infectious disease testing in Asia, our business may be impacted by laws and policies governing the coding, coverage, reimbursement, and demand for clinical laboratory services. With regard to the clinical laboratory services performed on Medicare beneficiaries, health care providers utilizing such tests generally either are paid under prospective payment systems for most tests performed on hospital inpatients and outpatients, or must bill the Medicare Part B program directly in compliance with applicable coding, coverage and reimbursement rules, and accept the amount paid by the Medicare contractor under the Medicare Clinical Laboratory Fee Schedule, or CLFS, as payment in full. Currently, Medicare does not require the beneficiary to pay a co-payment for clinical laboratory services paid under the CLFS. Pursuant to Section 216 of-the federal Protecting Access to Medicare Act of 2014, or PAMA, CMS is modernizing the CLFS by creating a market-based reimbursement system which will require clinical laboratories subject to the law to report certain private payor prices and test volumes, and CMS to set new payment rates for CLFS tests based on the weighted median of reported prices, effective January 1, 2018. It is unclear how this new law will affect testing services that use our products at this time, but as a general matter CMS has indicated that prices of many clinical laboratory tests will decrease under PAMA. In addition, state Medicaid programs are prohibited from paying more (and in many instances, pay significantly less) than Medicare, and payment is subject to state-specific coverage, reimbursement, and laboratory law requirements. Certain state Medicaid programs also require Medicaid recipients to pay co-payment amounts for clinical laboratory services. Likewise, payment by private payors is subject to payor-determined coverage and reimbursement policies that vary considerably and are subject to change without notice. Finally, there is increasing legislative attention to opioid abuse in the United States, including passage of the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act of 2016 which, among other things, strengthens state prescription drug monitoring programs and expands educational efforts for certain populations, which may increase the need for drugs of abuse testing. Changes like these related to clinical laboratory services, and any other changes related to coverage or reimbursement may impact the demand for and pricing of some of our products which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results. 
Reimbursement for Compounded Drugs 
 Given that we intend to compound and sell compounded products, some of which may include APIs that we manufacture, our business may be impacted by the downstream coverage and reimbursement of compounded products. Generally, federal reimbursement is available for compounded drugs, but is typically dependent upon whether the individual ingredients or bulk drug substances that make up the compounded product are FDA-approved. Certain of our API products have not yet received FDA approval. 
 There is a national payment policy for compounded drugs under Medicare Part B, but the policy is unclear because it does not stipulate whether payment is available for ingredients that are bulk drug substances, which are generally not FDA-approved. Under Medicare Part B, claims for compounded drugs are typically submitted using a billing code for “not otherwise classified drugs”, and CMS contractors who process Part B claims may conduct further reviews of outpatient claims to determine whether the drug billed under a nonspecific billing code is a compounded drug and to identify its ingredients in order to make payment decisions. However, CMS contractors who process Part B claims do not always collect information on the FDA-approval status of drug ingredients and, therefore, payment may be made for ingredients that are not FDA-approved products. Therefore, there is uncertainty as to whether Medicare payments for compounded drugs are consistent with the Medicare Part B policy. 
 Under Medicare Part D, federal payments are not available for non-FDA-approved products—including bulk drug substances—and inactive ingredients used to make a compounded drug. Insurers that offer Medicare Part D benefits and Part D-only sponsors, generally, pay pharmacies for each ingredient in the compounded drug that is an FDA-approved product and is otherwise eligible for reimbursement under Part D. However, with respect to non-FDA approved bulk drug substances, insurers that offer Medicare Part D benefits and Part D-only sponsors may choose to pay for such bulk substances but may not submit these payments as part of the Part D transaction data CMS uses to determine federal payments to Part D plans. 
 Healthcare Fraud and Abuse Laws and Compliance Requirements 
 We are subject to various federal and state laws targeting fraud and abuse in the healthcare industry. These laws may impact, among other things, our proposed sales and marketing programs. In addition, we may be subject to patient privacy regulation by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. The laws that may affect our ability to operate include: 

• | the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering, or paying remuneration (a term interpreted broadly to include anything of value, including, for example, gifts, discounts, chargebacks, and credits), directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward, or in return for, either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order, or recommendation of, an item or service reimbursable under a federal healthcare program, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 47

 
• | federal civil and criminal false claims laws and civil monetary penalty laws, which prohibit, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment to Medicare, Medicaid, or other third-party payors that are false or fraudulent, or making a false statement or record material to payment of a false claim or avoiding, decreasing, or concealing an obligation to pay money owed to the federal government;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | provisions of the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, which created new federal criminal statutes, referred to as the “HIPAA All-Payor Fraud Prohibition,” that prohibit knowingly and willfully executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program and making false statements relating to healthcare matters;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the federal transparency laws, including the federal Physician Payment Sunshine Act, which was part of the ACA, that require manufacturers of certain drugs and biologics to track and disclose payments and other transfers of value they make to U.S. physicians and teaching hospitals as well as physician ownership and investment interests in the manufacturer, and that such information is subsequently made publicly available in a searchable format on a CMS website;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | provisions of HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act and its implementing regulations, which imposes certain requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | state law equivalents of each of the above federal laws, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws which may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payor, including commercial insurers, state transparency reporting and compliance laws; and state laws governing the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and which may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The ACA broadened the reach of the fraud and abuse laws by, among other things, amending the intent requirement of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and the applicable criminal healthcare fraud statutes contained within 42 U.S.C. § 1320a-7b. Pursuant to the statutory amendment, a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of this statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. In addition, the ACA provides that the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the civil False Claims Act or the civil monetary penalties statute. Many states have adopted laws similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, some of which apply to the referral of patients for healthcare items or services reimbursed by any source, not only the Medicare and Medicaid programs. 
 The federal False Claims Act prohibits anyone from, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, for payment to federal programs (including Medicare and Medicaid) claims for items or services that are false or fraudulent. Although we would not submit claims directly to payors, manufacturers can be held liable under these laws if they are deemed to “cause” the submission of false or fraudulent claims by, for example, providing inaccurate billing or coding information to customers or promoting a product off-label. In addition, our future activities relating to the reporting of wholesaler or estimated retail prices for our products, the reporting of prices used to calculate Medicaid rebate information and other information affecting federal, state, and third-party reimbursement for our products, and the sale and marketing of our products, are subject to scrutiny under this law. For example, pharmaceutical companies have been prosecuted under the federal False Claims Act in connection with their alleged off-label promotion of drugs, purportedly concealing price concessions in the pricing information submitted to the government for government price reporting purposes, and allegedly providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal health care programs for the product. Penalties for a False Claims Act violation include three times the actual damages sustained by the government, plus mandatory civil penalties for each separate false claim, the potential for exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs, and, although the federal False Claims Act is a civil statute, conduct that results in a False Claims Act violation may also implicate various federal criminal statutes. In addition, private individuals have the ability to bring actions under the federal False Claims Act and certain states have enacted laws modeled after the federal False Claims Act. 
 Medical Devices 
 Through our subsidiary, Polymed, we currently market in-vitro diagnostic rapid test kits used in the performance of clinical laboratory tests (limited to drugs of abuse and pregnancy testing in the U.S.) pursuant to clearance under Section 510(k) of the FDCA by the FDA. These products and our operations are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA and other federal and state authorities in the United States, as well as comparable authorities in foreign jurisdictions. Our test kits are subject to regulation as medical devices in the United States under the FDCA, and related regulations enforced by the FDA. The FDA regulates, among other things, the development, design, non-clinical and clinical research, manufacturing, safety, efficacy, labeling, packaging, storage, installation, servicing, recordkeeping, premarket clearance or approval, import, export, adverse event reporting, advertising, promotion, marketing and distribution of medical devices to ensure that medical devices distributed domestically are safe and effective for their intended uses and otherwise meet the requirements of the FDCA. 
 48

In addition, the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988, or CLIA, established quality standards for laboratory testing to ensure the accuracy, reliability and timeliness of patient test results regardless of where the test was performed. Pursuant to CLIA, the FDA categorizes diagnostic tests into three categories based on their complexity in the testing process and risk of harm in reporting erroneous results: (1) waived tests, (2) moderate complexity tests, and (3) high complexity tests. Laboratories that perform only waived tests and hold a Certificate of Waiver under CLIA (including most physician office laboratories) are subject to minimal regulation as compared with laboratories that perform moderate or high complexity tests. To obtain a CLIA waived categorization for diagnostic tests that are intended for home use or for use by laboratories holding a Certificate of Waiver, we must demonstrate to FDA that the tests are simple to use with a low risk of error. Foreign countries may require similar or more onerous approvals to manufacture or market our products or to allow the use of our products in certain settings. Most of our test strips are categorized as CLIA waived, but some of our test strips are categorized as moderate in complexity. 
 FDA Premarket Clearance and Approval Requirements 
 Unless an exemption applies, each medical device commercially distributed in the United States requires either FDA clearance of a 510(k) premarket notification submission, granting of a de novo classification request, or approval of a premarket approval application, or PMA. Under the FDCA, medical devices are classified into one of three classes—Class I, Class II or Class III—depending on the degree of risk associated with each medical device. Class I includes devices with the lowest risk to the patient and are subject to the FDA’s general controls for medical devices, which include compliance with the applicable portions of the Quality System Regulation, or QSR, facility registration and product listing, reporting of adverse medical events, and truthful and non-misleading labeling, advertising, and promotional materials. Class II devices are subject to the FDA’s general controls, and special controls as deemed necessary by the FDA to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the device. These special controls can include performance standards, post-market surveillance, patient registries and FDA guidance documents. 
 Most Class I devices are exempt from the 510(k) requirements. Manufacturers of most Class II devices are required to submit to the FDA a premarket notification under Section 510(k) of the FDCA requesting permission to commercially distribute the device. The FDA’s permission to commercially distribute a device subject to a 510(k) premarket notification is generally known as 510(k) clearance. Devices deemed by the FDA to pose the greatest risks, such as life sustaining, life supporting or some implantable devices, or devices that have a new intended use, or use advanced technology that is not substantially equivalent to that of a legally marketed device, are placed in Class III, requiring approval of a PMA. Our currently marketed products are Class II devices subject to 510(k) clearance. 
 510(k) Marketing Clearance and De Novo Pathways 
 To obtain 510(k) clearance, a premarket notification submission must be submitted to the FDA demonstrating that the proposed device is “substantially equivalent” to a predicate device. A predicate device is a legally marketed device that is not subject to premarket approval, i.e., a device that was legally marketed prior to May 28, 1976 (pre-amendments device) and for which a PMA is not required, a device that has been reclassified from Class III to Class II or I, or a device that was found substantially equivalent another device cleared through the 510(k) process. The FDA’s 510(k) review process usually takes from three to six months, but may take longer. The FDA may require additional information, including clinical data, to make a determination regarding substantial equivalence. 
 If the FDA agrees that the device is substantially equivalent to a predicate device, it will grant 510(k) clearance to market the device. If the FDA determines that the device is “not substantially equivalent” to a previously cleared device, the device is automatically designated as a Class III device. The device sponsor must then fulfill more rigorous PMA requirements, or can request a risk-based classification determination for the device in accordance with the “de novo” process, which may determine that the new device is of low to moderate risk and that it can be appropriately be regulated as a Class I or II device. If a de novo request is granted, the device may be legally marketed and a new classification is established. If the device is classified as Class II, the device may serve as a predicate for future 510(k) submissions. 
PMA Approval Pathway 
 Class III devices require PMA approval before they can be marketed. The PMA process is more demanding than the 510(k) process. In a PMA the manufacturer must demonstrate that the device is safe and effective, and the PMA must be supported by extensive data, including data from preclinical studies and human clinical trials. The FDA will approve the new device for commercial distribution if it determines that the data and information in the PMA constitute valid scientific evidence and that there is reasonable assurance that the device is safe and effective for its intended use(s). The FDA may approve a PMA with post-approval conditions intended to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the device, including, among other things, restrictions on labeling, promotion, sale and distribution, and collection of long-term follow-up data from patients in the clinical trial that supported PMA approval or requirements to conduct additional clinical trials post-approval. Failure to comply with the conditions of approval can result in material adverse enforcement action, including withdrawal of the approval.

Our products are not currently subject to PMA requirements. However, we may in the future develop devices that will require the submission of a PMA, or FDA may find that some of our proposed uses are not substantially equivalent to previously cleared and marketed devices, and thus a PMA is required. 
 Clinical Trials 
 Clinical trials are almost always required to support a PMA and are sometimes required to support a 510(k) submission. All clinical investigations of devices to determine safety and effectiveness must be conducted in accordance with the FDA’s investigational device exemption, or IDE, regulations which govern investigational device labeling, prohibit promotion of the investigational device, and specify an array of recordkeeping, reporting and monitoring responsibilities of study sponsors and study investigators. If the device presents a “significant risk,” to human health, as defined by the FDA, the FDA requires the device sponsor to submit an IDE application to the FDA, which must be approved prior to commencing human clinical trials. A significant risk device is one that presents a potential for serious risk to the health, safety or welfare of a patient and either is implanted, used in supporting or sustaining human life, substantially important in diagnosing, curing, mitigating or treating disease or otherwise preventing impairment of human health, or otherwise presents a potential for serious risk to a subject. An IDE application must be supported by appropriate data, such as animal and laboratory test results, showing that it is safe to test the device in humans and that the testing protocol is scientifically sound. The IDE will automatically become effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA unless the FDA notifies us that the investigation may not begin. If the FDA determines that there are deficiencies or other concerns with an IDE for which it requires modification, the FDA may permit a clinical trial to proceed under a conditional approval. 
 During a clinical trial, the sponsor is required to comply with applicable FDA requirements, and the clinical investigators are also subject to FDA’s regulations. Both must comply with GCPs, which among other things require that informed consent be obtained from each research subject, that the investigational plan and study protocol be followed, that the disposition of the investigational device be controlled, and that reporting and recordkeeping requirements are followed. Additionally, after a trial begins, we, the FDA or the IRB could suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time for various reasons, including a belief that the risks to study subjects outweigh the anticipated benefits. Even if a clinical trial is completed, there can be no assurance that the data generated during a clinical trial will meet the safety and effectiveness endpoints or otherwise produce results that will lead the FDA to grant marketing clearance or approval. 
 Post-Market Regulation 
 After a device is cleared or approved for marketing, numerous and pervasive regulatory requirements continue to apply. These include: 
  
• | establishment registration and device listing with the FDA;
--+------------------------------------------------------------


• | Quality System Regulation, or QSR, requirements, which require manufacturers, including third-party manufacturers, to follow stringent design, testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures during all aspects of the design and manufacturing process;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | labeling regulations and requirements related to promotional activities, including FDA prohibitions against the promotion of investigational products, or ”off-label” uses of cleared or approved products;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | clearance or approval of product modifications to 510(k)-cleared devices that could significantly affect safety or effectiveness or that would constitute a major change in intended use of one of our cleared devices;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | medical device reporting requirements, which require that a manufacturer report to the FDA if a device it markets may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury, or has malfunctioned and the device or a similar device that it markets would be likely to cause or contribute to a death or serious injury, if the malfunction were to recur;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | correction, removal and recall reporting regulations, which require that manufacturers report to the FDA field corrections and product recalls or removals if undertaken to reduce a risk to health posed by the device or to remedy a violation of the FDCA that may present a risk to health;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the FDA’s mandatory recall authority, whereby the agency can order device manufacturers to recall from the market a product that is in violation of governing laws and regulations; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | post-market surveillance activities and regulations, which apply when deemed by the FDA to be necessary to protect the public health or to provide additional safety and effectiveness data for the device.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our manufacturing processes are required to comply with the applicable portions of the QSR, which cover the methods and the facilities and controls for the design, manufacture, testing, production, processes, controls, quality assurance, labeling, packaging, distribution, installation and servicing of finished devices intended for human use. The QSR also requires, among other things, maintenance of a device master file, device history file, and complaint files. As a manufacturer, we and our third-party manufacturers are subject to periodic scheduled or unscheduled inspections by the FDA. Our failure to maintain compliance with the QSR requirements could result in the shut-down of, or restrictions on, our manufacturing operations and the recall or seizure of our product. The discovery of previously unknown problems with our product, including unanticipated adverse events or adverse events of increasing severity or frequency, whether resulting from the use of the device within the scope of its clearance or off-label by a physician in the practice of medicine, could result in restrictions on the device, including the removal of the product from the market or voluntary or mandatory device recalls. 
 New Legislation and Regulations 
 From time to time, legislation is drafted, introduced and passed in Congress that could significantly change the statutory provisions governing the testing, approval, manufacturing, marketing, coverage and reimbursement of products regulated by the FDA or other government agencies. In addition to new legislation, FDA and healthcare fraud and abuse and coverage and reimbursement regulations and policies are often revised or interpreted by the agency in ways that may significantly affect our business and our products. In particular, we expect that the current presidential administration and U.S. Congress will continue to seek to modify, repeal, or otherwise invalidate all, or certain provisions of, the ACA. Most recently, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was enacted, which, among other things, removes penalties for not complying with the individual mandate to carry health insurance. There is still uncertainty with respect to the impact President Trump’s administration and the U.S. Congress may have, if any, and any changes will likely take time to unfold. Such reforms could have an adverse effect on anticipated revenues from therapeutic candidates that we may successfully develop and for which we may obtain regulatory approval and may affect our overall financial condition and ability to develop therapeutic candidates. However, we cannot predict the ultimate content, timing or effect of any healthcare reform legislation or the impact of potential legislation on us. 
 Furthermore, in the U.S., the health care industry is subject to political, economic, and regulatory influences. Initiatives to reduce the federal budget and debt and to reform health care coverage are increasing cost-containment efforts. We anticipate that federal agencies, Congress, state legislatures, and the private sector will continue to review and assess alternative health care benefits, controls on health care spending, and other fundamental changes to the healthcare delivery system. Any proposed or actual changes could limit coverage for or the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for health care products and services, which could also result in reduced demand for our products or additional pricing pressures, and limit or eliminate our spending on development projects and affect our ultimate profitability. We are not able to predict whether further legislative changes will be enacted or whether FDA or healthcare fraud and abuse or coverage and reimbursement regulations, guidance, policies or interpretations will be changed or what the effect of such changes, if any, may be. 
 Foreign Corrupt Practices Act 
 The FCPA prohibits any U.S. individual or business from corruptly offering, paying, promising, or authorizing the provision of anything of value, directly or indirectly, to any foreign official, foreign political party or official thereof, or candidate for foreign political office to obtain or retain business. The FCPA also obligates companies whose securities are listed in the United States to comply with accounting provisions requiring the issuer to maintain books and records that accurately and fairly reflect all transactions of the issuer and its controlled subsidiaries, and to devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls. 
Environment 
 We are subject to inspections by the FDA for compliance with cGMP and other U.S. regulatory requirements, including U.S. federal, state and local regulations regarding environmental protection and hazardous and controlled substance controls, among others. Environmental laws and regulations are complex, change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time. We have incurred, and may continue to incur, significant expenditures to ensure we are in compliance with these laws and regulations. We would be subject to significant penalties for failure to comply with these laws and regulations. 
PRC Government Regulation 
 In the PRC, we operate in an increasingly complex legal and regulatory environment. We are subject to a variety of PRC laws, rules and regulations affecting many aspects of our business. This section summarizes the principal PRC laws, rules and regulations relevant to our business and operations.

Foreign Investment in Pharmaceutical Industry 
 The Foreign Investment Industrial Guidance Catalogue (2015 Version), or the Foreign Investment Catalogue jointly promulgated by the National Development and Reform Commission, or NDRC, and the Ministry of Commerce, or MOFCOM, in March 2015 and effective in April 2015 and replaced the previous versions. The Foreign Investment Catalogue divides foreign investments in the pharmaceutical industry into four categories: encouraged, permitted, restricted or prohibited. In September 2016, the National People’s Congress Standing Committee adopted a decision on amending the law of foreign invested companies which became effective from October 1, 2016. Upon the effectiveness of the decision, the establishment of the foreign invested enterprise and its subsequent changes will be required to be filed with the relevant authorities instead of obtaining approvals from relevant commerce authorities, except for the foreign invested enterprises which are subject to the special administrative measures regarding foreign investment entry. In October 2016, NDRC and MOFCOM jointly issued a notice according to which the industries falling within the categories in which foreign investment is prohibited or restricted and those falling within the encouraged category subject to relevant requirements of equity or senior management under the Foreign Investment Catalogue, will be subject to the special administrative measures for foreign investment entry. 
General Regulations on China Food and Drug Administration 
 In the PRC, the CFDA monitors and supervises the administration of pharmaceutical products, as well as medical devices and equipment. The CFDA’s primary responsibility includes evaluating, registering and approving new drugs, generic drugs, imported drugs and traditional Chinese medicines; approving and issuing permits for the manufacture, export and import of pharmaceutical products and medical appliances; approving the establishment of enterprises for pharmaceutical manufacture and distribution; formulating administrative rules and policies concerning the supervision and administration of food, cosmetics and pharmaceuticals; and handling significant accidents involving these products. The local provincial drug administrative authorities are responsible for supervision and administration of drugs within their respective administrative regions. 
 The PRC Drug Administration Law promulgated by the Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress in 1984 and the Implementing Measures of the PRC Drug Administration Law promulgated by the Ministry of Health, or the MOH, in 1989 set forth the legal framework for the administration of pharmaceutical products, including the research, development and manufacturing of drugs. 
 The PRC Drug Administration Law was revised in February 2001, December 2013, and again in April 2015 respectively. The purpose of the revisions was to strengthen the supervision and administration of pharmaceutical products and to ensure the quality and safety of those products for human use. The revised PRC Drug Administration Law applies to entities and individuals engaged in the development, production, trade, application, supervision and administration of pharmaceutical products. It regulates and prescribes a framework for the administration of pharmaceutical preparations of medical institutions and for the development, research, manufacturing, distribution, packaging, pricing and advertisement of pharmaceutical products. Revised Implementing Measures of the PRC Drug Administration Law promulgated by the State Council took effect in September 2002 and was revised in February 2016, providing detailed implementing regulations for the revised PRC Drug Administration Law. 
 Under these regulations, we need to follow related regulations for preclinical research, clinical trials and production of new drugs. 
 Good Laboratories Practice Certification for Preclinical Research 
 To improve the quality of preclinical research, the CFDA promulgated the Administrative Measures for Good Laboratories Practice of Preclinical Laboratory in 2003 and began to conduct the certification program of GLP. Under the Certifying Measures for Clinical Test Units, or CFDA Circular 44, promulgated in February 2004, the CFDA decides whether an institution is qualified for undertaking pharmaceutical preclinical research upon the evaluation of the institution’s organizational administration, its research personnel, its equipment and facilities and its operation and management of preclinical pharmaceutical projects. If all requirements are met, a GLP Certification will be issued by the CFDA and the result will be published on the CFDA’s website. 
Approval for Clinical Trials and Production of New Drugs 
 According to the Provisions for Drug Registration promulgated by the CFDA in 2007, the PRC Drug Administration Law, the Provisions on the Administration of Special Examination and Approval of Registration of New Drugs, or the Special Examination and Approval Provisions issued by the CFDA in 2009, and the Circular on Information Publish Platform for Pharmaceutical Clinical Trials issued by the CFDA in 2013, we must comply with the following procedures and obtain several approvals for clinical trials and production of new drugs. 
 52

Clinical Trial Application 
 Upon completion of its preclinical research, a research institution must apply for approval of a Clinical Trial Application before conducting clinical trials. 
 Domestic Category 1 New Drugs Are Eligible for Special Examination and Approval 
 According to the Provisions for Drug Registration, drug registration applications are divided into three different types, namely Domestic New Drug Application, Domestic Generic Drug Application, and Imported Drug Application. Drugs fall into one of three categories, namely chemical medicine, biological product, or traditional Chinese or natural medicine. The registrations of chemical medicines are divided into six categories, among which, a Category 1 drug is a new drug that has never been marketed in any country. All of our clinical-stage drug candidates qualify as domestic Category 1 new drugs. 
 In March 2016, the CFDA promulgated the Work Plan for Reforming the Chemical Medicines Registration Classification System, under which, the registrations of chemical medicines are divided into five categories as follows: 
 Category 1: Innovative drugs that are not marketed both domestically and abroad. These drugs contain new compounds with clear structures and pharmacological effects and they have clinical value. 
 Category 2: Modified new drugs that are not marketed both domestically and abroad. With known active components, the drug’s structure, phase, prescription manufacturing process, administration route and indication are optimized and it has obvious clinical advantage. 
 Category 3: The drugs that are imitated by domestic applicants to original drugs that have been marketed abroad but not domestically. These kinds of drugs are supposed to have the same quality and effects with original drugs. Original drugs are the foremost drugs that are approved to be marketed domestically and /or abroad with complete and full safety and validity data as marketing evidence. 
 Category 4: The drugs that are imitated by domestic applicants to original drugs that have been marketed domestically. These kinds of drugs are supposed to have the same quality and effects with original drugs. 
 Category 5: The drugs that have been marketed abroad are applied to be marketed domestically. 
 The registration of Category 1 or Category 2 drugs above will be subject to the requirements of Domestic New Drug Application under the Provisions for Drug Registration, Domestic Generic Drug Application will be applicable to Category 3 or Category 4 drugs registration, and Imported Drug Application will be applicable to Category 5 drugs registration. The applicants whose registration applications for chemical medicines have been accepted by the CFDA before the date of promulgation of the Work Plan for Reforming the Chemical Medicines Registration Classification System can choose to continue the applications process according to the Provisions for Drug Registration or to comply with the new categories under the Work Plan for Reforming the Chemical Medicines Registration Classification System 
 According to the Special Examination and Approval Provisions, the CFDA conducts special examination and approval for new drugs registration application when: 
  
(1) | active ingredients and their preparations extracted from plants, animals and minerals, and newly discovered medical materials and their preparations have not been marketed in China;
----+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(2) | the chemical raw material medicines as well as the preparations and biological products thereof haven’t been approved for marketing home and abroad;
----+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(3) | the new drugs are for treating AIDS, malignant tumors and rare diseases, etc., and have obvious advantages in clinic treatment; or
----+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(4) | the new drugs are for treating diseases with no effective methods of treatment.
----+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The Special Examination and Approval Provisions provide that the applicant may file for special examination and approval at the stage of Clinical Trial Application if the drug candidate falls within items (1) or (2), and for drug candidates that fall within items (3) or (4), the application for special examination and approval must be made when filing for production. 
 53

The registration of Category 1 or Category 2 drugs above will be subject to the requirements of Domestic New Drug Application under the Provisions for Drug Registration, Domestic Generic Drug Application will be applicable to Category 3 or Category 4 drugs registration, and Imported Drug Application will be applicable to Category 5 drugs registration. The applicants whose registration applications for chemical medicines have been accepted by the CFDA before the date of promulgation of the Reform Plan Regarding the Category of the Registration of Chemical Medicines can choose to continue the applications process according to the Provisions for Drug Registration or to comply with the new categories under the Reform Plan Regarding the Category of the Registration of Chemical Medicines. 
 We believe that certain of our products fall within items (2) and (3) above. Therefore, we may file an application for special examination and approval at the Clinical Trial Application stage, which may enable us to pursue a more expedited path to approval in China and bring therapies to patients more quickly. 
 The Advantages of Category 1 New Drugs over Category 5 Drugs 
 Under the Provisions for Drug Registration and the Work Plan for Reforming the Chemical Medicines Registration Classification System, Category 5 drugs are drugs which have already been marketed abroad by multinational companies, but are not yet approved in China and Category 5 drug registration will be subject to the requirements of the Imported Drug Application. Compared with the application for Category 5 drugs, the application for Category 1 domestic new drugs has a more straight-forward registration pathway. According to the Special Examination and Approval Provisions, where a special examination and approval treatment is granted, the application for clinical trial and manufacturing will be handled with priority and with enhanced communication with the Center for Drug Evaluation of the CFDA, or the CDE, which will establish a working mechanism for communicating with the applicants. If it becomes necessary to revise the clinical trial scheme or make other major alterations during the clinical trial, the applicant may file an application for communication. When an application for communication is approved, the CDE will arrange the communication with the applicant within one month. 
 In comparison, according to the Provisions for Drug Registration, the registration pathway for Category 5 drugs is complicated and evolving. Category 5 drug applications may be submitted after a company obtains an NDA approval and receive the CPP granted by a major regulatory authority, such as the FDA or the EMA. Multinational companies may need to apply for conducting MRCTs, which means that companies do not have the flexibility to design the clinical trials to fit the Chinese patients and standard-of-care. Category 5 drug candidates may not qualify to benefit from fast track review with priority at the Clinical Trial Application stage. Moreover, a requirement to further conduct local clinical trials can potentially delay market access by several years from its international NDA approval. 
 Adjustment on the Administration of Imported Drug Registration 
 On October 10, 2017, the CFDA promulgated the Decision on Adjusting Relevant Matters Concerning the Administration of Imported Drug Registration, effective as of the date of its promulgation, which stipulates that, among others, (1) simultaneous research and application are allowed, meaning that, in the case of a clinical trial concerning a drug subject thereto to be conducted at an international multi-center clinical trial (“IMCCT”) in the PRC, Phase 1 clinical trials of the drug are allowed simultaneously, and the requirement that the drug subject to the clinical trial need to have been previously registered overseas or to have entered a Phase 2 or Phase 3 clinical trial shall not apply, except for preventative biological products; (2) the drug registration procedure is to be optimized, meaning that, upon the completion of a clinical trial at an IMCCT in the PRC, an applicant may directly file a drug registration application; and (3) for a new chemical drug or an innovative therapeutic biological drug for which a clinical trial or market registration is made, in each case as an imported drug, the requirement that such drug has received an overseas license issued by the country or region where the drug’s overseas pharmaceutical manufacturer is located shall not apply. 
 Changes to the Review and Approval Process 
 In August 2015, the State Council issued a statement, Opinions on Reforming the Review and Approval Process for Pharmaceutical Products and Medical Devices, which contained several potential policy changes that could benefit the pharmaceutical industry: 
  
• | A plan to accelerate innovative drug approval with a special review and approval process, with a focus on areas of high unmet medical needs, including drugs for HIV, cancer, serious infectious diseases, orphan diseases and drugs on national priority lists.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | A plan to adopt a policy which would allow companies to act as the marketing authorization holder and to hire contract manufacturing organizations to produce drug products.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 54

 
• | A plan to improve the review and approval of clinical trials, and to allow companies to conduct clinical trials at the same time as they are in other countries and encourage local clinical trial organizations to participate in international multi-center clinical trials.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 In November 2015, the CFDA released the Circular Concerning Several Policies on Drug Registration Review and Approval, which further clarified the following policies potentially simplifying and accelerating the approval process of clinical trials: 
  
• | A one-time umbrella approval procedure allowing approval of all phases of a new drug’s clinical trials at once, rather than the current phase-by-phase approval procedure, will be adopted for new drugs’ clinical trial applications.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | A fast track drug registration or clinical trial approval pathway will be available for the following applications: (1) registration of innovative new drugs treating HIV, cancer, serious infectious diseases and orphan diseases; (2) registration of pediatric drugs; (3) registration of geriatric drugs and drugs treating China-prevalent diseases; (4) registration of drugs sponsored by national science and technology grants; (5) registration of innovative drugs using advanced technology, using innovative treatment methods, or having distinctive clinical benefits; (6) registration of foreign innovative drugs to be manufactured locally in China; (7) concurrent applications for new drug clinical trials which are already approved in the U.S. or European Union, or concurrent drug registration applications for drugs which have applied for marketing authorization and passed onsite inspections in the U.S. or European Union and are manufactured using the same production line in China; and (8) clinical trial applications for drugs with urgent clinical need and patent expiry within three years, and marketing authorization applications for drugs with urgent clinical need and patent expiry within one year.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 In March 2016, the CFDA issued the Interim Provisions on the Procedures for Drug Clinical Trial Data Verification that provides procedural rules for CFDA’s on-site verification of clinical data before drug approvals. 
 Also in February 2016, the CFDA published the Opinions on Implementing a Prioritized Review System to Avoid Drug Review Backlogs, which introduces a prioritized review and approval pathway to clinical trial applications and registration applications of certain drugs as part of CFDA’s ongoing reform of its current drug review and approval system. 
 The CFDA issued the Procedures for Priority Examination and Approval of Medical Devices, or the Procedures on October 25, 2016, which shall come into effect on January 1, 2017. The Procedures, composed of 17 articles, specify that the priority in examination and approval shall be given, in relation to the applications of registering Class-III domestic, or Class-II and Class-III imported medical devices, when those applications fall within such categories as diagnosis or treatment of rare disease or malignant tumor with significant clinical advantage. According to the Procedures, the medical device technical evaluation center of the CFDA will tentatively decide on the applicants applying for their project given priority examination and approval, names of their products and the reception numbers and disclose such information on its website for a period of no less than five working days. The Procedures provide that for projects given priority in examination and approval, the medical device technical evaluation center shall communicate with applicants in an active way as required by applicable provisions in the course of evaluating relevant technologies, and may arrange for special talks when necessary; food and drug administrative departments at provincial level shall take the review of the registered quality management system of medical devices as priority; and the CFDA will prioritize their administrative examination and approval. 
 PRC Enterprise Income Tax Law and Its Implementation 
 The PRC Enterprise Income Tax Law, or EIT Law, and its implementation rules provide that from January 1, 2008, a uniform income tax rate of 25% is applied equally to domestic enterprises as well as foreign investment enterprises, and permit certain High and New Technologies Enterprises, or HNTEs, to enjoy preferential enterprise income tax rates subject to these HNTEs meeting certain qualification criteria. 
 The EIT Law and its implementation rules provide that a withholding tax at the rate of 10% is applicable to dividends and other distributions payable by a PRC resident enterprise to investors who are “non-resident enterprises” (that do not have an establishment or place of business in the PRC, or that have such establishment or place of business but the relevant dividend or other distribution is not effectively connected with the establishment or place of business). However, pursuant to the Arrangement between the Mainland and Hong Kong Special Administrative Region for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with respect to Taxes on Income effective on December 8, 2006, the withholding tax rate for dividends paid by a PRC resident enterprise is 5% if the Hong Kong enterprise owns at least 25% of the capital of the PRC enterprise; otherwise, the dividend withholding tax rate is 10%. According to the Notice of the PRC State Administration of Taxation on Issues relating to the Administration of the Dividend Provision in Tax Treaties promulgated on February 20, 2009 and effective on the same day, the corporate recipient of dividends distributed by PRC enterprises must satisfy the direct ownership thresholds at all times during the 12 consecutive months preceding the receipt of the dividends. The PRC State Administration of Taxation issued the Notice on How to Understand and Identify the Owner of Benefits in the PRC-HK Tax Agreement on October 27, 2009. Pursuant to these regulations and the Administrative 
 55

Measures for Tax Treaty Treatment for Non-Resident Taxpayers promulgated by the PRC State Administration of Taxation in August, 2015, non-resident enterprises are required to file information sheets to the competent tax authorities in order to enjoy the favorable treatments under the treaties. However, the relevant tax authorities may check and verify at their discretion, and if a company is deemed to be a pass-through entity rather than a qualified owner of benefits, it cannot enjoy the favorable tax treatments provided in the tax arrangement. In addition, if transactions or arrangements are deemed by the relevant tax authorities to be entered into mainly for the purpose of enjoying favorable tax treatments under the tax arrangement, such favorable tax treatments may be subject to adjustment by the relevant tax authorities in the future. 
 On July 27, 2011, the Ministry of Finance, the General Administration of Customs, and the State Administration of Taxation issued the Notice on the Relevant Tax Policies for the Implementation of the Strategy of Extensive Development of the Western Regions, under which from January 1, 2011 to December 31, 2020, a reduced enterprise income tax rate of 15% is applicable to the enterprises set up in the western regions as designated by the relevant PRC regulations with their main business in the encouraged industries. The encouraged industries are those listed in the Catalog of Encouraged Industries in the Western Regions as promulgated by NDRC. To qualify for the reduced tax rate, an enterprise must derive 70 percent or more of its revenue from the business listed in the Catalog of Encouraged Industries in the Western Regions. 
 Regulations Relating to Business Tax and Value-added Tax 
 Pursuant to the Temporary Regulations on Business Tax, which were promulgated by the State Council on December 13, 1993 and effective on January 1, 1994, as amended on November 10, 2008 and effective January 1, 2009, any entity or individual conducting business in a service industry is generally required to pay business tax at the rate of 5% on the revenues generated from providing such services. 
 In November 2011, the Ministry of Finance and the State Administration of Taxation, or SAT, promulgated the Pilot Plan for Imposition of Value-Added Tax to Replace Business Tax, or the Pilot Plan. Since January 2012, the SAT has been implementing the Pilot Plan, which imposes value-added tax, or VAT, in lieu of business tax for certain industries in Shanghai. The Pilot Plan was expanded to other regions, including Beijing, in September 2012, and was further expanded nationwide beginning August 1, 2013. VAT is applicable at a rate of 6% in lieu of business taxes for certain services and 17% for the sale of goods and provision of tangible property lease services. VAT payable on goods sold or taxable services provided by a general VAT taxpayer for a taxable period is the net balance of the output VAT for the period after crediting the input VAT for the period. In March 2016, the Ministry of Finance and SAT jointly issued the Notice on Adjustment of Transfer Business Tax to Value Added Tax effective from May 2016, according to which PRC tax authorities have started imposing VAT on revenues from various service sectors, including real estate, construction, financial services and insurance, as well as other lifestyle service sectors, replacing the business tax. 
 Four Phases of Clinical Trials 
 A clinical development program consists of Phases 1, 2, 3 and 4. Phase 1 refers to the initial clinical pharmacology and safety evaluation studies in humans. Phase 2 refers to the preliminary evaluation of a drug candidate’s therapeutic effectiveness and safety for particular indication(s) in patients, provide evidence and support for the design of Phase 3 clinical trial, and settle the administrative dose regimen. Phase 3 refers to clinical trials undertaken to confirm the therapeutic effectiveness of a drug. Phase 3 is used to further verify the drug’s therapeutic effectiveness and safety on patients with target indication(s), to evaluate overall benefit-risk relationships of the drug, and ultimately to provide sufficient evidence for the review of drug registration application. Phase 4 refers to a new drug’s post-marketing study to assess therapeutic effectiveness and adverse reactions when the drug is widely used, to evaluate overall benefit-risk relationships of the drug when used among general population or specific groups, and to adjust the administration dose, etc. 
New Drug Application 
 When Phase 1, 2 and 3 of the clinical trials have been completed, the applicant must apply to the CFDA for approval of a new drug application. The CFDA then determines whether to approve the application according to the comprehensive evaluation opinion provided by the CDE of the CFDA. We must obtain approval of a new drug application before our drugs can be manufactured and sold in the PRC market. 
Good Manufacturing Practice 
 All facilities and techniques used in the manufacture of products for clinical use or for sale in the PRC must be operated in conformity with cGMP guidelines as established by the CFDA. Failure to comply with applicable requirements could result in the termination of manufacturing and significant fines. 
 56

Animal Test Permits 
 According to Regulations for the Administration of Affairs Concerning Experimental Animals promulgated by the State Science and Technology Commission in November 1988, as revised in January 2011 and July 2013, and Administrative Measures on the Certificate for Animal Experimentation promulgated by the State Science and Technology Commission and other regulatory authorities in January 2001, performing experimentation on animals requires a Certificate for Use of Laboratory Animals. Applicants must satisfy the following conditions: 

• | Laboratory animals must be qualified and sourced from institutions that have Certificates for Production of Laboratory Animals;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The environment and facilities for the animals’ living and propagating must meet state requirements;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The animals’ feed and water must meet state requirements;
--+----------------------------------------------------------


• | The animals’ feeding and experimentation must be conducted by professionals, specialized and skilled workers, or other trained personnel;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The management systems must be effective and efficient; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------


• | The applicable entity must follow other requirements as stipulated by the PRC laws and regulations.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We obtained a Certificate for Use of Laboratory Animals in 2012 regarding the scope of rats and mice. 
 Regulations Relating to Intellectual Property Rights 
 Patent 
 Pursuant to the Patent Law of the PRC and its implementation rules, patents in the PRC fall into three categories, namely invention patent, utility model and design patent. Invention patent refers to a new technical solution proposed in respect of a product, method or its improvement; utility model refers to a new technical solution that is practicable for application and proposed in respect of the shape, structure or a combination of both of a product; and design patent refers to the new design of a certain product in shape, pattern or a combination of both and in color, shape and pattern combinations aesthetically suitable for industrial application. Under the Patent Law of the PRC, the term of patent protection starts from the date the patent was filed. Patents relating to inventions are effective for twenty years from the initial date the patent application was filed, and the term for utility model and designed patents is ten years from the initial date the patent application was filed. The Patent Law of the PRC adopts the principle of “first to file,” which means where more than one person files a patent application for the same invention, a patent will be granted to the person who first filed the application. 
 Existing patents can become invalid or unenforceable due to a number of factors, including known or unknown prior art, deficiencies in patent application and lack of novelty in technology. In the PRC, a patent must have novelty, innovation and practical application. Under the Patent Law of PRC, novelty means that before a patent application is filed, no identical invention or utility model has been publicly disclosed in any publication in the PRC or abroad or has been publicly used or made known to the public by any other means, whether in or outside of China, nor has any other person filed with the patent authority an application that describes an identical invention or utility model and is published after the filing date. Patents in the PRC are filed with the State Intellectual Property Office, or SIPO. Normally, the SIPO publishes an application for a pharmaceutical invention 18 months after the application is filed, which may be shortened upon request by the applicant. The applicant must apply to the SIPO for a substantive examination within three years from the date the application is filed. 
 Article 20 of the Patent Law of the PRC provides that, for an invention or utility model completed in China, any applicant (not just Chinese companies and individuals), before filing a patent application outside of China, must first submit it to the SIPO for a confidential examination. Failure to comply with this requirement will result in the denial of any Chinese patent for the subject invention. This added requirement of confidential examination by the SIPO has raised concerns by foreign companies who conduct research and development activities in the PRC or outsource research and development activities to service providers in the PRC. 
 Patent Enforcement 
 Unauthorized use of patents without consent from owners of patents, forgery of the patents belonging to other persons, or engagement in other infringement acts against patent rights, will subject the infringers to tortious liabilities. Serious offences may be subject to criminal penalties.

When a dispute arises as a result of infringement of the patent owner’s patent right, PRC law requires that the parties first attempt to settle the dispute through consultation between them. However, if the dispute cannot be settled through consultation, the patent owner, or an interested party who believes the patent is being infringed, may either file a civil legal suit or file an administrative complaint with the relevant patent administration authority under the SIPO. A PRC court may issue a preliminary injunction upon the patent owner’s or an interested party’s request before instituting any legal proceedings or during the proceedings. Damages for infringement are calculated as either the loss suffered by the patent holder arising from the infringement or the benefit gained by the infringer from the infringement. If it is difficult to ascertain damages in this manner, damages may be determined by using a reasonable multiple of the license fee under a contractual license. As in other jurisdictions, with one notable exception, the patent owner in the PRC has the burden of proving that the patent is being infringed. However, if the owner of a manufacturing process patent alleges infringement of its patent, the alleged infringer has the burden of proving that it has not infringed. To our knowledge, there are no disputes as to our infringement of any third party’s patent. 
 Medical Patent Compulsory License 
 According to the Patent Law of the PRC, the SIPO may grant a compulsory license for manufacturing patented drugs and exporting them to countries or regions covered under relevant international treaties to which the People’s Republic of China has acceded. 
Exemptions for Unlicensed Manufacture, Use and Import of Patented Drugs 
 According to the Patent Law of the PRC, any person may manufacture, use or import patented drugs for the purpose of providing information required for administrative examination and approval without authorization granted by the patent owner. 
Trade Secrets 
 According to the Anti-Unfair Competition Law of the PRC, the term “trade secrets” refers to technical information and business information that is unknown to the public, that has utility and may create business interest or profit for its legal owners or holders, and that is maintained as a secret by its legal owners or holders. 
 Under this law, business persons are prohibited from employing the following methods to infringe trade secrets: (1) obtaining the trade secrets from the legal owners or holders by any unfair methods such as stealing, solicitation or coercion; (2) disclosing, using or permitting others to use the trade secrets obtained illegally under item (1) above; or (3) disclosing, using or permitting others to use the trade secrets, in violation of any contractual agreements or any requirements of the legal owners or holders to keep such trade secrets in confidence. If a third party knows or should have known of the above-mentioned illegal conduct but nevertheless obtains, uses or discloses trade secrets of others, the third party may be deemed to have committed a misappropriation of the others’ trade secrets. The parties whose trade secrets are being misappropriated may petition for administrative corrections, and regulatory authorities may stop any illegal activities and fine infringing parties in the amount of RMB 10,000—200,000. Alternatively, persons whose trade secrets are being misappropriated may file lawsuits in a PRC court for loss and damages caused by the misappropriation. 
 The measures to protect trade secrets include oral or written agreements or other reasonable measures to require the employees of, or persons in business contact with, legal owners or holders to keep trade secrets confidential. Once the legal owners or holders have asked others to keep trade secrets confidential and have adopted reasonable protection measures, the requested persons bear the responsibility for keeping the trade secrets confidential. 
 Recently Issued Policies on the Protection of Intellectual Property Rights 
 On November 4, 2016, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council jointly issued a Guideline on Improving the Property Rights Protection System and Providing Law-based Protection to Property Rights (the “Guideline”), effective on the date of its release. The Guideline proposes that the country will provide equal, comprehensive and law-based protection to all kinds of property rights and requires that the punishment of intellectual property rights violations should be strengthened and the limits on compensation for violating intellectual property rights laws should be increased. In addition, the Guideline proposes to explore the establishment of infringement punitive compensation system for such intellectual property rights as patent and copyright, including allowing for punitive damages for serious malicious tort. The Guideline also stipulates to perfect the foreign-related intellectual property rights enforcement mechanism, and strengthen the international cooperation in criminal case enforcement and investigation in foreign-related intellectual property crimes. On November 28, 2016, the Supreme People’s Court released the Implementation Opinions on Appropriately and Lawfully Handling Long-standing Historical Property Rights Cases and the Opinions on Giving Full Play to Judicial Functions to Enhance Judicial Protection of Property Rights (the “Opinions”), effective on the date of their releases. The Opinions stipulate that, among others, efforts shall be made to crack down on intellectual property rights infringement and crimes in accordance with relevant laws and regulations, provide stronger judicial protection to intellectual property rights, introduce judicial interpretations and guiding cases in due time, promote the lawful application of the punitive compensation system, and impose severer punishments on chain-type and industrialized crimes against intellectual property rights.

Regulations Relating to Environmental Protection 
 China has adopted extensive environmental laws and regulations with national and local standards for emissions control, discharge of waste water and storage and transportation, treatment and disposal of waste materials. At the national level, the relevant environmental protection laws and regulations include the PRC Environmental Protection Law, the PRC Law on the Prevention and Control of Air Pollution, the PRC Law on the Prevention and Control of Water Pollution, the PRC Law on the Promotion of Clean Production, the PRC Law on the Prevention and Control of Noise Pollution, the PRC Law on the Prevention and Control of Solid Waste Pollution, the PRC Recycling Economy Promotion Law, the PRC Law on Environmental Impact Assessment, the Administrative Regulations on the Levy and Use of Discharge Fees and the Measures for the Administration of the Charging Rates for Pollutant Discharge Fees. In recent years, the PRC Government has introduced a series of new policies designed to generally promote the protection of the environment. For instance, on November 10, 2016, the General Office of the State Council has released the Implementing Plan for the Permit System for Controlling the Discharge of Pollutants (the “Plan”). The Plan proposes the need of instituting a system for enterprises and public institutions to control their respective total amount of pollutants discharged, which shall be connected with the environmental impact assessment system organically. The Plan also stipulates that it is necessary to regulate the orderly issuance of pollutant discharge permits, to make a name list to manage the permission of pollutant discharge, to promote the administration of such permission system per industry, and to impose severer administration and control over enterprises and public institutions located at such places where environment quality fails to reach relevant standards. Furthermore, the Plan requires that a national pollutant discharge permit management information platform shall be established by 2017 to strengthen the information disclosure and social supervision. 
Regulations Relating to Foreign Exchange and Dividend Distribution 
 Foreign Exchange Regulation 
 The Foreign Exchange Administration Regulations, most recently amended in August 2008, are the principal regulations governing foreign currency exchange in China. Under the PRC foreign exchange regulations, payments of current account items, such as profit distributions and trade and service-related foreign exchange transactions, may be made in foreign currencies without prior approval from the State Administration of Foreign Exchange, or SAFE, by complying with certain procedural requirements. In contrast, approval from or registration with appropriate government authorities is required when Renminbi is to be converted into a foreign currency and remitted out of China to pay capital expenses such as the repayment of foreign currency-denominated loans. 
 In August 2008, SAFE issued the Circular on the Relevant Operating Issues Concerning the Improvement of the Administration of the Payment and Settlement of Foreign Currency Capital of Foreign-Invested Enterprises, or SAFE Circular 142, regulating the conversion by a foreign-invested enterprise of foreign currency-registered capital into Renminbi by restricting how the converted Renminbi may be used. In addition, SAFE promulgated Notice on Issues concerning Further Clarifying and Regulating the Foreign Exchange Administration under Some Capital Accounts, or Circular 45, on November 9, 2011 to clarify the application of SAFE Circular 142. Under SAFE Circular 142 and Circular 45, Renminbi capital converted from foreign currency registered capital of a foreign-invested enterprise may only be used for purposes within the business scope approved by the applicable government authority and may not be used for equity investments within the PRC. In addition, SAFE strengthened its oversight of the flow and use of the Renminbi capital converted from foreign currency registered capital of foreign-invested enterprises. The use of such Renminbi capital may not be changed without SAFE’s approval, and such Renminbi capital may not, in any case, be used to repay Renminbi loans whose proceeds were not used. Furthermore, SAFE promulgated Notice on Issues Concerning Strengthening Administration of Foreign Exchange Services in November 2010, which tightens the regulation over settlement of net proceeds from overseas offerings, such as our initial public offering, and requires, among other things, the authenticity of settlement of net proceeds from offshore offerings to be closely examined and the net proceeds to be settled in the manner described in our prospectus or otherwise approved by our board of directors. Violations of these SAFE regulations may result in severe monetary or other penalties, including confiscation of earnings derived from such violation activities, a fine of up to 30% of the RMB funds converted from the foreign invested funds or in the case of a severe violation, a fine ranging from 30% to 100% of the Renminbi funds converted from the foreign-invested funds.

In November 2012, SAFE promulgated the Circular of Further Improving and Adjusting Foreign Exchange Administration Policies on Foreign Direct Investment, which substantially amends and simplifies the current foreign exchange procedure. Pursuant to this circular, the opening of various special purpose foreign exchange accounts, such as pre-establishment expenses accounts, foreign exchange capital accounts and guarantee accounts, the reinvestment of Renminbi proceeds by foreign investors in the PRC, and remittance of foreign exchange profits and dividends by a foreign-invested enterprise to its foreign shareholders no longer require the approval or verification of SAFE, and multiple capital accounts for the same entity may be opened in different provinces, which was not previously possible. In addition, SAFE promulgated the Circular on Printing and Distributing the Provisions on Foreign Exchange Administration over Domestic Direct Investment by Foreign Investors and the Supporting Documents in May 2013, which specifies that the administration by the SAFE or its local branches over direct investment by foreign investors in the PRC will be conducted by way of registration, and banks must process foreign exchange business relating to the direct investment in the PRC based on the registration information provided by SAFE and its branches. 
 Under the Circular of the SAFE on Further Improving and Adjusting the Policies for Foreign Exchange Administration under Capital Accounts promulgated by the SAFE on January 10, 2014 and effective from February 10, 2014, administration over the outflow of the profits by domestic institutions has been further simplified. In principle, a bank is no longer required to examine transaction documents when handling the outflow of profits of no more than the equivalent of $50,000 by a domestic institution. When handling the outflow of profits exceeding the equivalent of $50,000, the bank, in principle, is no longer required to examine the financial audit report and capital verification report of the domestic institution, provided that it must examine, according to the principle of transaction authenticity, the profit distribution resolution of the board of directors (or the profit distribution resolution of the partners) relating to this profit outflow and the original copy of its tax record-filing form. After each profit outflow, the bank must affix its seal to and endorsements on the original copy of the relevant tax record-filing form to indicate the actual amount of the profit outflow and the date of the outflow. 
 On March 30, 2015, SAFE promulgated the Circular on Reforming the Management Approach regarding the Settlement of Foreign Exchange Capital of Foreign-invested Enterprises, or SAFE Circular 19, which became effective on June 1, 2015. According to SAFE Circular 19, the foreign exchange capital of foreign-invested enterprises may be settled on a discretionary basis, meaning that the foreign exchange capital in the capital account of a foreign-invested enterprise for which the rights and interests of monetary contribution has been confirmed by the local foreign exchange bureau (or the book-entry registration of monetary contribution by the banks) can be settled at the banks based on the actual operational needs of the foreign-invested enterprise. The proportion of such discretionary settlement is temporarily determined as 100%. The Renminbi converted from the foreign exchange capital will be kept in a designated account, and if a foreign-invested enterprise needs to make further payment from such account, it still must provide supporting documents and go through the review process with the banks. 
 Furthermore, SAFE Circular 19 stipulates that the use of capital by foreign-invested enterprises must adhere to the principles of authenticity and self-use within the business scope of enterprises. The capital of a foreign-invested enterprise and capital in RMB obtained by the foreign-invested enterprise from foreign exchange settlement must not be used for the following purposes: 
  
1. | directly or indirectly used for the payment beyond the business scope of the enterprises or the payment prohibited by relevant laws and regulations;
---+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


2. | directly or indirectly used for investment in securities, unless otherwise provided by relevant laws and regulations;
---+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


3. | directly or indirectly used for granting the entrusted loans in RMB, unless permitted by the scope of business, repaying the inter-enterprise borrowing (including advances by the third party), or repaying the bank loans in RMB that have been sub-lent to the third party; and/or
---+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


4. | paying the expenses related to the purchase of real estate that is not for self-use, except for the foreign-invested real estate enterprises.
---+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 On June 9, 2016, SAFE issued the Notice to Reform and Regulate the Administration Policies of Foreign Exchange Capital Settlement to further reform foreign exchange capital settlement nationwide. 
 Our PRC subsidiaries’ distributions to the offshore parent and carrying out cross-border foreign exchange activities shall comply with the various SAFE registration requirements described above. 
 Share Option Rules 
 Under the Administration Measures on Individual Foreign Exchange Control issued by the People’s Bank of China on December 25, 2006, all foreign exchange matters involved in employee share ownership plans and share option plans in which PRC citizens participate require approval from SAFE or its authorized branch. In addition, under the Notices on Issues concerning the Foreign Exchange Administration for Domestic Individuals Participating in Share Incentive Plans of Overseas Publicly-Listed Companies, commonly known as SAFE Circular 7, or Share Option Rules, issued by the SAFE on February 15, 2012, PRC residents 
 60

who are granted shares or share options by companies listed on overseas stock exchanges under share incentive plans are required to (1) register with the SAFE or its local branches; (2) retain a qualified PRC agent, which may be a PRC subsidiary of the overseas listed company or another qualified institution selected by the PRC subsidiary, to conduct the SAFE registration and other procedures with respect to the share incentive plans on behalf of the participants; and (3) retain an overseas institution to handle matters in connection with their exercise of share options, purchase and sale of shares or interests and funds transfers. We have made and will to continue to make efforts to comply with these requirements since the completion of our initial public offering in June 2017. 
 In addition, the State Administration of Taxation has issued certain circulars concerning employee share options or restricted shares, including the Circular of the State Administration of Taxation on Issues Concerning Individual Income Tax in Relation to Share Options, promulgated in August 2009. Under these circulars, the employees working in the PRC who exercise share options or are granted restricted shares will be subject to PRC individual income tax. The PRC subsidiaries of such overseas listed companies have obligations to file documents related to employee share options or restricted shares with relevant tax authorities and to withhold individual income taxes of those employees who exercise their share options. If the employees fail to pay or the PRC subsidiaries fail to withhold their income taxes in accordance with relevant laws and regulations, the PRC subsidiaries may face fines or sanctions imposed by tax authorities or other PRC government authorities. 
 Regulation of Dividend Distribution 
 The principal laws, rules and regulations governing dividend distribution by foreign-invested enterprises in the PRC are the Company Law of the PRC, as amended, the Wholly Foreign-owned Enterprise Law and its implementation regulations, the Cooperative Joint Venture Law and its implementation regulations and the Equity Joint Venture Law and its implementation regulations. Under these laws, rules and regulations, foreign-invested enterprises may pay dividends only out of their accumulated profit, if any, as determined in accordance with PRC accounting standards and regulations. Both PRC domestic companies and wholly-foreign owned PRC enterprises are required to allocate at least 10% of their respective accumulated after-tax profits each year, if any, to fund certain capital reserve funds until the aggregate amount of these reserve funds have reached 50% of the registered capital of the enterprises. A PRC company is not permitted to distribute any profits until any losses from prior fiscal years have been offset. Profits retained from prior fiscal years may be distributed together with distributable profits from the current fiscal year. 
Labor Laws and Social Insurance 
 Pursuant to the PRC Labor Law and the PRC Labor Contract Law, employers must execute written labor contracts with full-time employees. All employers must comply with local minimum wage standards. Violations of the PRC Labor Contract Law and the PRC Labor Law may result in the imposition of fines and other administrative and criminal liability in the case of serious violations. 
 In addition, according to the PRC Social Insurance Law, employers like our PRC subsidiaries in China must provide employees with welfare schemes covering pension insurance, unemployment insurance, maternity insurance, work-related injury insurance, medical insurance, and housing funds. 
 Rest of the World Regulation 
 For other countries outside of the United States and the PRC, the requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, drug licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. In all cases the clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with GCP requirements and the applicable regulatory requirements and the ethical principles having their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki. 
 If we fail to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements, we may be subject to, among other things, fines, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecution.
