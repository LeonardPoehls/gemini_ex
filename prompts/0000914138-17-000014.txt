ITEM 1. | BUSINESS

General
Middleburg Financial Corporation (the “Company”) is a bank holding company that was incorporated under Virginia law in 1993.  The Company conducts its primary operations through two wholly owned subsidiaries, Middleburg Bank and Middleburg Investment Group, Inc., both of which are chartered under Virginia law.  The Company has one other wholly owned subsidiary, MFC Capital Trust II, which is a Delaware Business Trust that the Company formed in connection with the issuance of trust preferred debt in December 2003. This trust is an unconsolidated subsidiary of the Company and its principal assets are $5.2 million of the Company's subordinated debt securities (referred to herein as "subordinated notes") that are reported as liabilities of the Company. 
Middleburg Bank has one wholly owned subsidiary, Middleburg Bank Service Corporation, incorporated under the laws of the Commonwealth of Virginia, which is a partner in two limited liability companies, Bankers Title Shenandoah, LLC, which sells title insurance through its members, and Bankers Insurance, LLC, which acts as a broker for insurance sales for its member banks. 
The Company operates in a decentralized manner in three principal business activities: (1) commercial and retail banking services through Middleburg Bank, (2) wealth management services through Middleburg Investment Group, Inc. and (3) mortgage banking services. The following general business discussion focuses on the activities within each of these segments. Refer to Note 22 "Segment Reporting", included in the Company's consolidated financial statements for additional discussion. 
Middleburg Bank and the Company have assets in custody with Middleburg Trust Company and accordingly pay Middleburg Trust Company a monthly fee.  Middleburg Bank also pays interest to Middleburg Trust Company on deposit accounts it has with Middleburg Bank.   
Merger between the Company and Access National Corporation ("Access")
On October 24, 2016, the Company and Access National Corporation (“Access”) announced a definitive agreement to combine in a strategic merger (the “Merger Agreement”) pursuant to which the Company will merge with and into Access (the “Merger”). Upon consummation of the Merger, the holders of shares of the Company's common stock will receive 1.3314 shares of Access common stock for each share of the Company's common stock held immediately prior to the effective date of the Merger. The transaction is expected to be completed in the second quarter of 2017, subject to approval of both companies' shareholders, regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions.

On May 15, 2014, Middleburg Financial Corporation, through its banking subsidiary, Middleburg Bank, sold all of its majority interest in Southern Trust Mortgage LLC, which originated and sold mortgages secured by personal residences primarily in the southeastern United States.
Prior to the date of sale, mortgage banking activities were conducted through a business arrangement with Southern Trust Mortgage whereby the Bank acted as an investor in purchasing loans originated by Southern Trust Mortgage. Subsequent to the sale date, mortgage banking activity for the Company is included with the results of the retail banking segment. 
Products and Services
The Company, through its subsidiaries, offers a wide range of banking, fiduciary and investment management services to both individuals and small businesses.  Middleburg Bank’s services include various types of checking and savings deposit accounts, and the origination of business, real estate, development, mortgage, home equity, automobile and other installment, demand and term loans.

Competition
The Company’s commercial and retail banking segment faces significant competition for both loans and deposits.  Competition for loans comes from commercial banks, savings and loan associations and savings banks, mortgage banking subsidiaries of regional commercial banks, subsidiaries of national mortgage bankers, insurance companies, and other institutional lenders.  Its most direct competition for deposits comes from commercial banks, credit unions, savings banks, savings and loan associations and other financial institutions. Based upon total deposits at June 30, 2016, as reported to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the “FDIC”), the Company had:

• | 13.19% of the nearly $6.1 billion in deposits in Loudoun County.


• | 1.24% of the nearly $5.0 billion in deposits in the Reston market.


• | 6.55% of the nearly $1.5 billion in deposits in Fauquier County.


• | 3.81% of the nearly $1.3 billion in deposits in James City County.


• | 0.52% of the nearly $4.3 billion in deposits in Prince William County.


• | 0.09% of the nearly $19.2 billion in deposits in the City of Richmond.

The Company also faces competition for deposits from short-term money market mutual funds and other corporate and government securities funds.

The Company’s wealth management segment faces competition on several fronts.  Middleburg Trust Company competes for clients and accounts with banks, other financial institutions and money managers.  Even though many of these institutions have been engaged in the trust or investment management business for a considerably longer period of time than Middleburg Trust Company and have significantly greater resources, Middleburg Trust Company has grown through its commitment to providing quality trust and investment management services and a community focused approach to business.   
Competition for the Company’s mortgage banking business was largely from other mortgage banking entities.  Traditional financial institutions, investment banking companies and Internet sources for mortgages also add to the competitive market for mortgages. 
Lending Activities
Credit Policies
The principal risk associated with each of the categories of loans in Middleburg Bank’s portfolio is the creditworthiness of its borrowers, which can vary depending on prevailing economic conditions, market employment levels, consumer confidence, fluctuations in the value of real estate and other conditions that affect the ability of borrowers to repay indebtedness.  
In an effort to manage risk, Middleburg Bank has written policies and procedures, which include approval limits assigned to individual loan officers based on their position and level of experience. Middleburg Bank also utilizes an outside third party loan review process that includes regular portfolio reviews to assess exposure to loan losses and to ascertain compliance with Middleburg Bank’s loan policy. 
Middleburg Bank has three levels of lending authority.  Individual loan officers are the first level and are limited to their lending authority.  The second level is the Officers Loan Committee, which is composed of five senior officers of Middleburg Bank. The Officers Loan Committee approves loans that exceed the individual loan officers’ lending authority and reviews loans to be presented to the Directors Loan Committee.  The Directors Loan Committee is composed of six Directors, of which four are independent Directors.  The Directors Loan Committee approves new, modified and renewed credits that exceed Officer Loan Committee lending authorities.  A quorum is reached when four committee members are present, of which at least three must be independent Directors.  The approval of an application will be met with a majority of the members present, but no less than three votes. In addition, the Directors Loan Committee reports all new loans that were reviewed and approved to Middleburg Bank’s Board of Directors on a monthly basis.  Monthly reports provided to the Directors Loan Committee include, but are not limited to, all new credits in excess of $12,500 or which had been extended; a watch list including names, current balances, risk rating and payment status; nonaccruals and recommended charge-offs and a list of overdrafts in excess of $1,500 which have been overdrawn for more than five days.  The Directors Loan Committee also reviews lending policies that are proposed by management.
Construction Lending
The Company originates local construction loans, primarily residential, and land acquisition and development loans.  The construction loans are primarily secured by units under construction and the underlying land for which the loan was obtained.  The average life of a typical construction loan is approximately twelve months and will reprice monthly to meet the market, generally the Wall Street Journal prime rate plus one percent.  Because the interest rate charged on these loans floats with the market, these loans help the Company in managing its interest rate risk.  Construction lending entails significant additional risks, compared with residential mortgage lending.  Construction loans often involve larger loan balances concentrated with single borrowers or groups 
 5

of related borrowers.  Another risk involved in construction lending is attributable to loan funds being advanced upon the security of the land or home under construction, which value is estimated prior to the completion of construction.  Thus, it is more difficult to evaluate accurately the funds that are required to complete a project and related loan-to-value ratios.  To mitigate the risks associated with construction lending, the Company generally limits loan amounts to 75% to 85% of appraised value, in addition to analyzing the creditworthiness of its borrowers.  The Company also obtains a first lien on the property as security for its construction loans and typically requires personal guarantees from the borrowing entity’s principal owners.
Commercial Business Loans
Commercial business loans generally have a higher degree of risk than residential mortgage loans, but have higher yields.  To manage these risks, the Company generally obtains appropriate collateral and personal guarantees from the borrowing entity’s principal owners and monitors the financial condition of its business borrowers.  Commercial business loans typically are made on the basis of the borrower’s ability to make repayment from cash flow from its business and are secured by business assets, such as accounts receivable, equipment and inventory.  As a result, the availability of funds for the repayment of commercial business loans is substantially dependent on the success of the business itself.  Furthermore, the collateral for commercial business loans may depreciate over time and generally cannot be appraised with as much precision as residential real estate. 
Commercial Real Estate Lending
Commercial real estate loans are secured by various types of commercial real estate in the Company's market area, including multi-family residential buildings, commercial buildings and offices, small shopping centers and churches.  

In its underwriting of commercial real estate, the Company may lend, in accordance with internal policy, up to 80% of the secured property’s appraised value. Commercial real estate lending entails significant additional risk, as compared to residential mortgage lending.  Commercial real estate loans typically involve larger loan balances concentrated with single borrowers or groups of related borrowers.  Additionally, the payment experience on loans secured by income producing properties is typically dependent on the successful operation of a business or a real estate project and thus may be subject, to a greater extent, to adverse conditions in the real estate market or in the economy. The Company's commercial real estate loan underwriting criteria require an examination of debt service coverage ratios and the borrower’s creditworthiness, prior credit history and reputation.  The Company also evaluates the location of the security property and typically requires personal guarantees or endorsements of the borrowing entity’s principal owners.
1 - 4 Family Residential Real Estate Lending
Residential lending activity may be generated by loan originator solicitation, referrals by real estate professionals, existing or new clients and purchases of whole loans.  As part of the loan application process, information is gathered on income, employment and credit history of the applicant.  Loan originations are underwritten using Middleburg Bank’s underwriting guidelines.  Security for the majority of residential lending is in the form of owner occupied 1- 4 family dwellings. The valuation of residential collateral is provided by independent appraisers who have been approved by the Company's Board of Directors. In connection with residential real estate loans, the Company requires title insurance, hazard insurance and, if required, flood insurance.  Flood determination letters with life of loan tracking are obtained on all federally related transactions with improvements serving as security for the transaction.
Consumer Lending
The Company offers various secured and unsecured consumer loans, including unsecured personal loans and lines of credit, automobile loans, deposit account loans, installment and demand loans.  The Company currently originates all of its consumer loans in its geographic market area.  Most of the consumer loans are tied to the Wall Street Journal prime rate and reprice monthly.
Consumer loans may entail greater risk than residential mortgage loans, particularly in the case of loans which are unsecured, such as lines of credit, or secured by rapidly depreciating assets such as automobiles.  In such cases, any repossessed collateral for a defaulted consumer loan may not provide an adequate source of repayment of the outstanding loan balance as a result of the greater likelihood of damage, loss or depreciation.  The remaining deficiency often does not warrant further substantial collection efforts against the borrower.  In addition, consumer loan collections are dependent on the borrower’s continuing financial stability, and thus are more likely to be adversely affected by job loss, divorce, illness or personal bankruptcy.  Furthermore, the application of various federal and state laws, including federal and state bankruptcy and insolvency laws, may limit the amount which can be recovered on such loans.  Consumer loan delinquencies often increase over time as the loans age.
The underwriting standards for consumer loans include a determination of the applicant’s payment history on other debts and an assessment of the applicant's ability to meet existing obligations and payments on the proposed loan.  The stability of the applicant’s monthly income may be determined by verification of gross monthly income from primary employment, and additionally from any verifiable secondary income.  Although creditworthiness of the applicant is of primary consideration, the underwriting process also includes an analysis of the value of the security in relation to the proposed loan amount.

Supervision and Regulation
General
As a bank holding company, the Company is subject to regulation under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (the "Bank Holding Company Act"), and the examination and reporting requirements of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the "Federal Reserve").  As a state-chartered commercial bank, Middleburg Bank is subject to regulation, supervision and examination by the Virginia State Corporation Commission’s Bureau of Financial Institutions.  It is also subject to regulation, supervision and examination by the Federal Reserve.  Other federal and state laws, including various consumer and compliance laws, govern the activities of Middleburg Bank, the investments that it makes and the aggregate amount of loans that it may grant to one borrower.
The following description summarizes the significant federal and state laws applicable to the Company and its subsidiaries.  To the extent that statutory or regulatory provisions are described, the description is qualified in its entirety by reference to that particular statutory or regulatory provision.
The Bank Holding Company Act
Under the Bank Holding Company Act, the Company is subject to periodic examination by the Federal Reserve and is required to file periodic reports regarding its operations and any additional information that the Federal Reserve may require.  The Bank Holding Company Act limits activities at the bank holding company level to:

• | banking and managing or controlling banks;


• | furnishing services to or performing services for its subsidiaries; and


• | engaging in other activities that the Federal Reserve has determined by regulation or order to be so closely related to banking as to be a proper incident to these activities.

Some of the activities that the Federal Reserve Board has determined by regulation to be proper incidents to the business of a bank holding company include making or servicing loans and specific types of leases, performing specific data processing services and acting in some circumstances as a fiduciary, investment, or financial adviser.
With some limited exceptions, the Bank Holding Company Act requires every bank holding company to obtain the prior approval of the Federal Reserve before:

• | acquiring substantially all the assets of any bank;


• | acquiring direct or indirect ownership or control of any voting shares of any bank if after such acquisition it would own or control more than 5% of the voting shares of such bank (unless it already owns or controls the majority of such shares); or


• | merging or consolidating with another bank holding company.

In addition, and subject to some exceptions, the Bank Holding Company Act and the Change in Bank Control Act, together with their regulations, require Federal Reserve approval prior to any person or company acquiring 25% or more of any class of voting securities of a bank or bank holding company.  Prior notice to the Federal Reserve is required if a person acquires 10% or more, but less than 25%, of any class of voting securities of a bank or bank holding company and either the institution has registered securities under Section 12 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”) or no other person owns a greater percentage of that class of voting securities immediately after the transaction.
Payment of Dividends
The Company is a legal entity separate and distinct from its banking and non-banking subsidiaries.  The majority of the Company’s revenues are from dividends paid to the Company by its subsidiaries.  The Company and Middleburg Bank are subject to laws and regulations that limit the amount of dividends it can pay, including requirements to maintain capital at or above regulatory minimums.  Banking regulators have indicated that banking organizations should generally pay dividends only if the organization’s net income available to common shareholders is sufficient to fully fund the dividends and the prospective rate of earnings retention appears consistent with the organization’s capital needs, asset quality and overall financial condition.  The Company does not expect that any of these laws, regulations or policies will materially affect the ability of Middleburg Bank to pay dividends.  During the year ended December 31, 2016, Middleburg Bank and Middleburg Investment Group paid $5.9 million and $1.0 million, respectively, in dividends to the Company.
The FDIC has the general authority to limit the dividends paid by insured banks if the payment is deemed an unsafe and unsound practice.  The FDIC has indicated that paying dividends that deplete a bank’s capital base to an inadequate level would be an unsafe and unsound banking practice.

 7

Insurance of Accounts, Assessments and Regulation by the FDIC
The deposits of Middleburg Bank are insured by the FDIC up to the limits set forth under applicable law.  Middleburg Bank pays deposit insurance assessments of the Deposit Insurance Fund (“DIF”) of the FDIC.
The FDIC has implemented a risk-based deposit insurance assessment system under which the assessment rate for an insured institution may vary according to regulatory capital levels of the institution and other factors, including supervisory evaluations.  In addition to being influenced by the risk profile of the particular depository institution, FDIC premiums are also influenced by the size of the FDIC insurance fund in relation to total deposits in FDIC insured banks.  An institution’s assessment base is its consolidated total assets less its average tangible equity as defined by the FDIC.  The FDIC has authority to impose special assessments from time to time.
The FDIC is authorized to prohibit any DIF-insured institution from engaging in any activity that the FDIC determines by regulation or order to pose a serious threat to the respective insurance fund.  Also, the FDIC may initiate enforcement actions against banks, after first giving the institution’s primary regulatory authority an opportunity to take such action.  The FDIC may terminate the deposit insurance of any depository institution if it determines, after a hearing, that the institution has engaged or is engaging in unsafe or unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations, or has violated any applicable law, regulation, order or any condition imposed in writing by the FDIC.  It also may suspend deposit insurance temporarily during the hearing process for the permanent termination of insurance, if the institution has no tangible capital.  If deposit insurance is terminated, the deposits at the institution at the time of termination, less subsequent withdrawals, shall continue to be insured for a period from six months to two years, as determined by the FDIC.  The Company is not aware of any existing circumstances that could result in termination of any of Middleburg Bank’s deposit insurance.
Capital Requirements
The Federal Reserve Board and the FDIC have adopted rules to implement the Basel III capital framework as outlined by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and standards for calculating risk-weighted assets and risk-based capital measurements (collectively, the Basel III Final Rules) that apply to banking organizations they supervise. For the purposes of these capital rules, (i) common equity tier 1 capital (CET1) consists principally of common stock (including surplus) and retained earnings; (ii) Tier 1 capital consists principally of CET1 plus non-cumulative preferred stock and related surplus, and certain grandfathered cumulative preferred stocks and trust preferred securities; and (iii) Tier 2 capital consists principally of Tier 1 capital plus qualifying subordinated debt and preferred stock, and limited amounts of the allowance for loan losses. Each regulatory capital classification is subject to certain adjustments and limitations, as implemented by the Basel III Final Rules. The Basel III Final Rules also establish risk weightings that are applied to many classes of assets held by community banks, importantly including applying higher risk weightings to certain commercial real estate loans. 
The Basel III Final Rules were effective January 1, 2015, and the Basel III Final Rules capital conservation buffer will be phased in from 2015 to 2019. 
When fully phased in, the Basel III Final Rules require banks to maintain (i) a minimum ratio of CET1 to risk-weighted assets of at least 4.5%, plus a 2.5% “capital conservation buffer” (which is added to the 4.5% CET1 ratio as that buffer is phased in, effectively resulting in a minimum ratio of CET1 to risk-weighted assets of at least 7%), (ii) a minimum ratio of Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 6.0%, plus the capital conservation buffer (which is added to the 6.0% Tier 1 capital ratio as that buffer is phased in, effectively resulting in a minimum Tier 1 capital ratio of 8.5% upon full implementation), (iii) a minimum ratio of total (that is, Tier 1 plus Tier 2) capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 8.0%, plus the capital conservation buffer (which is added to the 8.0% total capital ratio as that buffer is phased in, effectively resulting in a minimum total capital ratio of 10.5% upon full implementation) and (iv) a minimum leverage ratio of 4%, calculated as the ratio of Tier 1 capital to balance sheet exposures plus certain off-balance sheet exposures (computed as the average for each quarter of the month-end ratios for the quarter). 
The Basel III Final Rules provide deductions from and adjustments to regulatory capital measures, primarily to CET1, including deductions and adjustments that were not applied to reduce CET1 under historical regulatory capital rules. For example, mortgage servicing rights, deferred tax assets, dependent upon future taxable income, and significant investments in non-consolidated financial entities must be deducted from CET1 to the extent that any one such category exceeds 10% of CET1 or all such categories in the aggregate exceed 15% of CET1. These deductions from and adjustments to regulatory capital will generally be phased in beginning in 2015 through 2018. 
The Basel III Final Rules permanently includes in Tier 1 capital trust preferred securities issued prior to May 19, 2010 by bank holding companies with less than $15 billion in total assets, subject to a limit of 25% of Tier 1 capital. The Company expects that its trust preferred securities will be included in Tier 1 capital until their maturity. 
 8

The Basel III Final Rules also implement a “countercyclical capital buffer,” generally designed to absorb losses during periods of economic stress and to be imposed when national regulators determine that excess aggregate credit growth becomes associated with a buildup of systemic risk. This buffer is a CET1 add-on to the capital conservation buffer in the range of 0% to 2.5% when fully implemented (potentially resulting in total buffers of between 2.5% and 5%). 
Other Safety and Soundness Regulations
There are a number of obligations and restrictions imposed on bank holding companies and their depository institution subsidiaries by federal law and regulatory policy that are designed to reduce potential loss exposure to the depositors of such depository institutions and to the FDIC insurance funds in the event that the depository institution is insolvent or is in danger of becoming insolvent.  For example, under the requirements of the Federal Reserve Board with respect to bank holding company operations, a bank holding company is required to serve as a source of financial strength to its subsidiary depository institutions and to commit resources to support such institutions in circumstances where it might not do so otherwise.  In addition, the “cross-guarantee” provisions of federal law require insured depository institutions under common control to reimburse the FDIC for any loss suffered or reasonably anticipated by the FDIC as a result of the insolvency of commonly controlled insured depository institutions or for any assistance provided by the FDIC to commonly controlled insured depository institutions in danger of failure.  The FDIC may decline to enforce the cross-guarantee provision if it determines that a waiver is in the best interests of the deposit insurance funds.  The FDIC’s claim for reimbursement under the cross guarantee provisions is superior to claims of shareholders of the insured depository institution or its holding company but is subordinate to claims of depositors, secured creditors and non-affiliated holders of subordinated debt of the commonly controlled insured depository institutions.
Monetary Policy
The commercial banking business is affected not only by general economic conditions but also by the monetary policies of the Federal Reserve Board.  The instruments of monetary policy employed by the Federal Reserve Board include open market operations in United States government securities, changes in the discount rate on member bank borrowings and changes in reserve requirements against deposits held by all federally insured banks.  The Federal Reserve Board’s monetary policies have had a significant effect on the operating results of commercial banks in the past and are expected to continue to do so in the future.  In view of changing conditions in the national and international economy and in the money markets, as well as the effect of actions by monetary fiscal authorities, including the Federal Reserve Board, no prediction can be made as to possible future changes in interest rates, deposit levels, loan demand of Middleburg Bank or the business and earnings of the Company.
Federal Reserve System
In 1980, Congress enacted legislation that imposed reserve requirements on all depository institutions that maintain transaction accounts or non-personal time deposits.  NOW accounts, money market deposit accounts and other types of accounts that permit payments or transfers to third parties fall within the definition of transaction accounts and are subject to these reserve requirements, as are any non-personal time deposits at an institution.  For net transaction accounts for final weekly reporting period in the year ended December 31, 2016, the first $15.2 million will be exempt from reserve requirements.  A 3% reserve ratio will be assessed on net transaction accounts over $15.2 million up to and including $95.0 million.  A 10% reserve ratio will be applied above $95.0 million.  These percentages are subject to adjustment by the Federal Reserve Board.  Because required reserves must be maintained in the form of vault cash or in a non-interest-bearing account at, or on behalf of, a Federal Reserve Bank, the effect of the reserve requirement is to reduce the amount of the institution’s interest-earning assets.
Transactions with Affiliates
Transactions between banks and their affiliates are governed by Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act.  An affiliate of a bank is any bank or entity that controls, is controlled by or is under common control with such bank.  Generally, Sections 23A and 23B:

• | limit the extent to which a bank or its subsidiaries may engage in “covered transactions” with any one affiliate to an amount equal to 10% of such institution’s capital stock and surplus, and maintain an aggregate limit on all such transactions with affiliates to an amount equal to 20% of such capital stock and surplus; and


• | require that all such transactions be on terms substantially the same, or at least as favorable, to the association or subsidiary as those provided to a non-affiliate.

The term “covered transaction” includes the making of loans, purchase of assets, issuance of a guarantee and similar other types of transactions.
Transactions with Insiders
The Federal Reserve Act and related regulations impose specific restrictions on loans to directors, executive officers and principal shareholders of banks.  Under Section 22(h) of the Federal Reserve Act, loans to a director, an executive officer and to a principal shareholder of a bank, and some affiliated entities of any of the foregoing, may not exceed, together with all other outstanding loans to such person and affiliated entities, the bank’s loan-to-one borrower limit.  Loans in the aggregate to insiders and their 
 9

related interests as a class may not exceed two times the bank’s unimpaired capital and unimpaired surplus until the bank’s total assets equal or exceed $100 million, at which time the aggregate is limited to the bank’s unimpaired capital and unimpaired surplus.  Section 22(h) also prohibits loans, above amounts prescribed by the appropriate federal banking agency, to directors, executive officers and principal shareholders of a bank or bank holding company, and their respective affiliates, unless such loan is approved in advance by a majority of the board of directors of the bank with any “interested” director not participating in the voting.  The FDIC has prescribed the loan amount, which includes all other outstanding loans to such person, as to which such prior board of director approval is required, as being the greater of $25,000 or 5% of capital and surplus (up to $500,000).  Section 22(h) requires that loans to directors, executive officers and principal shareholders be made on terms and underwriting standards substantially the same as offered in comparable transactions to other persons.
Community Reinvestment Act
Under the Community Reinvestment Act and related regulations, depository institutions have an affirmative obligation to assist in meeting the credit needs of their market areas, including low and moderate-income areas, consistent with safe and sound banking practices.  The Community Reinvestment Act requires the adoption by each institution of a Community Reinvestment Act statement for each of its market areas describing the depository institution’s efforts to assist in its community’s credit needs.  Depository institutions are periodically examined for compliance with the Community Reinvestment Act and are periodically assigned ratings in this regard.  Banking regulators consider a depository institution’s Community Reinvestment Act rating when reviewing applications to establish new branches, undertake new lines of business, and/or acquire part or all of another depository institution.  An unsatisfactory rating can significantly delay or even prohibit regulatory approval of a proposed transaction by a bank holding company or its depository institution subsidiaries.
The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act ("GLBA") and federal bank regulators have made various changes to the Community Reinvestment Act.  Among other changes, Community Reinvestment Act agreements with private parties must be disclosed and annual reports must be made to a bank’s primary federal regulator.  A bank holding company will not be permitted to become a financial holding company and no new activities authorized under the GLBA may be commenced by a holding company or by a bank financial subsidiary if any of its bank subsidiaries received less than a “satisfactory” rating in its latest Community Reinvestment Act examination.
Fair Lending; Consumer Laws
In addition to the Community Reinvestment Act, other federal and state laws regulate various lending and consumer aspects of the banking business.  Governmental agencies, including the Department of Housing and Urban Development, the Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Justice, have become concerned that prospective borrowers experience discrimination in their efforts to obtain loans from depository and other lending institutions.  These agencies have brought litigation against depository institutions alleging discrimination against borrowers.  Many of these suits have been settled, in some cases for material sums, short of a full trial.
These governmental agencies have clarified what they consider to be lending discrimination and have specified various factors that they will use to determine the existence of lending discrimination under the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and the Fair Housing Act, including evidence that a lender discriminated on a prohibited basis, evidence that a lender treated applicants differently based on prohibited factors in the absence of evidence that the treatment was the result of prejudice or a conscious intention to discriminate, and evidence that a lender applied an otherwise neutral non-discriminatory policy uniformly to all applicants, but the practice had a discriminatory effect, unless the practice could be justified as a business necessity.
Banks and other depository institutions also are subject to numerous consumer-oriented laws and regulations.  These laws, which include the Truth in Lending Act, the Truth in Savings Act, the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, the Electronic Funds Transfer Act, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, and the Fair Housing Act, require compliance by depository institutions with various disclosure requirements and requirements regulating the availability of funds after deposit or the making of some loans to customers.
Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999
The GLBA covers a broad range of issues, including a repeal of most of the restrictions on affiliations among depository institutions, securities firms and insurance companies.  The following description summarizes some of its significant provisions.
The GLBA permits unrestricted affiliations between banks and securities firms.  It also permits bank holding companies to elect to become financial holding companies.  A financial holding company may engage in or acquire companies that engage in a broad range of financial services, including securities activities such as underwriting, dealing, investment, merchant banking, insurance underwriting, sales and brokerage activities.  In order to become a financial holding company, a bank holding company and all of its affiliated depository institutions must be well-capitalized, well-managed and have at least a satisfactory Community Reinvestment Act rating.

The GLBA provides that the states continue to have the authority to regulate insurance activities, but prohibits the states in most instances from preventing or significantly interfering with the ability of a bank, directly or through an affiliate, to engage in insurance sales, solicitations or cross-marketing activities.  Although the states generally must regulate bank insurance activities in a nondiscriminatory manner, the states may continue to adopt and enforce rules that specifically regulate bank insurance activities in specific areas identified under the law.  Under the new law, the federal bank regulatory agencies adopted insurance consumer protection regulations that apply to sales practices, solicitations, advertising and disclosures.
The GLBA adopts a system of functional regulation under which the Federal Reserve Board is designated as the umbrella regulator for financial holding companies, but financial holding company affiliates are principally regulated by functional regulators such as the FDIC for state nonmember bank affiliates, the SEC for securities affiliates, and state insurance regulators for insurance affiliates.  It repeals the broad exemption of banks from the definitions of “broker” and “dealer” for purposes of the Exchange Act, as amended.  It also identifies a set of specific activities, including traditional bank trust and fiduciary activities, in which a bank may engage without being deemed a “broker,” and a “dealer.”  Additionally, the new law makes conforming changes in the definitions of “broker” and “dealer” for purposes of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, and the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended.
The GLBA contains extensive customer privacy protection provisions.  Under these provisions, a financial institution must provide to its customers, both at the inception of the customer relationship and on an annual basis, the institution’s policies and procedures regarding the handling of customers’ nonpublic personal financial information.  The law provides that, except for specific limited exceptions, an institution may not provide such personal information to unaffiliated third parties unless the institution discloses to the customer that such information may be so provided and the customer is given the opportunity to opt out of such disclosure.  An institution may not disclose to a non-affiliated third party, other than to a consumer reporting agency, customer account numbers or other similar account identifiers for marketing purposes.  The GLBA also provides that the states may adopt customer privacy protections that are stricter than those contained in the Act.
Bank Secrecy Act
Under the Bank Secrecy Act, a financial institution is required to have systems in place to detect certain transactions, based on the size and nature of the transaction.  Financial institutions are generally required to report cash transactions involving more than $10,000 to the United States Treasury.  In addition, financial institutions are required to file suspicious activity reports for transactions that involve more than $5,000 and which the financial institution knows, suspects or has reason to suspect, the transactions involves illegal funds, is designed to evade the requirements of the BSA or has no lawful purpose.  The USA PATRIOT Act of 2001, enacted in response to the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, requires bank regulators to consider a financial institution’s compliance with the BSA when reviewing applications from a financial institution.  As part of its BSA program, the USA PATRIOT Act also requires a financial institution to follow customer identification procedures when opening accounts for new customers and to review lists of individuals who and entities which are prohibited from opening accounts at financial institutions.
Dodd-Frank Act
The Dodd-Frank Act implemented far-reaching changes across the financial regulatory landscape, including changes that have affected or may affect all bank holding companies and banks, including the Company and the Bank. Provisions that significantly affect the business of the Company and the Bank include the following:

• | Insurance of Deposit Accounts. The Dodd-Frank Act changed the assessment base for federal deposit insurance from the amount of insured deposits to consolidated assets less tangible capital. The Dodd-Frank Act also made permanent the $250,000 limit for federal deposit insurance and increased the cash limit of Securities Investor Protection Corporation protection from $100,000 to $250,000.


• | Payment of Interest on Demand Deposits. The Dodd-Frank Act repealed the federal prohibitions on the payment of interest on demand deposits, thereby permitting depository institutions to pay interest on business transaction and other accounts.


• | Creation of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. The Dodd-Frank Act centralized significant aspects of consumer financial protection by creating a new agency, the CFPB, which is discussed in more detail below.


• | Debit Card Interchange Fees. The Dodd-Frank Act amended the Electronic Fund Transfer Act (EFTA) to, among other things, require that debit card interchange fees be reasonable and proportional to the actual cost incurred by the issuer with respect to the transaction. The Federal Reserve Board adopted regulations setting the maximum permissible interchange fee as the sum of $0.21 per transaction and 5 basis points multiplied by the value of the transaction, with an additional adjustment of up to $0.01 per transaction if the issuer implements additional fraud-prevention standards. Although issuers that have assets of less than $10 billion are exempt from the Federal Reserve Board’s regulations that set maximum interchange fees, these regulations could significantly affect the interchange fees that financial institutions with less than $10 billion in assets are able to collect. 

 11

In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act implements other far-reaching changes to the financial regulatory landscape, including provisions that: 

• | Restrict the preemption of state law by federal law and disallow subsidiaries and affiliates of national banks from availing themselves of such preemption.


• | Impose comprehensive regulation of over-the-counter derivatives market, subject to significant rulemaking processes, which would include certain provisions that would effectively prohibit insured depository institutions from conducting certain derivatives businesses in the institution itself.


• | Require depository institutions with total consolidated assets of more than $10 billion to conduct regular stress tests and require large, publicly traded bank holding companies to create a risk committee responsible for the oversight of enterprise risk management.


• | Require loan originators to retain 5% of any loan sold or securitized, unless it is a “qualified residential mortgage,” subject to certain exceptions.


• | Prohibit banks and their affiliates from engaging in proprietary trading and investing in and sponsoring certain unregistered investment companies (the Volcker Rule).


• | Implement corporate governance revisions that apply to all public companies not just financial institutions.

Many aspects of the Dodd-Frank Act remain subject to future rulemaking, making it difficult to anticipate the overall financial impact on the Company, its subsidiaries, its customers or the financial industry more generally. Some of the rules that have been proposed and, in some cases, adopted to comply with the Dodd-Frank Act's mandates are discussed further below. 
Consumer Protection
The Dodd-Frank Act created the CFPB, a federal regulatory agency that is responsible for implementing, examining and enforcing compliance with federal consumer financial laws for institutions with more than $10 billion of assets and, to a lesser extent, smaller institutions. The Dodd-Frank Act gives the CFPB authority to supervise and regulate providers of consumer financial products and services, and establishes the CFPB’s power to act against unfair, deceptive or abusive practices, and gives the CFPB rulemaking authority in connection with numerous federal consumer financial protection laws (for example, but not limited to, the Truth-in-Lending Act (TILA) and the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act (RESPA)). 
As a smaller institution (i.e., with assets of $10 billion or less), most consumer protection aspects of the Dodd-Frank Act will continue to be applied to the Company and to the Bank by the Federal Reserve Board. However, the CFPB may include its own examiners in regulatory examinations by a small institution’s principal regulators and may require smaller institutions to comply with certain CFPB reporting requirements. In addition, regulatory positions taken by the CFPB and administrative and legal precedents established by CFPB enforcement activities, including in connection with supervision of larger bank holding companies, could influence how the Federal Reserve Board apply consumer protection laws and regulations to financial institutions that are not directly supervised by the CFPB. The precise effect of the CFPB’s consumer protection activities on the Company and the Bank cannot be determined with certainty. 
Mortgage Lending
The CFPB implemented certain sections of the Dodd-Frank Act requiring creditors to make a reasonable, good faith determination of a consumer’s ability to repay any closed-end consumer credit transaction secured by a 1-4 family dwelling. The rule also established certain protections from liability under this requirement to ensure a borrower’s ability to repay for loans that meet the definition of “qualified mortgage.” Loans that satisfy this “qualified mortgage” safe harbor will be presumed to have complied with the new ability-to-repay standard. 
Volcker Rule
The Volcker Rule generally would prohibit banking entities from:

• | engaging in short-term proprietary trading of securities, derivatives, commodity futures and options on these instruments for their own account;


• | owning, sponsoring, or having certain relationships with hedge funds or private equity funds, referred to as “covered funds”.

On January 14, 2014, an adjustment to the final rule was made allowing banks to keep certain collateralized debt obligations (“CDOs”) acquired before the Volcker Rule was finalized, if the CDO was established before May 2010 and is backed primarily by trust preferred securities issued by banks with less than $15 billion in assets. The final rules were effective April 1, 2014; however, the Federal Reserve Board has extended the conformance period until July 21, 2017. We believe that we are in full compliance with the Rule.

Future Regulatory Uncertainty
Because federal regulation of financial institutions changes regularly and is the subject of constant legislative debate, the Company cannot forecast how federal regulation of financial institutions may change in the future and impact its operations.  Although Congress, in recent years, has sought to reduce the regulatory burden on financial institutions with respect to the approval of specific transactions, the Company fully expects that the financial institution industry will remain heavily regulated in the near future and additional laws or regulations may be adopted further regulating specific banking practices.
Middleburg Trust Company
Middleburg Trust Company is subject to supervision and regulation by the Virginia State Corporation Commission’s Bureau of Financial Institutions and the Federal Reserve Board.
State and federal regulators have substantial discretion and latitude in the exercise of their supervisory and regulatory authority over Middleburg Trust Company, including the statutory authority to promulgate regulations affecting the conduct of its business and operations of Middleburg Trust Company.  They also have the ability to exercise substantial remedial powers with respect to Middleburg Trust Company in the event that it determines that Middleburg Trust Company is not in compliance with applicable laws, orders or regulations governing its operations, is operating in an unsafe or unsound manner, or is engaging in any irregular practices.
