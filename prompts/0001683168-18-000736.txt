Current Projects
 
We currently have the following real estate projects under development:
 
Beauport, QC
 
This project is a low density project in Beauport, a city in the suburbs of Quebec. No other parcel of land is available in this strategic sector of the city. There are already 3 building contractors interested in reserving lands on this parcel. The main roads are 2 km away from the project and all services, including a shopping center, restaurants, grocery store, clinic, primary school and high school etc. are less than 1 km away. The projects will consist of townhouses, semi- detached and standard houses. Infrastructures will be necessary and are included in the budget. No significant development of this property occurred during the year ended December 31, 2016.
 
As of December 31, 2016, we have invested $4,724,686 (CAD 6,362,780) in the property.
 
Terrace, BC
 
Terrace is a city on the Skeena River in British Columbia, Canada. The Terrace region was a booming market in 2015 because of the Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) projects underway. Companies invested hundreds of millions of dollars in advanced work in order to be prepared for LNG. We had decided to participate in this opportunity by buying lands on which we expect to build apartments as the Terrace region had a lack of available housing and a strong need to house their employees. Stemming from the significant decline in global oil and gas prices in 2016, many LNG projects across British Columbia were delayed or discontinued and as such, housing demands in this region also rapidly diminished. No significant development of these properties occurred during the year ended December 31, 2016.
 
We currently own three properties in Terrace with a total cost to date of $1,602,875 (CAD 2,158,608).
 
Kitimat, BC
 
The Kitimat region was booming due to the LNG projects underway. Companies have invested hundreds of millions of dollars in advanced work in order to be prepared for the LNG projects. Accordingly, this region experienced a severe lack of infrastructure and single family dwellings needed to house their workers. Investments have been made into this region to help strengthen the local community and to create economic advantages for future generations of British Columbians. We incurred $50,000 of development costs on this property during the year ended December 31, 2015. Stemming from the significant decline in global oil and gas prices in 2016, many LNG projects across British Columbia were delayed or discontinued and as such, housing demands in this region also rapidly diminished.
 
We acquired approximately 250,000 square feet of prime residential land development to build over 300 apartment units. To date, we have invested $1,673,366 (CAD 2,253,540) in the property in Kitimat.
 
Louisette, France
 
Louisette is located in Seyne sur Mer, Var, South of France. The land is less than 5 minutes from the Six-Fours beach, which is a region rich in tourism. We are co- investing on this project with Rome Finance Group and Capital Evolution Group SAS. As of December 31, 2016, we own 2% of the project through an investment in shares of Society Louisette Memories SARL.
Evans, Colorado
 
The town of Evans is located in Weld County, 60 miles from Denver, Colorado. Evans has a growing economy fueled by large oil & gas companies, investors and agriculture. The technology, aerospace, construction, financial and health care sectors are also prominent in Evans with continued hiring and job opportunities. Job creation, strong population growth and a continued influx of new residents and businesses to the area have led to an increased demand for housing in Evans. According to the Department of Labor, Weld County has seen the strongest job growth of any county in the U.S. from June 2013 to June 2014, the last period for which data is available.

We acquired 220 acres (equivalent to 9,583,200 square feet of land) and 763 water rights in Evans. As of December 31, 2016, we have invested $6,717,876 in the property in Evans and have incurred an additional $1,029,944 in development costs. Beginning in 2018 and in affiliation with a local construction company(s), ROI intends to develop approximately 950 lots in approximately four phases. The project will feature a mix of housing units, including single family homes, town homes, duplexes and condos. The Company also plans to build a park as well as commercial and retail areas. A new middle school was opened last fall adjacent to the property, which is expected to further fuel demand for quality housing.
 
Sobha Hartland, Dubai, UAE
 
Sobha Hartland is a mixed-use development that is located in Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum City. It affords a full view of the Dubai skyline and it is conveniently located close to the metro, the water canal, in front of the Dubai Design District and only minutes from downtown via Al Khail artery road. This complete community offers high net worth residents of Dubai a chance to reduce their commuting drive from 20-25 km to 3 km or 5 minutes to downtown. Dubai is among the fastest growing cities in the world. It is a major financial center and business hub for the Middle East and Africa. Dubai’s economy is fueled by a number of industries including tourism, finance, industrial consulting and communication technologies.
 
We have partnered with Sobha LLC, a subsidiary of PNC Investments LLC (“PNC”), for this project. Sobha LLC is a large and fully integrated developer in the region having developed 450 projects in the Middle East and Europe. On February 7, 2016, our wholly-owned subsidiary, ROI Land Investments FZ, entered into a Development Sale and Purchase Agreement with PNC for the purchase of approximately 433,000 square feet of land in Sobha Hartland. The total acquisition price is $29,488,000 (AED 108,281,250). This project features three, eight-story buildings for a total of 300 units. Each building offers Dubai residents with a variety of luxurious housing options including studio apartments, 1-bedroom apartments, 2-bedroom apartments, 3-bedroom apartments, two bedroom duplexes and three bedroom duplexes.
 
On May 15, 2016, the Company received a termination letter from PNC terminating the agreement dated February 7, 2016 for non-payment of the amounts due under the agreement. As a result, the Company forfeited the $4,701,205 (AED 17,271,099) of deposits. A total of $5,048,032 (AED 18,545,258), including $346,827 (AED 1,273,583) of closing and development costs, has been charged to operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2016 as abandoned project costs. However, the Company is still in negotiations with PNC to acquire a reduced size and price of the land it had agreed to under the agreement dated February 7, 2016 and apply the deposits to this restructured arrangement. Negotiations are under way, but the likelihood that the Company will be successful in reaching a satisfactory agreement is dependent on its ability to pay at least a portion of the new acquisition price. As a result, there can be no assurance that the acquisition will occur as contemplated or at all. During the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company also incurred $273,048 of other costs related to the project and wrote-off leasehold improvements related to a lease in Dubai for an amount of $299,475.
 
Project Funding Activity
 
On June 17, 2014, ROI DEV entered into a Framework Agreement with Coast to Coast Holdings, Inc. (“CTC”), a Canadian Construction corporation. Under the terms of the agreement, ROI DEV will provide funding to CTC in the form of notes payable and mortgage notes payable for property development projects, and provide financial and real estate advisory services, for a period of up to ten years. ROI DEV has the right to make the loan or not and each individual loan will be evidenced by its own promissory note with terms agreed upon by the parties. On December 31, 2014, the Framework Agreement was cancelled; however, existing and additional loans were made.
 
As of December 31, 2015, the Company had a mortgage note receivable outstanding with CTC for $154,994 (CAD 215,000). The note bears interest at 8% and was due on the earlier of (i) December 30, 2015 or (ii) the date upon which the subject property is sold by CTC. The mortgage note is in default at December 31, 2015; however, it is collateralized by a mortgage on the property. During the year ended December 31, 2016, CTC defaulted on the mortgage note and therefore the note receivable was impaired. Management believes that the recoverability of this amount is less than probable. The Company initiated the process to activate the mortgage and seize the underlying land. While the Company believes that it will successfully hold ownership of the subject property, there is no probable assurance regarding the timing of such outcome. Therefore, the subject property has not been recorded as real estate under development and sale in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2016.

During the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company assumed a second mortgage note due to a related party by CTC and CTC agreed to reimburse the Company for the full amount of the mortgage and accrued interest due thereon. The loan bears interest at 6% per annum and is due April 13, 2016. The amount of the mortgage loan due from CTC at December 31, 2015 is $288,360 (CAD 400,000). During the year ended December 31, 2016, CTC defaulted on the mortgage note and therefore the note receivable was impaired. Management believes that the recoverability of this amount is less than probable. The Company initiated the process to activate the mortgage and seize the underlying land. While the Company believes that it will successfully hold ownership of the subject property, there is no probable assurance regarding the timing of such outcome. Therefore, the subject property has not been recorded as real estate under development and sale in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2016.
 
On December 31, 2015, the Company had an unsecured note receivable outstanding with CTC for $630,788 (CAD 875,000). The note bears interest at 8%, was due December 30, 2015 and is in default as of December 31, 2015. The funding from the note was used for the development and construction on the property for which the Company has two mortgage notes receivable. The property consists of six townhomes which are substantially complete and currently held for sale by CTC. As CTC has not responded to requests for payment on the note and has not provided any evidence of the use of funds, the Company has established a full reserve on the collectability of the note receivable, and $52,986 (CAD 73,500) of accrued interest as of December 31, 2015. The Company is vigorously pursuing the collection of the note but has not been successful as of December 31, 2016.
 
During the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company loaned CTC $1,012,237 (CAD 1,404,130) in the form of unsecured notes for the development of one of its properties. The notes bear interest at 8% per annum and were due December 30, 2015. The notes are in default at December 31, 2015. As CTC has not responded to requests for payment on the notes and has not provided any evidence of the use of funds, the Company has established a full reserve on the collectability of the notes receivable, and $56,162 (CAD 67,314) of accrued interest, as of December 31, 2015. The Company plans to vigorously pursue the collection of these notes. The Company is vigorously pursuing the collection of the note but has not been successful as of December 31, 2016.
