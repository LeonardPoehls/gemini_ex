Item 1. Business.
General
 
Texas Pacific Land Trust (which, together with its subsidiary as the context requires, may be referred to as “Texas Pacific”, the “Trust”, “our”, “we” or “us”) is one of the largest landowners in the State of Texas with approximately 890,000 acres of land in West Texas. We currently operate solely in the State of Texas and were organized under a Declaration of Trust, dated February 1, 1888, to receive and hold title to extensive tracts of land in the State of Texas, previously the property of the Texas and Pacific Railway Company, and to issue transferable Certificates of Proprietary Interest pro rata to the holders of certain debt securities of the Texas and Pacific Railway Company. Our Trustees are empowered under the Declaration of Trust to manage the lands with all the powers of an absolute owner. 
Business Segments
 
We operate our business in two segments: Land and Resource Management and Water Service and Operations. Our segments provide management with a comprehensive financial view of our key businesses. The segments enable the alignment of strategies and objectives of the Trust and provide a framework for timely and rational allocation of resources within businesses. See Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Note 9, “Business Segment Reporting” in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. 
Land and Resource Management
 
Our Land and Resource Management segment encompasses the business of managing the approximately 890,000 acres of land and related resources in West Texas owned by the Trust. The revenue streams of this segment principally consist of royalties from oil and gas, revenues from easements and leases and land sales. 
 
We are not an oil and gas producer. Rather, our oil and gas revenue is derived from our retained perpetual non-participating oil and gas royalty interests. Thus, in addition to being subject to fluctuations in response to the market prices for oil and gas, our oil and gas royalty revenues are also subject to decisions made by the owners and operators of the oil and gas wells to which our royalty interests relate as to investments in and production from those wells. 
 
Historically, our income from oil and gas royalties has been limited by the level of production authorized for prorated wells each year by the regulations of the Railroad Commission of the State of Texas. The monthly percentage of allowable production has averaged 100% in recent years, but, because of the limited capacity of older wells and other operating problems, the percentage permitted by the Railroad Commission may not be produced by all operators.
 
 


Our revenue from easements is generated from easement contracts covering activities such as oil and gas pipelines and subsurface wellbore easements. The majority of our easements have a ten-year term. We also enter into agreements with operators and mid-stream companies to lease land from us, primarily for facilities and roads. Additionally, we enter into grazing leases with local ranchers in areas where our lands are located. In recent years, we have been successful at keeping over 97% of our land subject to grazing leases.
 
We are a passive seller of land and do not actively solicit sales of land. Land sale activity in the last two years has been minimal. The demand for, and sale price of, particular tracts of land is influenced by many factors beyond our control, including general economic conditions, the rate of development in nearby areas and the suitability of the particular tract for the ranching uses prevalent in western Texas.

While we are generally not a purchaser of land, parcels are purchased from time to time at the discretion of management.
 
Operations
 
Revenues from the Land and Resource Management segment for the last three years were as follows (amounts presented in millions): 
 

 | 2017 | | 2016 | | 2015 
-----------------------------------------------------+-----------------+-------+----------------------------------+-----+-----------------
 | Segment Revenue | | % of Total Consolidated Revenue | | Segment Revenue | | % of Total Consolidated Revenue | Segment Revenue | | % of Total Consolidated Revenue | 
Oil and gas royalties | $ | 61.3 | | 46% | | $ | 30.0 | | 50% | | $ | 24.9 | 31%
Easements and sundry income | | 39.0 | | 29% | | | 18.4 | | 31% | | | 26.6 | 34%
Land sales and other income | | 0.7 | | 1% | | | 3.4 | | 6% | | | 23.1 | 29%
Total Revenue - Land and Resource Management segment | $ | 101.0 | | 76% | | $ | 51.8 | | 87% | | $ | 74.6 | 94%

On September 14, 2017, we settled the previously disclosed arbitration case with Chevron U.S.A., Inc. involving claims for underpayment of royalties. The Trust received $7.7 million as part of the settlement, including royalties that will be paid to the Trust on additional wells under several community leases. The settlement is included in oil and gas royalties in the table above.
Competition
 
Our Land and Resource Management segment does not have competitors, as such, in that it sells, leases and generally manages land owned by the Trust and, to that extent, any owner of property located in areas comparable to the Trust is a potential competitor. 
 
Water Service and Operations
 
Our Water Service and Operations segment primarily consists of revenues from royalties on sales of water, direct sales of water and to a lesser extent, easements and sundry income.
 
In prior years, we entered into agreements with energy companies and oilfield service businesses to allow such companies to explore for water, drill water wells, construct water-related infrastructure and purchase water sourced from land that we own. Energy businesses use water for their oil and gas projects while non-energy businesses (i.e., water management service companies) operate water facilities to produce and sell water to energy businesses. We collect revenue from royalties and water sales under these legacy agreements.

Drilling and completion activity in the Permian Basin continues to rise as operators increase their focus on development of leaseholds throughout the basin. Longer well laterals combined with large water load frac design, due to high proppant load and carrying limits, continue to drive the need for increased water demand for fracturing activities. In response to that anticipated demand, the Trust announced the formation of Texas Pacific Water Resources LLC (“TPWR”) in June 2017. 
 
TPWR, a single member LLC and wholly owned subsidiary of the Trust, focuses on providing a full-service water offering to operators in the Permian Basin. These services include brackish water sourcing, produced-water gathering/treatment/recycling, infrastructure development/construction, disposal, water tracking, analytics and well testing services. TPWR is committed to sustainable water development with significant focus on the large-scale implementation of recycled water operations. 
 
Operations

Revenues from our Water Service and Operations segment for the last three years were as follows (amounts presented in millions):
 

 | 2017 | | 2016 | | 2015 
-----------------------------------------------------+------------------+------+-----------------------------------+-----+-----------------
 | Segment Revenue | | % of Total Consolidated Revenue | | Segment Revenue | | % of Total Consolidated Revenue | Segment Revenue | | % of Total Consolidated Revenue | 
Water sales and royalties | $ | 25.5 | | 19% | | $ | 8.1 | | 13% | | $ | 4.8 | 6%
Easements and sundry income | | 5.8 | | 5% | | | — | | — | | | — | — 
Total Revenue – Water Service and Operations segment | $ | 31.3 | | 24% | | $ | 8.1 | | 13% | | $ | 4.8 | 6%

As of December 31, 2017, TPWR continues to build out its brackish water production and distribution system. Our first sales from internally developed projects were made during the fourth quarter of 2017. While these projects are currently functional, construction is ongoing to add additional capacity throughout 2018. 
 
TPWR also began performing produced water treatment services for a large independent operator in the fourth quarter of 2017. This service is performed using a TPWR constructed mobile water treatment system capable of treating up to 40,000 bbls/day. We anticipate adding additional treatment systems throughout the course of 2018.
 
During the year ended December 31, 2017, the Trust invested approximately $12.7 million in TPWR projects to develop brackish water sourcing and re-use assets. 
 
Competition
 
While there is competition in the water service business in West Texas, we believe our position as a significant landowner of approximately 890,000 acres in West Texas gives us a unique advantage over our competitors who must negotiate with existing landowners to source water and then for the right of way to deliver the water to the end user.
Major Customers
 
During 2017, we received $27.5 million, or approximately 17% of our total revenues (prior to deferrals), which included $10.7 million of oil and gas royalty revenue, $5.8 million of easements and sundry income (prior to deferrals), and $10.7 million of water sales and royalties, from Anadarko E&P Onshore, LLC and $15.4 million, or approximately 10% of our total revenues (prior to deferrals), which included $15.1 million of oil and gas royalty revenue, from Chevron U.S.A., Inc.

Seasonality
 
The business of Texas Pacific is not seasonal in nature, as that term is generally understood, although due to the nature of our operations, our revenue may vary widely from year to year and quarter to quarter.
 
Regulations 
 
We are subject to various federal, state and local laws. Management believes that our operations comply in all material respects with applicable laws and regulations and that the existence and enforcement of such laws and regulations have no more restrictive effect on our method of operations than on other companies similar to the Trust.
 
We cannot determine the extent to which new legislation, new regulations or changes in existing laws or regulations may affect our future operations.
 
Environmental Considerations
 
Compliance with Federal, State and local provisions that have been enacted or adopted regulating the discharge of materials into the environment, or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment, have had no material effect upon the capital expenditures, earnings and competitive position of Texas Pacific. To date, Texas Pacific has not been called upon to expend any funds for these purposes.
Employees
 
As of January 31, 2018, Texas Pacific had 32 full-time employees.
