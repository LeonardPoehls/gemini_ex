Item 1. BUSINESS OVERVIEW.

We are a Company focused on developing intellectual property, contracting out the manufacturing of the products covered by the intellectual property and bringing to market these products through direct to consumer sales utilizing digital media, infomercials as well as distribution through third party vendors and retail outlets. Our first product LUNA is an alchemy of essential oils and peptide. The Company has begun to generate limited sales of LUNA at $20 per unit selling approximately 70 10 milliliter bottles. Currently the main product the Company is working toward manufacturing and developing a market for is VOLUPTAS, a female sexual arousal enhancer. A provisional patent for VOLUPTAS has been filed and the Company is currently engaged with a manufacturer in Texas to create 3D molds and will take the product through all of the necessary stability tests required over the next approximately 6 months in preparation to bring this product to market. Final pricing for the VOLUPTAS has not been decided upon but expects to be priced in the $39.95 range. The Company is also looking to partner with third party companies to collaborate with them on marking and distributing private label products under the MJTV brand. 

Our goal is to create a well known brand and distribution network that will not only serve as a viable sales and distribution channel for the Companys products but also for third party vendors and their products. The Companys is focused on its catch phrase Beauty Backed By Science. Meaning, science backed products that enhance the inner beauty as well as the outer beauty of all people with an emphasis on women. The Company has also launched a new marketing campaign with a new logo in the shape of a woman with words written inside of the woman describing what is a beautiful woman. We call this woman BEAUTY. 

Acquisition of RP Capital In Place Of The Proposed Acquisition of Michael James Enterprises, Inc. [Nevada]

On August 4, 2016, the companys Board of Directors approved an asset purchase agreement with RP Capital Group, Ltd. to acquire all rights and title to the studies and intellectual property to a dranabinol based treatment for sleep apnea in place of the acquisition of Michael James Enterprises, Inc. Nevada. Prior to that, effective December 11, 2015, the Company filed an Amendment to the Companys Articles of Incorporation changing the Companys name to Michael James Enterprises Inc. and filed with FINRA for a new stock ticker symbol MJTV. Since August of 2016 the Company created the alchemy of essential oils called LUNA to help a person relax and hopefully achieve better sleep. Additionally, the companys CEO, James M. Farinella, designed a creative non invasive delivery system for an active ingredient which was assigned to the company by the CEO. This product VOLUPTAS, now patent pending with a filing for a trademark on the Name VOLUPTAS.
Spin-off of Our Subsidiary BullsnBears Holdings, Inc.

As contractually agreed to, the Company's wholly-owned subsidiary, BullsnBears, Inc. was spun off in its entirety including all of the assets and liabilities of the subsidiary including certain liabilities of the parent company that were incurred by the previous management including BullsnBears Holdings, Inc. Intellectual Property assets including its websites, URLs, and proprietary software, through a share dividend to MJTV shareholders of record as of the close of business on December 28, 2016, with one share of BullsnBears Holdings, Inc. Common Stock distributed for each one share of MJTV Common Stock owned as of the record date. Distribution of the shares took place on December 28, 2016
Capital Needs

Our ability to implement this business model, develop and launch a comprehensive website and market our products and services is dependent upon our ability to raise sufficient capital. As described later in this report, we have determined we need to raise approximately $2,500,000 for general operating capital, including funds necessary to hire and compensate executive and other employees, as well as for IT development, including staffing, support and equipment, advertising and marketing, expansion of business operations, and general working capital. Although we have received approximately $345,000 convertible promissory notes during 2016, we do not have any firm commitments to provide the balance of this capital and there are no assurances we will be successful in raising the necessary capital. In that event, our ability to fully implement our business model and begin generating revenues from our operations would be in jeopardy.
Competition

Most of our competitors are well-established networks and have substantially greater financial resources than we have. However these large companies are Bio Pharmaceutical companies with two such companies, Palatin Technologies and AMAG Pharmaceutical partnering on a female sexual dysfunction product that has completed phase 3 trials. These two companies expect to go through FDA approval process to bring their product to market as an FDA approved drug and will begin the FDA process in the middle to end of 2018. It usually takes about 2 years to get through the FDA approval process without certainty of getting final approval. MJTV will be bringing VOLUPTAS to the market as an over the counter product and will not be making any specific medical claims. Additionally, their delivery method is an auto-inject EPI Pen into the womans stomach. Our delivery method is a non-invasive squirt sublingual (under the tongue). We feel strongly that we will be to market

before Palatin and AMAG and our delivery method will be widely accepted compared to an injection into the stomach. Other competitors include sex dust (tree bark powder) that has been considered not effective with side effects like upset stomach and vomiting. ADI is also on the market as an FDA approved female sexual dysfunction drug but is also not considered very effective which has led to very limited sales. There is also an established market for essential oils making entry of LUNA and other soon to be developed essential oil mixtures difficult for MJTV to penetrate and gain market share in this essential oil segment There are no assurances, however, we will ever effectively compete in our target market.

Government regulation

While there are currently relatively few laws or regulations directly applicable to Internet access, commerce, or commercial search activity, there is increasing awareness and concern regarding some uses of the Internet and other online services, leading federal, state, local, and international governments to consider adopting civil and criminal laws and regulations, amending existing laws and regulations, conducting investigations, or commencing litigation with respect to the Internet and other online services covering issues such as:

·
 user privacy;
 ·
 trespass;
 ·
 defamation;
 ·
 database and data protection;
 ·
 limitations on the distribution of materials considered harmful to children;
 ·
 liability for misinformation provided over the web;
 ·
 user protection, pricing, taxation, and advertising restrictions (including, for example, limitation on the advertising on Internet gambling websites or of certain products);
 ·
 delivery of contextual advertisements via connected desktop software;
 ·
 intellectual property ownership and infringement, including liability for listing or linking to third-party websites that include materials infringing copyrights or other rights;
 ·
 distribution, characteristics, and quality of products and services; and

other consumer protection laws.

Legislation has also been introduced in the U.S. Congress and some state legislatures that is designed to regulate spyware, which does not have a precise definition, but which is often defined as software installed on consumers' computers without their informed consent and designed to gather and, in some cases, disseminate information about those consumers, including personally identifiable information. We do not expect to rely on spyware for any purpose, and it will not be part of our product offerings, but the definition of spyware or proposed legislation relating to spyware may be broadly defined or interpreted to include legitimate ad-serving software, including toolbar offerings and other downloadable software currently provided by our product offerings. Currently, legislation has focused on providing Internet users with notification of and the ability to consent or decline the installation of such software, but there can be no guarantee that future legislation will not provide more burdensome standards by which software can be downloaded onto consumers' computers. We expect that all downloadable software that we will distribute will require an express consent of the consumer and will provide consumers with an easy mechanism to delete the software once downloaded. However, if future legislation is adopted that makes the consent, notice, or uninstall procedures more onerous, we may have to develop new technology or methods to provide our services or discontinue those services in some jurisdictions or altogether. There is no guarantee we will be able to develop this new technology at all or in a timely fashion or on commercially reasonable terms. The adoption of any additional laws or regulations, application of existing laws to the Internet generally or our industry, or any governmental investigation or litigation related to the Internet generally, our industry, or our services may decrease the growth of the Internet or other online services. 

Intellectual property

We rely on a combination of copyright, trademark and trade secret laws and restrictions on disclosure to protect our intellectual property rights. Our success will depend on the protection of the proprietary aspects of our technology as well as our ability to operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of others. We expect to also enter into proprietary information and confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants and commercial partners and control access to, and distribution of, our product formulations and other proprietary information.

Employees

As of December 31, 2016, we have 2 full time employees, and Company operations are being conducted at our corporate offices in Whippany, New Jersey. The Company has also engaged the services of a Brand Ambassador to help brand and market MJTVs two current products as well as new product offerings to be added in the future.

Our history

We were organized under the laws of the State of Delaware on December 30, 2010 under the name Spicy Gourmet International, Inc. as part of the implementation of the Chapter 11 plan of reorganization of Spicy Gourmet Organics, Inc. ("SGO"), a California corporation. SGO was incorporated in the State of California in 2006 and was formed to import specialty, organic spices from South Asia and sell them in the United States. SGO was undercapitalized and sales of its spice products were slow to develop, possibly due to the recession in the 2007-2008 time period. As a result, SGO lacked sufficient cash flow to meet its current obligations and on October 1, 2010 SGO filed a voluntary petition for bankruptcy under Chapter 11 in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Central District of California. SGO's plan of reorganization was confirmed by the Court on November 19, 2010.

The plan of reorganization provided for the acquisition by SGO of a new, unrelated, retail business and the spin-off of all of the various elements of SGO's spice business to four different entities. The plan of reorganization called for the spin-off of SGO's manufacturing business to our company, the incorporation of our company, and the distribution of shares of our common stock to the bankruptcy creditors. The plan required us to issue 1,180,000 shares of our common stock and distribute these to SGO's general unsecured creditors, to its administrative creditors, and to its shareholders. The shares were distributed pursuant to Section 1145 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.

The Court also ordered the distribution of warrants to all administrative creditors of SGO, with these creditors to receive five warrants exercisable into shares of our common stock for each $0.05 of SGO's administrative debt which they held. These creditors received an aggregate of 5,000,000 warrants consisting of:

·
 1,000,000 "A Warrants" each convertible into one share of common stock at an exercise price of $3.00;
 ·
 1,000,000 "B Warrants" each convertible into one share of common stock at an exercise price of $4.00;
 ·
 1,000,000 "C Warrants" each convertible into one share of common stock at an exercise price of $5.00;
 ·
 1,000,000 "D Warrants" each convertible into one share of common stock at an exercise price of $6.00; and
 ·
 1,000,000 "E Warrants" each convertible into one share of common stock at an exercise price of $7.00.

All warrants are exercisable at any time prior to November 19, 2017 as a result of a two-year extension. This warrants distribution also took place on December 30, 2010. During October 2012, we agreed to reduce the exercise price of the outstanding warrants to $0.25 per share. 

We were a shell company as that term is defined in the Securities Act of 1933 from our date of incorporation until October 2012.

On October 20, 2012, we acquired from James M. Palladino, then an unrelated third party, the URL domain name and websites of bullsnbears.com for $150,000. Following this asset purchase we were no longer considered a shell company. On October 23, 2012, our former officers and directors resigned and certain of the then officers and directors were appointed, with the balance of our directors being newly appointed in December 2012.

In November 2012 we changed our name to BullsnBears.com, Inc. Effective December 11, 2015, we changed our name to Michael James Enterprises, Inc., and entered into an Agreement for Plan of Merger and Reorganization between the Company and Michael James Enterprises, Inc., a Nevada corporation. On August 4, 2016, the Company changed its direction and decided to acquire RP Capital Group, Ltd. and all of its intellectual property associated with a Dronabinol based treatment for sleep apnea. Additionally, the Company decided to develop and bring to market a female sexual arousal enhancer  VOLUPTAS. Trademark and patents were filed and the Company is currently in the process of securing $2,500,000 of funding to manufacture and bring to market this product. There is no guarantee these funds will be raised.

The Company's wholly-owned subsidiary, BullsnBears Holdings, Inc., was spun off spun-off on December 28, 2016 through a share dividend to BNBI shareholders of record as of the close of business on December 28, 2016, with one share of BullsnBears Holdings Common Stock distributed for each one share of MJTV Common Stock owned as of the record date. Distribution of the shares is the responsibility of Bullsn Bears Holdings, Inc. and will take place upon the effectiveness of a Registration Statement filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
