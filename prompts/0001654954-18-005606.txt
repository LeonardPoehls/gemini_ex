 Overview
  
  Overview of MEDITE Cancer Diagnostics, Inc.
  
 MEDITE Cancer Diagnostics, Inc. (the “Company”, “MEDITE”, “it”, “we”, or “us”), formerly CytoCore, Inc., develops, manufactures, markets and sells MEDITE branded products (instruments and consumables), in the areas of histology and cytology. These premium medical devices and consumables are for detection, risk assessment and diagnosis of cancerous and precancerous conditions and related diseases. Depending upon the type of cancer, segments within the current target market of approximately $5.8 billion are growing at annual rates between 10% and 30%. The well-established brand of MEDITE is widely known and remains a professional description of the Company’s business. The Company’s trading symbol is “MDIT”.
  
 In 2017 the Company focused on implementation of several growth opportunities including enhanced distribution of core products through focused sales and distribution channels, newly developed patented assays, new laboratory devices and several marketing projects like the introduction of the SureCyte C1 fluorogenic stain worldwide. The Company has approximately 64 employees in two countries, a distribution network in over 80 countries and a wide range of products for anatomic pathology, histology and cytology laboratories available for sale.
  
 China is an important market to the Company and we have addressed several product quality issues described under Revenue and Results of Operations elsewhere within this Report.  The Company has addressed most of the product, service and training issues in China.  Sales in China for 2017 were $85,000 compared to approximately $1 million for 2016.  There are two reasons for the lower number in 2017: 1. Legacy product quality issues from 2016 and early 2017, and 2. Inability to deliver products because of lack of working capital. The Company expects to grow business in China in 2018 and going forward.
  
 The Company’s cytology product line (non-Gyn and Gyn applications) revenue was lower in Europe during 2017 because product was not available to ship to meet demand, due to working capital constraints. The Company is in the process of moving forward the submission of an application to the US Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) for SureThin Gyn applications. The Company will be able to compete with the dominant suppliers in this $600 million market and target major strategic lab partners. The impact of the gynecology segment SureThin solution in the US market will drive significant new revenue and gross margin improvement opportunities moving forward.
  
 The patented self-collection device SoftKit targets the growing POC (Point of Care) market. Growth in this area is due to consumer-driven health care requirements and the necessity to support and address incremental patient population needs for screening and ongoing diagnostic tests. SoftKit is planned to be sold through various marketing channels that serve the gynecology consumer health and emerging post-acute care space. The Company is currently developing a study plan with a major research center in the Midwest, with the goal of submitting for FDA approval.
  
 Management believes that 2017 developments allowed the Company to more fully leverage the products and biomarker solutions from the original CytoCore component of MEDITE. The first entry is the introduction of the SureCyte C1 fluorogenic instant stain, offering tremendous opportunities for lab efficiencies and enhanced patient care. C1 is the first of many new offerings under the SureCyte brand that will ultimately include algorithms for computer-assisted analysis and advanced assays for micro-environment analysis. The Company is currently conducting informal studies with several labs in the U.S. and Europe and is also conducting a formal study with a hospital in China in partnership with UNIC. CI has recently received the CE Mark in the EU.
  
 As part of early SureCyte marketing activities, the Company is working with numerous U.S. and European Key Opinion Leaders (KOLs) and clinical sites to test the C1 stain, provide feedback on the overall product line plans, and to create white papers and publish articles in highly-recognized peer-reviewed journals and conferences.
  
 The Company will begin manufacturing its new cryostat line during the second quarter of 2018 and has already taken some customer orders. This enhanced microtome and cryostat product line will allow MEDITE to meet the anticipated demand for these instruments as well as enhance its worldwide distribution channel through its suppliers including China.

 | Cytology - Cancer screening and diagnostics based on the structures of individual cells


 
 Cancers and precancerous conditions are defined in terms of structural abnormalities in cells. For this reason, cytology is widely used for the detection of such conditions while histology is typically used for the confirmation, identification and characterization of the cellular abnormalities detected by cytology. Other diagnostic methods such as marker-based assays provide additional information that can supplement, but which cannot replace cytology and histology. The trend towards more personalized treatment of cancer increases the need for cytology, histology and assays for identifying and testing the best treatment alternatives. The Company believes that this segment will therefore be increasingly important for future development of strategies to fight the “cancer epidemic” (World Health Organization: World Cancer Report 2014) which expects about a 50 % increase in cancer cases worldwide within the next 20 years.
  
 This segment sees a trend toward, and demand for, higher automation for more throughput in bigger laboratories, process standardization, digitalization of cell and tissue slides and computer-aided diagnostic systems, and in general a search for more cost-effective solutions.
  
 MEDITE acts as a one-stop-shop for histology (also known as anatomic pathology) laboratories either as part of a hospital, as part of a chain of laboratories or individually. It is one out of only four companies offering all equipment and consumables for these laboratories worldwide. The MEDITE brand stands for innovative and high-quality products – most equipment is made in Germany – and competitive pricing.
  
 For the cytology market, MEDITE offers a wide range of consumable products and equipment; in particular for liquid-based-cytology which is an important tool in cancer screening and detection in the field of cervical, bladder, breast, lung and other cancer types.
  
 All of the Company’s operations during the reporting period were conducted and managed within this segment, with management team reporting directly to the Chief Executive Office. For information on revenues, profit or loss and total assets, among other financial data, attributable to operations, see the consolidated financial statements included herein. Further during 2017 the Company added key personnel with excellent historical performance in new product commercialization, sales development and internal operations improvement.
  
  Outlook
  
 Due to promising innovative new products for cancer risk assessment and an increasing number of distribution contracts executed in recent years, management believes the profitability and cash-flow of the business will grow and improve. Significant on-going manufacturing issues have been identified and addressed, and additional operating expenditures may be necessary to manufacture and market new and existing products to achieve the accelerated sales growth targets outlined in the Company’s business plan. To realize the planned growth potential, management will focus its efforts on 1.) Finishing and gaining approval for the products currently under development, 2.) Increasing sales in the U.S. to optimize the excellent sales/distribution channels available there and 3.) Invigorate the distribution networks for EU/ROW and continue to expand Chinese market sales by broadening the Company’s collaboration with the local distributor UNIC. The Company also will work on continuously optimizing manufacturing capacity and planning to increase gross margin. Implementation of these plans are contingent upon securing additional debt and/or equity financing, which was partly completed through May 2018 (see Subsequent Events). If the Company is unable to obtain additional capital or generate profitable sales revenues, we may be required to curtail product development and other activities. The consolidated financial statements presented herein do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.
  
 Currently, the Company’s sales are primarily generated in Euro currency. In 2017 the average EUR-USD exchange rate was 1.129507 compared to 1.10730 for 2016 (ODNDA) a significant increase. The stronger Euro (and increasing lately to 1.19 against USD) is favorable to revenue reporting since 90% of the Company’s revenue is in Euro, but also increases COGS for products sold in the U.S. and other countries conducting business in USD (including China). Overall, the stronger Euro is favorable to revenue reporting.

  Background
  
 The Company was incorporated in Delaware in December 1998 as the successor to Bell National Corporation, a company incorporated in California in 1958. In December 1998, Bell National, which was then a shell corporation, acquired InPath, LLC, a development stage company engaged in the design and development of products used in screening for cervical and other types of cancer. For accounting purposes, the acquisition was treated as if InPath had acquired Bell National. However, Bell National continued as the legal entity and the registrant for Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) filing purposes. Bell National merged into Ampersand Medical Corporation, its wholly-owned subsidiary, in May 1999, in order to change its state of incorporation to Delaware. In September 2001, Ampersand acquired 100% of the outstanding stock of AccuMed International, Inc., by means of a merger of AccuMed into the wholly-owned subsidiary. Shortly after the AccuMed merger, we changed our name to Molecular Diagnostics, Inc. Subsequently, in June 2006, we changed our name to CytoCore, Inc.
  
 On January 11, 2014, MEDITE Cancer Diagnostics, Inc. (formerly CytoCore Inc. the “Company”) entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”) with MEDITE Enterprises, Inc., a Florida corporation (“MEDITE”), MEDITE GmbH, a corporation organized under the laws of Germany and wholly owned by MEDITE (the “Subsidiary”), Michael Ott and Michaela Ott, the sole shareholders of the MEDITE at that time (collectively, the “Shareholders”).
  
 Pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, the Company agreed to acquire 100% of the issued and outstanding capital stock of MEDITE from the Shareholders in exchange for the issuance of up to 15,000,000 shares of the Company’s common stock (the “Shares”) to the Shareholders. The Purchase Agreement also provides that the Shareholders will indemnify the Company for certain losses during the one-year period following the “Closing” as defined in the Purchase Agreement. In connection with such indemnification rights, the Purchase Agreement provided that 3,750,000 of the Shares was deposited with the Company and held for a period of 12 months to cover certain indemnification claims that the Company may have against the Shareholders.  These shares were released to the Shareholders during 2015.
  
 Closing of the acquisition of MEDITE was conditioned upon: (i) the completion of a private placement transaction resulting in gross cash proceeds to the Company of $1.25 million (the “Private Placement”), and (ii) the conversion of certain accrued wages of the Company into shares of the Company’s common stock. In addition, as of the Closing, there was to be no more than 18,750,000 shares of the Company’s common stock exclusive of any shares of the Company’s common stock issued in connection with the Private Placement.
  
 On April 3, 2014, pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Purchase Agreement, as amended to date, the Company acquired 100% of the issued and outstanding capital stock of MEDITE in exchange for the issuance of up to 15,000,000 shares of the Company’s common stock to the Shareholders, of which 14,687,500 shares were issued upon the Closing of the Acquisition. In the event that the Company issued less than $2,500,000 at a price of $1.60 in the Private Placement, the Company was required to issue an additional 312,500 shares of common stock to the Shareholders. The Company issued these shares during 2015. Also during 2014, prior to the reverse merger, the Company issued 697,234 shares of common stock for payment of certain accrued wages of the Company.
  
  Recent Developments
  
 In January, 2018 the Company raised $150,000 in additional capital under the same terms as described in the Subordinate Convertible Notes see Note 6. 
  
 Also in January, 2018 the Company received a term sheet for additional debt financing, consisting of a convertible note with an initial conversion price of $0.075 per share.  Each $0.075 invested also receives one Common Stock share.  The Convertible Notes are subordinate to the GBP debt described in the GPB Debt Holdings II, LLC (“GPB”) Convertible Notes Payable see Note 6, have a 5-year maturity date and bear a 12% annual interest rate, payable semi-annually.  The Company received $1,955,000 in capital and issued 26,066,667 common stock shares under these terms as of May 17, 2018.

 On October 16, 2016 the Company filed a Form D to issue up to $6.9 million of convertible secured promissory notes and approximately 5.3 million warrants to issue common stock at $0.60 a share.
  
  On October 26, 2016, the board of directors appointed David E. Patterson to the position of Chief Executive Officer and Director of the Company. Pursuant to Mr. Patterson’s executive employment agreement with the Company, the commencement date of Mr. Patterson’s appointment was October 31, 2016. He was granted 250,000 restricted shares of the Company’s common stock (the “Shares”). The Company valued the Shares at $0.50 per share, based on the fair value of the stock on the date of grant. On November 5, 2017, the Board of Directors (the “Board”) of the Company held a meeting whereby David E. Patterson informed the Board of his decision to retire as Chief Executive Officer of the Company and resign his position as Chairman of the Board and Board member of the Company, all effective immediately. The Board approved a Transition Agreement whereby Mr. Patterson would receive three equal monthly payments with each payment being equal to his monthly salary, and all future restricted stock grants in the amount of 166,667 shares pursuant to his employment agreement would fully vest as of January 1, 2018 and be issued in consideration for assisting the Company through a transition period. Mr. Patterson rescinded those shares in March 2018.
  
 Thereafter, the Board, by unanimous consent, appointed current Board member, William Austin Lewis IV, to the position of Chairman of the Board of Directors of Company to serve until such time as his removal or resignation.
  
 Also, Stephen Von Rump was appointed by a unanimous vote of the Board to the position of Chief Executive Officer of the Company upon the same terms and conditions as his current employment, to serve until his resignation or removal.
  
 On November 12, 2017, the Board of Directors of the Company held a meeting whereby they appointed Joel Kanter, age 61, to the position of Director to serve until such time as his resignation or termination. Mr. Kanter’s appointment fills the vacancy created by the resignation of David E. Patterson.
  
 On January 2, 2018, the Board accepted Susan Weisman’s resignation as Chief Financial Officer. Ms. Weisman received a lump sum payment in consideration for assisting the Company through a transition period ending on January 31, 2018.
  
 The Company filed a Form D on March 7, 2017, initiating a total offering of $4,250,000, of which $25,000 in stock subscription were received by the Company as of December 31, 2017, representing the purchase of 50,000 shares of common stock.
  
 During the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company issued 5,060,000 shares of common stock for $2,530,000, less $187,000 of issuance costs. In connection with the issuance of common stock, the Company issued 2,530,000 warrants to purchase shares of common stock at $0.50, for a term of 5 years. We also issued 50,000 shares from stock subscriptions of $25,000 at December 31, 2016 and issued 25,000 warrants on the same terms and conditions.

  Description of Business
  
 MEDITE manufactures, develops, markets and sells a wide range of laboratory devices and consumable supplies for its target market in the histology and cytology cancer diagnostics segment. Most devices are manufactured at its German facility, and most consumables are staged for export there. This facility also acts as central location managing all international sales and logistics outside of the Americas. A direct sales force is employed in Germany and the U.S, and over 80 more countries worldwide are covered with an existing and continuously expanding network of independent distributors. In the U.S. MEDITE has established sales and distribution channels that will prioritize its products.
  
 A general goal of MEDITE in sales is to act as a one- stop-shop for its customers. Instrument purchases are usually bigger investments, with prices sometimes above the $50,000 level, which are more seasonal and depend significantly on investment budgets. Therefore, MEDITE also offers to sell the day to day consumables and sees its brand not just on the devices, but also on the supply products.
  
 The U.S. headquarters in Orlando, Florida manages the Company worldwide and is developing, establishing and realizing the strategic goals of the Company. It also acts as distributor for the Americas, maintaining a warehouse with instruments, repair parts and consumables available for sale and for warranty obligations to its customers, and taking care of centralized marketing, regulatory issues and finance. A second location in the U.S. operates as our research laboratory for cancer assays and other cytology developments and is located in the Chicago area.  
  
 For sales, MEDITE targets three major areas; U.S., Europe and China, and now increasingly Eastern Europe and North Africa. While the U.S. is currently the largest potential market for MEDITE products, it is expected that the rest-of-world will experience continued growth through 2018 due to the more established presence of MEDITE in those markets.
  
 Currently, MEDITE’s principal customers are histology and cytology laboratories associated with hospitals or research institutions and independent laboratories in markets with direct sales and distributors in markets covered by them. In the U.S. market, MEDITE executed several distribution contracts with third party sales organizations additional to its direct sales. 
  
 For manufacturing of its high-quality devices at the German facility, an enterprise resource planning software is used to manage the material flow and production planning for about 6,000 different parts. Management has evaluated and is in the process finalizing its review of a company-wide system anticipated to be implemented by the late 2018. Due to the wide range of products, the availability of all parts is essential to finish a manufactured product within an acceptable lead time. Smaller equipment items and all consumable products have to be available at any time to guarantee the customer continues to work. Usually orders of these goods are shipped within 24 hours after receiving the order, while for own-manufactured equipment, the delivery times is between 4 to 8weeks. This is not acceptable to many customers and the Company continues to implement production planning processes to improve delivery time. A major change in 2018 is that the Company now plans and builds to forecast, whereas it previously built mostly to confirmed orders (backlog).

 The Company’s strategy is to use its pipeline of newly developed and currently under development of innovative devices, consumables and newly developed assays to set new standards in the industry, create new markets and to take over additional market shares from its competition. These new offerings will further allow MEDITE to develop significant strategic relationships to enhance sales and revenue growth.
  
  Products
  
  Histology
  
 MEDITE offers its customers a comprehensive range of histology laboratory devices for processing tissue, from receiving the tissue in the laboratory to the final diagnosis. Most important to this segment are very high levels of reliability, efficiency, and safety.
  
 Starting from receiving the biopsies, it may be necessary to decalcify them; for example, from bone tissue. The USE 33 is an ultrasonic decalcification instrument that automatically runs the process under controlled temperatures.  Due to this innovative technology it can increase the speed of decalcification by 300% compared to just using acid.  Instead of days or even weeks, the biopsies are ready much earlier for further processing, which shortens the patient’s diagnosis wait time. This specific instrument also is often used in research labs.
  
 The next step is the tissue processing (dehydration and fixation), which usually runs automatically in the laboratory overnight with no human supervision. MEDITE’s TPC 15 Duo and Trio instruments offer a very high capacity of 440 or 660 biopsies per run and also offer two or three independent protocols. Therefore, depending on the size and kind of tissue, it can process simultaneously the different steps, and therefore replace two or three instruments of similar competitor’s instruments. It also offers a very high level of safety. In the unlikely situation of an error or just a power outage, it has a back-up battery, and the emergency mode puts the biopsies into a safe position. An advantage of this kind if tissue processer is the usability with Xylene replacements like Isopropanol, a second-grade alcohol The European Unit is proposing to ban Xylene in laboratories and so the TPC15 is the perfect unit to do so. Competitor systems with pumps have a higher risk in using Isopropanol. The price of the unit is very competitive in its market based on its high capacity.
  
 After tissue processing, the tissue will be transferred into a paraffin block using an embedding center. MEDITE was the original inventor of the three-piece units (heating, dispensing, and cooling). It is much more flexible to adapt to human and laboratory needs. While the dispensing unit usually is in the center, the others can be added to the right or left depending if right or left handed. Additional cooling units can also be added to extend the capacity. MEDITE offer two types: the low-cost set TES 99 when budget matters, and the high-end version TES Valida when design and technology is more important. The TES Valida is recognized as the best system currently available worldwide. Every histology lab has at least one system, but usually two or more of these embedding centers in place – historically the market consists of sales of several thousand units each year.
  
 With the paraffin block from the embedding center, the biopsy needs to be sectioned using a microtome. Several types of automation are demanded by the market; on the low end a manual microtome, in the middle a semi-automatic version, and on the high end, a fully automatic microtome. For a microtome, the most critical functionality is extremely precise mechanics able to cut slices of as small as 1 microns in thickness. Five years ago, MEDITE developed the semi-automatic version M530 first, then the fully automatic version A550 and started in 2014 the development of the manual version M380 – mainly for the Chinese market – of which the first production of these units was sold in August 2015. Since 2016, the microtomy manufacturing has operated in a second German facility in Nussloch where the roots of worldwide microtomy started with skilled employees. Since the new versions of all three types of microtomes have been brought to the market with growing success. For China, a special type of manual microtome M380 was developed to match the unique usage characteristics of histotechnologists there. As part of tissue sectioning, a freezing microtome called a “cryostat” can be used for fast biopsies when a patient needs a diagnosis immediately e.g. still being in the operational theater. Prototypes of the M630 were tested in the field in 2017 and manufacturing of the first set of this instrument will start in 2Q 2018. Based on the forecast with direct and incremental sales we expect to sell 75 units within the first year. The Company’s strategic goal for the cryostat is to offer a high-quality device for a competitive price to win 10% of the market (750 units annually).
  
 When the sections of the tissue are transferred to a microscopy slide they undergo a staining process with several different protocols depending on the type of tissue. To manage high volumes, robotic multi-staining systems are used. MEDITE offers the most flexible system, TST 44, which is computer controlled and can run several staining protocols simultaneously, and its unique feature software can even overtake slower with faster protocols. The maximum capacity is about 400 slides per hour with that system. This robotic stainer is currently going through an update and modernization project during 2018. This includes the latest innovative technology software, new color touch screen, new X-Y-Z robotic technology and a modern newly designed case. For higher volume throughput, e.g. for cytology laboratories, MEDITE offers the COT 20 linear staining system using a kind of conveyor technology to realize a capacity of over 1,000 slides per hour.

 The final step to the process is to place a cover over the tissue on the stained microscope slide to preserve it for many years and make it ready for digital scanning or directly for diagnoses under the microscope by a pathologist. MEDITE offers the RCM 9000, the latest version of a stand-alone robotic coverslipper using glass coverslips. Another option MEDITE developed is the ACS 720 glass coverslipper which is connected directly to the TST 44 multi-stainer creating a higher level of automation by bridging the former manual step between two separate instruments. This instrument combination – known in the industry as a “combi” - is very competitive and more and more public tenders are asking for it. Finally, to also support higher throughput laboratories, MEDITE developed the robotic coverslipper TWISTER using a clear film instead of cover glass. This triples the capacity of a glass coverslipper up to 1,200 slides per hour.
  
 Several smaller devices for stretching, drying, cooling, exhausting, recycling, printing etc. are also manufactured by MEDITE but not specifically described herein. These products are usually competing mainly on price, but quality is still important.
  
 In the segment of histology consumables, MEDITE offers everything necessary to run its instruments and to run the complete histology laboratory. This includes embedding cassettes, microscope slides, paraffin, staining solutions, reagents and other products. Some of the consumable products are MEDITE developments and exclusively manufactured by or for it. Other products are MEDITE branded but manufactured and delivered from external high-quality vendors. The procurement focus therefore is on high quality, not lowest price.
   Cytology
  
 The product strategy of MEDITE in this market is to offer products for the whole process, from cell collection through processing to diagnosis.
  
 Some of the histology processing instruments of MEDITE are also used in cytology labs, like the staining and coverslipping systems.  Characteristics of the sample collected determine the quality of the results of any tests performed on the sample. The sensitivity and/or accuracy of a test is, for example, likely to be reduced if the sample collection device or method does not capture a sufficient amount of the target analyte, alters the analyte of interest, or collects significant quantities of substances that interfere with the analysis. One of the Company’s major areas for product development is in sample collection for specific cells and tissues.
  
 Cervical cytology specimens have traditionally been prepared as “smears” where the cells on the collecting device are literally wiped or smeared onto a microscope slide. In the 1980s, an alternative method, variously called a “monolayer” or “liquid-based” preparation (“LBP”), was introduced. In this method, cells are washed off of the collection device into a preservative solution to form a cell suspension. A portion of this cell suspension is then transferred to a microscope slide. LBPs presently account for about 80% of the cervical cytology slides prepared in the U.S., but despite the technical benefits of LBPs, only about 20% of the cervical cytology slides in the European Union and much lower percentages in the rest of the world are prepared in this manner. The primary limitations to greater adoption of LBPs outside of the U.S. are the high equipment and ancillary supply costs associated with the two predominant LBP methods. With the acquisition of MEDITE, the Company sells two alternative LBP methods product lines, the SureThin line which is competing against the market leader Hologic, and the SafePrep line which is competing against the second largest market player Becton-Dickinson. Both product lines cover the complete set of consumables necessary to preserve, extract and process cells onto a microscopic slide. For the SureThin line, MEDITE also offers a processing device automatically extracting the cells from the preservative vial and transferring it on the slide. Both systems have a significantly lower price than the competition, which is increasingly important for some markets like the US, where a cytology laboratory needs to lower its cost due to lower reimbursement rates. This lower price level itself also creates new markets, where it is now more affordable even to smaller laboratories and can better compete against the traditional Pap smear. Once a cytology specimen has been deposited onto a microscope slide, it is stained in order to assist the cytologist in detecting and identifying the various features of the deposited cells that are relevant to determining whether the cells are normal, dysplastic or cancerous.

 The Company is also now developing a new suite of products called SureCyte as part of its digital pathology strategy, including a new stain called C1 for use in many cytology and histology screening and diagnostic applications. The new morphology stain is intended for use as a direct replacement for the Pap and H&E stains used in most cytological and histological tests. It will initially be introduced for use in tests where the specimens are evaluated visually with formulations for use with our automated slide imaging and analysis system and possibly also flow cytometer systems to follow. 
  
 As mentioned above, we are developing a family of immunocytological assays that combine the measurement of bio molecular cancer markers and cell morphology in a single test. These assays are intended to detect the presence of specific proteins and other markers that are indicative of the presence of a target disease, allow characterization of abnormal cells, or provide an estimate of the risk of disease progression. These assays are specifically designed to be compatible with the C1 stain and may be evaluated using our automated slide imaging and analysis system. An added benefit of C1 is that after the specimen has been evaluated, it can be counterstained with a Pap or other conventional stain for manual confirmation or archiving. Internal laboratory tests show a very high level of specificity and sensitivity, and the Company currently is preparing a strategy for the clinical evaluation. A system like this has the potential to displace the current expensive HPV testing methods by offering a significantly higher specificity and sensitivity, which management believes offers a significant market opportunity.
  
  Over the last few years, the MEDITE developed software for an imaging system for computer aided diagnosis of slides including its new C1 stain and its revolutionary new biomarker-based SureCyte assays. The intent of a medical screening system like this is to differentiate between patients who show no evidence of the target disease state (“normal”) and those who do (“abnormal”). Patients who have abnormal screening results are offered follow-up testing to confirm, diagnose, classify and determine the extent of disease and, where appropriate, determine the appropriate treatment. Patients who have a normal screening result are not offered these services. To allow scarce medical resources to be focused upon those patients having the greatest need, screening programs are structured to differentiate between normal and abnormal patients as accurately, rapidly, reliably and cost effectively as possible.
  
 The Company also is looking at new ways to analyze the SureCyte data, for example ploidy analysis (popular in China) and micronuclei counting. These have both been touted as alternatives to regular PAP analysis.
  
 The new C1 stain is also expected to work in Non-GYN applications (e.g. lung, bladder, thyroid and other cancers) and for Non-GYN imaging together with the SureThin consumables and processing units.
  
 The Company is also developing a new sample self-collection product called SoftKit, which is a low-cost disposable device for the self-collection of a sample that can be evaluated to provide an assessment of the health of the entire female genital tract. The Company has filed and issued patents in multiple countries.   The Company plans to finish the final design of SoftKit in 2018, which can be used for the collection of cellular samples that can potentially be screened for a variety of gynecological cancers (including cervical, endometrial, and ovarian), and for the collection of gynecological samples to be tested for the presence of HPV and variety of gynecological cancers and additional indications such as sexually transmitted disease (“STD”) testing. SoftKit addresses several market niches and segments that are not supported effectively by traditional gynecological sampling devices. SoftKit is designed to eliminate the need for assistance from a medical professional when collecting gynecological samples for many screening applications. The Company believes that this feature, in addition to the range of tests that can be performed on a SoftKit sample and SoftKit’s low cost, make it particularly attractive for use in large scale public health screening programs.
  
  Product Development and Research
  
 With the acquisition of MEDITE, the Company currently employs 11 full-time equivalents for software, electrical and mechanical design engineers. The strategic goal is to optimize development processes to shorten the development period and time to market for several ongoing and new R&D projects.
  
 MEDITE’s product development department is including engineering skills and technology in software development, multilayer circuit board design, electrical design, 3-D product design in (using CREO design software), technical regulatory documentation, often individually for different countries worldwide, and quality management based on its ISO 9001 certificate.
  
 The main focus of the development team during 2017 was working on innovative and new products like the cryostat M630 and the film coverslipper TWISTER, a cytology processor and several updates and modernization projects for existing instruments.
  
 In addition, a team of experienced researchers in biochemistry, with successful track records and a very high reputation in that segment, are working on special stains and assays for detection of pre-cancerous and cancerous conditions in cytology and histology. Some of these developed products are currently undergoing the commercialization process, starting with field studies and are expected to be rolled out in the near term.

  Markets and Marketing Objectives
  
 As described also in other paragraphs of this report, our target is basically the worldwide cancer diagnostics market. Currently we serve in particular the histology and cytology segments of this total market, but we are open to entering other cancer diagnostics segments in the future when attractive economically. The total annual market volume of histology and cytology is approximately $5.8 billion with annual growth rates between 10 and 30% depending on the specific market, cancer segment and country. 
  
  Cancer is a major threat for mankind and the recently published “World Cancer Report 2014” by the World Health Organization, states that the number of cases will increase world-wide by about 57% to 22 million cases in the next two decades. At the same time cancer deaths will rise from 8.2 million to 13 million per year.
  
 MEDITE’s current and future products will assist in the detection of precancerous and cancerous conditions and provide the basis for more efficient and cost-effective diagnosis. The net effect of utilizing MEDITE’s anatomic pathology (tissue based) and cytology (cell based) products may result in more lives saved at lower costs.
  
 While distributing currently into approximately 80 countries of the world, the Company’s sales and marketing efforts are in particular focused on the three major markets of U.S., China and Europe.
  
 Currently the target groups are the histology and cytology laboratories as end users. In Germany and (in some cases) the U.S. it sells directly to these laboratories, while in other countries it sells indirectly to them through its international network of distributors. Several of the products currently being developed by the Company may also be sold to national health programs and/or non-governmental public health agencies, or possibly directly to consumers. The Company use several means like sales and technical training, advertising materials, special offers etc. to motivate its distributors selling MEDITE products. Depending on local markets, the contact to public health care organizations or other public authorities responsible for purchasing medical product is important. While in many markets the laboratories directly can decide about purchases, in others they have to undergo a tender process.
  
 Worldwide, approximately 180 million Pap and 60 million breast cancer screening tests are performed annually. The potential market is approximately 1.5 to 1.8 billion women for each of these tests. Bio-molecular screening, diagnostic, and treatment products consequently are being developed to detect disease states early, so they can be dealt with before they become life threatening and expensive to treat. The Company is designing and developing products to satisfy this paradigm shift and focus more on diagnostic methods and tools for early detection.
   With the new products currently in the late stages of their development and/or regulatory processes, like the SureThin US gynecological (gyn) application or the SoftKit, the Company is targeting different groups of end-users and establishing the logistics needed to reach and support these users. Similarly, in addition to marketing to laboratories, the SoftKit is expected to be marketed to public health agencies as well as being directly marketed to the patient to motivate them to purchase it on the internet, a pharmacy or similar facility. MEDITE will continue to adjust its marketing to the specific needs of each product group.
  
 For the cytology and histology laboratories, the Company distributes national or international product catalogs each year with a wide overview of the related product lines. These are available in English, German and Polish languages and offered as export catalogs to its international distributors who translate them into the appropriate local languages. The catalogs are sent directly to the laboratories where MEDITE is selling directly. The Company has their products also featured on their websites for sales and distribution of information.
  
 MEDITE also attends several local, national and international exhibition and congresses which are segment-specific or medical product-orientated like the NSH in the U.S., the ECP in Europe, the Arab Health exhibition in Dubai, the Medica exhibition in Germany and many more. 
  
  Sales and Distribution
  
 The Company is distributing its products to over 80 countries worldwide while focusing on the three major areas of U.S., Europe and China.
  
 Depending on their experience, strength in their local market and potential sales volume, MEDITE uses exclusive or non-exclusive distribution national contracts. Due to the fact that three of the major competitors, Leica, Thermo and Sakura are changing their distribution strategy more towards direct sales, several well-established independent distributors with both international and national sales coverage have shown increased interest to sell MEDITE products as a priority offering versus other products lines.

 MEDITE in the U.S. has deepened selling and marketing relationships with two major marketing leaders with national distribution channels. One of the companies is a publicly traded international firm with a market cap of several billion. MEDITE is their chosen provider of Histology and Cytology solutions. While until now the Company has not realized the full potential of this distribution channel, it is working to gain its share of this market. A second distribution channel in the U.S. is selling MEDITE products through other established sales organizations, utilizing their sales agreements with end users and through their sales representative network. This network is considered an important part of MEDITE’s future sales growth strategy. These various distribution channels are managed by senior experienced sales directors to insure planning and penetration. MEDITE will also use a direct sales approach for certain large customers, using employed product specialist e.g. in cytology or even using our service employees for technical assistance, training, installation and sales. The channel of directs sales will be increased in the future using the Company’s own employees or sales representatives.
  
 In Europe, the Company sells direct in Germany with employed regional sales representatives and through a network of independent distributors in all other countries. Some of its sales partners have worked with MEDITE for more than a decade. MEDITE schedules several dates for sales training of distributors and technical training for their technical service employees for free each year to keep a high level of experienced staff trained for MEDITE products worldwide, and also to collect feedback for product improvement and development.
  
 For the Chinese market, MEDITE uses a strategic distribution agreement with its local partner UNIC Medical. The major shareholder and president is a professor of pathology and has established a wide network of sales teams in China and other Asian countries. With their help, the brand name MEDITE has attained recognition second in its segment. MEDITE together with UNIC successfully got Chinese FDA approval for all MEDITE histology instruments in 2014 and for the cytology instrument late in 2015. Since then the UNIC team has been increasingly successful is selling MEDITE products in China. The shared goal in China is to become the market leader in the histology and cytology market.
  
 The rest of the world is supported by an experienced team of export professionals at the German facility also acting as the Company’s logistic center. Especially in the medical area, a deep knowledge of custom tariffs and rules, international regulatory restrictions, international payment terms and dangerous goods shipment regulations, are major skills needed by these employees.
  
  Government Regulation, Clinical Studies and Regulatory Strategy
  
 The development, manufacture, sale, and distribution of medical devices are subject to extensive governmental regulation worldwide. In the U.S., our products are regulated under the Medical Device Amendments to the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (the “FD&C Act”) and cannot be sold, shipped or promoted in interstate commerce without prior “clearance” or “approval” by the FDA. In the European Union (“EU”), medical devices are regulated under the Medical Device, In-Vitro Device and other Directives that require that each product be CE Marked to show that it conforms to all of the requirements of the applicable Directive(s) before it can be imported into or sold in the EU. MEDITE products which are selling in the U.S. are FDA registered and all have the CE mark.     
  
 The regulatory systems in other major markets such as China and South America continue to undergo substantial changes and now in many respects resemble the systems in the EU. The CE Mark is now accepted or required in essentially all significant markets other than the U.S. In addition to having to obtain the appropriate regulatory approvals, we are also required to register our products with the national health authority in many countries in which we expect to do business; we may have our quality and manufacturing systems inspected and/or audited by representatives of various national authorities; and may have to conform to additional regulations imposed by individual countries.
  
 Under these regulations, we are subject to certain registration, record-keeping and reporting requirements. Our manufacturing facilities and those of our strategic partners, may be obligated to conform to specified quality standards, and are subject to audits and inspections. We are also subject to national, state and local laws relating to such matters as safe working conditions, manufacturing practices and environmental protection. Failure to comply with these regulations could have a material adverse effect on our future operations and may impose additional costs and risks.
  
 In the U.S., the FD&C Act generally bars selling, advertising, promoting, or other marketing of medical devices that have not been authorized (approved or cleared) by the FDA. The promotion or sale of medical devices for non-approved or “off-label” uses is prohibited. The FDA also regulates the design and manufacture of medical devices. These regulations have been largely, but not completely, harmonized with the ISO quality system standards for medical devices that are used for similar purposes in most other countries. This incomplete harmonization requires us to maintain two separate, but equal quality systems and increases the cost and complexity of regulatory compliance. The FDA and the corresponding regulatory agencies in other countries may withdraw product clearances or approvals for failure to comply with these regulatory standards and may impose additional sanctions.
  
 
   
-10-



 
 
 In the U.S. most low to moderate risk medical devices that have legally marketed predicates receive “clearance” to market through a process described in Section 510(k) of the FD&C Act. In order to receive clearance under the 510(k) process a product must be shown to be “substantially equivalent” to an appropriate legally marketed “predicate device”. High risk devices and devices that do not have a predicate require “approval” via a Pre-Market Approval (“PMA”) submission in which de-novo demonstration of the safety and efficacy must be established. Changes to a product, its intended use, and/or its labeling often require the submission of another 510(k) or PMA application. Obtaining approval to market via the PMA process takes substantially longer and is far more expensive than obtaining clearance to market via the 510(k) notification process.
  
 Each country has historically imposed its own unique regulations on medical products. In recent years, however, there has been a trend toward the harmonization of these regulations resulting in greater consistency between countries. This has resulted in a large and growing number of countries (over 70 as of this writing) adopting the CE Mark as a central element of their regulatory process for medical devices. The U.S. is the only major country that has not adopted the CE Mark. For a product to be CE Marked, the manufacturer must demonstrate to the satisfaction of the regulatory authorities that the product is safe and effective (conforms to the “Essential Requirements” for that class of product) and that it is manufactured in accordance with specified quality standards. In most countries the CE Mark is a pre-condition for medical device registration and in some places such as the EU, is mandatory in order for a product to be imported into or sold within the country or region. Failure to comply with the regulations pertaining to CE Marking can result in product seizures and other sanctions. 
  
 Although Company registration to the ISO 13485 quality system standard is not required for companies selling Class I (lowest risk category) medical devices and products in the EU, such registration is for all practical purposes mandatory for companies selling products in Class II and higher. All products that are presently being sold and a significant portion of those that are in development are currently classified as Class I devices. However, some of our upcoming products are expected to be in Class II or Class IIa and some changes that are being discussed in the EU may, if they come to pass, result in the reclassification of some of our Class I products into Class II. Our quality system is presently registered to ISO 9001 which is the parent standard of ISO 13485. We presently plan to have our quality system registered to ISO 13485 by the end of 2018.
  
 The EU is in the process of determining whether the various Directives pertaining to medical devices should be “recast” to bring them into conformance with the recommendations of the Global Harmonization Taskforce (GHTF) and is also studying the possibility of replacing these Directives, which must be transposed into national laws by each country in order to become effective, with EU-wide laws that do not require transposition. Conversion from the present Directives to corresponding EU laws could be beneficial in that it is expected to eliminate country-specific differences in how the Directives are applied and enforced and therefore facilitate our compliance with the pertinent regulations in the EU. Harmonization of the current medical device classification system with that recommended by the GHTF may, however, result in some or all of our products being placed in more restrictive categories that could significantly increase our regulatory compliance costs and time to market.
  
 The GHTF, which is comprised of representatives from major medical device regulatory agencies such as the FDA, has developed a single unified medical device identification system that will be mandatory as it is implemented worldwide. These regulations went into effect in many countries during 2014 and went into effect in additional countries by the end of 2016 with a final implementation in 2020. The Company is positioned to comply with these new regulations under this regulation for our current products and have the mechanisms in place to obtain such codes and the registrations of the affected products, if needed, in the future. In a number of countries these regulations include user fees that will increase our cost of regulatory compliance.
  
 We are also required to comply with certain environmental regulations with respect to products that are sold in various countries. One of these regulations is the Directive on Packaging and Packaging Wastes in the EU that: mandates the minimization of packaging; restricts the use of certain packaging materials; and imposes requirements, including possible “take-back” provisions, with respect to the recycling of packaging materials. All of our current products comply with the requirements of this Directive. At present, we comply with the recycling portions of this Directive by ensuring that all packaging materials are compatible with recycling programs that are in place in the EU. However, in the future we may be required to take a more active role in the recycling of certain types of products including possibly “taking back” and recycling laboratory instruments. Implementing a compliant take-back program will increase our operating and regulatory compliance costs.

 In the EU electronic products, including clinical laboratory instruments are required to comply with two environmental Directives, one of which requires that the manufacturer “take back” and recycle the electronic portions of these instruments and the other (the so-called RoHS Directive) of which restricts the presence of certain materials in electronic products. The Company complies with the RoHS Directive by requiring its suppliers to use only RoHS complaint materials in the construction of its products.
  
 The “REACH” regulation, which requires the registration of all chemical products produced in or imported into the EU is presently in its implementation phase. The long-term impact of this extremely complex multi-level regulation on the Company is unknown at present but is anticipated to be minimal in the near term as our sales of chemical products (stains, preservative, etc.) are and are expected to continue to be at less than the threshold levels for registration and reporting. An increase in sales of such products above currently forecast levels and/or a reduction in the applicable thresholds could potentially result in additional costs to the Company.
  
 Data from clinical trials and studies is often required in regulatory submissions and is highly desirable for use in product marketing activities. In general, at least one trial or study is necessary for each new product and additional studies or trials are needed to support new or modified indications for use and new marketing claims. 
  
  Cost and Reimbursement
  
 In the U.S., laboratory customers bill most insurers (including Medicare) for screening and diagnostic tests such as the Pap test. Insurers, such a private healthcare insurance or managed care payers, in addition to Medicare, reimburse for the testing, with a majority of these insurers using the annually-set Medicare reimbursement amounts as a benchmark in setting their reimbursement policies and rates. Other private payers do not follow the Medicare rates and may reimburse for only a portion of the testing or not at all. 
  
 Outside of the U.S., healthcare providers and/or facilities are generally reimbursed through numerous payment systems designed by governmental agencies, such as the National Health Service in the United Kingdom, the Servicio Sanitaris Nazionale in Italy and the Spanish National Health System, as well as private insurance companies and managed care programs. The manner and level of reimbursement will depend on the procedures performed, the final diagnosis, the devices and/or drugs utilized, or any combination of these factors, with coverage and payment levels determined at the payer’s discretion. 
  
 Our ability to successfully commercialize the current and future products depends in part on the extent to which coverage and reimbursement for such products will be available from third-party payers in the U.S. such as Medicare, Medicaid, health maintenance organizations and health insurers, and other public and private payers in foreign jurisdictions. The coverage policies and reimbursement levels of these third-party payers may impact the decisions of healthcare providers and facilities regarding which medical products they purchase and the prices they are willing to pay for those products. In some countries, our ability to commercialize products will also depend upon us becoming a qualified bidder on the tender offers issued by the National Healthcare Authority. When we succeed in bringing products to the market, we cannot be assured that third-party payers will pay for such products or establish and maintain price levels sufficient for realization of an appropriate return on our investment in product development. Additionally, we expect many payers to continue to explore cost-containment strategies (e.g., competitive bidding for clinical laboratory services within the Medicare program, so-called “pay-for-performance” programs implemented by various public and private payers, etc.) that could potentially impact coverage and/or payment levels for current or future MEDITE products. 
  
  Competition
  
 Historically, competition in the healthcare industry has been characterized by the search for technological innovations and efforts to market such innovations. Technological advances have accelerated the pace of change in recent years. The cost of healthcare delivery has always been a significant factor in markets outside of the U.S. In recent years, the U.S. market has also become much more cost conscious. The Company believes technological innovations incorporated into certain of its products offer cost-effective benefits that address this particular market opportunity.
  
 MEDITE is currently focused upon histology and cytology which are the two major fields of the anatomic pathology market. Each of these segments is dominated by only 2 – 3 major players. In histology, the Company’s manufactured instrument line competes with those from Leica, Sakura and Thermo Fisher, while in cytology its current SureThin and SafePrep product lines compete with products from the Cytyc division of Hologic and the TriPath division of Becton-Dickinson. Unlike certain of these competitors, MEDITE is a global one-stop supplier for all histology and cytology laboratories.
  
 
   
-12-



 
 
 In cytology, the Company is currently developing a versatile fully-automated, objective analysis, screening and evaluation system for cancer screening that can be used with its current liquid-based cytology SureThin line and the former CytoCore developed SureCyte stain, which is highly reproducible and produces staining results within seconds. This same system can be used with the Company’s newly-developed SureCyte biomarker assays and, unlike the few competing systems, it is specifically designed to perform cytological screening for a broad range of cancers when equipped with the appropriate software and reagent modules.
  
 In general, the Company believes that its products compete on a combination of clinical performance, accuracy, functionality, reliability, quality, product features and effectiveness in standard medical applications while being sufficiently versatile to support future applications. It also believes that cost control and cost effectiveness are additional key factors in achieving and maintaining a competitive advantage. It focuses a significant amount of its product development efforts on producing systems and tests that will not add to overall healthcare cost.
  
  Operations
  
 The Company’s operations consist of sales and marketing, research and development (including information technology), technical service, accounting and administration and manufacturing. Its quality assurance manager is independent and authorized to act at his own discretion in the interest of patient safety.
  
 MEDITE instruments and certain other products are manufactured in the Company’s factory in Burgdorf, Germany. Product manufacturing is monitored by TUV Sud for the UL (“Underwriter Laboratories”, US electrical standard testing) while its quality system is periodically audited by DQS. Small lot manufacturing with Kanban flow control and ERP management is used to ensure the timely delivery of smaller instruments while minimizing finished goods inventories. Larger instruments, most of which are customized to meet the unique requirements of their purchasers, are manufactured to order with a short turnaround. Extra safety stock is maintained for the few single source items that are used in its products, while qualified second sources are maintained for all other critical items. All incoming purchased goods intended for resale, whether or not under the MEDITE brand name, or for use in the manufacture of MEDITE products, are subject to intensive incoming inspection, and all finished MEDITE manufactured products receive intense final quality control testing including 24-48-hour burn-in, as appropriate, to the specific product before shipment. MEDITE additionally audits and monitors the quality systems of third party suppliers of MEDITE-branded consumables and supplies.
  
 The sales and distribution department is organized into the two major departments of direct sales and export (distributors). For direct sales the goal for consumables and smaller instruments is to ship them within 24 hours after the receipt of the order. The export department is handling quotes, orders and shipments to almost every country worldwide. Every query should be answered within 24 hours. After receiving an order for larger equipment, the manufacturing department informs the export department of the expected shipping date. 
  
 The MEDITE enterprise resource planning system is an integrated software that handles sales, material management and production planning. It is also automatically connected to the accounting system, transferring customer and supplier invoices, payments and the material consumption as a just in time controlling tool.  Management has evaluated and is in the process finalizing its review of a company-wide system anticipated to be implemented by the middle of 2018. 
  
  Intellectual Property
  
 The Company relies on a combination of patents, licenses, trade names, trademarks, know-how, proprietary technology, trade secrets and policies and procedures to protect our intellectual property. It considers such security and protection a very important aspect of the successful development and marketing of its products in the U.S., Germany, China and other foreign markets.
  
 
   
-13-



 
 
 Patents, trademarks and copyrights are essential components in the protection of MEDITE’s intellectual property worldwide. As the Company manufactures and sells products globally, it has designed its intellectual property strategy to provide the necessary protection while containing and managing the associated costs. Two of the major components of this strategy are the filing of “provisional” patent applications in the US, and of filing utility patent applications under the Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT) or similar entry points into national patent offices worldwide.
  
 With the passage of the America Invents Act (AIA), the patent systems in all major countries now award patents on a “first-to-file” basis that places a premium upon filing one or more patent applications as soon as it is determined that an invention meets the minimum standards for patentability. This filing is in the form of a “utility” application that meets all of the requirements for examination by a patent office. The U.S. offers the opportunity to file “provisional” patent applications that, while not being in form for examination and not providing any formal rights or protections, is accepted by almost all countries as officially establishing the “priority” or invention date for utility applications that are derived from it within one year of the date of the filing of the provisional application. Provisional applications therefore provide a means of obtaining the earliest possible priority date while allowing time to refine and expand the scope of the invention and associated claims that are included in any resulting utility application. The Company’s practice is to convert each of its provisional patent applications into some number of utility patent applications within this 12-month period. In most cases each provisional application results in one utility filing. However, in some cases a single provisional application can generate two or more separate utility applications and/or multiple provisional applications can be consolidated into a single utility application. During the examination of a utility application, the examining patent office may require the Company to divide the application into two or more separate applications or it may file a continuation-in-part patent application that expands upon the technology disclosed in an earlier patent application and which has the potential of superseding or improving upon the disclosure of the earlier application. For these reasons, estimating the number of patents that are likely to be issued based upon the number of provisional and utility applications filed is difficult.
  
 MEDITE routinely prepares and intends to continue to prepare additional patent applications for processes and inventions arising from its research and development process. The protections provided by a patent are determined by the claims that are allowed by the patent office that is processing the application. During the patent prosecution process it is not unusual for the claims made in the initial application to be modified or deleted or for new claims to be added to the application. For this reason, it is not possible to know the exact extent of protection provided by a patent until it is issued. Recent changes in US patent law, particularly conversion to a “first to file” system and introduction of a challenge period after a patent is granted may influence our IP strategy, especially as related to the filing of provisional applications. Several recent court decisions are also expected to influence these decisions.
  
 The Company’s products are or may be sold worldwide under trademarks and copyrights that it considers to be important to its business. It owns the trademarks relevant to these products and may file additional U.S. and foreign trademark and copyright applications in the future. 
  
 Future technology acquisition efforts will be focused toward those technologies that have strong patent or trade secret protection.
  
 The Company cannot be sure that patents or trademarks issued, or which may be issued in the future will provide us with any significant competitive advantages. We cannot be sure any of our patent applications will be granted or that their validity or enforceability will not be successfully challenged. The cost of any patent-related litigation could be substantial even if we were to prevail. In addition, the Company cannot be sure that someone will not independently develop similar technologies or products, duplicate our technology or design around the patented aspects of our products. The protection provided by patents depends upon a variety of factors, which may severely limit the value of the patent protection, particularly in certain countries. We intend to protect much of our core technology as trade secrets, either because patent protection is not possible or, in management’s opinion, would be less effective than maintaining secrecy. However, the Company cannot be sure that our efforts to maintain secrecy will be successful or that third parties will not be able to develop the technology independently.

  Research and Development Expenditures
  
 The Company’s research and development efforts are focused on introducing new products as well as enhancing our existing product line. We utilize mainly in-house research and development personnel and, in some cases, external research and development services including collaboration with universities, medical centers and other entities are used if management identifies these relationships to be helpful and efficient. Our research and development activities are presently conducted in the U.S. and Germany. Management believes research and development is critical to our success and business strategy. Research work in the U.S. in the area of chemical and biological components is expected to continue for the foreseeable future as we seek to refine the current process and add additional capabilities to our analysis procedures, including the detection of other forms of cancer and precursors to cancer. We anticipate the need to invest a substantial amount of capital, including the cost of clinical trials, required to complete current developments and bring it to market.
  
 The continuing development of new and update existing technology and consumables for histology and cytology is necessary to further increase the Company’s competitiveness and management intends to spend a certain percentage of revenue on an on-going basis. With increased revenue, the percentage attributed to research and development is anticipated to decline, even with the expenditures increasing.
  
  Components and Raw Materials
  
 Many of the raw materials used in the Company’s products are readily available from multiple diversified sources. As these raw materials typically account for less than 10 % of the cost of the finished parts that go into the product, changes in prices for these materials will not have a significant influence on our manufacturing costs.
  
 For paraffin the raw material is oil based and therefore the price fluctuates depending on the commodity markets. Management believes that the sales prices are adaptable and can be adjusted for significant swings in oil prices.
  
 Some of the staining solutions reagents are dependent on specific chemicals where the price also fluctuates. The Company typically will negotiate a fixed price with our supplier for a term of one year to limit its exposure.
  
 The availability of electronic and electrical parts for circuit board manufacturing is another challenge the Company closely monitors. The Company has negotiated with our critical parts suppliers to provide 12-month notice before discontinuing parts and, the Company if necessary, will place a last large order for sufficient number of these parts to support the continued manufacture and support of all MEDITE products that use the part for the anticipated life of the MEDITE product. In addition, it takes advantage of the extended availability programs that are offered by some manufacturers of electronic components and assemblies. The Company also attempts to transfer this discontinuation risk to our external circuit board module vendors, if possible.
  
  Working Capital Practices
  
 The Company raised additional cash of $2,105,000 from the sale of convertible debt subsequent to December 31, 2017, through the date of this filing, all raised by May 17, 2018. Working capital has improved by approximately the same amount as of the date of this filing. 
  
 Management continues to expand its product offerings and has also expanded its sales and distribution channels during 2018.
  
 At December 31, 2017, the Company’s cash and restricted cash balance was $490,025 and its operating losses for the year ended December 31, 2017 had used most of the Company’s liquid assets.
  
 Accrued salaries, vacation and related expenses at December 31, 2017, includes amounts owed the former CFO Robert McCullough of approximately $1.1 million and amounts owed to both Michaela and Michael Ott totaling approximately $104,000. Included in advances – related parties are amounts owed to the Company’s former CFO Robert McCullough of $50,000 on December 31, 2017 and amounts owed to Michaela Ott, stockholder and former CEO of the Company, of 16,000 Euros, ($19,160 as December 31, 2017) and 71,000 Euros ($85,022 as of December 31, 2017) related to two short term bridge loans. The Company has established a payment plan agreement with Michaela and Michael Ott. See further discussion regarding the legal proceedings with Robert McCullough.
  
  The Company’s security agreement (described in detail below) with its lender GPB Capital has provided borrowings of 35% of our collateralized assets.

  Employees
  
 As of December 31, 2017, the Company employed a total of 71 employees including 3 trainees, 0 employees on disability and 4 part-time employees which represents 2 full-time-equivalents. None of our employees are members of a labor union.
 Financial Information about Foreign and Domestic Operations and Export Sales
  
 Markets outside of North America are an important factor in the Company’s business strategy. Any business that operates on a worldwide basis and conducts its business in one or more local currencies is subject to the risk of fluctuations in the value of those currencies against the dollar, as well as foreign economic conditions. Such businesses are also subject to changing political climates, differences in culture and the local practices of doing business, as well as North American and foreign government actions such as export and import rules, tariffs, duties, embargoes and trade sanctions. The Company does not regard these risks, however, as a significant deterrent to our strategy to introduce our MEDITE product lines to foreign markets in the future. The Company’s current operations include payments and receivables in the three currencies of USD, EURO and Yen. For USD and Euro we try to naturally hedge them by having revenues and expenses in both currencies. Even in not handling other currencies directly, the exchange rates in both USD and Euro may influence our costs and prices directly and/or indirectly. The Company intends to adopt strategies to minimize the risks of changing economic and political conditions within the foreign countries we intend to do business.
  
 During the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017, the Company had direct foreign operations in Germany and distributed to approximately 80 countries in total.
