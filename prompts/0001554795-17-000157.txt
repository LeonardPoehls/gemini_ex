ITEM 1. DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS.
General Business Development
 
Overview

Petrogress, Inc. (the “Company” or “Petrogress”) operates a fully integrated oil commodity business, including upstream, midstream and downstream operations, primarily serving West African and Mediterranean countries. The Company operates primarily as a holding company and provides its services through three wholly-owned subsidiaries: Petrogres Co. Limited, which provides management of crude oil purchases and sales; Petronav Carriers LLC, which manages day-to-day operations of the tanker fleet currently consisting of four vessels; and Petrogress Oil & Gas Energy Inc., which is primarily focused on purchasing interests in oil fields in Texas and exporting liquefied natural gas.
 
The Company’s main operations are managed by an experienced team located in Piraeus, Greece.
 
Corporate History
 
We were originally incorporated in the State of Florida on February 10, 2010 under the name 800 Commerce, Inc. for the purpose of marketing credit card processing services on behalf of merchant payment processing service providers. Effective March 25, 2016, we changed our name from 800 Commerce, Inc. to Petrogress, Inc. and effective November 30, 2016, we changed our state of domicile from the State of Florida to the State of Delaware.
Securities Exchange Agreement
 
On February 29, 2016, we entered into a Securities Exchange Agreement (the “SEA”) with Petrogres Co. Limited, a Marshall Islands corporation (“Petrogres”), and its sole shareholder. Pursuant to the terms of the SEA, the Company acquired 100% of Petrogres and its affiliated companies. In exchange, the Company issued to the sole shareholder of Petrogres 136,000,000 shares of restricted common stock, representing 85% of the issued and outstanding shares of the Company’s common stock at the closing of the transaction. As part of the transaction, the sole shareholder and chief executive officer (“CEO”) of Petrogres, Christos Traios, was appointed as CEO and as a director of the Company and B. Michael Friedman resigned as an officer and director. In addition, the Company’s Board of Directors (the “Board”) approved an amendment to the Company’s Articles of Incorporation, increasing the authorized capital to 490,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, and 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $0.001 per share.
 
The SEA has been accounted for as a reverse acquisition and recapitalization of the Company whereby Petrogres effectively became a public company, which has allowed us to increase our operational efficiency and continue to expand our operations. As a result of this transaction, we acquired both the assets and operations of Petrogres and its wholly-owned subsidiaries.
 
Description of Business
 
We operate primarily as a holding company for our three wholly-owned subsidiaries: Petrogres, Co. Limited; Petronav Carriers LLC; and Petrogress Oil & Gas Energy, Inc.
 
Petrogres Co. Limited, a Marshall Islands corporation (“Petrogres”), was incorporated in 2009 with the purpose of supplying crude oil and other oil products in West Africa.
 
Since its inception, Petrogres has evolved its business from focusing solely on fleet and tanker ship operations to expand into the oil and gas industry as a trader and merchant of oil. Over the last five years, Petrogres has strengthened its position in the oil and gas industry by combining its regional market knowledge with over 25 years of experience to successfully establish both its midstream and downstream operations to serve markets primarily located in West Africa and the Mediterranean.

In 2014, Petrogres entered into a Joint Venture Agreement (the “JV Agreement”) with Platon Gas Oil Ghana Limited, an oil refinery and importer of various petroleum products based in Ghana (“Platon”). Pursuant to the terms of the JV Agreement, Platon processes crude oil and other products while Petrogres sells those products and other raw materials directly to local refineries in Ghana.
 
Since consummation of the SEA, Petrogres has successfully negotiated several new operational affiliations and partnerships to strengthen its existing oil operating platform. In November 2016, Petrogres entered into an alliance agreement with Prometheus Maritime Ltd., a Nigerian corporation (“PML”), a crude oil and gas trading company (the “Alliance Agreement”). Pursuant to the terms of the Alliance Agreement, Petrogres and PML agreed to cooperate towards a petroleum project in Nigeria , including the supply and transportation of oil commodities to various end-buyers throughout West Africa (the “Nigeria Petroleum Project”), with Petrogres acting as the lead party.
 
Today, Petrogres operates as an international merchant of petroleum products specializing in crude oil and refined products trade within West African and Mediterranean countries, with a focus on the supply and trade of light petroleum fuel oil (“LPFO”), refined oil products and other petrochemical commodities to local refineries in Ghana. Such products are shipped and delivered to these refineries by its four beneficially-owned affiliated vessels.
 
Petronav Carriers LLC, a Delaware corporation (“Petronav”), was incorporated in March 2016 with the purpose of managing the day-to-day operations of its four vessels, which are used to transport the Company’s petroleum products within various countries in West Africa. Petronav is currently exploring opportunities to expand its operations by identifying and acquiring additional vessels to expand its tanker fleet under management.
 
In December 2016, Petronav executed a non-binding memorandum of understanding (the “MOU”) with West Africa Fenders Ltd., a Nigerian company that provides ship-to-ship services to the oil and shipping industries (“WA Fenders”). The MOU contemplates that Petronav may purchase a 25% interest in the capital of WA Fenders, subject to execution of definitive agreements and customary closing conditions. As of the date of this annual report, we are conducting due diligence.
 
Petrogress Oil & Gas Energy Inc., a Texas corporation (“Petrogress Energy”), was incorporated in December 2015 and is focused on identifying and acquiring suitable interests in oil fields in Texas to allow for the Company’s expansion of its operations to include oil refinery production based within the United States and to export liquefied natural gas (“LNG”) to Mediterranean markets.
 
Our business structure affords us with full control of the logistics involved in oil sourcing and the transportation of our products by our affiliated vessels, which we believe to be a competitive advantage in West African markets. By directly controlling all aspects of our operations, as opposed to engaging the services of third-parties at potentially higher costs, we are able to keep costs low and thus generate revenue from a number of different sources.
 
Competition
 
International seaborne transportation of LPFO and the supply of petroleum products is mainly conducted by two types of operators: independent fleet-owning companies and fleets operated by both private and state owned oil companies. Many oil companies and other oil trading companies also operate their own vessels and transport oil for themselves and third-party charterers in direct competition with independent owners and operators. Competition for charters is intense and is based upon price, vessel location, the size, age, condition and acceptability of the vessel, and the quality and reputation of the vessel’s operator.
 
The Company will compete in the transportation of petroleum products with much larger companies that have significantly longer operating histories and are much better capitalized. Most of these other operators are larger in size and with more vessels either under management or owned. They may also operate in a larger geographical area than the Company does at present and have significantly more capital and other resources from which to conduct their operations and as a result, face less risk in their operations.
