Business Overview
 
We are a medical device company focused on the development, manufacturing, and commercialization of neurostimulation technology for the treatment of various neurological disorders through electrical stimulation of neural tissues. Our neurostimulation technology platform, has the potential to provide treatment to patients in several established neurostimulator markets including Deep Brain Stimulation (“DBS”), Peripheral Electrical Nerve Stimulation (“PENS”), Sacral Nerve Stimulation (“SNS”), Spinal Cord Stimulation (“SCS”), Vagus Nerve Stimulation (“VNS”), and other emerging neurostimulator markets.
 
Our first commercial application of our platform will be the Viant™ Deep Brain Stimulation System (the “Viant™ System”). We will pursue regulatory approval of the Viant™ System for Parkinson’s Disease in the United States, and for Parkinson’s Disease, Essential Tremor, and Dystonia in Europe.
 
The Viant™ System continues to meet critical milestones in its development program. In the first quarter of 2017, we completed the ISO 13485 certification process, which is a pivotal hurdle prior to regulatory submissions to the CE Mark authorities. Design verification, process validation and testing requirements are nearly complete, and management expects we will complete the technical file in 2018 with the exception of some longer duration biocompatibility and shelf life tests. The Company expects to receive a CE Mark in 2019. As related to the United States, in early 2018, we completed the pre-submission meetings with the FDA to determine scope of requirements for approval of the Viant™ System and as a result of that meeting Nexeon intends to submit an FDA Premarket Approval (“PMA”) application without a clinical study.
 
We have also advanced our platform for use in neurostimulation using non-dilutive, international, National Institutes of Health (“NIH”), and state grants. In the first quarter of 2018, we successfully completed and delivered the final tranche of devices to Galvani Bioelectronics (a joint venture between GlaxoSmithKline (“GSK”) and Verily, a subsidiary of Alphabet, Inc., formerly Google) for use in preclinical studies under the Galvani Bioelectronics Initiative.
 
We have additional opportunities to license the platform to companies focused on enhancements to a comprehensive system offering for closed-loop, chronic disease therapeutics, including advanced computational biology, deep learning utilizing Internet of Medical Things technology, imaging solutions, e-health programs, and big data management and optimization, among others.
 
We were incorporated in the State of Nevada on December 7, 2015. Our principal corporate office is located at 1910 Pacific Avenue, Suite 20000, Dallas, Texas 75201 and our phone number is (844) 919-9990. Our website is www.nexeonmed.com.
 
Market Overview
 
The neurostimulation market is comprised of four large markets (SCS; SNS; DBS; and VNS), along with several smaller, emerging markets, each focused on the treatment of a particular disease state through delivery of electrical stimulation to particular targeted sites in the body. We plan to compete in the DBS market with our Viant™ system, and we are evaluating our strategic options for competing in the PENS, SCS, SNS, and VNS markets. According to the Grandview Market Research report, the combined SCS, DBS, and SNS market sizes were approximately $3 billion for 2016.

Our Neurostimulation Technology Platform
 
Our neurostimulator technology platform was developed to provide the most innovative capabilities currently available on the market and to provide physicians and patients with improved solutions and tailored treatment options. Our platform is fundamental to the design of the Viant™ DBS System and provides the foundation for the development of future products. The key value propositions of our platform include:

● | Innovative core technology. The engine of our neurostimulator technology platform, the implantable pulse generator (“IPG”), is based on more than 10 years of development. The custom-made chip was developed using our advanced engineering and design capabilities to have a broad spectrum of electrical outputs. | Figure 1 – Select Components of the NNS™ Device
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+------------------------------------------------
● | Multiple independent current sources. Our neurostimulator technology platform can deliver stimulation from 16 independent current sources across a broad range of frequencies and pulse widths. This capability optimizes current delivery and improves field control allowing for current steering and precision therapy. 
● | Advanced sensing capabilities. Advanced sensing capabilities provide the ability to capture biopotentials to monitor the physiologic response to stimulation, and support research towards the development and optimization of adaptive or closed-loop deep brain stimulation. The recorded signals can be processed on the IPG, or streamed for subsequent storage and analysis.
● | Customized programmability. The technologies in our platform are designed to allow physicians to easily configure therapy to maximize clinical efficiency. These products are capable of documenting feedback from patients, and thereby providing physicians and patients with the flexibility to select from several different stimulation programs and optimize treatment. 


● | Rechargeability. The majority of neurostimulators on the market are not rechargeable requiring periodic replacement. Our neurostimulator platform is rechargeable to reduce the need for replacement surgeries and enable biopotential recording without concern of shortening the device life. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our Product – The Viant™ Deep Brain Stimulation System 
 
The Viant™ DBS device is designed to deliver effective therapeutic results faster, and to sustain them for the long-term. Viant™ is designed to deliver multiple current source stimulation, combined with sensing capabilities, in a single rechargeable device. Viant™’s on-board sensing capabilities have been developed to provide clinicians with the ability to measure and analyze the brain activity adjacent to the DBS leads to quickly and confidently locate the best location to stimulate in a matter of minutes rather than hours using current trial-and-error programming schemes. Clinicians can then focus their efforts on using Viant™’s multiple current source stimulator to take full advantage of the capabilities of directional leads.
 
Viant™’s sensing capabilities were also designed to enable clinicians and researchers to capture and stream brain recordings to an external device for subsequent analysis. The software in Viant™, and the products in Nexeon’s platform, can be transcutaneously updated, so that physicians and patients will be able to benefit from the latest technology as it becomes available without the need for replacement revision surgery.
 
The Viant™ DBS system consists of implantable and external components (Figure 1 above) that work synergistically to deliver precise electrical pulses with specified parameters to target brain structures. Remote controls for the physician and for the patient enable communication with the implant. Each remote control offers different options. The energy source of the system can be recharged through the skin after device implantation by use of the patient remote control in combination with a charger. We currently anticipate CE Mark approval and commercial launch of the device in major European markets in 2019. US approval would potentially occur after CE Mark approval.

--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Competition
 
The medical device industry is intensely competitive, subject to rapid change and highly sensitive to the introduction of new products and other market activities of industry participants. We intend to compete in the DBS market for movement disorders. In the U.S. and European DBS market, the competitors include Abbott Laboratories, formerly known as St. Jude Medical (“Abbott”), Boston Scientific, and Medtronic.  Abbott, Boston Scientific and Medtronic are publicly-traded companies or divisions of publicly-traded companies, all of whom have significantly greater resources than we have. In addition, these competitors also have established operations, long commercial histories, more extensive relationships with physicians, and wider product offerings within neuromodulation and other medical device product categories than we have. This may provide these competitors with greater negotiating power with customers and suppliers and with more opportunities to interact with the stakeholders involved in purchasing decisions.  Furthermore, although we have no current plans to enter the Chinese market, PINS Medical and SceneRay Corporation are established Chinese DBS companies that could begin to distribute their products in Europe and/or the United States. In addition, Aleva Neurotherapeutics has announced its intention to enter the European DBS market in late 2018, and other companies may likewise attempt to bring new products or therapies to this market. All of these companies will continue to develop new products that directly compete with our products, and their greater resources may allow them to respond more quickly to new technologies, new treatment indications or changes in customer requirements. For all of these reasons, it may be more difficult to compete successfully against these or future competitors.

These innovations are expected to include next generation IPG capabilities, additional lead offerings, and advancements in algorithmic programming. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Regulatory
 
In the European Economic Area (EEA) we are subject to the requirements of the EU Active Implantable Medical Devices Directive 90/385/EEC (“AIMDD”) which mandate that our product receive a CE Mark prior to being placed on the market in the EEA. To obtain a CE Mark, we must prepare a technical file for our product, and undergo a conformity assessment by a notified body, which is an organization authorized under the AIMDD to conduct conformity assessments. Following successful completion of a conformity assessment the notified body will grant a CE Mark.
 
We expect to complete the Viant™ DBS System technical file in the first half of 2019 and submit it for a conformity assessment with our notified body, DEKRA Certification B.V., shortly thereafter. While there have been some recent increases in the stringency of the relevant EU regulatory requirements, and there can be no assurances, absent unanticipated additional requirements or delays, we currently anticipate receiving the CE Mark for the Viant™ DBS System in the first half of 2019.
 
The Viant™ DBS System is classified as a Class III medical device under the Food and Drug Act. The Food and Drug Act requires submission and FDA approval of a PMA application before marketing of a Class III device can begin. The PMA application process is considerably more demanding than the Class I and Class II 510(k) premarket notification process. The Company has used the FDA’s pre-submission process to engage the FDA to clarify the path to ultimate product approval. At this time, the Company intends to submit to the FDA in 2019 for a PMA for the Treatment of Parkinson’s Disease without a clinical study.

Sales and Marketing
 
We currently have no sales force as we are engaged in completing the product and preparing to make regulatory submissions. In 2017, we hired a Vice President of Sales and Marketing to develop and execute our detailed commercial plan. We intend to build a US-based marketing team to promote awareness of our products by training and educating physicians, exhibiting at tradeshows and conducting focused promotions.
 
We expect to begin to build our international sales organization in late 2018. To achieve operating efficiencies, we expect to use a combination of distributors, independent sales agents, and a limited number of direct employees. Our representatives will target movement disorder specialists located primarily at large academic centers, as well as their referring network of neurologists in countries with existing reimbursement coverage for these therapies.
 
Product Development Pipeline
 
We have invested significant finances and effort towards engineering/product development of the first generation auricular vagus nerve stimulation (“aVNS”) device. In early 2017, we received Ethics Committee and Competent Authority approval to examine the effects of aVNS on cardiac activity in healthy adults. The study was completed in Belgium at the Universite’ Catholique de Louvain under the principal investigator Jean-Benoit Le Polain (Cardiac Electrophysiologist). We enrolled 20 healthy subjects that received right ear cymba concha stimulation during simultaneous telemetric ECG monitoring (Polar H7). Each subject underwent 10 min of baseline ECG recording, 10 min of aVNS+ECG recording, and 10 min of recovery ECG recording (no aVNS). All subjects received biphasic stimulation at 5 Hz (separate trials), pulse duration of 200 µs, and personalized current intensity (average = 2.7 mA). In comparison to baseline ECG, we observed significant increase heart rate variability (HRV) during aVNS: increased R-R interval (19 of 20 subjects, p<0.001), and increased root mean square of successive differences (RMSSD; 14 of 20 subjects, p<0.001). Additionally, aVNS demonstrated a significant increase in the high frequency component (parasympathetic activity) of HRV (13 of 20 subjects, p<0.001).


The aVNS system is a non-invasive, battery-operated, self-administered device to transcutaneously stimulate the auricular branch of the vagus nerve (ABVN). The device is composed of a handheld generator and one earpiece. The earpiece makes electrical contact with the skin via specially designed disposable self-adhesive hydrogel electrodes. One electrode is designed to be placed into the Cymba Concha which is innervated by the ABVN.
 
According to the Journal of Cardiology, Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common cardiac arrhythmia, and is associated with substantial risk of mortality. According to the Journal of Cardiology, AF currently affects more than 2.5 million Americans and the affected population is steadily growing with our aging society. AF independently increases the risk of stroke by 4- to 5-fold, is an independent risk factor for stroke recurrence, and is responsible for at least 15-20% of all ischemic strokes. In addition to its associated health risks and diminished quality of life, AF is a financial burden on the US Healthcare system, with annual Medicare costs currently estimated at $16 billion.


This study is designed as a prospective, single-center pilot study to assess the feasibility of aVNS with the Nexeon MedSystems aVNS system as a treatment for paroxysmal AF. Each subject will be screened and then undergo a 30-day baseline evaluation to document pre-treatment AF burden. If subject does not have a ICP or ILR, subjects will be given a HM (LiveTec, Total Medical Solutions, Netherlands) to achieve 30-day baseline evaluation, and monitoring during and after treatment. Subjects meeting the requisite documented AF burden in the baseline phase will be trained to use the Nexeon MedSystems aVNS system and Brain HQ online cognitive training software. This visit will be classified as “Day 0.” The subject will be instructed to deliver therapy with the Nexeon MedSystems aVNS system at home for 30 minutes per day for a total of 30 days (± 5 days). Concurrently, subjects will be instructed to use Brain HQ at home for ~5 minutes per day for a total of 30 days (± 5 days). Subjects will be randomly assigned into 1 of 2 groups; Group 1 (n=10) begins Brain HQ cognitive training before stimulation, Group 2 (n=10) begins Brain HQ cognitive training after stimulation. At the Day 30 visit, the auricular stimulation will stop; the subjects will return to the clinic for ICP, ILR, or HM interrogation to document AF during the treatment phase, blood marker collection, and cognitive assessments. The subject will return to the clinic for a 60-day visit, study participation will end at this visit. The expected duration of subject participation is approximately 3 months from enrollment until the end of study participation.

Research and Development
 
For the years ending December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, our research and development expenses were $2,942,981 and $759,502, respectively, primarily reflecting the costs associated with our research and discovery efforts related to the design and development of our proposed medical devices. It is expected that the Company’s research and development activities and related expenses will increase significantly in the future as we increase the scope and rate of such efforts and begin more expensive development activities, including clinical trials and similar studies as required by the relevant regulatory authorities in our targeted jurisdictions (i.e. the United States and European Union).
