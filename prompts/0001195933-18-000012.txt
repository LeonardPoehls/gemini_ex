Business
Introduction
Infinity Property and Casualty Corporation was incorporated under the laws of the State of Ohio on September 16, 2002. We are a holding company that provides insurance, through our subsidiaries, for personal auto with a concentration on nonstandard risks, commercial auto and classic collectors. Our headquarters is located in Birmingham, Alabama. We employed approximately 2,300 people at December 31, 2017.

Unless indicated otherwise, the financial information we present in this report is on a Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) basis. Schedules may not foot due to rounding.
On February 13, 2018, the Company entered into a definitive agreement and plan of merger (the “Merger Agreement”) with Kemper Corporation, a Delaware corporation (“Parent”) and Vulcan Sub, Inc., an Ohio corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (“Merger Sub”). The Merger Agreement provides that, subject to the satisfaction or waiver of certain conditions set forth therein, Merger Sub will merge with and into the Company in accordance with the Ohio General Corporation Law (the “Merger”), with the Company surviving such Merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (such entity, the “Surviving Company”). The Company expects the closing of the Merger to occur in the third quarter of 2018.

Our Strategy
We offer personal and commercial auto insurance primarily in four key states: Arizona, California, Florida and Texas. Our target customers are urban and Hispanic drivers. This narrow geographic and demographic focus allows us to concentrate our efforts and resources on providing competitively priced products to underserved segments while generating adequate returns for our shareholders.
Segments
Personal Automobile is our primary insurance product. It provides coverage to individuals for liability to others for bodily injury and property damage and for physical damage to an insured's own vehicle from collision and various other perils. In addition, some states require policies to provide for first party personal injury protection, frequently referred to as no-fault coverage.

Personal auto insurance is the largest line of property and casualty insurance, accounting for approximately 39%, or $207 billion, of the estimated $535 billion of annual industry premium. Personal auto insurance comprises preferred, standard and nonstandard risks. Nonstandard risks are associated with drivers who, due to factors such as their driving record, driving experience, lapse in, (or the absence of) prior insurance, or credit history, represent a higher than normal risk. Customers in the market for nonstandard auto insurance generally seek minimum required liability limits and are willing to accept restrictive coverages in exchange for more affordable insurance, given their risk profile. There is no established industry-recognized distinction between nonstandard risks and all other personal auto risks. Independent agents sell approximately 27% of all personal automobile insurance. The remainder is sold by captive agents or directly by insurance companies to their customers. We believe that, relative to the standard and preferred auto insurance market, independent agents sell a disproportionately larger portion of nonstandard auto insurance.
The personal auto insurance industry is cyclical, characterized by periods of price competition and excess capacity followed by periods of higher premium rates and shortages of underwriting capacity. These cycles may vary by geographic market.
Industrywide, rates increased 7.9%, 7.0% and 5.7% in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Our filed average rate adjustments on our personal auto business were 8.9%, 8.1% and 5.1% 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
The personal auto insurance industry is highly competitive and, except for regulatory considerations, there are relatively few barriers to entry. We generally compete with other insurers based on price, coverage offered, claims handling, customer service, agent commission, geographic coverage and financial strength ratings. We compete with both large national writers and small regional companies. In 2016, the five largest automobile insurance companies accounted for approximately 56% of the industry’s net written premium and the largest ten accounted for approximately 72% (2017 industry data is not yet available). Approximately 299 insurance groups and unaffiliated insurance companies compete in the personal auto insurance industry. Some of these groups specialize in nonstandard auto insurance while others insure a broad spectrum of personal auto insurance risks.
Based on data published by A.M. Best, we believe that we are the second largest provider of nonstandard personal auto coverage through independent agents in the United States. We also write standard and preferred personal auto insurance. 
We have a history of underwriting results that outperform the personal auto industry. The following table compares our statutory combined ratio, net of fees, in past years with those of the private passenger auto industry. The statutory combined ratio is the sum of the loss ratio (the ratio of losses and loss adjustment expenses (LAE) to net earned premium) and the expense ratio (when calculated on a statutory accounting basis, the ratio of underwriting expenses, net of fees, to net written premium). Underwriting results are generally considered profitable when the combined ratio is under 100%; when the ratio is over 100%, underwriting results are generally considered unprofitable. 

 | 2017 | | 2016 | | 2015 | 2014 | | 2013 | | 2013-2017 | 2008-2017
Personal Auto Segment | 93.0 | % | | 94.9 | % | 93.6 | % | | 94.5 | % | 96.2 | % | 94.4 | % | 94.0 | %

 ________________

(a) | We obtained the private passenger auto industry combined ratios for 2008 through 2016 from A.M. Best. A.M. Best data is not available for 2017. The industry combined ratio for 2017 is an estimate based on data obtained from Conning Research and Consulting.

Commercial Auto provides coverage to businesses for liability to others for bodily injury and property damage and for physical damage to vehicles from collision and various other perils. 
Approximately 339 insurance groups and unaffiliated insurance companies compete in the commercial auto insurance industry. Writers of commercial auto insurance typically focus on one or more of the various segments of commercial auto. We avoid the segments that are involved in what we consider to be hazardous operations or interstate commerce. 
The primary segment of the market on which we focus is artisan contractors, which makes up approximately 19% of the industry's commercial auto premium. We primarily target businesses with fleets of 10 or fewer vehicles, averaging 1.9 vehicles per policy. 
Classic Collector provides coverage to individuals with classic or antique automobiles for liability to others for bodily injury and property damage and for physical damage to an insured's own vehicle from collision and various other perils.
Refer to Note 17 – Segment Information to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information on our revenues and underwriting income by segment.

Distribution and Marketing
We distribute our products primarily through a network of approximately 10,600 independent agencies and brokers in 15,600 locations. In 2017, 16% of our agency force produced 80% of our gross written premium, our top 10 independent agents and brokers produced 22%, eight independent agencies accounted for more than 1% each, and our top agent produced 7%. In California, Infinity’s largest state by premium volume, 54 independent agents and brokers produced 50% of gross written premium in the state (which represents 24% countrywide), and our largest broker in the state produced 15% of that premium. In Florida, Infinity's second largest state by premium volume, 32 independent agents and brokers produced 50% of gross written premium in the state (which represents 13% countrywide), and our largest agent in the state produced 19% of that premium.
We foster agent relationships by providing them with access to our Internet-based software applications along with programs and services designed to strengthen and expand their marketing, sales and service capabilities. Our Internet-based software applications provide many of our agents with e-signature capabilities and real-time underwriting, claims and policy information. We believe the array of services offered to our agents adds significant value to the agents' businesses. For example, “Easy Street” is our incentive-based program through which agents receive assistance in critical areas such as training, advertising and promotion. In 2017 we spent $12.5 million on co-op advertising and promotions.
In 2017 we also wrote $94.0 million of business sold directly to the consumer either through company-owned sales centers or via the Internet.
We are licensed to write insurance in all 50 states and the District of Columbia, but we focus our operations in targeted urban areas identified in selected states that we believe offer the greatest opportunity for premium growth and profitability.
Total gross written premium mix was as follows ($ in thousands):

 | Twelve months ended December 31,
Personal Auto: | 2017 | | 2016 | | 2015
California | 46.1 | % | | 49.0 | % | | 49.2 | %
Florida | 25.4 | % | | 29.4 | % | | 31.9 | %
Texas | 11.8 | % | | 6.3 | % | | 3.9 | %
Arizona | 2.3 | % | | 1.3 | % | | 1.2 | %
Other States | 1.6 | % | | 2.4 | % | | 3.6 | %
Total Personal Auto | 87.1 | % | | 88.5 | % | | 89.8 | %
Commercial Auto | 11.7 | % | | 10.4 | % | | 9.1 | %
Classic Collector | 1.2 | % | | 1.1 | % | | 1.1 | %
Total all states and all lines | 100.0 | % | | 100.0 | % | | 100.0 | %
Total all states and all lines | $ | 1,397,294 | | | $ | 1,401,414 | | | $ | 1,387,866

We implement our distribution and marketing efforts with a focus on maintaining a low cost structure. Controlling expenses allows us to price competitively and achieve better underwriting returns. Over the five years ended 2016, years for which industry data is available from A.M. Best, our statutory ratio of underwriting expenses to premium written has averaged 17.8%, which is 8.0 points better than the independent agency segment of the private passenger automobile industry average of 25.8% for the same period.
Claims Handling
We strive for accuracy, consistency and fairness in our claim resolutions. Our claims organization employs approximately 1,300 people, has several field locations in each of the states in which we do business and provides a 24-hour, seven days per week toll-free service for our customers to report claims. We predominantly use our own local adjusters and appraisers.
We are committed to the field handling of claims and we believe that it provides, when compared with alternative methods, better service to our customers and better control of the claim resolution process. We open claims branch offices in urban areas where the volume of business will support them. Customer interactions can occur with generalists (initial and continuing adjusters) and specialists (staff appraisers, field casualty representatives and special investigators) based on local market volume, density and performance. 
In addition to the use of field claims handling, we use centralized claims call centers to receive initial reports of losses and to adjust simple property damage claims.

Ratings
A.M. Best has assigned our insurance company subsidiaries a group financial strength rating of “A” (Excellent). A.M. Best assigns “A” ratings to insurers that, in A.M. Best's opinion, “have an excellent ability to meet their ongoing insurance obligations.” A.M. Best bases our rating on factors that concern policyholders and not upon factors concerning investor protection.
Standard and Poor's has assigned our insurance company subsidiaries insurer financial strength ratings of "A" (Strong). An insurer rated "A" by Standard and Poor's has "strong financial security characteristics but is somewhat more likely to be affected by adverse business conditions than are insurers with higher ratings." Insurer financial strength ratings do not refer to an organization's ability to meet nonpolicy (debt) obligations.
Regulatory Environment
Our insurance company subsidiaries are subject to regulation and supervision by insurance departments of the jurisdictions in which they are domiciled or licensed to transact business. State insurance departments have broad administrative power relating to licensing insurers and agents, regulating premium rates and policy forms, establishing reserve and investment requirements, prescribing statutory accounting methods and the form and content of statutory financial reports, and regulating methods and processes of how an insurer conducts its business. Examples of the latter include the establishment in California of auto rating factor and rate approval regulations, proscription on credit-based insurance scoring, prohibition of certain business practices with auto body repair shops, and attempts to set uniform auto body repair shop parts and labor rates.
Under state insolvency and guaranty laws, regulated insurers can be assessed or required to contribute to state guaranty funds to cover policyholder losses resulting from insurer insolvencies. Many states also require insurers, as a condition of doing business in the state, to participate in various assigned risk pools, reinsurance facilities or underwriting associations, which provide insurance coverage to individuals who otherwise are unable to purchase that coverage in the voluntary market. Participation in these involuntary plans is generally in proportion to voluntary writings of related lines of business in that state. The underwriting results of these plans traditionally have been unprofitable. The amount of premium we might be required to assume in a given state in connection with an involuntary plan may be reduced because of credit we may receive for nonstandard policies that we voluntarily write. Many states also have laws and regulations that limit an insurer's ability to exit a market. For example, certain states limit an automobile insurer's ability to cancel and non-renew policies.
State insurance departments that have jurisdiction over our insurance subsidiaries may conduct routine, on-site visits and examinations of our subsidiaries' affairs. There were no open market conduct examinations as of February 15, 2018. These examinations have from time to time given rise to regulatory orders requiring remedial, injunctive or other action on the part of an insurance subsidiary or the assessment of substantial fines or other penalties against our insurance subsidiaries, and are likely to do so in the future. Every five years, our insurance subsidiaries are subject to a financial examination by the states in which the subsidiaries are domiciled. We expect the examination of years 2012 through 2016 to be completed during the first quarter of 2018 with no adjustment to statutory capital surplus.
The insurance laws of the states of domicile of our insurance subsidiaries contain provisions to the effect that the acquisition or change of control of a domestic insurer or of any entity that controls a domestic insurer cannot be consummated without the prior approval of the relevant insurance regulator. In addition, certain state insurance laws require pre-acquisition notification to state agencies of a change in control with respect to a non-domestic insurance company licensed to do business in that state. Such approval requirements may deter, delay or prevent certain transactions affecting the ownership of our common stock.
We are a holding company with no business operations of our own. Consequently, our ability to pay dividends to shareholders and meet our debt payment obligations is largely dependent on dividends or other distributions from our insurance company subsidiaries, current investments and cash held. State insurance laws restrict the ability of our insurance company subsidiaries to declare shareholder dividends. These subsidiaries may not make an “extraordinary dividend” until thirty days after the applicable commissioner of insurance has received notice of the intended dividend and has either not objected or has approved the payment of the extraordinary dividend within the 30-day period. An extraordinary dividend is defined as any dividend or distribution that, together with other distributions made within the preceding twelve months, exceeds the lesser of (i) 10% of the insurer's surplus; or (ii) the insurer's net income excluding realized capital gains for the twelve-month period ended the preceding December 31st, in each case determined in accordance with statutory accounting practices. In addition, an insurer's remaining surplus after payment of a cash dividend to shareholder affiliates must be both reasonable in relation to its outstanding liabilities and adequate to its financial needs. 
If a shareholder dividend does not rise to the statutory level of an extraordinary dividend, then it is an “ordinary dividend.” While an insurance company’s ability to pay an ordinary dividend does not require the approval of a state insurance department, it must 
 4

file a 10-day notice of ordinary dividend with the appropriate insurance department. Insurance companies that fail to notify an insurance department of the payment of an ordinary dividend are assessed administrative fines.
State insurance laws require our subsidiaries to maintain specified levels of statutory capital and surplus. Generally, the net admitted assets of insurance companies that, subject to other applicable insurance laws and regulations, are available for transfer to the parent company cannot include the net admitted assets required to meet the minimum statutory surplus requirements of the states where the companies are licensed. In addition, for competitive reasons, our insurance company subsidiaries need to maintain adequate financial strength ratings from independent rating agencies. Both of these factors may limit the ability of our insurance subsidiaries to declare and pay dividends.
