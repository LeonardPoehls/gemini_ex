Item 1. Business 
 RAI is a holding company whose wholly owned operating subsidiaries include the second largest tobacco company in the United States, R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company; the manufacturer and marketer of the leading super-premium cigarette brand, Santa Fe Natural Tobacco Company, Inc., referred to as SFNTC; the second largest smokeless tobacco products manufacturer in the United States, American Snuff Company, LLC, referred to as American Snuff Co.; R.

RAI was incorporated in the State of North Carolina on January 2, 2004, and its common stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange, referred to as NYSE, under the symbol “RAI.” RAI’s headquarters are located in Winston-Salem, North Carolina. On July 30, 2004, the U.S. assets, liabilities and operations of Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corporation, now known as Brown & Williamson Holdings, Inc., referred to as B&W, an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary of BAT were combined with R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company, a wholly owned operating subsidiary of R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Holdings, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of RAI, referred to as RJR. These transactions on July 30, 2004, generally are referred to as the B&W business combination. As a result of the B&W business combination and BAT Share Purchase, as defined below, BAT, through wholly owned subsidiaries, beneficially owns approximately 42% of RAI’s outstanding common stock. 
 References to RJR Tobacco prior to July 30, 2004, relate to R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company, a New Jersey corporation. References to RJR Tobacco on and subsequent to July 30, 2004 and until June 12, 2015, relate to the combined U.S. assets, liabilities and operations of B&W and R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company. Concurrent with the completion of the B&W business combination, RJR Tobacco became a North Carolina corporation. References to RJR Tobacco on and subsequent to June 12, 2015, relate to R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company, a North Carolina corporation, and reflect the effects of the Lorillard Merger and Divestiture, described below.
 Proposed Merger with BAT
 On January 16, 2017, RAI, BAT, a subsidiary of BAT, and Merger Sub entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger, referred to as the Merger Agreement, pursuant to which, subject to the satisfaction or waiver of certain conditions, Merger Sub will merge with and into RAI, referred to as the BAT Merger, with RAI surviving as a wholly owned subsidiary of BAT.
 The BAT Merger has been approved by the independent directors of RAI who formed a committee to negotiate with BAT, referred to as the Transaction Committee, given BAT’s existing ownership stake in RAI and representation on RAI’s Board, and by the Boards of Directors of both companies.
 At the effective time of the BAT Merger, each share of RAI common stock (other than any shares of RAI common stock owned by BAT or any of its subsidiaries and by shareholders of RAI who have properly asserted and not lost or effectively withdrawn appraisal rights) will be converted into the right to receive 0.5260 of a BAT American Depositary Share, referred to as a BAT ADS, and $29.44 in cash, without interest, and subject to adjustment to prevent dilution.
 The BAT Merger is subject to customary closing conditions, including RAI and BAT shareholder approvals, including the approval of the BAT Merger by a majority of the shares of RAI common stock not owned, directly or indirectly, by BAT or its subsidiaries or any of RAI’s subsidiaries, and regulatory approvals. The Merger Agreement contains certain other termination rights for each of RAI and BAT, including the right of each party to terminate the Merger Agreement if the BAT Merger has not been completed on or before December 31, 2017, subject to an extension of five business days if, on December 31, 2017, BAT has not 
 2


completed all or any portion of the financing it needs to fund the BAT Merger and the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement. Financing, however, is not a condition to the closing of the BAT Merger. Under certain circumstances, if the Merger Agreement is terminated, the terminating party must pay the non-terminating party a termination fee of $1 billion. In the event that the Merger Agreement is terminated due to an inability to obtain unconditional approval under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, referred to as the HSR Act, or any other antitrust laws, RAI will be entitled to receive a termination fee of $500 million from BAT. The BAT Merger is currently expected to close in the third quarter of 2017.
 Each of RAI and BAT has made representations and warranties in the Merger Agreement. RAI and BAT each also have agreed to various covenants and agreements, including, among other things, to conduct their respective businesses in the ordinary course in all material respects during the period between the execution of the Merger Agreement and completion of the BAT Merger and not to engage in certain transactions during this period.
 The foregoing description of the BAT Merger and the Merger Agreement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Merger Agreement, a copy of which is attached as Exhibit 2.1 to RAI’s Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, referred to as the SEC, on January 17, 2017, which is incorporated by reference herein.
 There are a number of risks and uncertainties associated with the BAT Merger. For more information, see Item 1A. Risk Factors and “— Cautionary Information Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Item 7. In connection with the BAT Merger, BAT will file with the SEC a registration statement on Form F-4 that will include the proxy statement of RAI that also constitutes a prospectus of BAT. Shareholders are urged to read the proxy statement/prospectus on Form F-4 once it becomes available because it will contain important information about the BAT Merger, including relevant risk factors. 
 Lorillard Transactions 
 On June 12, 2015, RAI acquired Lorillard, Inc., n/k/a Lorillard, LLC, referred to as Lorillard, in a cash and stock transaction, valued at $25.8 billion, referred to as the Lorillard Merger. Also on June 12, 2015, a wholly owned subsidiary, n/k/a ITG Brands, LLC, referred to as ITG, of Imperial Brands, PLC, f/k/a Imperial Tobacco Group, PLC, referred to as Imperial, acquired for approximately $7.1 billion, in a transaction referred to as the Divestiture, certain assets (1) owned by RAI subsidiaries or affiliates relating to the cigarette brands WINSTON, KOOL and SALEM, and (2) owned by Lorillard subsidiaries or affiliates related to the cigarette brand MAVERICK and the “e-vapor” brand blu (including SKYCIG), as well as Lorillard’s owned and leased real property, and certain transferred employees, together with associated liabilities. As a result of the Divestiture, RAI recognized a pre-tax gain of approximately $3.2 billion. Additionally, on June 12, 2015, shortly after the completion of the Lorillard Merger, Lorillard Tobacco Company, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Lorillard, referred to as Lorillard Tobacco, merged with and into RJR Tobacco, with RJR Tobacco continuing as the surviving entity, referred to as the Lorillard Tobacco Merger.
 On June 12, 2015, concurrently with the completion of the Lorillard Merger and Divestiture, BAT indirectly (through a wholly owned subsidiary) purchased 77,680,259 shares of RAI common stock, prior to giving effect to RAI’s 2015 two-for-one stock split, referred to as the BAT Share Purchase, for approximately $4.7 billion, which was sufficient for BAT and its subsidiaries collectively to maintain their approximately 42% beneficial ownership in RAI. For additional information on the Lorillard Merger and Divestiture, and related transactions, see Item 8, notes 2 and 13 to consolidated financial statements.
 Sale of International Rights to the NATURAL AMERICAN SPIRIT Brand
 On January 13, 2016, RAI, through various subsidiaries, referred to as the Sellers, completed the sale of the international rights to the NATURAL AMERICAN SPIRIT brand name and associated trademarks, along with SFRTI and other international companies that distributed and marketed the brand outside the United States, to JT International Holding BV, referred to as JTI Holding, a subsidiary of Japan Tobacco Inc., referred to as JTI, in an all-cash transaction of approximately $5 billion, and recognized a pre-tax gain of approximately $4.9 billion. The transaction did not include the rights to the NATURAL AMERICAN SPIRIT brand name and associated trademarks in the U.S. market, U.S. duty-free locations, and U.S. territories or in U.S. military outlets, all of which have been retained by SFNTC. With this transaction completed, the international rights to nearly all of RAI’s operating companies’ cigarette trademarks are now owned by international tobacco companies. For additional information on the transaction, see Item 8, notes 3 and 13 to consolidated financial statements.
 Operating Segments
 RAI’s reportable operating segments are RJR Tobacco, Santa Fe and American Snuff. The RJR Tobacco segment consists of the primary operations of R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company. The Santa Fe segment consists of the primary operations of SFNTC. The American Snuff segment consists of the primary operations of American Snuff Co. Included in All Other, among other RAI 
 3


subsidiaries, are RJR Vapor, Niconovum USA, Inc., Niconovum AB, and until their sale on January 13, 2016, as described above, SFRTI and various foreign subsidiaries affiliated with SFRTI. The segments were identified based on how RAI’s chief operating decision maker allocates resources and assesses performance. Certain of RAI’s operating subsidiaries have entered into intercompany agreements for products or services with other subsidiaries. As a result, certain activities of an operating subsidiary may be included in a different segment of RAI. For net sales and operating income attributable to each segment, see — “Overview and Business Initiatives” in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Item 7 and Item 8, note 17 to consolidated financial statements.

 All dollar amounts, other than per share amounts, are presented in millions, except as otherwise noted. 
 RAI Strategy 
 RAI’s strategy continues to focus on transforming tobacco to deliver sustainable earnings growth, strong cash flow and enhanced long-term shareholder value. This transformation strategy includes growing the core cigarette and moist-snuff businesses, focusing on innovation and engaging with adult tobacco consumers, while maintaining efficient and effective operations. 
 To achieve its strategy, RAI encourages the migration of adult smokers to smoke-free tobacco products and other non-combustible nicotine-containing products, which it believes aligns consumer preferences for new alternatives to traditional tobacco products in view of societal pressure to reduce smoking. RAI’s operating companies facilitate this migration through innovation, including the development of digital vapor cigarettes, CAMEL Snus, heat-not-burn cigarettes, and nicotine replacement therapy technologies. RAI remains committed to maintaining high standards of corporate governance and business conduct in a high-performing culture. 
 RJR Tobacco 
 Overview 
 RAI’s largest reportable operating segment, RJR Tobacco, is the second largest tobacco company in the United States. RJR Tobacco’s brands include three of the top four best-selling cigarettes in the United States: NEWPORT, CAMEL and PALL MALL. These brands, and its other brands, including DORAL, MISTY and CAPRI, are manufactured in a variety of styles and marketed in the United States. As part of its total tobacco strategy, RJR Tobacco offers a smoke-free tobacco product, CAMEL Snus. RJR Tobacco manages contract manufacturing of cigarettes and tobacco products through arrangements with BAT affiliates, and manages the export of tobacco products to U.S. territories, U.S. duty-free shops and U.S. overseas military bases. RJR Tobacco also manages the super-premium cigarette brands, DUNHILL and STATE EXPRESS 555, which are licensed from BAT. 
 RJR Tobacco primarily conducts business in the highly competitive U.S. cigarette market. The international rights to substantially all of RJR Tobacco’s brands were sold in 1999 to JTI, and no international rights were acquired in connection with the B&W business combination in 2004 or the Lorillard Merger in 2015. The U.S. cigarette market, which has a few large manufacturers and many smaller participants, is a mature market in which overall adult consumer demand has declined since 1981, and is expected to continue to decline. Management Science Associates, Inc., referred to as MSAi, reported that U.S. cigarette shipments declined 2.4% in 2016, to 258.0 billion cigarettes, 0.1% in 2015 and 3.2% in 2014. From year to year, shipments are impacted by various factors including price increases, excise tax increases and wholesale inventory adjustments. 
 Profitability of the U.S. cigarette industry and RJR Tobacco continues to be adversely impacted by decreases in consumption, increases in state excise taxes and governmental regulations and restrictions, such as marketing limitations and product standards. 
 Competition 
 RJR Tobacco’s primary competitors are Philip Morris USA Inc. and ITG, as well as manufacturers of deep-discount brands. Deep-discount brands are brands manufactured by companies that are not original or subsequent participants in the Master Settlement Agreement, referred to as the MSA, and other state settlement agreements with the States of Mississippi, Florida, Texas and Minnesota, which together with the MSA are collectively referred to as the State Settlement Agreements. Accordingly, these manufacturers do not have cost structures burdened with payments related to State Settlement Agreements to the same extent as the 
 4


original or subsequent participating manufacturers. For further discussion of the State Settlement Agreements, see “— Litigation Affecting the Cigarette Industry — Health-Care Cost Recovery Cases — State Settlement Agreements” in Item 8, note 13 to consolidated financial statements. 
 Based on data collected by SymphonyIRI Group, Inc. and Capstone Research Inc., collectively referred to as IRI/Capstone, and processed and managed by MSAi, during each of 2016 and 2015, RJR Tobacco had an overall retail share of the U.S. cigarette market of 32.3%, reflecting the impact of the Lorillard Merger and Divestiture. During each of these same years, Philip Morris USA Inc. had an overall retail share of the U.S. cigarette market of 49.9%. RJR Tobacco believes that deep-discount brands made by small manufacturers had combined shipments of approximately 7% of total U.S. industry shipments during each of 2016 and 2015. 
 Domestic industry shipment volume and retail share of market data that appear in this document have been obtained from MSAi and IRI/Capstone, respectively. These organizations are the primary sources of volume and market share data relating to the tobacco industry. This information is included in this document because it is used primarily as an indicator of the relative performance of industry participants, brands and market trends. All share results that appear, except as noted otherwise, in this document are based on U.S. cigarette (or smokeless tobacco products, as applicable) shipments to retail outlets, referred to as STR data, based on information submitted by wholesale locations and processed and managed by MSAi. However, you should not rely on the STR data reported by MSAi as being a precise measurement of actual market share as the shipments to retail outlets do not reflect actual consumer sales and do not track all volume and trade channels. Accordingly, the STR data of the U.S. tobacco industry as reported by MSAi may overstate or understate actual market share. Moreover, you should be aware that in a product market experiencing overall declining consumption, a particular product can experience increasing market share relative to competing products, yet still be subject to declining consumption volumes. 
 Competition is based primarily on brand positioning, including price, product attributes and packaging, consumer loyalty, promotions, advertising and retail presence, as well as finding efficient and effective means of balancing market share and profit growth. Cigarette brands produced by the major manufacturers generally require competitive pricing, substantial marketing support, retail programs and other incentives to maintain or improve market position or to introduce a new brand or brand style. Competition among the major cigarette manufacturers continues to be highly competitive and includes product innovation and expansion into smoke-free tobacco categories. 
 Marketing 
 RJR Tobacco is committed to building and maintaining a portfolio of profitable brands. RJR Tobacco’s marketing programs are designed to strengthen brand image, build brand awareness and loyalty, and switch adult smokers of competing brands to RJR Tobacco brands. In addition to building strong brand equity, RJR Tobacco’s marketing approach utilizes a retail pricing strategy, including discounting at retail, to defend certain brands’ shares of market against competitive pricing pressure. RJR Tobacco’s competitive pricing methods may include list price changes, discounting programs, such as retail and wholesale buydowns, periodic price reductions, off-invoice price reductions, dollar-off promotions and consumer coupons. Retail buydowns refer to payments made to the retailer to reduce the price that consumers pay at retail. Consumer coupons are distributed by a variety of methods. 
 RJR Tobacco provides trade incentives through trade terms, wholesale partner programs and retail incentives. Trade discounts are provided to wholesalers based on compliance with certain terms. The wholesale partner programs provide incentives to RJR Tobacco’s direct buying customers based on performance levels. Retail incentives are paid to the retailer based on compliance with RJR Tobacco’s contract terms. 
 RJR Tobacco’s cigarette brand portfolio strategy is based upon two brand categories: drive and other. The drive brands consist of two premium brands, NEWPORT and CAMEL, and the largest traditional value brand, PALL MALL. These three drive brands are managed for long-term market share and profit growth, and receive the vast majority of RJR Tobacco’s equity support with an emphasis on the NEWPORT and CAMEL brands. The other brand category includes the premium brand, CAPRI, and the value brands, DORAL and MISTY, along with other smaller brands. All of the other brands receive limited marketing support and are managed to maximize profitability. 
 The key objectives of the portfolio strategy are designed to balance the long-term market share growth and profitability of the drive brands while managing the other brands for long-term sustainability and profitability. Consistent with that strategy, RJR Tobacco continues to evaluate some of its non-core cigarette styles for potential elimination. 
 RJR Tobacco’s portfolio also includes CAMEL Snus, a smoke-free, heat-treated tobacco product sold in individual pouches that provide convenient tobacco consumption.

Anti-tobacco groups continue to attempt to restrict cigarette sales, cigarette advertising, and the testing and introduction of new tobacco products as well as encourage smoking bans. The MSA and federal, state and local laws and regulations, including the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act, referred to as the FDA Tobacco Act, discussed below, and related regulations, restrict or prohibit utilization of television, radio or billboard advertising or certain other marketing and promotional tools for cigarettes and smoke-free tobacco products. RJR Tobacco continues to use direct mailings, websites and other means to market its brands and enhance their appeal among age-verified adults who use tobacco products. RJR Tobacco continues to advertise and promote at retail locations and in adult venues and also uses print advertising in newspapers and consumer magazines in the United States, where permitted. 
 Manufacturing and Distribution 
 RJR Tobacco owns its manufacturing facilities, located in the Winston-Salem, North Carolina area. RJR Tobacco has a total production capacity of approximately 115 billion cigarettes per year. RJR Tobacco distributes its cigarettes primarily through a combination of direct wholesale deliveries from two local distribution centers and public warehouses located throughout the United States. 
 RJR Tobacco has entered into various transactions with affiliates of BAT. RJR Tobacco sells contract-manufactured cigarettes, tobacco leaf and processed tobacco to BAT affiliates. In January 2016, RJR Tobacco received written notice from a BAT affiliate terminating the cigarette contract manufacturing agreement effective January 5, 2019. In July 2016, RJR Tobacco amended the contract manufacturing agreement with a BAT affiliate to permit an early transition of the cigarette production, covered by the agreement, to BAT facilities, which began in the fourth quarter of 2016. Net sales, primarily of cigarettes, to BAT affiliates represented approximately 2% of RAI’s total net sales in each of 2016 and 2015 and 4% in 2014. For additional information, see Item 8, notes 18 and 22 to consolidated financial statements.
 Raw Materials 
 In its production of tobacco products, RJR Tobacco uses U.S. and foreign, grown primarily in Brazil, burley and flue-cured leaf tobaccos, as well as Oriental tobaccos grown primarily in Turkey, Macedonia and Bulgaria. RJR Tobacco believes there is a sufficient supply of leaf in the worldwide tobacco market to satisfy its current and anticipated production requirements. 
 RJR Tobacco purchases the majority of its U.S. flue-cured and burley leaf directly through contracts with tobacco growers. These short-term contracts are frequently renegotiated. RJR Tobacco believes the relationship with its leaf suppliers is good. 
 RJR Tobacco also uses other raw materials such as filter tow, filter rods and fire standards compliant paper, which are sourced from either one supplier or a few suppliers. RJR Tobacco believes it has reasonable measures in place designed to mitigate the risk posed by the limited number of suppliers of certain raw materials. 
 Santa Fe 
 Overview 
 RAI’s reportable operating segment, Santa Fe, manufactures and markets super-premium cigarettes and other tobacco products under the NATURAL AMERICAN SPIRIT brand in the U.S. 
 Competition 
 Santa Fe competes in the U.S. cigarette market with its Natural American Spirit brand, which is the fastest growing super-premium cigarette brand and is a top 10 best-selling cigarette brand. It is priced higher than most other competitive brands. Competition in the cigarette category is based primarily on brand positioning, including price, product attributes and packaging, consumer loyalty, promotions, advertising and retail presence. Based upon data collected by IRI/Capstone and processed and managed by MSAi, during 2016 and 2015, Santa Fe had an overall retail share of the U.S. cigarette market of 2.2% and 1.9%, respectively. 
Marketing 
 Santa Fe has a commitment to its natural tobacco products, the environment and its consumers and uses its marketing programs to promote this commitment. SFNTC is a subsequent participating manufacturer in the MSA. The MSA and federal, state and local laws and regulations, including the FDA Tobacco Act and related regulations, restrict or prohibit utilization of television, radio or billboard advertising or certain other marketing and promotional tools for cigarettes and other tobacco products. Santa Fe continues to use direct mailings, websites and other means to market its brand and enhance its appeal among age-verified adults who use tobacco 
 6


products. Santa Fe continues to advertise and promote at retail locations and in adult venues, and uses print advertising in consumer magazines and other publications in the United States, where permitted. 
 Manufacturing and Distribution 
 SFNTC owns its manufacturing facility, which is located in Oxford, North Carolina. Santa Fe distributes its products primarily through a combination of direct wholesale deliveries from a distribution center in North Carolina and public warehouses located throughout the United States. 
Raw Materials 
 Santa Fe’s support for sustainable agriculture and natural resources is part of its commitment to the environment. Santa Fe contracts directly with independent farmers and advocates earth-friendly practices through its two growing programs, Purity Residue Clean, which utilizes environmentally friendly cultivation practices, and Certified Organic, which follows the guidelines of the United States Department of Agriculture’s National Organic Program. In the production of its tobacco products, Santa Fe purchases electricity generated from renewable sources, including wind power, and operates a zero waste-to-landfill manufacturing facility. 
American Snuff 
 Overview 
 RAI’s reportable operating segment, American Snuff, is the second largest smokeless tobacco products manufacturer in the United States, and offers adult tobacco consumers a range of differentiated smokeless tobacco products, primarily moist snuff. The moist snuff category is divided into premium, price-value and popular-price brands. American Snuff’s primary brands include its largest selling moist snuff brands, GRIZZLY, in the price-value category, and KODIAK, in the premium category. 
 In contrast to the declining U.S. cigarette market, U.S. moist snuff retail volumes grew approximately 3.6%, 2.0% and 2.3% in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Moist snuff’s growth is partially attributable to cigarette smokers switching from cigarettes to smokeless tobacco products or using both. 
 Moist snuff has been the key driver to American Snuff’s overall growth and profitability within the U.S. smokeless tobacco market and accounted for approximately 91%, 90% and 89% of its revenue in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Profit margins on moist snuff products are generally higher than on cigarette products.
 Competition 
 American Snuff is dependent on the U.S. smokeless tobacco products market and competes in that market with other domestic and international companies. The highly competitive moist snuff category has developed many of the characteristics of the larger cigarette market, including multiple pricing tiers, focused marketing programs and significant product innovation. Similar to the cigarette market, competition is based primarily on brand positioning and price, as well as product attributes and packaging, consumer loyalty, promotions, advertising and retail presence. 
 American Snuff’s retail share of the U.S. moist snuff market, according to data collected by IRI/Capstone and processed and managed by MSAi, was 33.4% and 33.7% in 2016 and 2015, respectively. GRIZZLY moist snuff had a market share of 30.8% and 30.9% in 2016 and 2015, respectively. American Snuff’s largest competitor is U.S. Smokeless Tobacco Company LLC, referred to as USSTC, which had approximately 54.7% and 54.0% of the U.S. moist snuff market share in 2016 and 2015, respectively. 
 Marketing 
 American Snuff is committed to building and maintaining a portfolio of profitable brands. American Snuff’s marketing programs are designed to enhance brand image, build brand awareness and loyalty, and switch adult smokeless tobacco consumers of competing brands to American Snuff brands. Federal, state and local laws and regulations, including the FDA Tobacco Act and related regulations, restrict or prohibit utilization of television, radio or billboard advertising or certain other marketing and promotional tools for smoke-free tobacco products. 
 American Snuff’s brand portfolio strategy consists of the drive brand GRIZZLY, a leading moist snuff brand in the United States, and non-support brands that consist of all other brands. American Snuff is focusing on growing market share and profitability of its GRIZZLY branded products through equity-building initiatives and promotions. American Snuff also offers GRIZZLY pouches, which provide pre-measured portions that are more convenient than traditional, loose moist snuff. Pouches are the fastest growing 
 7


segment in the moist snuff category and represented approximately 20% of the total U.S. moist snuff market as of December 31, 2016. During 2016, demand for pouches continued to grow at more than triple the overall category rate. 
 Manufacturing and Distribution 
 American Snuff Co. owns its manufacturing facilities located in Memphis, Tennessee; Clarksville, Tennessee; and Winston-Salem, North Carolina. American Snuff distributes its products primarily through a combination of direct wholesale deliveries from a distribution center in North Carolina and public warehouses located throughout the United States. 
Raw Materials 
 In its production of moist snuff, American Snuff uses U.S. fire-cured and air-cured tobaccos as well as foreign, primarily Brazilian, burley and air-cured leaf tobaccos. American Snuff purchases the majority of its U.S. fire-cured and air-cured leaf directly through contracts with tobacco growers. These short-term contracts are frequently renegotiated. American Snuff believes the relationship with its leaf suppliers is good, and there is a sufficient supply of leaf in the worldwide tobacco market to satisfy its current and anticipated production requirements.

Raw Materials 
 In 2004, legislation was passed eliminating the U.S. government’s tobacco production controls and price support program. The buyout of tobacco quota holders provided for in the Fair and Equitable Tobacco Reform Act, referred to as FETRA, was funded by a direct quarterly assessment on every tobacco product manufacturer and importer, on a market-share basis measured on volume to which federal excise tax was applied. The aggregate cost of the buyout to the tobacco industry was approximately $9.9 billion, including approximately $9.6 billion payable to quota tobacco holders and growers through industry assessments over ten years, to 2014, and approximately $290 million for the liquidation of quota tobacco stock. The FETRA assessment expired in September 2014. RAI’s operating subsidiaries’ overall share of the buyout approximated $2.5 billion prior to the deduction of permitted offsets under the MSA. For additional information, see “— Tobacco Buyout Legislation” in Item 8, note 13 to consolidated financial statements. 
Research and Development 
 The research and development activities of RAI’s operating subsidiaries are primarily conducted at RJR Tobacco’s facility in Winston-Salem, North Carolina through various intercompany service agreements. Scientists and engineers continue to explore the development of innovative products, packaging and processes, as well as harm reduction technologies, modified risk tobacco products and analytical methodologies. Another key activity for research and development is to assist RAI’s operating companies in complying with regulations of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, referred to as the FDA, and to adhere to future FDA regulations and approval processes. 
 RAI’s operating subsidiaries’ research and development expense for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, was $101 million, $107 million and $88 million, respectively. 
 Intellectual Property 
 RAI’s operating subsidiaries own or have the right to use numerous trademarks, including the brand names of their products and the distinctive elements of their packaging and displays, and numerous patents. RAI’s operating subsidiaries’ material patents and trademarks are registered with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, and certain corresponding patents and trademarks are registered in other countries throughout the world. Rights in the U.S. patents will expire in accordance with their individual statutory terms, and rights in the trademarks in the United States will last as long as RAI’s subsidiaries continue to use the trademarks. The operating subsidiaries consider the distinctive blends and recipes used to make each of their brands to be trade secrets. These trade secrets are not patented, but RAI’s operating subsidiaries take appropriate measures to protect the unauthorized disclosure of such information. 
 In 1999, RJR Tobacco sold most of its trademarks and patents outside the United States in connection with the sale of the international tobacco business to JTI. The sale agreement granted JTI the right to use certain of RJR Tobacco’s trade secrets outside the United States, but details of the ingredients or formulas for flavors and the blends of tobacco may not be provided to any sub-licensees or sub-contractors. The agreement also generally prohibits JTI and its licensees and sub-licensees from the sale or distribution of tobacco products of any description employing the purchased trademarks and other intellectual property rights in the United States. In 2005, the U.S. duty-free and U.S. overseas military businesses relating to certain brands were re-acquired from JTI. 
 In addition to intellectual property rights it directly owns, RJR Tobacco has certain rights with respect to BAT intellectual property that were available for use by B&W prior to the completion of the B&W business combination. 
 On June 12, 2015, pursuant to the Divestiture, ITG acquired certain assets (1) owned by RAI subsidiaries or affiliates relating to the cigarette brands WINSTON, KOOL and SALEM, and (2) owned by Lorillard subsidiaries or affiliates related to the cigarette brand MAVERICK and the “e-vapor” brand blu (including SKYCIG). 
 On January 13, 2016, RAI, through the Sellers, completed the sale of the international rights to the NATURAL AMERICAN SPIRIT brand name and associated trademarks, along with SFRTI and other international companies that distributed and marketed the brand outside the United States to JTI Holding. Pursuant to that transaction, RAI has agreed not to, and agreed to cause its controlled affiliates not to, engage in the business of producing, selling, distributing and developing natural, organic and additive-free combustible tobacco cigarettes and roll-your-own or make-your-own tobacco products outside of the United States, and JTI has agreed not to, and agreed to cause its controlled affiliates not to, engage in the conduct of such business in the United States, in each case, for five years following the closing of the transaction.

Regulation and Taxation
 Tobacco products are subject to a variety of federal, state and local laws and regulations. Since 1966, federal law has required a warning statement on cigarette packaging. In 2009, the FDA Tobacco Act was adopted, granting the FDA broad authority over the manufacture, sale, marketing and packaging of tobacco products. In 2016, the FDA issued a regulation deeming certain products, including e-cigarettes, to be subject to the FDA Tobacco Act. Many state, local and municipal governments and agencies have adopted laws or regulations prohibiting or restricting the public use of tobacco products. Cigarettes and other tobacco products also are subject to substantial taxation at both the federal and state levels. For more information regarding the nature of the regulation and taxation of tobacco products, see Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Governmental Activity.” 
Litigation and Settlements
 Litigation, claims and other legal proceedings relating to the use of, exposure to, or purchase of tobacco products are pending or may be instituted in the future against RJR Tobacco (including as successor by merger to Lorillard Tobacco), American Snuff Co., SFNTC, RJR Vapor, RAI, Lorillard, other RAI affiliates, and indemnitees, including but not limited to B&W, sometimes referred to collectively as Reynolds Defendants. Reynolds Defendants have been named in a number of tobacco-related legal actions, proceedings or claims seeking damages in amounts ranging into the hundreds of millions or even billions of dollars. As of December 31, 2016, RJR Tobacco had paid approximately $239 million since January 1, 2014, related to unfavorable smoking and health litigation judgments.
 RAI’s management continues to conclude that the loss of any particular pending smoking and health tobacco-related litigation claims against Reynolds Defendants, or the loss of any particular case concerning the use of smokeless tobacco products against American Snuff Co., when viewed on an individual case-by-case basis, is not probable or estimable, except for certain Engle Progeny cases, as described in “— Litigation Affecting the Cigarette Industry — Overview” in Item 8, note 13 to consolidated financial statements. RAI and its subsidiaries believe that they have valid bases for appeal of adverse verdicts in their pending cases and valid defenses to all actions and intend to defend all actions vigorously. Nonetheless, the possibility of material losses related to tobacco-related litigation is more than remote. Litigation is subject to many uncertainties, and generally it is not possible to predict the outcome of the litigation pending against Reynolds Defendants, or to reasonably estimate the amount or range of any possible loss. Moreover, notwithstanding the quality of defenses available to it and its affiliates in tobacco-related litigation matters, it is possible that RAI’s consolidated results of operations, cash flows or financial position could be materially adversely affected by the ultimate outcome of certain pending or future litigation matters or difficulties in obtaining the bonds required to stay execution of judgments on appeal. 
 In 1998, RJR Tobacco, Lorillard Tobacco, B&W, SFNTC and the other major U.S. cigarette manufacturers entered into the MSA with attorneys general representing most U.S. states, territories and possessions. The State Settlement Agreements, of which the MSA is the most wide-reaching, impose a perpetual stream of future payment obligations on RJR Tobacco and the other major U.S. cigarette manufacturers and place significant restrictions on their ability to market and sell cigarettes in the future. The State Settlement Agreements have materially adversely affected RJR Tobacco’s shipment volumes. RAI believes that these settlement obligations may materially adversely affect the results of operations, cash flows or financial position of RAI and RJR Tobacco in future periods. The degree of the adverse impact will depend, among other things, on the rate of decline in U.S. cigarette sales in the premium and value categories, RJR Tobacco’s share of the domestic premium and value cigarette categories, and the effect of any resulting cost advantage of manufacturers not subject to the State Settlement Agreements.
 For disclosure of legal proceedings involving RAI and its operating subsidiaries, see Item 8, note 13 to consolidated financial statements. For a description of RAI’s and its operating subsidiaries’ accounting treatment for tobacco-related litigation contingencies, see Item 8, note 13 “—Tobacco Litigation — General — Accounting for Tobacco-Related Litigation Contingencies.” For additional information related to State Settlement Agreements, see Item 8, note 1 “— Cost of Products Sold”, and note 13 “— Litigation Affecting the Cigarette Industry — State Settlement Agreements — Enforcement and Validity; Adjustments,” to consolidated financial statements.

 At December 31, 2016, RAI and its subsidiaries had approximately 5,500 full-time employees and approximately 50 part-time employees. The 5,500 full-time employees include approximately 3,700 RJR Tobacco employees, 500 Santa Fe employees and 600 American Snuff employees. No employees of RAI or its subsidiaries are unionized.
