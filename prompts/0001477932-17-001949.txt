ITEM 1. BUSINESS.
Overview
 
Spotlight Innovation Inc. (the “Company”) is a pharmaceutical company focused on acquiring the intellectual property rights to innovative and proprietary therapeutics designed to address unmet medical needs with an emphasis on rare, emerging, or neglected diseases. In late summer/early fall of 2016 the Company changed its disease focus and has revised its product offerings including the addition of new indications and the elimination of previous programs. 
 
The Company works to maintain a balanced portfolio of early- and late-stage product candidates. We conserve capital and streamline operations through cost-effective collaborations with:
 

● | Contract research organizations (CROs) 
--+--------------------------------------------
● | Contract manufacturing organizations (CMOs)
● | Academic laboratories 

 
As of December 31, 2016, the Company had four subsidiaries: Celtic Biotech Iowa, Inc., Caretta Therapeutics, LLC, SMA Therapeutics, LLC, and Zika Therapeutics, LLC. The Company’s focus areas include, cancer, pain management, Zika virus infection, spinal muscular atrophy and refractory glaucoma.
 
Cancer
 
On June 4, 2014, our subsidiary, Celtic Biotech Iowa, Inc. (hereinafter "Celtic Iowa") acquired Celtic Biotech Limited (hereinafter "Celtic Limited"). Celtic Limited was founded in 2003 in Dublin, Ireland to develop novel therapies derived from snake venom for the treatment of solid cancers and pain in humans. 
 
Celtic Iowa's main focus has been the development of the specific snake venom toxin crotoxin, as a pain and cancer therapeutic. Derived from naturally specialized receptor-binding proteins, these products may have the potential to reduce treatment costs, improve quality-of-life and increase survival.
 
In March of 2017, Celtic Iowa commenced Part 2 of its Phase I dose escalation safety study, Crotoxin in Patients with Advanced Cancer using an Intravenous Route of Administration. ImmunoClin Ltd., a company specializing in clinical development, is the contract research organization (“CRO”) overseeing the study conduct. Part 2 of the Phase I study uses a revised protocol designed to determine whether faster dose escalation can be attained in a shortened time frame without increased risk to patients. The trial is being conducted at the Department of Medical Oncology at Pitié-Salpêtrière Hospital in Paris, France under the direction of Principal Investigator Maria A. Gil-Delgado, MD, PhD. Dr. Gil-Delgado is a member of the American Society of Clinical Oncology (“ASCO”). Noted French oncologist David Khayat, MD, PhD, FASCO, a Board Member of ASCO, is serving as Principal Scientific Advisor.
 
Pain Management
 Our subsidiary Caretta Therapeutics, LLC (“Caretta”) will commercialize homeopathic, over-the-counter products derived from cobra and venom, to treat chronic pain. 
 
Caretta holds a license agreement with Dr. Paul Reid to develop, manufacture and sell certain products derived from snake venom that may have analgesic properties. Caretta plans, in the second quarter of 2017, to launch Venodol, a topical roll-on, intended to provide relief from chronic pain that is a non-addictive alternative to opioid and steroidal analgesics. Additionally, Caretta has signed a Master Broker Agreement with a premier global distribution brokerage firm to distribute its products into supermarket, drug store, mass merchandise and warehouse chains.

Spinal Muscular Atrophy 
 
In October 2016, the Company entered into an Exclusive License Agreement with Indiana University Research and Technology Corporation (“IURTC”) to commercialize STL-182, an orally-available small molecule that may have therapeutic potential for treating spinal muscular atrophy. Spinal muscular atrophy is an autosomal recessive disorder that is a leading genetic cause of death in infants and toddlers. Synthesis and early preclinical testing of STL-182 was accomplished through a research collaboration between Professors Elliot Androphy of Indiana University School of Medicine, and Kevin Hodgetts, director of the Laboratory for Drug Discovery in Neurodegeneration at Brigham and Women's Hospital. Their work was supported in part by the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) and the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD). Professor Androphy and Professor Hodgetts are members of the Company’s Scientific Advisory Board.
 
Spinal muscular atrophy affects between 1 in 6,000 and 1 in 10,000 newborns. Approximately 1 in 40 to 1 in 50 adults have only a single intact spinal motor neuron 1 (SMN1) gene, which encodes a protein (SMN) required for proper neuromuscular function. An infant who inherits no intact SMN1 gene from either parent may develop spinal muscular atrophy and lose the ability to sit, stand, walk, swallow, and/or breathe. In about 60% of cases, patients with spinal muscular atrophy die by age two. Even in spinal muscular atrophy patients, low levels of functional spinal muscular atrophy protein are produced by an SMN1-related gene called SMN2. One therapeutic strategy to treat spinal muscular atrophy is to increase levels of functional SMN protein encoded by SMN2. In mouse models of spinal muscular atrophy, STL-182 may restore neuromuscular function by stabilizing endogenous SMN protein.
 
The Company has engaged a top-tier contract research organization (CRO) to conduct additional preclinical mouse studies of STL-182. These studies are ongoing and are expected to continue throughout 2017.
 
Zika Virus Infection
 
In August 2016, the Company entered into a sponsored research agreement with Florida State University (“FSU”) to support research directed by FSU professor Hengli Tang aimed at developing safe and effective drugs to treat patients infected with the Zika virus (ZIKV). In November 2016, the Company obtained from the Florida State University Research Foundation (“FSURF”) exclusive, worldwide rights to develop and commercialize certain compounds for the treatment of viral infections, including Zika virus infection. Included among the licensed compounds are those identified in a study co-authored by Prof. Tang that was published in Nature Medicine in August 2016. Prof. Tang and his research team collaborate with the Company as part of an existing sponsored research agreement (SRA), and Prof. Tang is a member of the Company's Scientific Advisory Board.
 
In January 2017, the Company entered into a second license agreement with FSURF for the development and commercialization of additional anti-Zika virus compounds. As with the initial license agreement, this agreement grants the Company exclusive, worldwide rights to develop and commercialize certain compounds for the treatment of viral infections, including Zika virus infection. 
 
Refractory Glaucoma
 
The Company has made a strategic, external investment in Solx, Inc., a Massachusetts-based, privately-held medical device company that develops innovative surgical technologies to treat refractory glaucoma and preserve vision. Solx's lead product is the SOLX Gold Shunt™, a first-in-class, implantable drainage device designed to reduce elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) associated with refractory glaucoma without creating a bleb. The device provides a pathway for the flow of aqueous humor from the anterior chamber to the suprachoroidal space, utilizing a natural pressure differential within the eye. Approved for use in Canada and Europe, the SOLX Gold Shunt has been tested in a multi-center clinical trial, is investigational and awaiting FDA approval in the U.S.
 
Additionally, the Company had interests in the following entities that was terminated during the year ended December 31, 2016:
 
CDT Veterinary Therapeutics, LLC (“CDT”) was formed in November 2015 to create reformulated variants of certain compounds, modified to meet the needs of the veterinary market. In September 2016, the Company decided to suspend its activities in CDT Veterinary Therapeutics, Inc.
 
The Company acquired approximately 82% of Memcine Pharmaceuticals, Inc. ("Memcine") in June 2015. On October 12, 2016, the Company terminated its interest in Memcine, and entered into a termination agreement with Memcine, the University of Iowa Research Foundation, and Dr. Tony Vanden Bush. Pursuant to the termination agreement, the Company terminated and cancelled all of its interest in Memcine, terminated the shareholder agreement of Memcine, and John Krohn and Cristopher Grunewald resigned as officers and directors of Memcine.

Intellectual Property
 
The Company’s goal is to protect the proprietary technologies that we believe to be key to its strategy. We seek to maintain patent protection to cover our product candidates, their methods of use, related technology and other inventions that we consider important to our business. We also rely on trade secrets and monitoring of our proprietary information to protect the aspects of our business that are necessarily appropriate for patent protection. A third party may hold intellectual property, including patent rights, which are important or necessary to the development of our technologies. It may be necessary for us to use the patented or proprietary technology of third parties to commercialize our products, in which case we would be required to obtain a license from these third parties on commercially reasonable terms, or our business could be harmed, possibly materially. If we were not able to obtain a license, or were not able to obtain a license on commercially reasonable terms, our business could be harmed, possibly materially. The scope of coverage claimed in a patent application can be significantly reduced and or modified before and after the patent is issued. Consequently, we do not know whether any of our technology candidates will be protectable or remain protected by enforceable patents. We cannot predict whether the patent applications we are currently pursuing will issue as patents or whether the claims of any issued patents will provide sufficient proprietary protection from competitors. Any patents that we hold may be challenged, circumvented or invalidated by third parties. 
 
The table below reflects the Intellectual Property of the Company: 
 

 | PATENT NO. | ISSUE DATE | TITLE 
---------------+-----------------------+------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Celtic Biotech | U.S. Patent 8,921,305 | Dec 2014 | Crotoxin Administration for Cancer Treatment and Pain Relief 
Celtic Biotech | U.S. Patent 8,278,265 | Oct 2012 | Methods, Kits and Compositions with Crotamine 
Celtic Biotech | U.S. Patent 9,345,751 | May 2016 | Crotalus Durissus Terrificus Venom Administration for Cancer Treatment and Pain Relief

Research and Development
 
The Company’s business is dependent on conducting research and development. We have spent and continue to spend significant time and capital on conducting research and development. Research and development expenses were $232,798 and $274,894 for 2016 and 2015, respectively. The Company anticipates that research and development expenses will continue to be substantial and to significantly increase as we continue the development of our existing technologies.
Competition
 
The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition and a strong emphasis on proprietary products. While we believe that our technology, knowledge, experience and scientific resources provide us with competitive advantages, we face potential competition from different sources, including large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, specialty pharmaceutical and generic drug companies, and medical technology companies. Any product candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize will compete with existing therapies and new therapies that may become available in the future. 
 
There are a large number of companies developing or marketing therapies for the indications that we are pursuing. Many of our competitors have substantially greater financial, technical and human resources and significantly greater experience in the development of product candidates, obtaining FDA and other regulatory approvals of products and the commercialization of those products. Small or early stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. We also compete with these companies in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific personnel and establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials.

FDA Approval Process
 
(Source: fda.gov) 
 
(a) Investigational New Drug Application ("IND") - At IND, the FDA decides whether it is reasonably safe for the company to move forward with testing the drug in humans after evaluating the results of preclinical testing in laboratory animals and what they propose to do for human testing.
(b) Clinical Trials - Drug studies in humans can begin only after an IND is reviewed by the FDA and a local institutional review board. At the commencement of clinical trials, they approve the clinical trial protocols, which describe the type of people who may participate in the clinical trial, the schedule of tests and procedures, the medications and dosages to be studied, the length of the study, the study's objectives, and other details. 
 
(c) Phase 1 - Phase 1 studies are usually conducted in healthy volunteers. The goal is to determine what the drug's most frequent side effects are and, often, how the drug is metabolized and excreted. Phase 1 focuses on safety. 
 
(d) Phase 2 - Phase 2 studies begin if Phase 1 studies do not reveal unacceptable toxicity. Phase 2 focuses on effectiveness. This phase aims to obtain preliminary data on whether the drug works in people who have a certain disease or condition. For controlled trials, patients receiving the drug are compared with similar patients receiving a different treatment--usually an inactive substance (placebo). 
 
(e) Phase 3 - Phase 3 studies begin if evidence of effectiveness is shown in Phase 2. These studies gather more information about safety and effectiveness, studying different populations in a larger group and different dosages and using the drug in combination with other drugs. 
 
(f) New Drug Application ("NDA") - The NDA is the formal step a drug sponsor takes to ask that the FDA consider approving a new drug for marketing in the United States. An NDA includes all animal and human data and analyses of the data, as well as information about how the drug behaves in the body and how it is manufactured.
