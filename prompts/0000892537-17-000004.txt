Our Customers
We derive the vast majority of our revenues from U.S. government customers. We have successful, long-standing relationships with these customers, having supported many of them for almost half a century. For each of the last three years we have derived approximately 98% of our annual revenues from our U.S. government customers, with at least 90% of our revenues each such year from national security and defense customers. 
Foreign Operations
We treat sales to U.S. government customers as sales within the U.S. regardless of where the services are performed. U.S. revenues were approximately 98.4%, 99.9% and 99.7% of our total revenues for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. International revenues were approximately 1.6%, 0.1% and 0.3% of our total revenues for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. We have recently made efforts to expand our international operations, primarily in support of allied nation governments, and we anticipate that our percentage of international revenues will increase from historical levels. 
Backlog
At December 31, 2016, our backlog was $4.9 billion, of which $1.0 billion was funded backlog. At December 31, 2015, our backlog was $4.1 billion, of which $1.0 billion was funded backlog. We expect that approximately 31% of our total backlog will be recognized as revenue prior to December 31, 2017.
We define backlog as our estimate of the remaining future revenues from existing signed contracts, assuming the exercise of all options relating to such contracts and including executed task orders issued under Indefinite Quantity/Indefinite Delivery (ID/IQ) contracts. We also include an estimate of revenues for solutions that we believe we will be asked to provide in the future under the terms of ID/IQ contracts for which there are established patterns of revenues.
We define funded backlog to be the portion of backlog for which funding currently is appropriated and allocated to the contract by the purchasing agency or otherwise authorized for payment by the customer upon completion of a specified portion of work. Our funded backlog does not include the full value of our contracts because Congress often appropriates funds for a particular program or contract on a yearly or quarterly basis, even though the contract may call for performance over a much longer period of time.
A variety of circumstances or events may cause changes in the amount of our backlog and funded backlog, including the execution of new contracts, the extension of existing contracts, the non-renewal or completion of current contracts, the early termination of contracts, and adjustments to estimates for previously included contracts. Changes in the amount of our funded backlog also are affected by the funding cycles of the government.
Patents, Trademarks, Trade Secrets and Licenses
We own a limited number of patents. We also maintain a number of trademarks and service marks to identify and distinguish the goods and services we offer. While we protect our patents, marks, trade secrets and vital confidential information, our business does not depend on the existence or protection of such intellectual property.
Seasonality
Our business is not seasonal. However, in order to avoid the loss of unexpended fiscal year funds it is not uncommon for U.S. government agencies to award extra tasks or complete other contract actions in the weeks before the end of the U.S. government's fiscal year (GFY), which begins on October 1 and ends on September 30. Additionally, our quarterly results are impacted by the number of working days in a given quarter. There are generally fewer working days for our employees to generate revenues in the first and fourth quarters of our fiscal year. 
Business Environment and Competitive Landscape
Our primary customer is the U.S. government, the largest consumer of services and solutions in the U.S. In U.S. GFY 2016, the U.S. government obligated approximately $287 billion on contracted services. Our principal focus is on the national security 
8

and defense of the U.S. homeland. The DoD is the largest purchaser of services and solutions in the U.S. government. With the U.S. GFY 2017 budget of $524 billion, the DoD accounts for approximately 50% of the total discretionary budget. 
We compete in a market that is shaped by both customer requirements and federal budget priorities and constraints. Our key competitors currently include divisions of large defense contractors, as well as a number of mid-size U.S. government contractors with specialized capabilities. Because of the diverse requirements of U.S. government customers and the highly competitive nature of large procurements, we frequently collaborate with these and other companies to compete for large contracts and we bid against these companies in other situations. 
 Following a decade of uninterrupted growth, federal spending came under pressure beginning in U.S. GFY 2012. Over the last several years, the failure to provide timely appropriations and constraints on discretionary spending created significant uncertainty about funding levels, which in turn caused federal agencies to delay contract award decisions, change spending patterns and reprioritize IT expenditures, which in turn adversely impacted the Company and our industry. In addition to the budget constraints of the last several years (which drove extremely competitive bidding, particularly on sustainment-related opportunities), the U.S. government's increased use of a lowest price/technically acceptable (LPTA) standard in connection with the procurement of certain services also contributed to pricing pressures. Generally, the use of an LPTA standard results in lower margins compared to comparable services procured in other manners. At the same time, many government agencies increasingly prioritized setting aside certain work for small businesses and disadvantaged businesses, which reduced our ability to bid on those opportunities as a prime contractor. While we were able to pursue some of that work by teaming with small businesses and disadvantaged businesses, such arrangements typically have resulted in less revenue and profit for us than we would receive if we were permitted to pursue the work on a full and open basis.
The difficult environment caused by the aforementioned developments began to improve in 2016. Congressional action in late 2015 alleviated much of the potential impact of sequestration and provided visibility into funding and spending levels throughout 2016 and through the recent presidential election. This improved budget clarity resulted in our customers making more award decisions and procuring services to meet mission needs on a more regular and predictable basis. We also believe that our customers' use of LPTA procurements has leveled off.
The U.S.government is currently operating under a continuing resolution through April 28, 2017, but the new Administration plans to submit a GFY 2017 budget amendment and supplemental request in March 2017, with a focus on needs within the DoD that (if approved) should result in a net increase over the top line amount requested by the previous Administration. The President is expected to submit his GFY 2018 budget in May, which should provide additional clarity with respect to out-year mission priorities and funding levels. 
The new Administration has sighted significant global threats, including the Islamic State in the Middle East, continued instability in Syria and Iraq, readiness and force structure needs within the military, increased concern regarding terrorism in the U.S. homeland and abroad, and cyber aggressions by both state and non-state actors, as priorities in establishing federal policy and budgets. We expect government funding priorities will continue to evolve under the new Administration. On January 27, 2017, the Administration issued the National Security Presidential Memorandum on Rebuilding the U.S. Armed Forces, which provides initial guidance focused on improving warfighting readiness and achieving program balance by addressing pressing shortfalls and building a larger, more capable and more lethal joint force. Although new Administration priorities will be subject to Congressional debate, we believe that the U.S. government's spending will remain robust in key areas that we are well positioned to serve, including national and homeland security programs, cyber security, sophisticated intelligence gathering and information sharing activities.
