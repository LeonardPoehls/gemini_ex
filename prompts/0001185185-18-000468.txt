Item 1. Business
Introduction
 
We are a global provider of disinfection solutions. We invented the AsepticSure® system to provide a superior means of disinfecting non-porous surfaces in numerous settings, including hospitals, other healthcare facilities and non-hospital/healthcare facilities. The AsepticSure® system utilizes hydrogen peroxide vapor and ozone in a patented process that achieves a six-log reduction across a broad array of bacterial and viral pathogens.
Recent Developments
 
Note and Warrant Financing
 
On January 31, 2018, we entered into identical securities purchase agreements (the “Securities Purchase Agreements”) with two specialized investment firms, L2 Capital, LLC (“L2”) and SBI Investments LLC, 2014-1 (“SBI” and, with L2, collectively, the “Investors”), pursuant to which we issued identical unsecured convertible promissory notes (collectively, the “Notes”) in the aggregate principal amount of $305,000. The Notes accrue interest at a rate of 8% per annum. Principal and accrued interest are payable at maturity six months from the date of issue. The Notes were issued with an original issue discount of $35,000. We also paid $20,000 from the proceeds of the Notes to the Investors to reimburse them for their legal fees in connection with the preparation of the Notes and the related loan and investment transaction documentation. Accordingly, the net proceeds we received from these Notes was $250,000. The Notes are convertible at any time at the option of the Investors into shares of common stock at a conversion price of $0.05 per share, subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of certain events of default with respect to the Notes; provided, however, that in no event shall an Investor be entitled to convert any portion of a Note in excess of that portion of the Note that, after giving effect to the conversion, such Investor (together with such Investor’s affiliates, and any persons acting as a group together with such Investor or any of such Investor’s affiliates) would beneficially own in excess of 4.99% (or 9.99% if elected by the Investor) of the number of shares of the common stock outstanding immediately after giving effect to the conversion. An Investor, upon 61 days prior notice to us, may increase the beneficial ownership limitation provisions applicable to its conversion of the Note from 4.99% to 9.99% of the number of shares of the common stock outstanding immediately after giving effect to the conversion. We may prepay the amount outstanding under either Note at any time by making a payment to the holder of an amount in cash equal to 130% multiplied by the total outstanding amount owed under the Note at such time of repayment. The Investor may convert the Note in whole or in part at any time within 10 days after it has been called for redemption.
 
In connection with the Securities Purchase Agreements, we also issued to each Investor a warrant (collectively, the “Warrants”) to purchase 2,833,168 shares of common stock. The Warrants are immediately exercisable for five years at an exercise price per share of $0.04169 (which is a price equal to 110% multiplied by the closing bid price of our common stock on the issuance date, which was $0.0379 per share). The Warrants include a cashless net exercise provision whereby the holder can elect to receive shares equal to the value of the Warrants minus the fair market value of shares being surrendered to pay for the exercise. The Warrants also contain customary anti-dilution provisions.
 
Equity Line Financing Arrangement
 
Also on January 31, 2018, we entered into that certain Equity Purchase Agreement with the Investors, which was subsequently amended on March 16, 2018 (as amended, the “Purchase Agreement”), pursuant to which the Investors committed to purchase in the aggregate, up to $10,000,000 of value of our common stock (the “Equity Line”). In consideration of their commitment under the Purchase Agreement, on January 31, 2018, we issued to each Investor 4,087,193 shares of common stock (the “Commitment Shares”) as a commitment fee. Pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, provided certain conditions are met, we have the right, but not the obligation, to direct the Investors to purchase shares of our common stock (the “Put Shares”) (i) in a minimum amount of not less than $20,000 and (ii) in a maximum amount of $1,000,000, provided that the number of Put Shares shall not exceed 300% of the average daily trading volume in the 10 trading days immediately preceding a Put Notice (as defined below). This arrangement is sometimes referred to as an “Equity Line.”

 Table of Contents
 At any time, and from time to time during the term of the Purchase Agreement (the “Commitment Period”), we may deliver a notice to the Investors requiring them to purchase shares (each such notice, a “Put Notice”). We will also deliver the Put Shares to the Investors via Deposit and Withdrawal at Custodian or “DWAC” within one trading day of the Put Notice. The purchase price for the Put Shares is 85% of the lowest traded price (as reported by Bloomberg Finance L.P.) during the five trading days immediately following the date the Investors receive the Put Shares associated with the applicable Put Notice (the “Valuation Period”); provided, however, that if the market price of our common stock during the Valuation Period is less than $0.01 per share, then the purchase price for the Put Shares will be 80% of the market price of our common stock during the Valuation Period. The closing of a Put Notice shall occur within one trading day following the end of the respective Valuation Period, at which time (i) the Investors shall deliver the investment amount to us by wire transfer of immediately available funds and (ii) the Investors shall return surplus Put Shares if the value of the Put Shares delivered to the Investors causes us to exceed the maximum commitment amount under the Purchase Agreement. Under the terms of the Purchase Agreement, we may not deliver another Put Notice to the Investors within seven trading days of a prior Put Notice.
 
Our right to issue and sell Put Shares to the Investors is subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, including, but not limited to, (i) an effective registration statement for resale of the Put Shares and the Commitment Shares, (ii) the accuracy of our representations and warranties, (iii) our performance of our obligations under the Purchase Agreement in all material respects, (iv) no suspension of trading or delisting of our common stock, (v) limitation of each Investor’s beneficial ownership to no more than 9.99% of our outstanding common stock, (vi) our maintaining our DWAC-eligible status, and (vii) our maintaining a sufficient number of authorized shares of common stock in reserve.
 
The obligation of the Investors to purchase common stock from us will expire (the “Commitment Period”) on the earlier of (i) the date on which the Investors shall have purchased $10,000,000 value of shares of common stock from us pursuant to the Equity Line, (ii) January 31, 2021, or (iii) upon our provision of written notice to the Investors that we elect to terminate the Purchase Agreement. Neither of the Investors, nor any affiliate of either of the Investors acting on its behalf or pursuant to any understanding with it, will execute any short sales during the period from the date hereof to the end of the Commitment Period.
 
In connection with the Purchase Agreement, we also entered into a Registration Rights Agreement requiring us to prepare and file a registration statement registering the resale of the Commitment Shares and the shares of common stock to be issued to the Investors under the Purchase Agreement (collectively the “Registrable Shares”), to use commercially reasonable efforts to cause such registration statement to become effective, and to keep such registration statement effective until the later of (i) the date as of which the Investors may sell all the Registrable Shares owned by them without restriction under Rule 144 promulgated under the Securities Act, or (ii) the date they have sold all the Registrable Shares and no “Available Amount” remains under the Purchase Agreement. In accordance with the Registration Rights Agreement, on February 12, 2018, we filed a registration statement on Form S-1 with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) to register the resale by the Investors of up to 14,059,041 shares that may be issued and sold to the Investors under the Equity Line and 8,174,386 Commitment Shares, or approximately 5.6% of our shares of common stock, assuming all such shares were issued and outstanding.
 
The foregoing description of the terms of the Securities Purchase Agreements, the Notes, the Warrants, the Purchase Agreement and the Registration Rights Agreement is not complete and is subject to and qualified in its entirety to the agreements and instruments themselves. We have previously filed Current Reports on Form 8-K and included copies of these agreements as exhibits to those reports, copies of which can be viewed on our corporate website.
 
The Disinfection Problem
 
Hospital-acquired infections (“HAIs”), also referred to as nosocomial infections, are a significant global problem. In the United States, such infections are a leading cause of death, accounting for approximately 100,000 deaths annually. According to the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (the “CDC”), the nosocomial infection rate for U.S. hospital admissions is approximately five to ten percent. In the European Union (“EU”), HAIs cause 37,000 deaths annually but contribute to an additional 110,000 deaths and impose direct costs on the healthcare system of approximately $10.5 billion annually. There are an estimated 4.1 million cases of nosocomial infections in the EU each year. In the developed world, nosocomial infections are estimated to affect patients at a rate of 3.5% to 12% of hospital admissions. Approximately 20% to 30% of these infections are considered preventable through intensive hygiene and control programs, while the other 70% to 80% are preventable through more involved measures, including hospital architecture, hospital air sanitation and use of disposable equipment and supplies.
 
In the hospital setting, a few bacterial and viral pathogens account for almost all the nosocomial infections. The species include the following: Acinetobacter baumannii, Clostridium difficile (“C. difficile”), Staphylococcus aureus and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (“MRSA”), Escherichia coli (“E. coli”), Salmonella, Shigella, Campylobacter, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Stenatrophomonas maltophilia, Tuberculosis, vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (“VRE”), Legionnaires’ Disease, Noroviruses, and Rotaviruses. A recent CDC report identified 18 superbugs as “urgent, serious, and concerning threats” to the population, including carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae, drug-resistant Neisseria gonorrhea and multi-drug resistant Acinetobacter. Infections caused by the same bacterial and viral pathogens that result in HAIs are also prevalent in settings outside hospitals.

 The AsepticSure® Solution
 
The AsepticSure® system is a portable, affordable disinfection system that can be easily operated by trained maintenance staff. Each AsepticSure® system consists of a primary unit that generates hydrogen peroxide mist and ozone (the “disinfectant generator”), two ozone scrubbers and a dehumidifier. The disinfectant unit is placed in the center of the room to be cleaned. Vents and doors are then sealed with an easily and cleanly removable adhesive tape product. The disinfectant unit is activated from outside of the room through a remote wireless interface. The room is filled with a unique and patented ozone-based gas formula to specific humidity and charge strength. Following the charge period and subsequent treatment period, the disinfectant unit is remotely turned off and the ozone scrubbers restore the atmosphere inside the room to applicable safety standards. The turnaround time for re-use of rooms up to 4,000 cubic feet in size is 80 to 90 minutes. This includes the decontamination of all room contents.
 
The disinfection action of the AsepticSure® system is achieved through a patented process involving the interaction of low-dose hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and ozone (O3) at a specific relative humidity for a fixed period of time. Ozone is a gas composed of three oxygen atoms (O3) in an unstable and highly reactive form. Ozone naturally tends to seek its normal state, exhibiting a short half-life as it reverts to oxygen (O2) fairly rapidly. There are many uses of ozone as a disinfecting agent. Although ozone does react with organic matter, it leaves no residue in water or on a treated product. Ozone also does not form any toxic byproducts. The interaction of hydrogen peroxide and ozone creates a compound known as Trioxidane (H2O3). Trioxidane is so efficient in killing bacteria at low concentrations that all equipment may remain in the room during the disinfection process as material compatibility testing across a broad range of metals, plastics, textiles and electronic circuit boards has shown no damage following 20 separate disinfection runs.
 
In October 2017, the AsepticSure® system was “CE” Mark certified in the EU and its member states. In June 2017, we received full electrical safety approval for all models of the AsepticSure® system. The approval means that the AsepticSure® system has achieved full compliance with the applicable international safety standards that provide a baseline requirement that must be met in order to pursue marketing in all jurisdictions, including Canada, the United States, South America, the EU, Asia, and the Middle East. Although we will be required to apply for a separate approval in each country, compliance with the international safety standards will greatly facilitate this process. In August 2016, Cogmedix Inc., our contract manufacturer (“Cogmedix”), obtained company and establishment numbers from the EPA to serve as a manufacturer for the AsepticSure® system. Cogmedix already held FDA medical device manufacturing status. EPA registration allows Cogmedix to ship AsepticSure® systems to hospitals and other users in the United States. The EPA has also granted a registration number for the specific hydrogen peroxide catalyst used in the AsepticSure® system. The AsepticSure Oxidative Catalyst is EPA approved for use in hospitals, clinics, food industry, sporting venues, and hotels to disinfect hard, non-porous surfaces at a 1.4% concentration.
 
We tested the AsepticSure® system against many of the bacterial and viral pathogens that most frequently cause HAIs. The table below sets forth the names of such species and, information about the results of our testing of the efficacy of the AsepticSure® system as a means of controlling them.
 
The efficacy data in the table below refer to “log reduction”. “Log” stands for logarithm, which is the exponent of 10. Log reduction stands for a 10-fold (one decimal) or 90% reduction in numbers of live bacteria. For example, a “5-log reduction” means lowering the number of microorganisms by 100,000-fold, that is, if a surface has 100,000 pathogenic microbes on it, a 5-log reduction would reduce the number of microorganisms to one. A 6-log reduction means the number of pathogenic microorganisms is 1,000,000 times smaller and a 7-log reduction means the number is 10,000,000 times smaller. Disinfection is considered to involve a bio-burden reduction of 99.99% (4-logs) and up to 99.999% (5-log reduction) or destruction of 999,990 out of 1,000,000 organisms, leaving behind very few, but still some, viable organisms. Sterilization is the statistical destruction of all microorganisms and their spores. It is defined as 6-log or a 99.9999% reduction. Statistically, this definition is accepted as zero viable organisms surviving.
 
Our research team has demonstrated that even a 3-log (99.9%) bactericidal kill is not enough to stop bactericidal regeneration. Yet a 3-log kill exceeds the results of most current cleaning practices and technologies. In our laboratories, we have demonstrated that the remaining 0.1% of bacteria following a 3-log kill begin to regenerate in a few hours and in five days will return to full strength. That is the reason most current cleaning methods and systems have failed to break the reinfection cycle in health care facilities.

The efficacy of the AsepticSure® system was first demonstrated outside the laboratory at Belleville General Hospital in Ontario, Canada during the summer of 2013 when a ward that had been contaminated with a MRSA outbreak was quarantined. Historically, the hospital reported that the ward had averaged one to two new MRSA cases per month. Following a single AsepticSure® cleaning, the hospital determined that the ward was free of MRSA and remained so for 11 months. In May 2014, at the Infection Prevention and Control Association of Canada (“IPAC”) Annual Scientific Meeting in Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada, we reported that each of the rooms disinfected with the AsepticSure® system at Belleville in June 2013 described above had gone a full year without another case of MRSA.
 
In January 2015, a senior official at Quinte Health Care, a four hospital Canadian health care system (“QHC”), informed Medizone that following the use of the AsepticSure® system to treat the MRSA outbreak at Belleville and a C. difficile outbreak at QHC’s Trenton Memorial Hospital, the hospitals reported no further cases of illness related to MRSA or C. difficile, citing the use of the AsepticSure® system as a significant factor. We reported at the IPAC meeting in Victoria, B.C. in June 2015, that there had been no further cases of C. difficile at Trenton Memorial Hospital as of the meeting date. We believe that this extraordinary demonstration of disinfection efficacy by the AsepticSure® system underscores the importance of obtaining 100% kill of infective pathogens in health care settings if the re-infection cycle is to be broken.
 
The Market for Disinfection Products and Services
 
We believe that the AsepticSure® system has application in a wide variety of settings, including medical facilities (hospitals, clinics, physician’s offices, outpatient surgical centers, long-term care facilities), bio-safety labs, athletic facilities (gyms and locker rooms) and sports equipment, mortuaries, bio-defense and response to pandemics, building remediation, tissue labs, and clean rooms. Each of these potential markets is discussed in greater detail below.
  
Medical Facilities. We believe that medical facilities, including hospitals, clinics, physician’s offices, outpatient surgical centers, and long-term care facilities, represent the primary market for the AsepticSure® system. The need to replace equipment periodically – the rate of replacement for typical steam, heat or chemical sterilizers is between 8 and 11 years – makes this an attractive market in our view.


Bio-safety Labs, Tissue and Cleanrooms. Bio-safety labs, tissue and blood labs and cleanrooms seek to reduce the risk of the transmission of infectious agents or materials from culture to culture and from culture to personnel. We believe that the use of the AsepticSure® system as a routine disinfection process in all biosafety levels and microbiological practices may reduce the risk of such transmission, while also reducing potential negative effects that can result from other decontamination products, such as high-concentration vaporized hydrogen peroxide, formaldehyde, glutaraldehyde and titanium dioxide, including blistering of paints, corrosion of metals, lengthy exposure times and potential carcinogenic exposure. There are many requirements and restrictions on the type of decontamination agents such labs may use to prevent these risks and remediate adverse incidents. We also believe that the AsepticSure® system can aid in all biosafety levels and microbiological practices, on all safety equipment, transfer hoods, isolation chambers, animal cages and other equipment, as well as help prevent the risks associated with handling infectious microorganisms.
 
Athletic Facilities and Sports Equipment. Transmission of infectious diseases in athletic facilities and by sports equipment is an increasingly recognized serious problem that is underappreciated by operators of the facilities and athletes. An October 2015 article published on Forbes.com [Stone, MRSA: How You Can Avoid NFL Player Daniel Fells’ Plight At The Gym (October 13, 2015) https://www.forbes.com/sites/judystone/2015/10/13/how-you-can-avoid-daniel-fells-mrsa-plight/#304555361974] highlights the risk of contracting infectious diseases faced by athletes at all levels of sport. The article explored the plight of Daniel Fells, then a 32-year-old New York Giants tight end, who contracted a serious MRSA infection after receiving a cortisone shot for an ankle injury. Fells had five surgeries to address the infection, which was feared to be career-ending. The article also states that a number of prominent NFL players have had MRSA infections, including members of the Cleveland Browns, Washington Redskins and Los Angeles Rams. The Tampa Bay Buccaneers had an outbreak among three players and faced a lawsuit from former kicker Lawrence Tynes, who claimed that unsanitary conditions at the team’s facilities caused him to become infected with MRSA, which required multiple surgeries and six weeks of intravenous antibiotics to cure. Tynes contended that the infection ended his career, costing him over $20 million in anticipated future earnings. It also notes that a college player at Lycoming College died from an MRSA infection in 2003 and that several prominent NBA players have also had difficult infections.
 
To evaluate the risk of infectious disease transmission by athletic equipment, our research staff assessed the risk of microbiological contamination in routinely used sports equipment, in this case ice hockey equipment, by taking samples from the surface of the equipment. The samples, which were plated and incubated in our research laboratory, showed significant bacterial growth on all sports equipment items, with no one organism being predominant. The equipment was then placed in a treatment room with one AsepticSure® machine where it was treated for 60 minutes at a relative humidity of 90%, with an 80-ppm concentration of ozone and a concentration of hydrogen peroxide at 1.4%. Post-treatment assessment showed no bacterial growth on all locations sampled after 24 hours. Based on the success of this test, we intend to market routine cleaning of athletic facilities and sports equipment using the AsepticSure® system as a means of reducing the transmission of infectious disease among athletes.

Mortuaries. There are more than 20,000 mortuaries, employing over 100,000 people, in the United States. The mortuary industry in the United States generates approximately $16 billion of revenues annually. The preparation rooms operated by mortuaries present major opportunities for disease transmission and contamination. We believe that mortuaries represent a major disinfecting/decontamination need and, as a result, are an attractive market for application of the AsepticSure® technology. In 2017, we assessed the risk of disease transmission in a mortuary in Ontario, Canada. At the beginning of the assessment, samples were collected from various locations in the mortuary’s preparation room. We plated and incubated the samples in our research laboratory. The pre-treatment assessment showed significant bacterial growth in multiple locations, with no single organism being predominant. We treated the preparation room with two AsepticSure® machines for 60 minutes. The relative humidity in the preparation room was set at 90%, the ozone concentration was set at 80 ppm and the concentration of hydrogen peroxide was 1.4%. Following treatment, we collected samples from the same areas that we sampled before treatment. The post-treatment assessment showed no growth in all locations assessed after 24 hours, while one bacterial colony was present at one of the sample locations after 48 hours. Based on our assessment, we concluded that a high level of microbial load was present in the preparation room before it was treated with the AsepticSure® system and that the single treatment virtually eliminated this microbial load. As a result, we intend to market routine cleaning of preparation rooms using the AsepticSure® system to mortuary operators as a means of reducing the risk of transmission of infectious diseases to mortuary workers.
 
Bio-defense and Response to Pandemics. The AsepticSure® system has received patents in the United States and the EU for its effectiveness as a means of eliminating B. subtilis, a well-accepted surrogate for Anthrax. In 19 separate tests involving 38 samples, the system demonstrated 100% reduction in B. subtilis spores. Furthermore, the National Research Council – Canada (NRC Human Health Therapeutics Portfolio) demonstrated the efficacy of the AsepticSure® system against Adenovirus (PTG3602) and a Coronavirus known as transmissible gastroenteritis virus (“TGEV”) (ATCC # VR-763), which is a surrogate for other coronaviruses such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome-Coronavirus (“MERS-CoV”) and Sudden Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (“SARS-CoV”). In two tests with the Adenovirus, involving 24 samples, the AsepticSure® system demonstrated the ability to eliminate 100% of the organism. In five tests against TGEV, involving 45 samples, the AsepticSure® system eliminated 100% of the organism. We believe that these tests provide scientific evidence supporting our belief that the AsepticSure® system is an effective means of eliminating the Ebola virus because filoviridae such as the Ebola virus are more susceptible to disinfection compared to coronavirus and adenovirus. Therefore, we intend to market the AsepticSure® system as a means of combating pandemic infections and bioterrorism.
 
Building Remediation. We believe that the remediation of buildings that are contaminated with mold, smoke, the residual effects from water damage, including bacterial contamination, and methamphetamine is a potentially a large market for the AsepticSure® system. As there are over 20,000 certified professional building remediators in the United States, we intend to target this market. Validation that we conducted in New Zealand has demonstrated the effectiveness of the AsepticSure® system as a means of decontaminating buildings that have been used in the illegal production of methamphetamines. The New Zealand study involved the use of one AsepticSure® machine to treat two separate 200-milligram samples of homogenized methamphetamine hydrochloride and a blank sample in a sealed two-by-three meter room. After treatment, the samples and blanks were rinsed and dissolved in approximately two milliliters of ethanol and analyzed by gas chromatography mass spectrometry along with a positive control. No additional compounds were detected in the methamphetamine hydrochloride samples after treatment with the AsepticSure® system. An independent testing laboratory in New Zealand, the Institute of Environmental Science and Research Limited, determined that no residual chemicals remained following the treatment of methamphetamine hydrochloride with the AsepticSure® system. In addition, research conducted at our BSL2 facility in Canada has also demonstrated high levels of efficacy (100% kill at 5 and 6 logs) for a broad variety of molds, including the ubiquitous black mold (Aspergillus fumigates) found throughout the United States and of particular concern in Texas, Florida and Puerto Rico, following recent hurricanes.
 
Distributors
 
We are attempting to establish a network of distributors to market the AsepticSure® system outside the United States. To date, we have entered into distributorship agreements with respect to Canada (Contamination Control Company), South America (GYD S.A. dba “BioAsepsis”; territories: Argentina, Chile, Brazil, Colombia and Peru), New Zealand/Australia (Aseptic Systems Ltd.) and the Nordic Region (Aglon a/s; territories: Norway, Sweden, Finland, Denmark and Iceland). These distributors have not yet contributed meaningfully to our operating results. We are in discussions with other potential distributors for other jurisdictions.
Intellectual Property
 
Our success depends in part upon our ability to obtain and maintain proprietary protection for our products and technologies. We protect our technology and products by, among other means, obtaining United States and foreign patents. There can be no assurance, however, that any patent will provide adequate protection for the technology, system, product, service or process it covers. In addition, the process of obtaining and protecting patents can be long and expensive. We also rely upon trade secrets, technical know-how, and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position.

Regulation
 
Our business is subject to various degrees of governmental regulation in the countries in which we and our distributors operate. In the United States, the FDA, the EPA and other governmental authorities regulate the development, manufacture, sale, and distribution of the AsepticSure® system. Government regulations include detailed inspection of, and controls over, research and development, clinical investigations, product approvals and manufacturing, marketing and promotion, sampling, distribution, record-keeping, storage, and disposal practices.
 
Compliance with applicable regulations is a significant expense for us. Past, current or future regulations, their interpretation, or their application could have a material adverse impact on our operations. Also, additional governmental regulation may be passed that could prevent, delay, revoke, or result in the rejection of regulatory clearance of our products. We cannot predict the effect on our operations resulting from current or future governmental regulation or the interpretation or application of these regulations. For more information about the risks we face regarding regulatory requirements, see “Risk Factors”.

 Table of Contents

We were required to register the AsepticSure® system with the EPA because it is considered to be a pesticide applicator within the meaning of the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act (“FIFRA”). FIFRA defines as a pesticide any substance or mixture of substances intended for preventing, destroying, repelling or mitigating any pest. A pest is defined by FIFRA to include any virus, bacteria or other microorganisms (except those organisms on or in living man or animals). However, the term pesticide does not include liquid chemical sterilant products (including any sterilant or subordinate disinfectant claims on such products) for use on a critical or semi-critical medical device. In other words, the EPA would have jurisdiction over viruses, bacteria or other microorganisms on inanimate surfaces as long as the surfaces are not considered semi-critical or critical medical devices. The FDA asserts jurisdiction over products intended for use on critical or semi-critical medical devices.
 
In November 2016, we received EPA registration of the AsepticSure® system for use as a disinfectant for animal pathogenic bacteria on hard nonporous surfaces in food processing plant premises, food processing equipment, hospital premises, hotels, motels, and sports venues (stadiums). This registration permits us to market and sell the AsepticSure® system as a general-purpose disinfectant.
  
The FDA regulates medical devices in the United States. The scope of the FDA’s authority extends to the labeling of and the promotion materials used in connection with medical devices. The FDA has taken the position that the AsepticSure® system is a medical device that is subject to pre-market approval utilizing the de novo 510(k) process because there is no predicate device that is substantially equivalent to the AsepticSure® system considering its unique method of action. During discussions with the FDA in January 2018, we obtained a clear understanding of the additional testing that we will need to conduct and the additional data that we will need to submit to the FDA to support our de novo application. We are now in the process of conducting the testing and gathering the data with a view toward making a submission to the FDA prior to the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2018.


We have received approval by the regulating bodies of Canada, New Zealand, and Chile for the AsepticSure® system to commence commercialization of the system and are pursuing approval, with the assistance of our distributors, by the appropriate authorities in other countries. The manufacturing and marketing of the AsepticSure® system is subject to the standards of Good Manufacturing Practices. We have not had any difficulty or unreasonable expense in meeting these standards.
 
Competition
 
The infection-control industry is extremely competitive. Our competitors include companies that market hydrogen-peroxide-based products, such as TOMI Environmental Solutions, Inc., Steris Corporation, Bioquell, Inc., Sanosil Ltd and The Clorox Company, various companies that market ultra-violet light disinfection systems and companies that market chemical-based disinfection systems. Many of our competitors have longer operating histories, greater name recognition, larger installed customer bases and substantially greater financial and marketing resources than we have. We believe that the principal factors affecting competition in our markets include name recognition and the ability to receive referrals based on client confidence in the disinfection system or service. Apart from government regulatory activities, there are no significant barriers of entry that could keep potential competitors from offering disinfection systems that compete with the AsepticSure® system. Our ability to compete successfully in the industry will depend, in large part, upon our ability to market and sell our indoor decontamination and infectious disease control products and services. There can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully in the remediation industry, or that future competition will not have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.
