The Company
Taubman Centers, Inc. (TCO or the Company) is a Michigan corporation (incorporated in 1973) that operates as a self-administered and self-managed real estate investment trust (REIT). The Taubman Realty Group Limited Partnership (the Operating Partnership or TRG) is a majority-owned partnership subsidiary of TCO that owns direct or indirect interests in all of our real estate properties. In this report, the terms "we", "us", and "our" refer to TCO, the Operating Partnership, and/or the Operating Partnership's subsidiaries as the context may require.
We own, lease, acquire, dispose of, develop, expand, and manage regional and super-regional shopping centers and interests therein. Our owned portfolio of operating centers as of December 31, 2016 consisted of 23 urban and suburban shopping centers operating in 11 U.S. states, Puerto Rico, South Korea, and China. The Consolidated Businesses consist of shopping centers and entities that are controlled by ownership or contractual agreements, The Taubman Company LLC (Manager), and Taubman Properties Asia LLC and its subsidiaries (Taubman Asia). Shopping centers owned through joint ventures that are not controlled by us but over which we have significant influence (Unconsolidated Joint Ventures) are accounted for under the equity method. See "Item 2. Properties" for information regarding the centers.
Taubman Asia, which is the platform for our operations and developments in China and South Korea, is headquartered in Hong Kong.
We operate as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code). In order to satisfy the provisions of the Code applicable to REITs, we must distribute to our shareowners at least 90% of our REIT taxable income prior to net capital gains and meet certain other requirements. The Operating Partnership's partnership agreement provides that the Operating Partnership will distribute, at a minimum, sufficient amounts to its partners such that our pro rata share will enable us to pay shareowner dividends (including capital gains dividends that may be required upon the Operating Partnership's sale of an asset) that will satisfy the REIT provisions of the Code.
We have one reportable segment, which owns, develops, and manages regional shopping centers. We have aggregated our shopping centers into this one reportable segment, as the shopping centers share similar economic characteristics and other similarities. See "Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" to our consolidated financial statements for more information.

The Shopping Center Business
There are several types of retail shopping centers, varying primarily by size and marketing strategy. Retail shopping centers range from neighborhood centers of less than 100,000 square feet of gross leasable area (GLA) to regional and super-regional shopping centers. Retail shopping centers in excess of 400,000 square feet of GLA are generally referred to as "regional" shopping centers, while those centers having in excess of 800,000 square feet of GLA are generally referred to as "super-regional" shopping centers. In this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the term "regional shopping centers" refers to both regional and super-regional shopping centers. The term "GLA" refers to gross retail space, including anchors and mall tenant areas, and the term "Mall GLA" refers to gross retail space, excluding anchors. The term "anchor" refers to a department store or other large retail store. The term "mall tenants" refers to stores (other than anchors) that lease space in shopping centers.
Business of the Company
We are engaged in the ownership, leasing, acquisition, disposition, development, expansion, and management of regional shopping centers and interests therein. We owned interests in 23 operating centers as of December 31, 2016. 
As of December 31, 2016, the centers:

• | are strategically located in major metropolitan areas, many in communities that are among the most affluent in the U.S. or Asia, including Denver, Detroit, Honolulu, Kansas City, Los Angeles, Miami, Nashville, New York City, Orlando, Salt Lake City, San Francisco, San Juan, Sarasota, St. Louis, Tampa, Washington, D.C., Hanam (South Korea), and Xi'an (China);


• | range in size between 236,000 and 1.7 million square feet of GLA and between 186,000 and 1.2 million square feet of Mall GLA, with an average of 1.0 million and 0.5 million square feet, respectively. The smallest center has approximately 60 stores, and the largest has over 250 stores with an average of 150 stores per center. Of the 23 centers, 14 are super-regional shopping centers;


• | have approximately 3,100 stores operated by their mall tenants under approximately 1,500 trade names;


• | have 53 anchors, operating under 14 trade names;


• | lease approximately 93% of Mall GLA to national chains (U.S. centers only), including subsidiaries or divisions of Forever 21 (Forever 21, For Love 21, and XXI Forever), The Gap (Gap, Gap Kids, Baby Gap, Banana Republic, Old Navy, Athleta, and others), H&M, and Limited Brands (Bath & Body Works/White Barn Candle, Pink, Victoria's Secret, and others); and


• | are among the highest quality centers in the U.S. public regional mall industry as measured by our high portfolio average of mall tenants' sales per square foot. In 2016, our mall tenants at comparable centers reported average sales per square foot of $792.

The most important factor affecting the revenues generated by the centers is leasing to mall tenants (including temporary tenants and specialty retailers), which represents approximately 90% of revenues. Anchors account for less than 10% of revenues because many own their stores and, in general, those that lease their stores do so at rates substantially lower than those in effect for mall tenants.
Our portfolio is concentrated in highly productive shopping centers. Of our 23 owned centers, 19 have annualized rent rolls at December 31, 2016 of over $10 million. We believe that this level of productivity is indicative of the centers' strong competitive positions and is, in significant part, attributable to our business strategy and philosophy. We believe that large shopping centers (including regional and especially super-regional shopping centers) are the least susceptible to direct competition because (among other reasons) anchors and large specialty retail stores do not find it economically attractive to open additional stores in the immediate vicinity of an existing location for fear of competing with themselves. In addition to the advantage of size, we believe that the centers' success can be attributed in part to their other physical characteristics, such as design, layout, and amenities.

Business Strategy And Philosophy
We believe that the regional shopping center business is not simply a real estate development business, but rather an operating business in which a retailing approach to the on-going management and leasing of the centers is essential. Thus we:

• | offer retailers a location where they can maximize their profitability. We believe leading retailers and emerging concepts choose to showcase their brand in the best markets and highest quality assets;


• | offer a large, diverse selection of retail stores and dining in each center to give customers a broad selection of consumer goods, food, and entertainment and a variety of price ranges;


• | endeavor to increase overall mall tenants' sales by leasing space to a constantly changing mix of tenants, thereby increasing rents;


• | seek to anticipate trends in the retailing industry and emphasize ongoing introductions of new retail concepts into our centers. Due in part to this strategy, a number of successful retail trade names have opened their first mall stores in the centers. In addition, we have brought to the centers "new to the market" retailers and other retailers that previously served customers through online presences. We believe that the execution of this leasing strategy is an important element in building and maintaining customer loyalty and increasing mall productivity; and


• | provide innovative initiatives, including those that utilize technology and the Internet, to increase revenues, enhance the shopping experience, build customer loyalty, and increase tenant sales, with the following as examples:


• | our Taubman website program connects shoppers to each of our individual center brands through the Internet, including mobile devices;


• | we have a robust email program reaching our most loyal customers weekly and our social media sites offer retailers and customers an immediate geo-targeted communication vehicle;


• | we have pioneered an indoor navigation technology that has the potential to significantly change a shopper's experience and connect them to retailers in new ways. Since its pilot in 2014, we have rolled out the indoor navigation technology at 15 centers in our portfolio;


• | we were one of the first mall companies to implement a third-party loyalty program that directly and automatically connects shopper credit card activity within the mall to rewards earned in order to drive repeat shopper visits; and


• | we are continuing to invest in other synergistic digital capabilities and are a leading pioneer of the "Smart Mall" concept. Of the 23 shopping centers in our portfolio, 19 are considered to be "Smart Malls." This technology includes a new fiber optic network throughout the centers, free shopper Wi-Fi, navigation and directory technology, advanced energy management, high-speed networking options for our tenants, new digital, mobile shopper engagement, and advanced shopper analytics.

The impact of e-commerce on shopping center retail has been steadily increasing but is difficult to quantify. While challenging traditional retail in the shorter-term, e-commerce is also making high quality brick-and-mortar assets more valuable, as retailers focus their real estate investments on the strongest assets. Successful retailers understand that a combination of both physical and digital channels best meet their customer needs. Physical locations are an important distribution channel that reduce order fulfillment and customer acquisition costs, while improving website traffic and brand recognition. We strive to position our assets to be desirable platforms for omni-channel retailers, believing technology improves the customer experience and will continue to do so, from the front of the house, logistics, efficiency, pricing, customer acquisition, customer knowledge and service. Our portfolio complements retailers' omni-channel strategy by positioning their brand among high-end, productive retailers in some of the best markets.
Our leasing strategy involves assembling a diverse mix of mall tenants in each of the centers in order to attract customers, thereby generating higher sales by mall tenants. High sales by mall tenants make the centers attractive to prospective renewal and new tenants, thereby increasing the rental rates that current and prospective tenants are willing to pay. We have implemented an active leasing strategy to increase the centers' productivity and to set minimum rents at higher levels. Elements of this strategy include renegotiating existing leases and leasing space to prospective tenants that would enhance a center's retail mix.

The centers compete for retail consumer spending through diverse, in-depth presentations of predominantly fashion merchandise in an environment intended to facilitate customer shopping. Many of our centers include stores that target high-end customers, and such stores may also attract other retailers to come to the center. However, each center is individually merchandised in light of the demographics of its potential customers within convenient driving distance. When necessary, we consider rebranding existing centers in order to maximize customer loyalty, maintain and increase tenant sales, and achieve greater profitability.
Potential For Growth
Our principal objective is to enhance shareowner value. We seek to maximize the financial results of our core assets, while also pursuing a growth strategy that includes redevelopment of existing centers as well as a new center development program. As our current development pipeline is now largely complete, our emphasis will now be on strengthening and growing our core assets, in addition to stabilizing our newest projects and executing our redevelopments. We continue to invest for the future and are creating value in our centers that is intended to lead to sustained growth for our shareowners. Our internally generated funds and distributions from operating centers and other investing activities (including strategic dispositions), augmented by use of our existing revolving lines of credit and unsecured term loans, provide resources to maintain our current operations and assets, pay dividends, and fund a portion of our major capital investments. Generally, our need to access the capital markets is limited to refinancing or repaying debt obligations at or near maturity and, in certain cases, funding major capital investments. From time to time, we also may access the equity markets or sell interests in shopping centers to raise additional funds or refinance existing obligations on a strategic basis, including using excess proceeds therefrom.
Internal Growth
As noted in "Business Strategy and Philosophy" above in detail, our core business strategy is to maintain a portfolio of properties that deliver above-market profitable growth by providing targeted retailers with the best opportunity to do business in each market and targeted shoppers with the best local shopping experience for their needs.
We continue to expect that over time a significant portion of our future growth will come from our existing core portfolio and business. We have always had and will continue to have a culture of intensively managing our assets and maximizing the rents from tenants as this is a key growth driver going forward.
While the sale of seven centers to Starwood Capital Group (Starwood) in 2014 reduced the number of centers in our core portfolio, the more consistent, smaller base has allowed us to focus where the greatest net asset value can be created: our most highly productive centers, our redevelopments, and development pipeline.
Another element of growth over time is the strategic expansion and redevelopment of existing properties to update and enhance their market positions by adding, replacing, re-tenanting, or otherwise re-merchandising the use of anchor space, increasing mall tenant space, or rebranding centers. Most of the centers have been designed to accommodate expansions. Expansion projects can be as significant as new shopping center construction in terms of scope and cost, requiring governmental and existing anchor store approvals, design and engineering activities, including rerouting utilities, providing additional parking areas or decking, acquiring additional land, and relocating anchors and mall tenants (all of which must take place with a minimum of disruption to existing tenants and customers).
A comprehensive renovation is underway at Beverly Center and is scheduled to be completed by the 2018 holiday season. Additionally, we have an ongoing redevelopment project at The Mall at Green Hills that will add approximately 170,000 square feet of incremental GLA that we expect to be completed in 2019. 
We also recently completed redevelopment projects at Cherry Creek Shopping Center, Dolphin Mall, International Plaza, and Sunvalley. In total, these completed projects added approximately 160,000 square feet of incremental GLA to our portfolio and resulted in exciting additions to many of our best assets. 
We also look to monetize our common areas through robust specialty leasing and sponsorship programs. About 8% of our 2016 comparable center Net Operating Income (NOI) was generated from such programs. In the past five years, comparable center NOI from leasing and sponsorship programs has ranged from 8% to 11%. Examples found in our centers include destination holiday experiences, customer service programs, sponsored children's play areas, and turnkey attractions. In addition, we monetize our common areas through static and digital media that comes in a variety of formats.

External Growth
We pursue various areas of external growth, including traditional center development in the U.S., new opportunities in Asia, and acquisitions. Additionally, we also consider other forms of retail, such as outlet centers and street retail, which may be part of significant mixed-use projects, as we believe they are a natural extension of our existing capabilities. We opened three new centers in 2016 in Hawaii, South Korea, and China and construction is ongoing on another shopping center in China, which is scheduled to open in March 2017. We continue to evaluate various development and acquisition possibilities for additional new centers. 
Development of New U.S. Centers
We have developed 14 U.S. properties since 1998, or an average about one every 18 months. Over the past three years, we have opened three new U.S. centers:

• | International Market Place opened in Waikiki, Honolulu, Hawaii in August 2016. We have a 93.5% interest in the 0.3 million square foot center, which is subject to a participating ground lease.


• | The Mall of San Juan opened in San Juan, Puerto Rico in March 2015. We have a 95% ownership interest in the 0.6 million square foot center.


• | The Mall at University Town Center in Sarasota, Florida opened in October 2014. We have a 50% ownership interest in the 0.9 million square foot center.

While we attempt to maximize external growth through the development of new centers, we also prudently manage the risks associated with development. We generally do not acquire land early in the development process. Instead, we generally acquire options on land or form partnerships with landowners holding potentially attractive development sites. We typically exercise the options only once we are prepared to begin construction. The pre-construction phase for a regional center typically extends over several years and the time to obtain anchor commitments, zoning and regulatory approvals, and public financing arrangements can vary significantly from project to project. In addition, we generally do not begin construction until a sufficient number of anchor stores or significant tenants have agreed to operate in the shopping center, such that we are confident that the projected tenant sales and rents from Mall GLA are sufficient to earn a stabilized return on invested capital in excess of our cost of capital. Having historically followed these principles, our experience indicates that, on average, less than 10% of the costs of the development of a regional shopping center will be incurred prior to the construction period. However, no assurance can be given that we will continue to be able to so limit pre-construction costs.
While we will continue to evaluate U.S. development projects using criteria, including financial criteria for rates of return, similar to those employed in the past, no assurances can be given that the adherence to these criteria will produce comparable or projected results in the future. In addition, the costs of shopping center development opportunities that are explored but ultimately abandoned will, to some extent, diminish the overall return on development projects taken as a whole. See "MD&A – Liquidity and Capital Resources – Capital Spending" for further discussion of our development activities.
In 2015, we made a decision not to move forward with an enclosed regional mall that was intended to be part of the Miami Worldcenter mixed-use, urban development in Miami, Florida. As a result of this decision, an impairment charge of $11.8 million was recognized in the fourth quarter of 2015, which represents previously capitalized costs related to the pre-development of the enclosed mall plan. 
Miami Worldcenter's master developer, Miami Worldcenter Associates, is now pursuing a high street retail plan as a part of their master development of the site. We have agreed with Miami Worldcenter Associates on terms for a co-leasing services agreement with The Forbes Company for the retail portion of the street level project, with an option to purchase the retail component at a favorable price once it opens.

Asia
We are pursuing a development strategy in Asia to:

• | provide additional growth through exposure to more rapidly growing gross domestic products (GDPs);


• | utilize our expertise, including leasing/retailer relationships, design/development expertise, and operational/marketing skills; and


• | take advantage of a generational opportunity, as the demand for high-quality retail is early to mid-cycle, there is significant deal flow, and it diversifies longer-term growth investment opportunities.

Taubman Asia is responsible for our operations and development in the Asia-Pacific region, focusing on China and South Korea. We have pursued a strategy of seeking strategic partners to jointly develop high quality malls in our areas of focus. Taubman Asia is engaged in projects that leverage our strong retail planning, design, and operational capabilities with our strategic partners being responsible for acquiring and entitling the land and leading construction. 
We currently have two joint ventures with Wangfujing Group Co., Ltd (Wangfujing), one of China's largest department store chains. The first joint venture owns an interest in and manages an approximately 1.0 million square foot shopping center, CityOn.Xi'an, which opened in April 2016 and is located at Xi'an Saigao City Plaza, a large-scale mixed-use development in Xi'an, China. We have an effective 50% ownership interest in the center. The second joint venture with Wangfujing owns an interest in and will manage a shopping center, CityOn.Zhengzhou, to be located in Zhengzhou, China. We beneficially own a 49% interest in the project. This approximately 1.0 million square foot shopping center is scheduled to open in March 2017.
We also have a joint venture with Shinsegae Group, one of South Korea's largest retailers, that owns and manages an approximately 1.7 million square foot shopping center, Starfield Hanam, in Hanam, South Korea. The center opened in September 2016. We have partnered with a major institution in Asia for a 49% ownership interest in Starfield Hanam. The institutional partner owns 14.7% of the center, bringing our effective ownership to 34.3%.
As part of our Asia strategy, we look to mitigate our operating costs through third-party service contracts when possible. We previously provided leasing and management services for IFC Mall in Yeouido, Seoul, South Korea, although these services were ended in the first quarter of 2017 in connection with a change in ownership of the mall. We also currently provide leasing and management services for the retail portion of Studio City, a cinematically-themed integrated entertainment, retail and gaming resort developed by Melco Crown Entertainment Limited in the Cotai region of Macau, China.
We attempt to manage risks for our Asia developments through similar means as those mentioned previously under "Development of New U.S. Centers", as well as pursuing initial projects that are already fully entitled with partners having appropriate expertise in land acquisition and local regulatory issues. However, in Asia, our projects are expected to have lower initial rates of return at stabilization than those expected in the U.S. With sales growth in the region expected to outpace the U.S., as well as average shorter lease terms that allow for quicker lease rollovers, we generally expect that returns on our Asia investments will eventually meet or exceed those targeted in the U.S. Also, developments in China and South Korea are subject to income taxes and taxes upon repatriation of earnings.
See "MD&A - Results of Operations - Taubman Asia" for further details regarding our activities in Asia.

Strategic Acquisitions
We expect attractive opportunities to acquire existing centers, or interests in existing centers, from other companies to continue to be scarce and expensive. However, we continue to look for assets where we can add significant value or that would be strategic to the rest of our portfolio, and we have capital available for selective opportunities. Our objective is to acquire existing centers only when they are compatible with the quality of our portfolio, or can be redeveloped to that level. We also may acquire additional interests in centers currently in our portfolio, such as our acquisitions of additional interests in CityOn.Xi'an and CityOn.Zhengzhou during 2016 (see "MD&A – Liquidity and Capital Resources – Capital Spending – New Developments").
In March 2016, a joint venture we formed with The Macerich Company acquired Country Club Plaza, a mixed-use retail and office property in Kansas City, Missouri, from Highwood Properties for $660 million ($330 million at TRG’s beneficial share) in cash, excluding transaction costs. This purchase is consistent with our strategy to own high quality, dominant assets in great markets. See "MD&A - Results of Operations - Acquisition - Country Club Plaza" for additional information regarding the acquisition.
Rental Rates
As leases have expired in the centers, we have generally been able to rent the available space, either to the existing tenant or a new tenant, at rental rates that are higher than those of the expired leases. Generally, center revenues have increased as older leases rolled over or were terminated early and replaced with new leases negotiated at current rental rates that were usually higher than the average rates for existing leases. Average rent per square foot statistics reflect the contractual rental terms of the lease currently in effect and include the impact of rental concessions. In periods of increasing sales, rents on new leases will generally tend to rise. In periods of slower growth or declining sales, rents on new leases will grow more slowly or will decline for the opposite reason, as tenants' expectations of future growth become less optimistic. Rent per square foot statistics are computed using contractual rentals per the tenant lease agreements, which reflect any lease modifications, including those for rental concessions. See "Risk Factors" for further information.
The following table contains certain information regarding average mall tenant minimum rent per square foot of our Consolidated Businesses and Unconsolidated Joint Ventures at the comparable centers (centers that had been owned and open for the current and preceding year, excluding centers impacted by significant redevelopment activity). Comparable center statistics for 2016 and 2015 exclude Beverly Center, CityOn.Xi'an, Country Club Plaza, International Market Place, The Mall of San Juan, and Starfield Hanam.

(1) | Excludes rents from temporary in-line tenants and centers not open and operating at December 31, 2016.


(2) | In addition to tenants with spaces 10,000 square feet or less, includes tenants with spaces over 10,000 square feet and value and outlet center anchors. Excludes rents from regional mall anchors and temporary in-line tenants. 


(3) | Weighted average of the annualized contractual rent per square foot as of the end of the reporting period.


(4) | Excludes leases that expire in 2017 for which renewal leases or leases with replacement tenants have been executed as of December 31, 2016.

We believe that the information in the table is not necessarily indicative of what will occur in the future because of several factors, but principally because of early lease terminations at the centers. For example, the average remaining term of the leases that were terminated during the period 2011 to 2016 was less than one year. The average term of leases signed was approximately six and eight years during 2016 and 2015, respectively.
In addition, mall tenants at the centers may seek the protection of the bankruptcy laws, which could result in the termination of such tenants' leases and thus cause a reduction in cash flow. In 2016, tenants representing 0.8% of leases filed for bankruptcy during the year compared to 1.0% in 2015. This statistic has ranged from 0.3% to 1.6% of leases per year over the last five years. The annual provision for losses on accounts receivable represents 0.7% of total revenues in 2016 and has ranged from 0.1% to 0.7% over the last five years.
Occupancy
Occupancy and leased space statistics include temporary in-line tenants (TILs) and value and outlet center anchors (Arizona Mills, Dolphin Mall, Great Lakes Crossing Outlets, and Taubman Prestige Outlets Chesterfield). The following table shows ending occupancy and leased space for the past five years:

Major Tenants
No single retail company represents 5% or more of our Mall GLA or revenues. The combined operations of Forever 21 accounted for about 4% of Mall GLA as of December 31, 2016 and less than 4% of 2016 minimum rent. No other single retail company accounted for more than 4% of Mall GLA as of December 31, 2016 or 4% of 2016 minimum rent.
The following table shows the ten mall tenants who occupy the most Mall GLA at our centers and their square footage as of December 31, 2016:

Competition
There are numerous shopping facilities that compete with our properties in attracting retailers to lease space. We compete with other major real estate investors with significant capital for attractive investment opportunities. See "Risk Factors" for further details of our competitive business.
Seasonality
The regional shopping center industry in the U.S. is seasonal in nature, with mall tenant sales highest in the fourth quarter due to the Christmas season, and with lesser, though still significant, sales fluctuations associated with the Easter holiday and back-to-school period. See "MD&A – Seasonality" for further discussion.
Environmental Matters
See "Risk Factors" regarding discussion of environmental matters.
Financial Information about Geographic Areas 
We have not had material consolidated revenues attributable to foreign countries in the last three years or material consolidated long-lived assets located in a country other than the United States, as our investments in Asia are unconsolidated joint ventures and are accounted for under the equity method.
