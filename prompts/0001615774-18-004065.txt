OVERVIEW 
 Fiscal year 2013
 GENERAL
 
Established in 1969, Advanzeon Solutions, Inc., (formerly Comprehensive Care Corp.) (“Advanzeon”, “we” or the “Company”),through its wholly-owned subsidiary Comprehensive Behavioral Care, Inc., and its wholly-owned subsidiaries provided managed care services in the behavioral health and substance abuse fields. We primarily offered these services to commercial, Medicare, Medicaid, Children’s Health Insurance Program (“CHIP”) health plans, as well as self-insured companies. Our managed care operations include administrative service agreements, fee-for-service agreements, and capitation contracts.
 
The behavioral health and substance abuse services provided through our provider network include outpatient programs (such as counseling or therapy), intermediate care programs (such as intensive outpatient programs and partial hospitalization services), and inpatient and crisis intervention services. In 2013, we had a network of approximately 60,000 contracted providers in the following areas: psychiatrists, psychologists, therapists, other licensed healthcare professionals, psychiatric hospitals, general medical facilities with psychiatric beds, residential treatment centers and other treatment facilities.
 
In 1999 we were awarded our first National Committee for Quality Assurance (“NCQA”) accreditation.

MARKET OPPORTUNITIES 
 
Advanzeon markets to regional health plans that do not have their own behavioral health network. These health plans will often contract with a managed behavioral healthcare organization (“MBHO”) to obtain access to behavioral healthcare professionals, claims processing, case management, better-integrated behavioral healthcare, and in some cases pharmacy management services. The health plans typically engage an MBHO like Advanzeon on a fixed fee paid on a per-member-per-month (“PMPM”) basis. Often, the PMPM will include the costs of care, which are the costs paid out to the providers and for pharmaceuticals, if applicable. Such an arrangement is known as an at-risk contract and the MBHO bears the risk/reward of the costs associated with higher or lower utilization of care. If the PMPM excludes the cost of care, the MBHO is essentially providing administrative services only (“ASO”). In such a case, the MBHO is not at risk of over/under utilization.
 
In fiscal year 2013, through our primary operating subsidiary, Comprehensive Behavioral Care, Inc. (“CBC”) and its subsidiaries, we provide managed behavioral healthcare, and substance abuse. Additionally, CBC provided analytic services for its health plan customers and self-insured companies to integrate medical claims data into actionable information so patient care can be coordinated cost effectively. We coordinate and manage the delivery of our services and products to:
 

● | commercial members;
--+--------------------


● | Medicare members;
--+------------------


● | Medicaid members; and
--+----------------------


● | CHIP member.
--+-------------

 
We provided services primarily through a network of contracted providers that includes:
 

● | psychiatrists;
--+---------------


● | psychologists;
--+---------------


● | therapists;
--+------------


● | other licensed healthcare professionals;
--+-----------------------------------------


● | psychiatric hospitals;
--+-----------------------


● | general medical facilities with psychiatric beds;
--+--------------------------------------------------


● | residential treatment centers; and
--+-----------------------------------


● | other treatment facilities.
--+----------------------------

 
The services provided through our provider network include outpatient programs (such as counseling or therapy), intermediate care programs (such as intensive outpatient programs and partial hospitalization services), inpatient programs and crisis intervention services. We do not directly provide treatment or own any treatment facilities.

We typically enter into contracts on an annual basis to provide managed behavioral healthcare and substance abuse, services to our clients’ members. Our arrangements with our clients fall into two broad categories:
 
●    at-risk arrangements where our clients pay us a fixed fee per member in exchange for our assumption of the financial risk of providing services; and
 
●    Administrative Service Only or ASO arrangements where we manage behavioral healthcare programs or perform various managed care services, such as clinical care management, provider network development, and claims processing without assuming financial risk for member behavioral healthcare costs. 
 
Under our at-risk arrangements, the number of covered members as reported to us by our clients determines the amount of premiums we receive, which is independent of the cost of services rendered to members. The amount of premiums we receive for each member is fixed by our contract at the beginning of its term. Under certain circumstances, these premiums may be subsequently adjusted up or down, or the contract terminated, generally at the commencement of each renewal period.
 
Our largest expense is the cost of the behavioral health services that we provide, which is based primarily on our arrangements with healthcare providers. Since we are subject to increases in healthcare operating costs based primarily on an increase in the number and frequency of our members seeking behavioral care services, but also inflationary factors, our profitability depends on our ability to predict and effectively manage healthcare operating costs in relation to the fixed premiums we receive under capitation arrangements. Providing services on an at-risk basis exposes us to the risk that our contracts may ultimately be unprofitable if we are unable to control or otherwise anticipate healthcare costs. Accrued claims payable and claims expense were our most significant critical accounting estimates.
 
We manage programs through which services are provided to recipients in eight] states. Our objective is to provide easily accessible, high quality behavioral healthcare and pharmacy services and products and to manage costs through measures such as the monitoring of hospital inpatient admissions, review of authorizations for various types of outpatient therapy and effective management of prescription drugs. Our goal is to combine access to quality behavioral healthcare services with effective management controls in order to ensure the most cost-effective use of healthcare resources.

Our programs and services include:
 
●     fully integrated behavioral healthcare services;
 
●     analytic services for medical claims for medical integration of behavioral and medical care coordination;
 
●     case management/utilization review services;
 
●     administrative services management;
 
●     preferred provider network development;
 
●     management and physician advisor reviews; and
 
●     overall care management services.
 
SOURCES OF REVENUE 
 
During our fiscal year ended December 31, 2013, the majority of our revenue was earned from at-risk contracts pursuant to which we provide managed behavioral healthcare and substance abuse to recipients, primarily through subcontracts with health plans that have historically outsourced these functions to MBHOs like us. In exchange for arranging behavioral health and substance abuse services, we generally receive a negotiated amount on a per-member per-month, or capitated, basis in exchange for providing these services. We then contract directly with behavioral healthcare providers that receive discounted fees at predetermined per-service, per-case or per-diem rates. During the latter part of 2013, we conducted a review of CBC’s operations and determined that we would not continue with the business. On December 30, 2013, we sold CBC which operated our ASO and at-risk contracts, see Note 11 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
 
Under at-risk behavioral contracts, our profit is a function of utilization and the amount of claims payments made to our network providers. We performed periodic reviews of our current client contracts to determine profitability. In the event a contract is not profitable, we may seek to revise the terms of the contract or to terminate the agreement in accordance with its terms.
 
During 2013, we provided services under at-risk arrangements for Medicare and commercial patients in 6 states. Such services generated approximately 87% of our managed care operating revenue.
 
Our Medicare, Medicaid and CHIP contracts were subject to agreements with our health plan clients whose contracts with the various governmental agencies may be subject to renegotiation at the election of the specific agency.

Under our at-risk contracts, we assume the financial risk for the costs of member behavioral healthcare services in exchange for a fixed, per member per month fee. Under our ASO contracts, we may manage behavioral healthcare programs or perform various managed care functions, such as clinical care management, provider network development and claims processing without assuming financial risk for member behavioral healthcare costs.
 
MARKETING AND SALES 
 
Our marketing and sales efforts are led by our management team. In addition, we utilized consultants for direct sales to commercial, Medicare Medicaid, and CHIP health plans, as well as self-insured companies and unions.
PROVIDER NETWORK 
 
As of December 31, 2013, we had approximately 60,000 behavioral healthcare practitioners in our network located in 47 states. As a result of selling CBC, we had no provider network in 2014. However, as part of the sale of CBC, the Company has the ability to lease the network at a future date.
 
Our managed behavioral healthcare services are provided by contracted providers, including behavioral healthcare professionals and facilities. Our behavioral healthcare professionals included a variety of specialized behavioral healthcare personnel, such as:
 
●           psychiatrists;
 
●           psychologists;
 
●           therapists;
 
●           licensed clinical social workers;
 
●           substance abuse counselors; and
 
●           other licensed healthcare professionals.
 
The facilities we provide our services to include:
 
●           psychiatric hospitals;
 
●           general medical facilities with psychiatric beds;
 
●           residential treatment facilities; and
 
●           other treatment facilities.
 
Outpatient providers include both individual practitioners, as well as individuals who are members of group practices or other licensed centers or programs. Outpatient providers typically enter into contracts with us under whom they are generally paid on a discounted fee-for-service basis.
 
Our provider network also included contractual arrangements with intensive outpatient facilities, partial hospitalization facilities, community health centers, and other community-based facilities. Our contracts with facilities were on a per diem or discounted fee-for-service basis and, in some cases, on a “case rate” basis, whereby a fixed amount is paid irrespective of the amount of services provided. To help ensure quality of care, we credential and re-credential all professional providers with whom we contract in accordance with standards of the NCQA. After we sold CBC in December 2013, we no longer maintained a provider network in 2014.

COMPETITION 
 
The behavioral healthcare industry is very competitive and provides products and services that are price sensitive. Competitors include independent MBHOs as well as health plans and insurers with internal behavioral health units or subsidiaries. Many of these competitors have revenues, financial resources, and membership bases that are substantially larger than ours. The extent of competition results in significant pricing pressures which limits our revenue growth.
EFFECTS OF INFLATION AND CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES 
 
Our business operations were subject to the effects of inflation, particularly as to the types of healthcare costs we cover on an at risk basis. However, to minimize the effect of inflation, some of our multi-year revenue contracts contained provisions for annual rate increases that average approximately three percent per year. Our largest expense, the cost of care provided by our contracted providers, is frequently tied to standard Medicaid, CHIP, and Medicare reimbursement rates set by governmental entities. To the extent these standard rates are increased periodically to reflect the effects of inflation, we may be adversely affected by rising prices, absent a sufficient compensating increase in our revenues from our customers. Although currently, all our debt instruments bear fixed interest rates, we have historically funded our operations with increased borrowings annually, often at higher than market interest rates as a result of our currently weak financial condition, cash flows and operating results, and, thus, unless we are successful in raising sufficient additional equity capital, we may be subject to the effects of changing interest rates.
SEASONALITY OF BUSINESS 
 
Historically, we have experienced increased member utilization principally during the months of March, April and May and consistently low utilization by members during the months of June, July, and August. Such variations in member utilization impact our costs of care during these months, generally having a positive impact on our gross margins and operating profits during the June through August period and an adverse impact on our gross margins and operating profits during the months of March through May.
GOVERNMENT REGULATION 
 
We are subject to extensive and evolving state and federal regulations relating to the nation’s mental health system, as well as changes in Medicaid and Medicare reimbursement that could have an effect on our profitability. These regulations range from licensure and compliance with regulations related to insurance companies and other risk-assuming entities, to licensure and compliance with regulations related to healthcare providers. These laws and regulations may vary considerably between states. As a result, we may be subject to the specific regulatory approach adopted by each state for regulation of managed care companies and for providers of behavioral healthcare treatment services. As of November 31, 2013, we held licenses or certificates to perform utilization review and/or third party administrator (“TPA”) services in:

ACCREDITATION 
 
The NCQA provides information about the quality of national managed care plans to enable consumers to evaluate health plan performance. To develop standards that effectively evaluate the structure and function of medical and quality management systems in managed care organizations, NCQA has an extensive review and development process in conjunction with the managed care industry, healthcare purchasers, state regulators, and consumers. The Standards for Accreditation of MBHOs used by NCQA reviewers to evaluate an MBHO address the following areas: quality improvement, utilization management, credentialing, members’ rights and responsibilities, and preventative care. These standards validate that an MBHO is founded on principles of quality and is continuously improving the clinical care and services it provides. NCQA utilizes the Health Plan Employer Data and Information Set, which is a core set of industry-wide performance measurements developed by NCQA to respond to complex but clearly defined employer needs as standards for patient care and customer satisfaction.
 
In October 2011, we were awarded Full Accreditation by NCQA extending until October 2014. Full Accreditation is granted for a period of three years to those plans that have, according to the NCQA, excellent programs for continuous quality improvement and that meet NCQA’s rigorous standards.
 
NCQA accreditation was required by several of our client contracts and is frequently an important consideration to our prospective clients. We believe our NCQA accreditation is beneficial to our clients and their members we serve. After the sale of CBC, we no longer needed to maintain such accreditation.
 
MANAGEMENT INFORMATION SYSTEMS 
 
All of our health plan information technology and systems operate on a single platform. This approach avoids the costs associated with maintaining multiple systems and improves productivity. The open architecture of the systems gives us the ability to transfer data from other systems thereby facilitating the integration of new health plan business. We use our information system for claims processing, utilization management, reporting, cost trending, planning, and analysis. The system also supports member and provider service functions, including:

● | enrollment;
--+------------


● | member eligibility verification;
--+---------------------------------


● | provider rosters;
--+------------------


● | claims status inquiries; and
--+-----------------------------


● | referrals and authorizations.

We are subject to the requirements of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”). One of the purposes of HIPAA is to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the healthcare system through standardization of the electronic data interchange of certain administrative and financial transactions and, also, to protect the security and privacy of protected health information. Entities subject to HIPAA include some healthcare providers and all healthcare plans.
 
We significantly enhanced our network by installing a storage area network and virtualizing our computer servers. This implementation brought in the current best practices approach and permitted a major overhaul of our information technology infrastructure. The technology centralizes storage management, increases the utilization of equipment, improves redundancy of the servers, reduces the overall hardware requirements, and facilitates growth, while driving down the total cost of ownership.
 
Fiscal year 2014
 
In January of 2014, we changed our name to Advanzeon Solutions, Inc.
 
During the fiscal year ended December 31, 2014, the fee we received from CBC was our only source of revenue. In January 2014, we entered into an agreement with CBC whereby we provided software and managerial oversight and facilities to CBC staff for the contracts held by CBC. Our only business in 2014 was servicing ASO contract for CBC.
