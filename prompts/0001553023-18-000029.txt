Recent Developments
On February 27, 2017, the Company effected a full physical early settlement of the previously announced forward sale agreements (the Forward Sale Agreements) entered into with Goldman, Sachs & Co. on August 10, 2016 relating to, in the aggregate, approximately 4.4 million shares of the Company’s common stock. Upon settlement, the Company issued and sold all such shares to Goldman, Sachs & Co., in its capacity as forward purchaser, in exchange for net proceeds of approximately $210.8 million, in accordance with the provisions of the Forward Sales Agreements. Such proceeds were used to finance, in part, the acquisition of the Sentinel Properties (as defined below). 
On February 28, 2017, CyrusOne closed its acquisition of two data centers located in Somerset, New Jersey and Raleigh-Durham, North Carolina (the Sentinel Properties) from Sentinel Data Centers. The Company paid aggregate cash consideration of approximately $492.3 million in connection therewith, including transaction related costs of $1.5 million. The transaction was financed by the Company with proceeds from settlement of its forward equity sale described above and borrowings under its Revolving Credit Facility (as defined in Note 10).
On March 17, 2017, CyrusOne LP and CyrusOne Finance Corp. completed their offering of $500.0 million aggregate principal amount of 5.000% senior notes due 2024 (the Original 2024 Notes) and $300.0 million aggregate principal amount of 5.375% senior notes due 2027 (the Original 2027 Notes) in a private offering. The Company received proceeds of $791.2 million, net of underwriting costs of $8.8 million.
The Company used the net proceeds from the offering (i) to finance its repurchase and redemption of all of its outstanding 6.375% Senior Notes due 2022 (the 2022 Notes), of which $474.8 million in aggregate principal amount was outstanding, (ii) for the repayment of borrowings outstanding under the operating partnership’s Revolving Credit Facility and (iii) for the payment of related premiums, fees, discounts and expenses.
On June 16, 2017, CyrusOne LP entered into an amendment to its senior Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (as defined in Note 10) that increased the total commitments thereunder by $450.0 million to $2.0 billion and provided additional flexibility to pursue various initiatives, including joint ventures and international expansion. The amendment increased the size of the term loan maturing in January 2022 from $300.0 million to $650.0 million and expanded the Revolving Credit Facility (as defined in Note 10) by $100.0 million to $1.1 billion. Proceeds from the $350.0 million term loan increase were used to pay down borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility. The existing $250.0 million term loan maturing in September 2021 remained unchanged. The amendment refreshes the amount available under the accordion feature of the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement to enable CyrusOne LP to increase the total loan commitments under the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement to up to $2.3 billion from time to time.
On October 18, 2017, CyrusOne announced the formation of a new strategic partnership with the execution of a commercial agreement with GDS Holdings Limited (GDS), a leading developer and operator of high-performance, large-scale data centers in China. Under this new partnership, CyrusOne and GDS expect to work together to market and cross-sell data center space and related services in both the United States and China.

Our Business
We provide mission-critical data center real estate assets designed and operated to protect and ensure the continued operation of IT infrastructure for our customers. Our goal is to be the preferred global data center provider to Fortune 1000 companies, including the largest enterprises and providers of cloud services. As of December 31, 2017, our customers included 197 of the Fortune 1000, or private, or foreign enterprises of equivalent size. These 197 Fortune 1000 customers, or private or foreign enterprises of equivalent size, provided 72% of our annualized rent as of December 31, 2017. Additionally, as of December 31, 2017, our top 10 customers represented 41% of our annualized rent.

Data centers are highly specialized and secure real estate assets that serve as centralized repositories of server, storage and network equipment. They are designed to provide the space, power, cooling and network connectivity necessary to efficiently operate mission-critical IT equipment. Telecommunications carriers typically provide network access into a data center through optical fiber. The demand for data center infrastructure is being driven by many factors, but most importantly by significant growth in data as well as an increased demand for outsourcing. The market for third-party data center facilities includes, among other companies, established “traditional” enterprises that are web-enabling their applications and business processes, as well as cloud-centric companies with sophisticated technology requirements. 
We cultivate long-term strategic relationships with our customers and provide them with solutions for their data center facilities and IT infrastructure requirements. Our offerings provide flexibility, reliability and security delivered through a tailored, customer service focused platform that is designed to foster long-term relationships. Our customers include those who have not historically outsourced their data center needs and are open to solutions that address their current and future needs. Our facilities are designed and constructed in a manner to allow us to offer flexibility in density and power resiliency, and the opportunity for expansion as our customers' needs grow. The CyrusOne National IX Platform delivers interconnection across states and between metro-enabled sites within the CyrusOne footprint and beyond. The platform enables high-performance, low-cost data transfer and accessibility for customers by uniting our data centers.
Our Competitive Strengths
Our ability to attract and retain the world’s largest customers is attributed to the following competitive strengths, which distinguish us from other data center operators and will enable us to continue to grow our operations. 
High Quality Customer Base. The high quality of our assets, combined with our reputation for serving the needs of large enterprises, has enabled us to focus on the Fortune 1000 to build a quality customer base. We currently have nearly 1,000 customers from a broad spectrum of industries and serve nine of the top ten cloud companies. Our revenue is generated by a stable enterprise customer base, as evidenced by the fact that as of December 31, 2017, 72% of our annualized rent comes from the Fortune 1000, private or foreign enterprises of equivalent size. We serve a diversity of industries, including information technology, financial services, energy, oil and gas, mining, medical and consumer goods and services.
As of December 31, 2017, Microsoft Corporation represented 18% of our revenue.
Strategically Located Portfolio. Our portfolio is located in several domestic and international markets possessing attractive characteristics for enterprise-focused data center operations. We have domestic properties in six of the largest metropolitan areas in the U.S. (Chicago, Dallas, Houston, New York, Phoenix and San Antonio) and six of the largest metropolitan areas for Fortune 500 headquarters (Chicago, Cincinnati, Dallas, Houston, San Antonio and New York). We believe cities with large populations or a large number of corporate headquarters are likely to produce incremental demand for IT infrastructure. In addition, being located close to our current and potential customers provides chief information officers (CIOs) with additional confidence when outsourcing their data center infrastructure to us.
Modern, High Quality, Flexible Facilities. Our portfolio includes highly efficient, reliable facilities with flexibility to customize customer solutions and accessibility to hundreds of connectivity providers. To optimize the delivery of power, our properties include modern engineering technologies designed to minimize unnecessary power usage and, in our newest facilities, we are able to provide power utilization efficiency ratios that we believe to be among the best in the multi-tenant data center industry. Fortune 1000 CIOs are dividing their application stacks into various groups as some applications require 100% availability, while others may require significant power to support complex computing, or robust connectivity. Our facility design enables us to deliver different power densities and resiliencies to the same customer footprint, allowing customers to tailor solutions to meet their application needs. In addition, the National IX Platform provides access to hundreds of telecommunication and Internet carriers.
Massively Modular® Construction Methods. Our Massively Modular® data center design principles allow us to efficiently stage construction on a large scale and deliver critical power and colocation square feet (CSF) in a timeframe that we believe is one of the best in the industry. We acquire or build a large powered shell capable of scaling with our customers’ power and colocation space needs. The powered shell can be acquired or constructed for a relatively inexpensive capital cost. Once the building shell is ready, we can build individual data center halls in portions of the building space to meet the needs of customers on a modular basis. This modular data center hall construction can 
9

be completed in 12 to 16 weeks to meet our customers’ immediate needs. This short construction timeframe ensures a very high utilization of the assets and minimizes the time between our capital investment and the receipt of customer revenue, favorably impacting our return on investment while also translating into lower costs for our customers. Our design principles also allow us to add incremental equipment to increase power densities as our customers’ power needs increase, which provides our customers with a significant amount of flexibility to manage their IT demands. We believe this Massively Modular® approach allows us to respond to rapidly evolving customer needs, to commit capital toward the highest return projects and to develop state-of-the-art data center facilities.
Significant Leasing Capability. Our focus on the customer, our ability to scale with their needs, and our operational excellence provide us with embedded future growth from our customer base. During 2017, we signed new leases representing $105.5 million in annualized revenue, with previously existing customers accounting for approximately 80% of this amount. Since December 31, 2016, we have increased our CSF by approximately 1,187,000 square feet or 57%, while maintaining a high percentage of CSF utilized of 83% and 85% as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
Significant, Attractive Expansion Opportunities. As of December 31, 2017, we had 1,534,000 net rentable square feet (NRSF) of powered shell available for future development and approximately 343 acres of land that are available for future data center facility development. The powered shell available for future development in locations that are part of our domestic portfolio consist of approximately 487,000 NRSF in the Southwest (Texas and Phoenix), 579,000 NRSF in the Northeast (Raleigh-Durham, Northern Virginia and New York Metro) and 468,000 NRSF in the Midwest (Chicago and Cincinnati). Our current development properties and available acreage were selected based on extensive site selection criteria and the collective industry knowledge and experience of our management team with a focus on markets with a strong presence of and high demand by Fortune 1000 companies and providers of cloud services. As a result, we believe that our development portfolio contains properties that are located in markets with attractive supply and demand conditions and that possess suitable physical characteristics to support data center infrastructure.
Differentiated Reputation for Service. We believe that the decision CIOs make to outsource their data center infrastructure has material implications for their businesses, and, as such, CIOs look to third-party data center providers that have a reputation for serving similar organizations and that are able to deliver a customized solution. We take a consultative approach to understanding the unique requirements of our customers, and our design principles allow us to deliver a customized data center solution to match their needs. We believe that this approach has helped fuel our growth. Our current customers are also often the source of new contracts, with referrals being an important source of new customers.
Experienced Management Team. Our management team is comprised of individuals drawing on diverse knowledge and skill sets acquired through extensive experiences in the real estate, REITs, telecommunications, technology and mission-critical infrastructure industries.
Balance Sheet Positioned to Fund Continued Growth. As of December 31, 2017, we had $1,243.4 million in available liquidity, including $1,091.5 million in borrowing capacity under our Revolving Credit Facility. The Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement also includes an accordion feature that allows us to increase the aggregate commitment by up to $300 million. We believe that we are appropriately capitalized with sufficient financial flexibility and capacity to fund our anticipated growth. 
Experienced Sales Force with Robust Partner Channel. We have an experienced sales force with a particular expertise in selling to large enterprises and providers of cloud services, which can require extensive consultation and drive long sales cycles as these enterprises make the initial outsourcing decision. As of December 31, 2017, we had 48 sales-related employees. We believe the depth, knowledge, and experience of our sales team differentiates us from other data center companies, and we are not as dependent on brokers to identify and acquire customers as some other companies in the industry. To complement our direct sales efforts, we have developed a robust network of partners, including value added resellers, systems integrators and hosting providers.
Business and Growth Strategies
Our objective is to grow our revenue and earnings and maximize stockholder returns and cash flow by continuing to expand our data center infrastructure outsourcing business.
Increasing Revenue from Existing Customers and Properties. We have historically generated a significant portion of our revenue growth from our existing customers. We will continue to target our existing customers because we believe that many have significant data center infrastructure needs that have not yet been outsourced, and many will require additional data center space and power to support their growth and their increasing reliance on technology infrastructure in their operations. To address new demand, as of December 31, 2017, we have approximately 1,098,000 NRSF currently available for lease. We also have approximately 645,000 NRSF under development, as well as 1,534,000 NRSF of additional powered shell space under roof available for development. 
Attracting and Retaining New Customers. Increasingly, enterprises are beginning to recognize the complexities of managing data center infrastructure in the midst of rapid technological development and innovation. We believe that these complexities, brought about by the rapidly increasing levels of Internet traffic and data, cloud adoption, obsolete existing corporate data center infrastructure, increased power and cooling requirements and increased regulatory requirements, are all driving the need for companies to outsource their data center 
10

facility requirements. Consequently, this will significantly increase the percentage of companies that use third-party data center colocation services over the next several years. We believe that our high quality assets and reputation for serving cloud providers and large enterprises have been, and will be, key differentiators for us in attracting customers that are outsourcing their data center infrastructure needs. 
We acquire customers through a variety of channels. We have historically managed our sales process through a direct-to-the-customer model but are now also utilizing third-party leasing agents and indirect leasing channels to expand our universe of potential new customers. Over the past few years, we have developed a robust network of partners in our indirect leasing channels, including value added resellers, systems integrators and hosting providers. These channels, in combination with our marketing strategies, have enabled us to build both a strong brand and outreach program to new customers. Throughout the life cycle of a customer’s lease with us, we maintain a disciplined approach to monitoring their experience, with the goal of providing the highest level of customer service. This personal attention fosters a strong relationship and trust with our customers, which leads to future growth and leasing renewals. 
Expanding into New Markets. Our expansion strategy focuses on acquiring and developing new data centers, both domestically and internationally, in markets where our customers are located and in markets with a strong presence of and high demand by Fortune 1000 customers and providers of cloud services. We conduct extensive analysis to ensure an identified market displays strong data center fundamentals, independent of the demand presented by any particular customer. In addition, we consider markets where our existing customers want us to be located. We regularly meet with our customers to understand their business strategies and potential data center needs. We believe that this approach, combined with our Massively Modular® construction design, reduces the risk associated with expansion into new markets because it provides strong visibility into our leasing opportunities and helps to ensure targeted returns on new developments. When considering a new market, we take a disciplined approach in evaluating potential business, property and site acquisitions, including a site’s geographic attributes, availability of telecommunications and connectivity providers, access to power, and expected costs for development.
Growing Interconnection Business. In April 2013, we launched the National IX Platform, delivering interconnection across states and between metro-enabled sites within the CyrusOne facility footprint and beyond. The platform enables high-performance, low-cost data transfer and accessibility for customers seeking to connect between CyrusOne facilities, from CyrusOne to their own private data center facility, or with one another via private peering, cross connects and/or public switching environments. Interconnection within a facility or on the National IX Platform allows our customers to share information and conduct commerce in a highly efficient manner not requiring a third-party intermediary, and at a fraction of the cost normally required to establish such a connection between two enterprises. The demand for interconnection creates additional rental and revenue growth opportunities for us, and we believe that customer interconnections increase our likelihood of customer retention by providing an environment not easily replicated by competitors. We act as a trusted neutral party that enterprises, carriers and content companies utilize to connect to each other. In 2014, we became the first colocation provider in North America to receive multi-site certification from the Open-IX Association, a non-profit industry group formed to promote better standards for data center interconnection and Internet Exchanges in North America.
Our Portfolio
As of December 31, 2017, our property portfolio included 45 data centers and 2 recovery centers in 12 distinct markets (10 in the U.S., plus London and Singapore) collectively providing approximately 5,717,000 net rentable square feet and powered by approximately 540 megawatts (MW) of available critical load capacity. Since December 31, 2016, the NRSF increased by 1,813,000. These increases were in San Antonio 248,000, Northern Virginia 519,000, New York Metro 213,000, Raleigh-Durham 167,000, Phoenix 373,000 and the remaining properties accounted for the balance. We own 33 of the buildings in which our data center facilities are located. We lease the remaining 14 buildings, which account for approximately 652,000 NRSF, or approximately 11% of our total operating NRSF. These leased buildings accounted for 18% of our total annualized rent as of December 31, 2017. We also had approximately 645,000 NRSF under development, as well as an aggregate of approximately 1,534,000 NRSF of additional powered shell space under roof available for development. In addition, we have approximately 343 acres of land that are available for future data center shell development. Along with our primary product offering, leasing of colocation space, certain of our customers are also interested in ancillary office and other space. We believe our existing operating portfolio and development pipeline will allow us to meet the evolving needs of our existing customers and continue to attract new customers. The following tables provide an overview of our operating and development properties as of December 31, 2017.

* | Indicates properties in which we hold a leasehold interest.


** | The information provided for the Cincinnati - 7th Street property includes data for two facilities, one of which we lease and one of which we own.


(a) | Represents the total square feet of a building under lease or available for lease based on engineers' drawings and estimates but does not include space held for development or space used by CyrusOne.


(b) | Stabilized properties include data halls that have been in service for at least 24 months or are at least 85% utilized. Pre-stabilized properties include data halls that have been in service for less than 24 months and are less than 85% utilized.


(c) | Represents monthly contractual rent (defined as cash rent including customer reimbursements for metered power) under existing customer leases as of December 31, 2017, multiplied by 12. For the month of December 2017, customer reimbursements were $67.8 million annualized and consisted of reimbursements by customers across all facilities with separately metered power. Customer reimbursements under leases with separately metered power vary from month-to-month based on factors such as our customers' utilization of power and the suppliers' pricing of power. From January 1, 2016 through December 31, 2017, customer reimbursements under leases with separately metered power constituted between 10.2% and 12.6% of annualized rent.


(d) | CSF represents the NRSF at an operating facility that is currently leased or readily available for lease as colocation space, where customers locate their servers and other IT equipment.


(e) | Percent leased is determined based on CSF being billed to customers under signed leases as of December 31, 2017 divided by total CSF. Leases signed but not commenced as of December 31, 2017 are not included.


(f) | Utilization is calculated by dividing CSF under signed leases for colocation space (whether or not the lease has commenced billing) by total CSF.


(g) | Represents the NRSF at an operating facility that is currently leased or readily available for lease as space other than CSF, which is typically office and other space.


(h) | Percent leased is determined based on Office & Other space being billed to customers under signed leases as of December 31, 2017 divided by total Office & Other space. Leases signed but not commenced as of December 31, 2017 are not included.


(i) | Represents infrastructure support space, including mechanical, telecommunications and utility rooms, as well as building common areas.


(j) | Represents the NRSF at an operating facility that is currently leased or readily available for lease. This excludes existing vacant space held for development.


(k) | Represents space that is under roof that could be developed in the future for operating NRSF, rounded to the nearest 1,000.


(l) | Critical load capacity represents the aggregate power available for lease and exclusive use by customers expressed in terms of megawatts. The capacity reported is for non-redundant megawatts, as we can develop flexible solutions to our customers at multiple resiliency levels. Does not sum to total due to rounding.

Regulation
General
Properties in our markets are subject to various laws, ordinances and regulations, including regulations relating to common areas. In addition to the regulations described below, we are subject to various federal, state and local regulations, such as state and local fire and life safety regulations. We believe that each of our properties has, or is expected to have when required, the necessary permits and approvals for us to operate our business.
Americans With Disabilities Act
Our properties must comply with Title III of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, or the ADA, to the extent that such properties are “public accommodations” as defined by the ADA. The ADA may require removal of structural barriers to access by persons with disabilities in certain public areas of our properties where such removal is readily achievable. We believe that our properties are in substantial compliance with the ADA and that we will not be required to make substantial capital expenditures to address the requirements of the ADA. However, noncompliance with the ADA could result in imposition of fines or an award of damages to private litigants. The obligation to make readily achievable accommodations is an ongoing one, and we will continue to assess our properties and to make alterations as appropriate in this respect. 
Environmental Matters
We are subject to laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment, the storage, management and disposal of hazardous materials, emissions to air and discharges to water, the cleanup of contaminated sites and health and safety matters. These include various regulations promulgated by the Environmental Protection Agency and other federal, state, and local regulatory agencies and legislative bodies relating to our operations, including those involving power generators, batteries, and fuel storage to support co-location infrastructure. While we believe that our operations are in substantial compliance with environmental, health, and human safety laws and regulations, as an owner or operator of property and in connection with the current and historical use of hazardous materials and other operations at its sites, we could incur significant costs, including fines, penalties and other sanctions, cleanup costs and third-party claims for property damages or personal injuries, as a result of violations of or liabilities under environmental laws and regulations.  Fuel storage tanks are present at many of our properties, and if releases were to occur, we may be liable for the costs of cleaning up resulting contamination.  Some of our sites also have a history of previous commercial operations, including past underground storage tanks. 
Some of the properties may contain asbestos-containing building materials.  Environmental laws require that asbestos-containing building materials be properly managed and maintained, and may impose fines and penalties on building owners or operators for failure to comply with these requirements.  
Environmental consultants have conducted, as appropriate, Phase I or similar non-intrusive environmental site assessments on recently acquired properties and if appropriate, additional environmental inquiries and assessments on recently acquired properties. Nonetheless, we may acquire or develop sites in the future with unknown environmental conditions from historical operations. Although we are not aware of any sites at which we currently have material remedial obligations, the imposition of remedial obligations as a result of spill or the discovery of contaminants in the future could result in significant additional costs to us.
Our operations also require us to obtain permits and/or other governmental approvals and to develop response plans in connection with the use of our generators or other operations. These requirements could restrict our operations or delay the development of data centers in the future. In addition, from time to time, federal, state or local government regulators enact new or revise existing legislation or regulations that could affect us, either beneficially or adversely. As a result, we could incur significant costs in complying with environmental laws or regulations that are promulgated in the future.
Insurance
We carry comprehensive liability, fire, extended coverage, business interruption and rental loss insurance covering all of the properties in our portfolio under a blanket policy. In the opinion of our management, our policy specifications, limits and insurance carriers are appropriate given the relative risk of loss, the cost of coverage and industry practice. We cannot provide any assurance that the business interruption or property insurance we have will cover all losses that we may experience, that the insurance carrier will be solvent, that rates will remain commercially reasonable, that insurance carriers will not cancel our policies, or that the insurance carriers will pay all claims made by us. Certain circumstances, such as acts of war, are generally uninsurable under our policies. See also “Risk Factors-Risks Related to Our Business and Operations." Any losses to our properties that are not covered by insurance, or that exceed our policy coverage limits, could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Competition
We compete with numerous developers, owners and operators of technology-related real estate, many of which own properties similar to ours in the same markets in which our properties are located. If our competitors offer space at rental rates below current market rates or below the rental rates we currently charge our customers, or if our competitors offer space that tenants perceive to be superior to ours (based on factors such as available power, security considerations, location or connectivity), we may lose potential customers and we may be pressured to reduce our rental rates below those we currently charge in order to retain customers when our customers’ leases expire or incur costs to improve our properties. In addition, our customers have the option of building their own data center space which can also place pressure on our rental rates.
As a developer of data center space and provider of interconnection services, we also compete for the services of key third-party providers of services, including engineers and contractors with expertise in the development of data centers. There is competition for the services of specialized contractors and other third-party providers required for the development of data centers, increasing the cost of engaging such providers and the risk of delays in completing our development projects. 
In addition, we face competition from real estate developers in our sector and in other industries for the acquisition of additional properties suitable for the development of data centers. Such competition may reduce the number of properties available for acquisition, increase the price of these properties and reduce the demand for data center space in the markets we seek to serve.
Employees
We employ approximately 416 persons. None of these employees are represented by a labor union.
