Overview
LINN Energy is an independent oil and natural gas company that was formed in February 2017, in connection with the reorganization of the Predecessor. The Predecessor was publicly traded from January 2006 to February 2017. As discussed further in Note 2, on May 11, 2016 (the “Petition Date”), Linn Energy, LLC, certain of its direct and indirect subsidiaries, and LinnCo (collectively, the “LINN Debtors”) and Berry (collectively with the LINN Debtors, the “Debtors”), filed voluntary petitions (“Bankruptcy Petitions”) for relief under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code (“Bankruptcy Code”) in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Texas (“Bankruptcy Court”). The Debtors’ Chapter 11 cases were administered jointly under the caption In re Linn Energy, LLC, et al., Case No. 16‑60040. During the pendency of the Chapter 11 proceedings, the Debtors operated their businesses as “debtors-in-possession” under the jurisdiction of the Bankruptcy Court and in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Bankruptcy Code. The Company emerged from bankruptcy effective February 28, 2017 (the “Effective Date”).
The Company’s properties are currently located in the United States (“U.S.”), in the Hugoton Basin, east Texas and north Louisiana (“TexLa”), Michigan/Illinois, the Mid-Continent, the Permian Basin and the Rockies. The Company also owns a 50% equity interest in Roan Resources LLC (“Roan”), which is focused on the accelerated development of the Merge/SCOOP/STACK play in Oklahoma.
Proved reserves at December 31, 2017, were approximately 1,968 Bcfe, of which approximately 70% were natural gas, 22% were natural gas liquids (“NGL”) and 8% were oil. Approximately 97% were classified as proved developed, with a total standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows of approximately $1.05 billion. At December 31, 2017, the Company operated 10,545 or approximately 66% of its 15,918 gross productive wells.
Strategy
The Company’s current focus is the development of the Merge/SCOOP/STACK through its equity interest in Roan, as well as through its midstream operations in that area. Additionally, the Company is pursuing emerging horizontal opportunities in the Mid-Continent and TexLa regions while continuing to add value by efficiently operating and applying new technology to

Item 1.    Business - Continued

a diverse set of long-life producing assets. Prior to the Company’s emergence from voluntary reorganization under Chapter 11, the Company was an upstream master limited partnership with a strategy to acquire, develop and maximize cash flow from a growing portfolio of long-life oil and natural gas assets. 
Recent Developments
Strategic Plan to Separate into Three Companies
In December 2017, the Company announced its intention to separate LINN Energy into three standalone companies during 2018. The proposed separation will further maximize shareholder value by giving shareholders focused exposure to three unique companies. The Company is continuing to evaluate the structure and potential tax consequences of any such separation.
Roan Resources LLC. A pure play high growth company focused in the prolific Merge/SCOOP/STACK play. LINN Energy, Inc., which currently trades on the OTCQB market under the ticker LNGG, will serve as a holding company solely for the existing 50 percent equity interest of Roan and would prepare to up list on either the NYSE or NASDAQ in 2018.
Blue Mountain Midstream LLC. A rapidly expanding and highly economic midstream business centered in the core of the Merge. The Board continues to evaluate all options which include, among other things, hiring a separate management team, establishing an independent capital structure, pursuing additional third party acreage dedication, exploring potential strategic alternatives and/or a separate public listing independent from LNGG. The Chisholm Trail Midstream business in the Merge is expected to be the primary asset for Blue Mountain at separation.
“NewCo”. The Company expects to form a new public company comprised of the following assets: Hugoton, Michigan/Illinois, Arkoma, Northwest STACK, East Texas and North Louisiana. “NewCo” is expected to be unlevered and generate significant free cash flow with a strategic focus on developing its growth oriented assets and returning capital to shareholders.

The total wells above exclude 38 gross wells (32 net wells) drilled by the Company in California during the year ended December 31, 2015. There were no wells drilled by the Company in California during the years ended December 31, 2017, or December 31, 2016. The total wells above also exclude 20 and 196 gross wells (18 and 163 net wells) drilled by Berry during the period from January 1, 2016 through December 3, 2016, and the year ended December 31, 2015, respectively.
There were no lateral segments added to existing vertical wellbores during the years ended December 31, 2017, or December 31, 2016. There were two lateral segments added to existing vertical wellbores during the year ended December 31, 2015. As of December 31, 2017, the Company had 17 gross (2 net) wells in progress, and no wells were temporarily suspended.
This information should not be considered indicative of future performance, nor should it be assumed that there is necessarily any correlation between the number of productive wells drilled and the quantities or economic value of reserves found. Productive wells are those that produce commercial quantities of oil, natural gas or NGL, regardless of whether they generate a reasonable rate of return.
The following table sets forth information about the Company’s drilling locations and net acres of leasehold interests as of December 31, 2017:

 | Total (1)
Proved undeveloped | 8 
Other locations | 4,202 
Total drilling locations | 4,210 
Leasehold interests – net acres (in thousands) | 2,254 


(1) | Does not include optimization projects.

As shown in the table above, as of December 31, 2017, the Company had 8 proved undeveloped drilling locations (specific drilling locations as to which the independent engineering firm, DeGolyer and MacNaughton, assigned proved undeveloped

reserves as of such date) and the Company had identified 4,202 additional unproved drilling locations (specific drilling locations as to which DeGolyer and MacNaughton has not assigned any proved reserves) on acreage that the Company has under existing leases. Successful development wells frequently result in the reclassification of adjacent lease acreage from unproved to proved. The number of unproved drilling locations that will be reclassified as proved drilling locations will depend on the Company’s drilling program, its commitment to capital and commodity prices.
Productive Wells
The following table sets forth information relating to the productive wells in which the Company owned a working interest as of December 31, 2017. Productive wells consist of producing wells and wells capable of production, including wells awaiting pipeline or other connections to commence deliveries. The number of wells below does not include approximately 2,204 gross productive wells in which the Company owns a royalty interest only.

 | Natural Gas Wells | Oil Wells | | Total Wells

Leasehold acreage | 3,621 | | 2,245 | | 26 | | 9 | | 3,647 | 2,254

Future Acreage Expirations
The Company’s investment in developed and undeveloped acreage comprises numerous leases. The terms and conditions under which the Company maintains exploration or production rights to the acreage are property-specific, contractually defined and vary significantly from property to property. If production is not established or the Company takes no other action to extend the terms of the related leases, undeveloped acreage will expire. The Company currently has no material undeveloped acreage due to expire during the next three years.
Programs are designed to ensure that the exploration potential of any property is fully evaluated before expiration. In some instances, the Company may elect to relinquish acreage in advance of the contractual expiration date if the evaluation process is complete and there is not a business basis for extension. In cases where additional time may be required to fully evaluate acreage, the Company has generally been successful in obtaining extensions. The Company utilizes various methods to manage the expiration of leases, including drilling the acreage prior to lease expiration or extending lease terms.
Production, Price and Cost History
The results of operations of the Company’s California properties and Berry are reported as discontinued operations for all periods presented (see Note 4).  Unless otherwise indicated, information presented herein relates only to LINN Energy’s continuing operations.

Item 1.    Business - Continued

The Company’s natural gas production is primarily sold under short-term market-sensitive contracts that are typically priced at a differential to the published natural gas index price for the producing area due to the natural gas quality and the proximity to major consuming markets. In certain circumstances, the Company has entered into natural gas processing contracts whereby the residue natural gas is sold under short-term contracts but the related NGL are sold under long-term contracts. In all such cases, the residue natural gas and NGL are sold at market-sensitive index prices. As of December 31, 2017, the Company had natural gas delivery commitments under a long-term contract of approximately 12 Bcf to be delivered in 2018, approximately 16 Bcf to be delivered each year from 2019 through 2025 and approximately 4 Bcf to be delivered in 2026. The Company expects to fulfill these delivery commitments with existing proved developed reserves dedicated to its Blue Mountain midstream business. If production is not sufficient to meet contractual delivery commitments, the Company may be subject to shortfall penalties. As of December 31, 2017, the Company had no NGL delivery commitments under long-term contracts.
The Company’s natural gas production is sold to purchasers under spot price contracts, percentage-of-index contracts or percentage-of-proceeds contracts. Under percentage-of-index contracts, the Company receives a price for natural gas and NGL based on indexes published for the producing area. Under percentage-of-proceeds contracts, the Company receives a percentage of the resale price received by the purchaser for sales of residue natural gas and NGL recovered after transportation and processing of natural gas. These purchasers sell the residue natural gas and NGL based primarily on spot market prices.
The Company’s natural gas is transported through its own and third-party gathering systems and pipelines. The Company incurs processing, gathering and transportation expenses to move its natural gas from the wellhead to a purchaser-specified delivery point. These expenses vary based on the volume, distance shipped and the fee charged by the third-party processor or transporter.
The Company’s oil production is primarily sold under short-term market-sensitive contracts that are typically priced at a differential to the New York Mercantile Exchange (“NYMEX”) price or at purchaser posted prices for the producing area. As of December 31, 2017, the Company had no oil delivery commitments under long-term contracts.
The following table sets forth information regarding total production, average daily production, average prices and average costs for each of the years indicated:

(2) | This measure is not intended to represent the market value of estimated reserves.


(3) | In accordance with Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) regulations, reserves were estimated using the average price during the 12-month period, determined as an unweighted average of the first-day-of-the-month price for each month, excluding escalations based upon future conditions. The average price used to estimate reserves is held constant over the life of the reserves. 

During the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company’s PUDs decreased to 60 Bcfe from 266 at December 31, 2016, representing a decrease of approximately 206 Bcfe. The decrease was primarily due to the sale of approximately 243 Bcfe of PUDs related to the 2017 divestitures and the development of approximately 15 Bcfe of PUDs during 2017, partially offset by approximately 52 Bcfe of PUDs added as a result of the Company’s drilling activities. During the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company incurred approximately $10 million in capital expenditures to convert 52 Bcfe of reserves that were classified as PUDs at December 31, 2016, to proved developed reserves.
Based on the December 31, 2017 reserve reports, the amounts of capital expenditures estimated to be incurred in 2018, 2019 and 2020 to develop the Company’s PUDs are approximately $23 million, $14 million and $14 million, respectively. The amount and timing of these expenditures will depend on a number of factors, including actual drilling results, service costs and product prices. None of the 60 Bcfe of PUDs at December 31, 2017, has remained undeveloped for five years or more. All PUD properties are included in the Company’s current five-year development plan.
Reserve engineering is inherently a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of oil, natural gas and NGL that cannot be measured exactly. The accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data and engineering and geological interpretation and judgment. Accordingly, reserve estimates may vary from the quantities of oil, natural gas and NGL that are ultimately recovered. Future prices received for production may vary, perhaps significantly, from the prices assumed for the purposes of estimating the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows. The standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows should not be construed as the market value of the reserves at the dates shown. The 10% discount factor required to be used under the provisions of applicable accounting standards may not be the most appropriate discount factor based on interest rates in effect from time to time and risks associated with the Company or the oil and natural gas industry. The standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows is materially affected by assumptions regarding the timing of future production, which may prove to be inaccurate.
The reserve estimates reported herein were prepared by independent engineers, DeGolyer and MacNaughton. The process performed by the independent engineers to prepare reserve amounts included their estimation of reserve quantities, future production rates, future net revenue and the present value of such future net revenue, based in part on data provided by the Company. When preparing the reserve estimates, the independent engineering firm did not independently verify the accuracy and completeness of the information and data furnished by the Company with respect to ownership interests, production, well test data, historical costs of operation and development, product prices, or any agreements relating to current and future operations of the properties and sales of production. However, if in the course of their work, something came to their attention that brought into question the validity or sufficiency of any such information or data, they did not rely on such information or data until they had satisfactorily resolved their questions relating thereto. The estimates of reserves conform to the guidelines of the SEC, including the criteria of “reasonable certainty,” as it pertains to expectations about the recoverability of reserves in future years. The independent engineering firm also prepared estimates with respect to reserve categorization, using the definitions of proved reserves set forth in Regulation S-X Rule 4-10(a) and subsequent SEC staff interpretations and guidance.
The Company’s internal control over the preparation of reserve estimates is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of the Company’s reserve estimates in accordance with SEC regulations. The preparation of reserve estimates was overseen by the Company’s Corporate Reserves Manager, who has Master of Petroleum Engineering and Master of Business Administration degrees and more than 30 years of oil and natural gas industry experience. The reserve estimates were reviewed and approved by the Company’s senior engineering staff and management, with final approval by its Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer. Reserve estimates of Roan were reviewed and approved by Roan’s President and Chief Executive Officer. For additional information regarding estimates of reserves, including the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows, see “Supplemental Oil and Natural Gas Data (Unaudited)” in Item 8. “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.” The Company has not filed reserve estimates with any federal authority or agency, with the exception of the SEC.

Item 1.    Business - Continued

Operational Overview
General
The Company generally seeks to be the operator of its properties so that it can develop drilling programs and optimization projects intended to not only replace production, but also to add value through reserve and production growth and future operational synergies. Many of the Company’s wells are completed in multiple producing zones with commingled production and long economic lives.
Principal Customers
For the year ended December 31, 2017, no individual customer exceeded 10% of the Company’s sales of oil, natural gas and NGL. If the Company were to lose any one of its major oil and natural gas purchasers, the loss could temporarily cease or delay production and sale of its oil and natural gas in that particular purchaser’s service area. If the Company were to lose a purchaser, it believes it could identify a substitute purchaser. However, if one or more of the large purchasers ceased purchasing oil and natural gas altogether, it could have a detrimental effect on the oil and natural gas market in general and on the prices and volumes of oil, natural gas and NGL that the Company is able to sell.
Competition
The oil and natural gas industry is highly competitive. The Company encounters strong competition from other independent operators in contracting for drilling and other related services, as well as hiring trained personnel. The Company is also affected by competition for drilling rigs and the availability of related equipment. In the past, the oil and natural gas industry has experienced shortages of drilling rigs, equipment, pipe and personnel, which has delayed development drilling and has caused significant price increases. The Company is unable to predict when, or if, such shortages may occur or how they would affect its drilling program.
Operating Hazards and Insurance
The oil and natural gas industry involves a variety of operating hazards and risks that could result in substantial losses from, among other things, injury or loss of life, severe damage to or destruction of property, natural resources and equipment, pollution or other environmental damage, cleanup responsibilities, regulatory investigation and penalties, and suspension of operations. The Company may be liable for environmental damages caused by previous owners of property it purchases and leases. As a result, the Company may incur substantial liabilities to third parties or governmental entities, the payment of which could reduce or eliminate funds otherwise available, or result in the loss of properties. In addition, the Company participates in wells on a nonoperated basis, as well as through its equity method investment in Roan, and therefore may be limited in its ability to control the risks associated with the operation of such wells.
In accordance with customary industry practices, the Company maintains insurance against some, but not all, potential losses. The Company cannot provide assurance that any insurance it obtains will be adequate to cover any losses or liabilities. The Company has elected to self-insure for certain items for which it has determined that the cost of available insurance is excessive relative to the risks presented. In addition, pollution and environmental risks generally are not fully insurable. The occurrence of an event not fully covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial position, results of operations and cash flows. For more information about potential risks that could affect the Company, see Item 1A. “Risk Factors.”
Title to Properties
Prior to the commencement of drilling operations, the Company conducts a title examination and performs curative work with respect to significant defects. To the extent title opinions or other investigations reflect title defects on those properties, the Company is typically responsible for curing any title defects at its expense prior to commencing drilling operations. Prior to completing an acquisition of producing leases, the Company performs title reviews on the most significant leases and, depending on the materiality of properties, the Company may obtain a title opinion or review previously obtained title opinions. As a result, the Company has obtained title opinions on a significant portion of its properties and believes that it has satisfactory title to its producing properties in accordance with standards generally accepted in the industry. 
13

Item 1.    Business - Continued

Seasonal Nature of Business
Seasonal weather conditions and lease stipulations can limit the drilling and producing activities and other operations in regions of the U.S. in which the Company operates. These seasonal conditions can pose challenges for meeting the well drilling objectives and increase competition for equipment, supplies and personnel, which could lead to shortages and increase costs or delay operations. For example, Company operations may be impacted by ice and snow in the winter and by electrical storms and high temperatures in the spring and summer, as well as by wild fires in the fall.
The demand for natural gas typically decreases during the summer months and increases during the winter months. Seasonal anomalies sometimes lessen this fluctuation. In addition, certain natural gas consumers utilize natural gas storage facilities and purchase some of their anticipated winter requirements during the summer, which can also lessen seasonal demand fluctuations.
Environmental Matters and Regulation
The Company’s operations are subject to stringent federal, state and local laws and regulations governing the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to environmental protection. The Company’s operations are subject to the same environmental laws and regulations as other companies in the oil and natural gas industry. These laws and regulations may:

• | require the acquisition of various permits before drilling commences;


• | require notice to stakeholders of proposed and ongoing operations;


• | require the installation of expensive pollution control equipment;


• | restrict the types, quantities and concentration of various substances that can be released into the environment in connection with drilling and production activities;


• | limit or prohibit drilling activities on lands located within wilderness, wetlands, areas inhabited by endangered species and other protected areas;


• | require remedial measures to prevent pollution from former operations, such as pit closure, reclamation and plugging and abandonment of wells;


• | impose substantial liabilities for pollution resulting from operations; and


• | require preparation of a Resource Management Plan, an Environmental Assessment, and/or an Environmental Impact Statement with respect to operations affecting federal lands or leases.

These laws and regulations may also restrict the production rate of oil, natural gas and NGL below the rate that would otherwise be possible. The regulatory burden on the industry increases the cost of doing business and consequently affects profitability. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may trigger a variety of administrative, civil and criminal enforcement measures, including the assessment of monetary fines or penalties, the imposition of investigatory or remedial requirements, and the issuance of orders enjoining future operations. Moreover, accidental releases or spills may occur in the course of the Company’s operations, which may result in significant costs and liabilities, including third-party claims for damage to property, natural resources or persons. Additionally, Congress and federal and state agencies frequently revise environmental laws and regulations, and any changes that result in more stringent and costly requirements for the oil and natural gas industry could have a significant impact on operating costs.
The environmental laws and regulations applicable to the Company and its operations include, among others, the following U.S. federal laws and regulations:

• | Clean Air Act (“CAA”), which governs air emissions;


• | Clean Water Act (“CWA”), which governs discharges to and excavations within the waters of the U.S.;


• | Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (“CERCLA”), which imposes liability where hazardous releases have occurred or are threatened to occur (commonly known as “Superfund”);


• | The Oil Pollution Act of 1990, which amends and augments the CWA and imposes certain duties and liabilities related to the prevention of oil spills and damages resulting from such spills;


• | Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007, which prescribes new fuel economy standards and other energy saving measures;

14

Item 1.    Business - Continued


• | National Environmental Policy Act (“NEPA”), which governs oil and natural gas production activities on federal lands;


• | Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (“RCRA”), which governs the management of solid waste;


• | Safe Drinking Water Act (“SDWA”), which governs the underground injection and disposal of wastewater;


• | Endangered Species Act (“ESA”), which restricts activities that may affect endangered and threatened species or their habitats; and


• | U.S. Department of Interior regulations, which impose liability for pollution cleanup and damages.

Various states regulate the drilling for, and the production, gathering and sale of, oil, natural gas and NGL, including imposing production taxes and requirements for obtaining drilling permits. States also regulate the method of developing new fields, the spacing and operation of wells and the prevention of waste of resources. States may regulate rates of production and may establish maximum daily production allowables from wells based on market demand or resource conservation, or both. States do not regulate wellhead prices or engage in other similar direct economic regulations, but there can be no assurance that they will not do so in the future. The effect of these regulations may be to limit the amounts of oil, natural gas and NGL that may be produced from the Company’s wells and to limit the number of wells or locations it can drill. The oil and natural gas industry is also subject to compliance with various other federal, state and local regulations and laws. Some of those laws relate to occupational safety, resource conservation and equal opportunity employment.
The Company believes that it substantially complies with all current applicable environmental laws and regulations and that continued compliance with existing requirements will not have a material adverse impact on its business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Future regulatory issues that could impact the Company include new rules or legislation relating to the items discussed below.
Climate Change
In December 2009, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) determined that emissions of carbon dioxide, methane and other “greenhouse gases” (“GHG”) present an endangerment to public health and the environment because emissions of such gases are, according to the EPA, contributing to warming of the earth’s atmosphere and other climatic changes. Based on these findings, the EPA has adopted and implemented regulations to restrict emissions of GHGs under existing provisions of the CAA. In May 2016, the EPA finalized rules that set additional emissions limits for volatile organic compounds and established new controls for emissions of methane from new, modified or reconstructed sources in the oil and natural gas source category, including production, processing, transmission and storage activities. The rules include first-time standards to address emissions of methane from equipment and processes across the source category, including hydraulically fractured oil and natural gas well completions. In June 2017, EPA issued a proposal to stay certain of these requirements for two years and reconsider the entirety of the 2016 rules; however, the rules currently remain in effect. The EPA has also adopted rules requiring the monitoring and reporting of GHG emissions from specified sources in the U.S., including, among other things, certain onshore oil and natural gas production facilities, on an annual basis. In addition, in 2015, the U.S. participated in the United Nations Climate Change Conference, which led to the creation of the Paris Agreement. The Paris Agreement requires member countries to review and “represent a progression” in their intended nationally determined contributions, which set GHG emission reduction goals every five years beginning in 2020. In June 2017, the United States announced its withdrawal from the Paris Agreement, although the earliest possible effective date of withdrawal is November 2020. Despite the planned withdrawal, certain U.S. city and state governments have announced their intention to satisfy their proportionate obligations under the Paris Agreement. Legislation has from time to time been introduced in Congress that would establish measures restricting GHG emissions in the U.S., and a number of states have begun taking actions to control and/or reduce emissions of GHGs.
Some scientists have concluded that increasing concentrations of GHGs in the Earth’s atmosphere may produce climate changes that have significant physical effects, such as increased frequency and severity of storms, floods and other climatic events. If any such effects were to occur, they could adversely affect or delay demand for the oil or natural gas produced or cause the Company to incur significant costs in preparing for or responding to those effects.

Item 1.    Business - Continued

Hydraulic Fracturing
Hydraulic fracturing is an important and common practice that is used to stimulate production of hydrocarbons from tight formations. The process involves the injection of water, sand and chemicals under pressure into formations to fracture the surrounding rock and stimulate production. The Company performs hydraulic fracturing as part of its operations. Hydraulic fracturing operations have historically been overseen by state regulators as part of their oil and natural gas regulatory programs. However, in February 2014, EPA published permitting guidance under the SDWA addressing the use of diesel in fracturing hydraulic operations, and in May 2014, the EPA issued an advance notice of proposed rulemaking under the Toxic Substances Control Act (“TSCA”) relating to chemical substances and mixtures used in oil and natural gas exploration or production. Further, in March 2015, the Department of the Interior’s Bureau of Land Management (“BLM”) adopted a rule requiring, among other things, public disclosure to the BLM of chemicals used in hydraulic fracturing operations after fracturing operations have been completed and strengthening standards for well-bore integrity and management of fluids that return to the surface during and after fracturing operations on federal and Indian lands. Following years of litigation, the BLM rescinded the rule in December 2017. However, in January 2018, California and several environmental groups filed lawsuits challenging BLM’s rescission of the rule; those lawsuits are pending in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California. In addition, from time to time legislation has been introduced before Congress that would provide for federal regulation of hydraulic fracturing and would require disclosure of the chemicals used in the fracturing process. If enacted, these or similar bills could result in additional permitting requirements for hydraulic fracturing operations as well as various restrictions on those operations. These permitting requirements and restrictions could result in delays in operations at well sites and also increased costs to make wells productive.
There may be other attempts to further regulate hydraulic fracturing under the SDWA, TSCA and/or other statutory or regulatory mechanisms. In December 2016, the EPA released its final report on the potential impacts of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water resources, concluding that “water cycle” activities associated with hydraulic fracturing may impact drinking water resources under certain circumstances. Moreover, some states and local governments have adopted, and other states and local governments are considering adopting, regulations that could restrict hydraulic fracturing in certain circumstances. For example, many states in which the Company operates have adopted disclosure regulations requiring varying degrees of disclosure of the constituents in hydraulic fracturing fluids. In addition, the regulation or prohibition of hydraulic fracturing is the subject of significant political activity in a number of jurisdictions, some of which have resulted in tighter regulation, bans, and/or recognition of local government authority to implement such restrictions. In many instances, litigation has ensued, some of which remains pending. If new laws or regulations that significantly restrict hydraulic fracturing are adopted, such laws could make it more difficult or costly for the Company to perform fracturing to stimulate production from tight formations. In addition, any such additional regulation could lead to operational delays, increased operating costs and additional regulatory burdens, and reduced production of oil and natural gas, which could adversely affect the Company’s revenues, results of operations and net cash provided by operating activities.
Hydraulic fracturing operations require the use of a significant amount of water. The Company’s inability to locate sufficient amounts of water, or dispose of or recycle water used in its drilling and production operations, could adversely impact its operations. Moreover, new environmental initiatives and regulations could include restrictions on the Company’s ability to conduct certain operations such as hydraulic fracturing or disposal of waste, including, but not limited to, produced water, drilling fluids and other wastes associated with the development or production of natural gas.
Finally, in some instances, the operation of underground injection wells has been alleged to cause earthquakes in some of the states where the Company operates. Such issues have sometimes led to orders prohibiting continued injection or the suspension of drilling in certain wells identified as possible sources of seismic activity. Such concerns also have resulted in stricter regulatory requirements in some jurisdictions relating to the location and operation of underground injection wells. Future orders or regulations addressing concerns about seismic activity from well injection could affect the Company, either directly or indirectly, depending on the wells affected.
Solid and Hazardous Waste
Although oil and natural gas wastes generally are exempt from regulation as hazardous wastes under RCRA and some comparable state statutes, it is possible some wastes the Company generates presently or in the future may be subject to regulation under RCRA or other applicable statutes. The EPA and various state agencies have limited the disposal options for 
16

Item 1.    Business - Continued

certain wastes, including hazardous wastes, and there is no guarantee that the EPA or the states will not adopt more stringent requirements in the future. For example, in December 2016, the EPA and several environmental groups entered into a consent decree to address the EPA’s alleged failure to timely assess its regulations exempting certain exploration and production related oil and gas wastes from regulation as hazardous wastes under RCRA. The consent decree requires the EPA to propose a rulemaking no later than March 15, 2019, for revision of certain regulations pertaining to oil and gas wastes or to sign a determination that revision of the regulations is not necessary. If the EPA proposes revised oil and gas regulations, the consent decree requires that the EPA take final action following notice and comment rulemaking no later than July 15, 2021. Furthermore, certain wastes generated by the Company’s oil and natural gas operations that are currently exempt from designation as hazardous wastes may in the future be designated as hazardous wastes under RCRA or other applicable statutes, and therefore be subject to more rigorous and costly operating and disposal requirements.
In addition, CERCLA, also known as the Superfund law, imposes cleanup obligations, without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct, on certain classes of persons that are considered to be responsible for the release of a “hazardous substance” into the environment. These persons include the owner or operator of the disposal site or sites where the release occurred and companies that transported or disposed of or arranged for the transport or disposal of the hazardous substances found at the site. Persons who are or were responsible for releases of hazardous substances under CERCLA and any state analogs may be subject to joint and several liability for the costs of cleaning up the hazardous substances that have been released into the environment and for damages to natural resources, and it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file corresponding common law claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the hazardous substances released into the environment. While petroleum and crude oil fractions are not included in the definition of hazardous substances under CERCLA and some of its state analogs because of the so-called “petroleum exclusion,” adulterated petroleum products containing other hazardous substances have been treated as hazardous substances under CERCLA in the past.
Endangered Species Act
Some of the Company’s operations may be located in areas that are designated as habitats for endangered or threatened species under the ESA. In February 2016, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service published a final policy which alters how it identifies critical habitat for endangered and threatened species. A critical habitat designation could result in further material restrictions to federal and private land use and could delay or prohibit land access or development. Moreover, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service continues to make listing decisions and critical habitat designations where necessary, including for over 250 species as required under a 2011 settlement approved by the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, and many hundreds of additional anticipated listing decisions have already been identified beyond those recognized in the 2011 settlement. The Company believes that it is currently in substantial compliance with the ESA. However, the designation of previously unprotected species as being endangered or threatened, if located in the areas of the Company’s operations, could cause the Company to incur additional costs or become subject to operating restrictions in areas where the species are known to exist.
Air Emissions
In August 2012, the EPA issued final rules that subject oil and natural gas production, processing, transmission and storage operations to regulation under the New Source Performance Standards (“NSPS”) and National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (“NESHAP”) programs. The EPA rules include NSPS standards for completions of hydraulically fractured natural gas wells. These standards require operators to capture the gas from natural gas well completions and make it available for use or sale, which can be done through the use of green completions. The standards are applicable to newly fractured wells and existing wells that are refractured. Further, the rules also establish specific requirements for emissions from compressors, controllers, dehydrators, storage tanks, gas processing plants and certain other equipment. The EPA amended these rules in December 2014 to specify requirements for different flowback stages and to expand the rules to cover more storage vessels, among other changes. These rules may require changes to the Company’s operations, including the installation of new equipment to control emissions.
The Company’s costs for environmental compliance may increase in the future based on new environmental regulations. In November 2016, the BLM issued final rules to reduce methane emissions from venting, flaring, and leaks during oil and gas operations on public lands. In December 2017, the BLM finalized a suspension of certain requirements of the rules until 
17

Item 1.    Business - Continued

2019. However, California, New Mexico, and several environmental groups filed lawsuits challenging BLM’s suspension of the rules; those lawsuits are pending in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California. Several states are pursuing similar measures to regulate emissions of methane from new and existing sources within the oil and natural gas source category. In addition, in May 2016, the EPA finalized rules regarding criteria for aggregating multiple small surface sites into a single source for air-quality permitting purposes applicable to the oil and gas industry. This rule could cause small facilities, on an aggregate basis, to be deemed a major source, thereby triggering more stringent air permitting requirements. The EPA has also adopted new rules under the CAA that require the reduction of volatile organic compound emissions from certain fractured and refractured natural gas wells for which well completion operations are conducted and further require that most wells use reduced emission completions, also known as “green completions.” These regulations also establish specific new requirements regarding emissions from production-related wet seal and reciprocating compressors, and from pneumatic controllers and storage vessels. Further, the EPA lowered the National Ambient Air Quality Standard (“NAAQS”) for ozone from 75 to 70 parts per billion in October 2015 and has announced that it intends to complete most initial area designations under the standard by April 30, 2018. State implementation of the revised NAAQS could result in stricter permitting requirements or delay, or limit the Company’s ability to obtain permits, and result in increased expenditures for pollution control equipment. Compliance with these and other air pollution control and permitting requirements has the potential to delay the development of oil and natural gas projects and increase the Company’s costs of development, which costs could be significant.
Water Resources
The CWA and analogous state laws restrict the discharge of pollutants, including produced waters and other oil and natural gas wastes, into waters of the U.S., a term broadly defined to include, among other things, certain wetlands. Under the CWA, permits must be obtained for the discharge of pollutants into waters of the U.S. The CWA provides for administrative, civil and criminal penalties for unauthorized discharges, both routine and accidental, of pollutants and of oil and hazardous substances. It imposes substantial potential liability for the costs of removal or remediation associated with discharges of oil or hazardous substances. State laws governing discharges to water also provide varying civil, criminal and administrative penalties and impose liabilities in the case of a discharge of petroleum or its derivatives, or other hazardous substances, into state waters. In addition, the EPA has promulgated regulations that may require permits to discharge storm water runoff, including discharges associated with construction activities. The CWA also prohibits the discharge of fill materials to regulated waters including wetlands without a permit. In addition, the EPA and the Army Corps of Engineers (“Corps”) released a rule to revise the definition of “waters of the United States” (“WOTUS”) for all CWA programs, which went into effect in August 2015. In October 2015, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit stayed the rule revising the WOTUS definition nationwide pending further action of the court. In response to this decision, the EPA and the Corps resumed nationwide use of the agencies’ prior regulations defining the term “waters of the United States.” However, in January 2018, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the rule revising the WOTUS definition must be reviewed first in the federal district courts, which may result in a withdrawal of the stay by the Sixth Circuit. In addition, the EPA has proposed to repeal the rule revising the WOTUS definition, and in January 2018 the EPA released a final rule that delays implementation of the rule revising the WOTUS definition until 2020 to allow time for the EPA to reconsider the definition of “waters of the United States.” Several states and environmental groups have since filed lawsuits challenging the delay rule. To the extent the rule revising the WOTUS definition is implemented, it could significantly expand federal control of land and water resources across the U.S., triggering substantial additional permitting and regulatory requirements.
Also, in June 2016, the EPA finalized wastewater pretreatment standards that prohibit onshore unconventional oil and natural gas extraction facilities from sending wastewater to publicly-owned treatment works; for certain facilities, compliance is required by August 29, 2019. This pending restriction of disposal options for hydraulic fracturing waste and other changes to CWA requirements may result in increased costs.
Natural Gas Sales and Transportation
Section 1(b) of the Natural Gas Act (“NGA”) exempts natural gas gathering facilities from regulation by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (“FERC”) as a natural gas company under the NGA. The Company believes that the natural gas pipelines in its gathering systems meet the traditional tests FERC has used to establish a pipeline’s status as a gatherer not subject to regulation as a natural gas company, but the status of these lines has never been challenged before FERC. The distinction between FERC-regulated transmission services and federally unregulated gathering services is subject to change

Item 1.    Business - Continued

based on future determinations by FERC, the courts, or Congress, and application of existing FERC policies to individual factual circumstances. Accordingly, the classification and regulation of some of the Company’s natural gas gathering facilities may be subject to challenge before FERC or subject to change based on future determinations by FERC, the courts, or Congress. In the event the Company’s gathering facilities are reclassified to FERC-regulated transmission services, it may be required to charge lower rates and its revenues could thereby be reduced.
FERC requires certain participants in the natural gas market, including natural gas gatherers and marketers which engage in a minimum level of natural gas sales or purchases, to submit annual reports regarding those transactions to FERC. Should the Company fail to comply with this requirement or any other applicable FERC-administered statute, rule, regulation or order, it could be subject to substantial penalties and fines.
Pipeline Safety Regulations
The U.S. Department of Transportation’s Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (“PHMSA”) regulates safety of oil and natural gas pipelines, including, with some specific exceptions, oil and natural gas gathering lines. From time to time, PHMSA, the courts, or Congress may make determinations that affect PHMSA’s regulations or their applicability to the Company’s pipelines. These determinations may affect the costs the Company incurs in complying with applicable safety regulations.
Worker Safety
The Occupational Safety and Health Act (“OSHA”) and analogous state laws regulate the protection of the safety and health of workers. The OSHA hazard communication standard requires maintenance of information about hazardous materials used or produced in operations and provision of such information to employees. Other OSHA standards regulate specific worker safety aspects of the Company’s operations. Failure to comply with OSHA requirements can lead to the imposition of penalties.
Future Impacts and Current Expenditures
The Company cannot predict how future environmental laws and regulations may impact its properties or operations. For the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company did not incur any material capital expenditures for installation of remediation or pollution control equipment at any of its facilities. The Company is not aware of any environmental issues or claims that will require material capital expenditures during 2018 or that will otherwise have a material impact on its financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
Employees
As of December 31, 2017, the Company employed approximately 970 personnel. None of the employees are represented by labor unions or covered by any collective bargaining agreement. The Company believes that its relationship with its employees is satisfactory.
