(b) Financial Information About Business Segments
 
Investors Heritage Life
 
The business segments of Investors Heritage Life are identified and discussed on page 10-14 of the Annual Report to Stockholders for the year ended December 31, 2016 and are incorporated herein by reference. We offer a portfolio of the standard forms of participating and non-participating whole life, limited pay, endowments, split-funding, interest-sensitive whole life, guaranteed issue whole life, single premium whole life, universal life, term and group life, annuities and single premium immediate annuities. In addition, we write credit life and credit accident and health insurance on a group basis.   The business of Investors Heritage Life is not seasonal.
 
Investors Heritage Life is regulated by the Departments of Insurance in the states where it is licensed to do business. All insurance products must be approved by the Departments of Insurance in each state where Investors Heritage Life is authorized to do business prior to being sold in that state. In addition, the financial condition and market conduct condition of Investors Heritage Life are monitored and examined by the state regulatory agencies on a regular basis.
 
Ordinary Production. The business segments for ordinary production are Preneed and Burial products (“Preneed”) and Traditional and Universal Life products (“Traditional”). Ordinary insurance in force accounts for 77% of total insurance in force.  One of our primary focuses has been the Preneed sales in the final expense and preneed funeral markets. Final expense sales include the sale of small face amount ordinary life insurance products, the purpose of which is to pay the insured's final expenses. Preneed funeral sales include the sale of multiple premium and single premium ordinary life policies which are sold to fund a specific prearranged funeral contract.

Traditional products consist of senior wealth transfer products, traditional life, group life, certain annuities and universal life products.
 
Administrative and Financial Services. This segment includes the administration of credit insurance as well as fees generated from our third party administration arrangements. Investors Heritage Life has sold credit insurance since 1966. Since 1996, Investors Heritage Financial has marketed Investors Heritage Life’s credit insurance products. All of the risk on credit insurance policies sold by Investors Heritage Life has been and is expected to continue to be reinsured with larger, highly rated companies. Currently, all credit insurance business is being reinsured with Swiss Life Ltd. and KenBanc Reinsurance Company, Ltd. Investors Heritage Life has an exclusive marketing agreement with the KBA and its insurance agency subsidiary, KenBanc Insurance Services, Inc., whereby they handle all marketing and sales management responsibilities for the credit insurance products to financial institutions in the Commonwealth of Kentucky. Investors Heritage Life provides insurance products to be marketed as well as all back office administrative services related to the credit insurance operations. 
 
In addition to credit administration, this segment includes fees generated relative to our third party administrative relationships. We currently provide tailored administrative services for five unaffiliated life insurance companies. Services provided to each company vary based on their needs and can include some or all aspects of back-office accounting, actuarial services and policy administration. We are continuing to market our third party administrative services to prospective clients.
 
(c) Narrative Description of Business
 
Preneed and Burial Products (“Preneed”).   Approximately 75% of total ordinary insurance in force is Preneed. Sales for this segment are under the direct supervision of the home office using a regionally supervised agency system. The method of field operation involves independent contractual agents working with district and regional managers. These managers contract with and train agents who work under them. The regional managers may have district managers under their supervision. In the Preneed area, agency relationships have also been entered into directly with numerous funeral home owners. Management anticipates this trend to continue and, depending on the size of the funeral home and state law, preneed counselors may also become part of the agency force. 
 
Our efforts and strategy to continue a successful preneed insurance operation hinge on continuing to provide solid products and outstanding administrative service and on the personal relationships developed and fostered each year. Our Preneed sales are generated primarily through independent funeral homes in fourteen states.

The preneed market is very competitive despite the recent conditions in the financial markets. There are more than twenty companies active in our preneed market. The principal methods of competition are product pricing including growth on preneed insurance products and commissions, and the quality and efficiency of service provided. Our competitive pricing and our quality and efficient service as well as long term sustainability are positive factors in our competitive position. However, competitors introduce new products frequently and we strive to maintain and improve our offerings constantly as we ensure sales of sustainable and profitable business. 
 
We also market final expense whole life insurance policies. These products are non-participating whole life insurance issued with simplified underwriting. These products are offered outside of the preneed market. Currently the product is being sold through independent agents.
 
The final expense market is very competitive. The principal methods of competition are product pricing and commissions; however the quality and efficiency of service are also important factors.
 
Traditional and Universal Life Products (“Traditional”). Sales for this segment are under the direct supervision of the home office using independent agents. In addition, for the senior wealth preservation products, we utilize a national marketing firm that retains captive account executives and agents and the firm is responsible for recruiting and training these individuals. We also sell business through general agents or brokers who may represent one or more companies.
 
Approximately 25% of total ordinary insurance in force is Traditional. These sales are built around a standard portfolio of life insurance policies with some of the contributions to in-force business being a participating ordinary life insurance policy, a guaranteed issue whole life policy and non-participating life policies. In addition, we offer term insurance products including an Express Term product for the middle income market.
 
We also continue to sell products through our agreement with the national marketing firm, Puritan Financial Group. The products being sold include a single premium whole life policy and a single premium immediate annuity sold in conjunction with a ten-pay whole life policy. 
 
The single premium and 10-pay whole life/single premium immediate annuity markets are also very competitive but in conjunction with our marketing partner, Investors Heritage has attempted to establish a middle income market niche for the sale of lower volume products. Most of the major competitors are focused on much higher volume production. The principal methods of competition are product design, pricing and quality and efficiency of service.
 
Our ordinary products also include the HLW Choice Whole Life, Heritage Youth Protector and Heritage Protector IV.
 
Group life accounts for 6% of total insurance in force. We have entered into several marketing agreements with various association groups to provide a group term life insurance policy to members of the groups. Although this is not currently a large volume of business, we anticipate expanding the association group business and anticipate cross-selling other life insurance products to members of the groups.

Administrative and Financial Services. Credit insurance, which accounts for 17% of total insurance in force, is generally sold through banks, finance companies and automobile dealerships and is offered in connection with the extension of credit. The amount of the insurance is designed to cover the amount of the loan with the financial institution being the beneficiary of the insurance policy to the extent of the unpaid balance of the loan. Credit insurance production is dependent on consumer debt. In times of low unemployment, reasonable interest rates and a steadily improving economy, consumer debt increases; therefore, credit insurance sales increase. When the economy slows, consumer debt slows and therefore credit insurance sales decrease.
 
Investors Heritage Life has reinsurance agreements for credit insurance with ten unaffiliated companies. Pursuant to those agreements, our credit insurance products sold by each company’s agents are then reinsured to each company, respectively. Investors Heritage Life and Investors Heritage Financial are paid an initiation fee and an administration fee for services provided. 
 
Investors Heritage Financial generates revenue from marketing Investors Heritage Life’s credit insurance products through banks, finance companies and selected automobile dealerships. 
 
In addition to selling credit insurance, Investors Heritage Life provides ongoing servicing of written credit business, generating fee income. Additionally, Investors Heritage Life bank agents may obtain an ordinary life license enabling them to sell mortgage life insurance. 
 
During 2016, we continued to market our third party administrative services to non-affiliated companies. We have an employee whose primary responsibility is to promote this aspect of our organization. This additional marketing focus has and is expected to generate fee income associated with providing these services. Our overall revenue is further enhanced by the fact that we generally incur minimal expense increases associated with the third party administrative services, which decreases our overall unit costs. 
 
We have the capacity within our organization to handle the additional load and we have been successful in providing services without the need to add a significant number of new employees. We currently provide administrative services for five non-affiliated life insurance companies. These agreements are with a variety of companies that encompass different levels of services, including in some cases, full life insurance back office administration and accounting.
 
Reinsurance. Investors Heritage Life utilizes a combination of yearly renewable term reinsurance and coinsurance to cede life insurance coverage in excess of its desired retention limits. In recent years, we have maintained our retention limits in most cases at $25,000 per life, utilizing a combination of established product specific reinsurance treaties along with yearly renewable term treaties for policies where we had previously maintained more than this limit. At the end of the second quarter of 2016, we approved an increase in our individual life retention to $50,000 per life where allowable under our reinsurance agreements. We are in the process of evaluating and either replacing or modifying our existing individual life yearly renewable term reinsurance agreements in order to effect this increase in retention. We anticipate that this change will better align our retention with our current capital, reduce reinsurance costs and allow for us to maintain a greater share of the anticipated profitability of our products.

Effective September 30, 2016, Investors Heritage Life entered into a 100% coinsurance agreement with Southland National Insurance Corporation (“SNIC”) whereby we reinsured an existing block of deferred fixed annuities to SNIC. The total liabilities reinsured as of September 30, 2016 were approximately $44,024,000 and deferred acquisition costs associated with this block were approximately $329,000. We transferred cash to SNIC under the agreement totaling approximately $41,921,000. In order to generate cash, we sold fixed maturity securities generating pre-tax net realized capital gains totaling approximately $880,000. In accordance with GAAP guidance, the initial ceding commission received on this transaction was deferred and will be recognized into income over the expected life of the reinsurance contract, which is 20 years. The initial ceding commission, net of tax, was $1,471,858 and is presented separately on the balance sheet as deferred revenue on reinsurance ceded. We recognized $40,211 of income associated with the amortization of the deferred revenue during 2016. Under the terms of the reinsurance agreement, we will continue to administer this business and will be paid administrative fees by SNIC. SNIC will also maintain a trust account further securing the statutory liabilities ceded.

Other Subsidiaries. Investors Heritage Printing performed job printing for Investors Heritage Life as well as numerous unaffiliated sources. This includes the printing of the application forms and other office forms required by Investors Heritage Life. The income from Investors Heritage Printing has not been a significant factor in our overall business. Due to the retirement of a key employee at the end of 2015 and shifts in print demand, we currently have no ongoing operational plans relative to Investors Heritage Printing. 
 
The operation of Investors Heritage Financial generates additional revenue to Investors Heritage Capital Corporation, although this additional revenue is not a significant factor in our overall business. 
 
At Need Funding is a single member, limited liability company organized under the laws of the Commonwealth of Kentucky. Investors Heritage Capital Corporation is the sole member of the LLC. Funding provided by At Need Funding is secured by assignments of verified incontestable life insurance policies issued by unaffiliated companies. The funds are advanced to funeral homes for services provided for the insured. Upon receipt of death benefits from the unaffiliated insurance company, the principal balance of the debt is reduced and interest and fees are recorded. This service is marketed primarily to funeral homes that do not have the manpower to timely complete necessary paperwork to process the insurance claim. 
 
Additionally, we earn fees for other services performed for our subsidiaries. The fees pay for the necessary supervision and coordination required to provide common policies and procedures for all the subsidiaries. The supervision results in a coordination of contracts with the various independent agents, common sales brochures, and a savings to each company in the area of printing and purchasing. We purchase director and officer liability coverage, employment practices liability insurance coverage, professional liability coverage, cyber liability coverage and blanket fidelity bonds. All policies provide coverage for each of the subsidiaries and provide a cost savings when compared to purchases made by individual companies. These fees are not significant to our total revenue and are eliminated in consolidation. Investors Heritage Capital Corporation also has revenue from other investments, but it is not a significant factor in our business.
 
Employees. Investors Heritage Capital Corporation does not have any employees. While Investors Heritage Capital Corporation’s officers perform various functions, they are not paid a salary by Investors Heritage Capital Corporation for performing such functions. There are 81 people employed by Investors Heritage Life and 76 of these individuals are full-time employees. There are no unions organized nor are there any collective bargaining agreements with the employees. Management of Investors Heritage Life considers its relationship with the employees to be satisfactory.
