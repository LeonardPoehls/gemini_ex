Item 1.        Business
Overview
Unless otherwise indicated or required by the context, references throughout to “Endo,” the “Company,” “we,” “our” or “us” refer to financial information and transactions of Endo International plc and its subsidiaries.
Endo International plc is an Ireland-domiciled, global specialty pharmaceutical company focused on generic and branded pharmaceuticals. We aim to be the premier partner to healthcare professionals and payment providers, delivering an innovative suite of generic and branded drugs to meet patients’ needs. Endo International plc was incorporated in Ireland in 2013 as a private limited company and re-registered effective February 18, 2014 as a public limited company.
Our ordinary shares are traded on the NASDAQ Global Market (NASDAQ) under the ticker symbol “ENDP.” References throughout to “ordinary shares” refer to Endo International plc’s ordinary shares, 1,000,000,000 authorized, par value $0.0001 per share. In addition, we have 4,000,000 euro deferred shares outstanding, par value of $0.01 each.
Our global headquarters are located at Minerva House, Simmonscourt Road, Ballsbridge, Dublin 4, Ireland (telephone number: 011-353-1-268-2000) and our U.S. headquarters are located at 1400 Atwater Drive, Malvern, Pennsylvania 19355 (telephone number: 484-216-0000).
Across all of our businesses, we generated total revenues of $3.47 billion, $4.01 billion and $3.27 billion in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
Our focus is on pharmaceutical products and we target areas where we believe we can build leading positions. We use a differentiated operating model based on a lean and nimble structure, the rational allocation of capital and an emphasis on high-value research and development (R&D) targets. While our primary focus is on organic growth, we evaluate and, where appropriate, execute on opportunities to expand through the acquisition of products and companies in areas that serve patients and customers and that we believe will offer above average growth characteristics and attractive margins. We believe our operating model and the execution of our corporate strategy will enable us to create shareholder value over the long-term.
As of December 31, 2017, the three reportable business segments in which the Company operates were: (1) U.S. Generic Pharmaceuticals, (2) U.S. Branded Pharmaceuticals and (3) International Pharmaceuticals. Differences in economic and other characteristics between our Sterile Injectables product portfolio, which is currently part of our U.S. Generic Pharmaceuticals segment, and the remaining U.S. Generic Pharmaceuticals segment products have been heightened by recent competitive pressures and other industry trends impacting sales and profitability. In response to these trends, in February 2018, we made changes to the way we manage and evaluate our business. As a result, our first quarter 2018 Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q will reflect a change in segments. Our Sterile Injectables product portfolio, which was part of our U.S. Generic Pharmaceuticals segment as of December 31, 2017, will be presented as a new segment named “U.S. Branded - Sterile Injectables.” Additionally, our current U.S. Branded Pharmaceuticals segment will be renamed “U.S. Branded - Specialty & Established Pharmaceuticals.” Subsequent to this change, we will have four reportable business segments: (1) U.S. Generic Pharmaceuticals, (2) U.S. Branded - Specialty & Established Pharmaceuticals, (3) U.S. Branded - Sterile Injectables and (4) International Pharmaceuticals. Each of these segments will represent a separate reporting unit for goodwill testing purposes. Under U.S. GAAP, we are required to test the goodwill of the reporting units impacted by the change described above both immediately before and after the segment realignment. This analysis, which we expect to complete in connection with our first quarter 2018 financial reporting close, is expected to result in an impairment to the goodwill of the new U.S. Generic Pharmaceuticals reporting unit, the amount of which could be material.
U.S. Generic Pharmaceuticals
Our U.S. Generic Pharmaceuticals segment, which accounted for 66%, 64% and 51% of total revenues in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively, focuses on high-barrier-to-entry products, including first-to-file or first-to-market opportunities that are difficult to formulate or manufacture or face complex legal and regulatory challenges. A first-to-file product, also known as a Paragraph IV product, refers to a generic product for which the Abbreviated New Drug Application (ANDA) containing a patent challenge to the corresponding branded product was the first to be filed with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). A first-to-market product refers to a product that is the first marketed generic equivalent of a branded product for reasons apart from statutory marketing exclusivity, such as the generic equivalent of a branded product that is difficult to formulate or manufacture. First-to-file products offer the opportunity for 180 days of generic marketing exclusivity, except for competing authorized generic products, to the extent we are successful in litigating any patent challenges and receive final FDA approval of the products. First-to-market products allow us to mitigate risks from competitive pressure commonly associated with commoditized generic products.
1

The product offerings of this segment consist of a differentiated product portfolio including solid oral extended-release, solid oral immediate-release, abuse-deterrent products, liquids, semi-solids, patches, powders, ophthalmics, sprays and sterile injectables and include products in the pain management, urology, central nervous system disorders, immunosuppression, oncology, women’s health and cardiovascular disease markets, among others. Our U.S. Generic Pharmaceuticals segment is among the largest U.S. generics company based on market share. Our largest U.S. Generic Pharmaceuticals manufacturing sites are in Chestnut Ridge, New York; Irvine, California; Rochester, Michigan; and Chennai, India; which handle the production, assembly, quality assurance testing and packaging of our products. The majority of the products we manufacture are produced in our U.S. facilities.
This segment consists of our legacy generics business together with the generic pharmaceuticals products obtained through our September 25, 2015 acquisition of Par Pharmaceutical Holdings, Inc. (Par), which develops, licenses, manufactures, markets and distributes innovative and cost-effective pharmaceuticals that help improve patient quality of life.
U.S. Branded Pharmaceuticals
Our U.S. Branded Pharmaceuticals segment, which accounted for 28%, 29% and 39% of our total revenues in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively, includes a variety of branded prescription products to treat and manage conditions in urology, urologic oncology, endocrinology, pain and orthopedics. The products that are included in this segment include XIAFLEX®, SUPPRELIN® LA, TESTOPEL®, NASCOBAL® Nasal Spray, AVEED®, OPANA® ER, PERCOCET®, VOLTAREN® Gel, LIDODERM®, TESTIM® and FORTESTA® Gel, among others.
This segment consists of our legacy branded business together with the branded products obtained through our January 29, 2015 acquisition of Auxilium Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Auxilium), a fully integrated specialty pharmaceutical company with a focus on developing and commercializing innovative products for specific patients’ needs in orthopedics, dermatology and other therapeutic areas, and our September 25, 2015 acquisition of Par.
International Pharmaceuticals
The International Pharmaceuticals segment, which accounted for 7%, 7% and 10% of total revenues in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively, includes a variety of specialty pharmaceutical products sold outside the U.S., primarily in Canada through our operating company Paladin Labs Inc. (Paladin). This segment’s key products serve growing therapeutic areas, including attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), pain, women’s health and oncology.
This segment also included: (i) our South African business, which was sold in July 2017 and consisted of Litha Healthcare Group Limited (Litha) and certain assets acquired from Aspen Holdings in October 2015 and (ii) our Latin American business consisting of Grupo Farmacéutico Somar, S.A.P.I. de C.V. (Somar), which was sold in October 2017. We expect this segment’s revenues to continue to decline in 2018 due to the divestitures of Litha and Somar.
Our Strategy
Our strategy is to focus on our core assets, a leading generics business and a specialty branded pharmaceutical business, that deliver high quality medicines to patients through excellence in development, manufacturing and commercialization. Through a lean and efficient operating model, we are committed to serving patients and customers while continuing to innovate and provide products that make a difference in the lives of patients. We strive to maximize shareholder value by adapting to market realities and customer needs.
We are committed to driving organic growth at attractive margins by improving execution, optimizing cash flow and leveraging our market position, while maintaining a streamlined cost structure throughout each of our businesses. Specific areas of management’s focus include:

• | U.S. Generic Pharmaceuticals: Focusing on developing or acquiring high-barrier-to-entry products, including first-to-file or first-to-market opportunities that are difficult to formulate or manufacture or face complex legal and regulatory challenges.


• | U.S. Branded Pharmaceuticals: Accelerating performance of organic growth drivers in our Specialty Products portfolio, expanding margin in our Established Products portfolio and investing in key pipeline development opportunities.


• | International Pharmaceuticals: Operating in regulated markets with durable revenue streams and where physicians play a significant role in choosing the course of therapy and expanding distribution of certain of our products outside of the U.S.

We remain committed to strategic R&D across each business unit. Going forward, while our primary focus will be on organic growth, we will evaluate and, where appropriate, execute on opportunities to expand through acquisitions of products and companies.

Our Competitive Strengths
To successfully execute our strategy, we must continue to capitalize on our following core strengths:
Experienced and dedicated management team. We have a highly skilled and customer-focused management team in critical leadership positions across all of Endo. Our senior management team has extensive experience in the pharmaceutical industry and a proven track record of developing businesses and value creation. This experience includes improving business performance through organic revenue growth and through the identification, consummation and integration of licensing and acquisition opportunities.
Focus on the differentiated products of our generics business. We develop high-barrier-to-entry generic products, including first-to-file or first-to-market opportunities that are difficult to formulate or manufacture or face complex legal and regulatory challenges. We believe products with these characteristics will face a lesser degree of competition and therefore provide longer product life cycles and higher profitability than commodity generic products. Our business model continues to focus on being the lowest-cost producer of products in categories with higher barriers to entry and lower levels of competition by leveraging operational efficiency. Our U.S. Generic Pharmaceuticals segment is focused on categories where there are fewer challenges from low-cost operators.
Operational excellence. We have efficient, effective and high-quality manufacturing capabilities across a diversified array of dosage forms. We believe our comprehensive suite of technology, manufacturing and development competencies increases the likelihood of success in commercializing high-barrier-to-entry products and obtaining first-to-file and first-to-market status on future products, yielding more sustainable market share and profitability. For example, our capabilities in the rapidly growing U.S. market for sterile drug products, such as injectables and ophthalmics, and sterile vial and hormonal capabilities afford us with a broader and more diversified product portfolio and a greater selection of targets for potential development.
We believe that our competitive advantages include our integrated team-based approach to product development that combines our formulation, regulatory, legal, manufacturing and commercial capabilities; our ability to introduce new generic equivalents for brand-name drugs; our quality and cost-effective production; our ability to meet customer and/or patient expectations; and the breadth of our existing generic product portfolio offerings. Through our recent strategic assessments, we have taken further steps to optimize our generic, specialty branded and international product portfolios and now look to capitalize on a much stronger and durable in-line product portfolio and R&D pipeline. We are focused only on those marketed products that deliver acceptable returns on investment, thereby leveraging our existing platform to drive operational efficiency.
Growth of our branded Specialty Products portfolio while leveraging the strength of our Established Products portfolio. We have assembled a portfolio of branded prescription products offered by our U.S. Branded Pharmaceuticals segment to treat and manage conditions in urology, urologic oncology, endocrinology, pain and orthopedics. Our Specialty Products portfolio includes, among other products: XIAFLEX®, SUPPRELIN® LA, TESTOPEL®, NASCOBAL® Nasal Spray and AVEED®. Our Established Products portfolio includes, among other products: PERCOCET®, VOLTAREN® Gel, LIDODERM®, TESTIM® and FORTESTA® Gel. For additional detail, see “Products Overview.”
Continuing proactive diversification of our business. Our primary focus is on organic growth. However, we will evaluate and, where appropriate, execute on opportunities to expand through acquisitions of products and companies in areas that will serve patients and customers and that we believe will offer above average growth characteristics and attractive margins. In particular, we will look to continue to enhance our product lines by acquiring or licensing rights to additional products and regularly evaluating selective acquisition opportunities.
Research and development expertise. Our R&D efforts are focused on the development of a balanced, diversified portfolio of innovative and clinically differentiated products. The acquisition of Auxilium added multiple, strategically-aligned programs to our branded pharmaceutical R&D pipeline with the addition of collagenase clostridium histolyticum (CCH). Through our U.S. Generics business, we seek out and develop high-barrier-to-entry generic products, including first-to-file or first-to-market opportunities. We periodically review our generic products pipeline in order to better direct investment toward those opportunities that we expect will deliver the greatest returns. We remain committed to R&D across each business unit with a particular focus on assets with inherently lower risk profiles and clearly defined regulatory pathways. Our current R&D pipeline consists of products in various stages of development. For additional detail, see “Select Development Projects.”
Our R&D and regulatory affairs staff is based primarily in Chestnut Ridge, New York, Chennai, India, at our global headquarters in Dublin, Ireland and at our U.S. headquarters in Malvern, Pennsylvania.

Targeted sales and marketing infrastructure. Our sales and marketing activities are primarily based in the U.S. and Canada and focus on the promotion of our Specialty Products portfolio. We market our products directly to specialty physicians, including those specializing in urology, orthopedics, pediatric endocrinology and bariatric surgery. Our sales force also targets retail pharmacies and other healthcare professionals. We distribute our products through independent wholesale distributors, but we also sell directly to retailers, clinics, government agencies, doctors, independent retail and specialty pharmacies and independent specialty distributors. Our marketing policy is designed to provide physicians, pharmacies, hospitals, public and private payers and appropriate healthcare professionals with products and relevant, appropriate medical information. We work to gain access to healthcare authority, pharmacy benefit managers and managed care organizations’ formularies (lists of recommended or approved medicines and other products), including Medicare Part D plans and reimbursement lists, by demonstrating the qualities and treatment benefits of our products within their approved indications.
Products Overview
U.S. Generic Pharmaceuticals
The U.S. Generic Pharmaceuticals segment’s product portfolio has over 280 generic prescription product families including solid oral extended-release, solid oral immediate-release, abuse-deterrent products, liquids, semi-solids, patches (which are medicated adhesive patches designed to deliver the drug through the skin), powders, ophthalmics (which are sterile pharmaceutical preparations administered for ocular conditions), sprays and sterile injectables and products in the pain management, urology, central nervous system disorders, immunosuppression, oncology, women’s health and cardiovascular disease markets, among others.
Generic drugs are the pharmaceutical and therapeutic equivalents of branded products and are generally marketed under their generic (chemical) names rather than by brand names. Generic products are substantially the same as branded products in dosage form, safety, efficacy, route of administration, quality, performance characteristics and intended use, but are generally sold at prices below those of the corresponding branded products and thus represent cost-effective alternatives for consumers.
Typically, a generic drug may not be marketed until the expiration of applicable patent(s) on the corresponding branded product, unless a resolution of patent litigation results in an earlier opportunity to enter the market. For additional detail, see “Governmental Regulation.” However, our generics portfolio also contains certain authorized generics, which are generic versions of branded drugs licensed by brand drug companies under a New Drug Application (NDA) and marketed as generics. Authorized generics do not face regulatory barriers to introduction and are not prohibited from sale during the 180-day marketing exclusivity period granted to the first-to-file ANDA applicant. Our authorized generics include lidocaine patch 5% (LIDODERM®), budesonide (Entocort® EC), and diclofenac sodium gel (VOLTAREN® Gel), among others. We believe we are a partner of choice to larger brand companies seeking an authorized generics distributor for their branded products. We have been the authorized generic distributor for such companies as AstraZeneca plc, Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, Novartis AG (Novartis) and Merck & Co., Inc.

(2) | New Launches and Alternative Dosages includes liquids, semi-solids, patches, powders, ophthalmics, sprays and new product launches. Products are included in New Launches during the calendar year of launch and the subsequent calendar year such that the period of time any product will be considered a New Launch will range from thirteen to twenty-four months. Subsequent to this thirteen to twenty-four month period that revenues are considered New Launches, these product revenues will be reflected as either U.S. Generics Base or Sterile Injectables, or will remain as an Alternative Dosage.

U.S. Generics Base consists of more than 190 products, including solid oral-extended release, solid oral-immediate release and pain/controlled substances products. This category includes the antidepressant bupropion XL and a portfolio of pain products such as hydrocodone bitartrate and acetaminophen tablets.
4

Sterile Injectables consists of high-barrier-to-entry injectable products that are generally difficult to manufacture and may therefore face a lesser degree of competition. Products in this category include VASOSTRICT®, currently the first and only vasopressin injection with an NDA approved by the FDA, and ADRENALIN®. We have been issued five patents relating to VASOSTRICT® by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (PTO). These patents expire in January 2035 and were submitted to the FDA’s Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations (known as the Orange Book). These patents are presently listed in the Orange Book. The Orange Book listing requires any ANDA or 505(b)(2) applicant (as further described below under the heading “Governmental Regulation”) seeking FDA approval for a generic version of VASOSTRICT® prior to patent expiry to notify us of its ANDA or 505(b)(2) filing before it can obtain FDA approval. Any ANDA or 505(b)(2) filer seeking approval prior to patent expiry whose application was not received prior to submission of the patent information would be subject to a 30-month stay of marketing approval by the FDA upon our initiation of Hatch-Waxman litigation against the ANDA or 505(b)(2) filer within the statutory time period.
New Launches and Alternative Dosages includes liquids, semi-solids, patches, powders, ophthalmics, sprays and new product launches. Products are included in New Launches during the calendar year of launch and the subsequent calendar year such that the period of time any product will be considered a New Launch will range from thirteen to twenty-four months. Products in the New Launches category include, among others, ephedrine sulfate injection, vigabatrin powder for oral solution and neostigmine injection, which were launched in 2017, and ezetimibe tablets, quetiapine ER tablets and the authorized generic of VOLTEREN® Gel, which were launched in 2016.

Specialty Products Portfolio
Endo commercializes a number of products within the market served by specialty distributors and specialty pharmacies, and in which healthcare practitioners (HCPs) can purchase and bill payers directly (the buy and bill market). Our current offerings primarily relate to two distinct areas: (i) urology treatments, which focus mainly on Peyronie’s disease (PD) and testosterone replacement therapies (TRT) for hypogonadism; and (ii) orthopedics/pediatric endocrinology treatments, which focus on Dupuytren’s contracture (DC) and central precocious puberty (CPP).
Key product offerings in this category include the following:

• | XIAFLEX®, which is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with DC with an abnormal buildup of collagen in the fingers which limits or disables hand function. It is also indicated for the treatment of adult men with PD with a collagen plaque and a penile curvature deformity of thirty degrees or greater at the start of therapy. XIAFLEX® is the first and only FDA-approved non-surgical treatment for PD.


• | SUPPRELIN® LA, which is a soft, flexible 12-month hydrogel implant based on our hydrogel polymer technology that delivers histrelin acetate, a gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist and is indicated for the treatment of CPP in children.

5


• | TESTOPEL®, which is a unique, long-acting implantable pellet indicated for TRT in conditions associated with a deficiency or absence of endogenous testosterone.


• | NASCOBAL® Nasal Spray, which is a prescription medicine used as a supplement to treat vitamin B12 deficiency and is the only FDA-approved B12 nasal spray.


• | AVEED®, which is a novel, long-acting testosterone undecanoate for injection for the treatment of hypogonadism. AVEED® is dosed only five times per year after the first month of therapy.

Established Products Portfolio
Endo’s Established Products portfolio’s current treatment offerings primarily relate to two distinct areas: (i) pain management, including products in the opioid analgesics and osteoarthritis pain segments and for the treatment of pain associated with post-herpetic neuralgia; and (ii) urology, which focuses mainly on treatment of hypogonadism. The Company’s legacy pain portfolio products are managed as mature brands.
Key product offerings in this category include, among others, the following:

• | PERCOCET®, which is an opioid analgesic approved for the treatment of moderate-to-moderately-severe pain.


• | VOLTAREN® Gel, which is a topical prescription treatment for the relief of joint pain of osteoarthritis in the knees, ankles, feet, elbows, wrists and hands. VOLTAREN® Gel delivers effective pain relief with a favorable safety profile.


• | LIDODERM®, which is a topical patch product containing lidocaine, approved for the relief of pain associated with post-herpetic neuralgia, a condition thought to result after nerve fibers are damaged during a case of Herpes Zoster (commonly known as shingles).


• | TESTIM® (and its authorized generic), which is a topical gel indicated for TRT in conditions associated with a deficiency or absence of endogenous testosterone.


• | FORTESTA® Gel (and its authorized generic), which is a patented two percent (2%) testosterone transdermal gel and is a treatment for men suffering from hypogonadism.

Also included within this product portfolio is OPANA® ER, an opioid agonist indicated for the management of pain severe enough to require daily, around-the-clock, long-term opioid treatment and for which alternative treatment options are inadequate. In March 2017, we announced that the FDA’s Drug Safety and Risk Management and Anesthetic and Analgesic Drug Products Advisory Committees voted that the benefits of reformulated OPANA® ER (oxymorphone hydrochloride extended release) no longer outweigh its risks. In June 2017, we became aware of the FDA’s request that we voluntarily withdraw OPANA® ER from the market, and in July 2017, after careful consideration and consultation with the FDA, we decided to voluntarily remove OPANA® ER from the market. During the second quarter of 2017, we began to work with the FDA to coordinate an orderly withdrawal of the product from the market. By September 1, 2017, we ceased shipments of OPANA® ER to customers and we expect the New Drug Application will be withdrawn in the coming months.
International Pharmaceuticals
Our International Pharmaceuticals segment includes a variety of specialty pharmaceutical products sold outside the U.S., primarily in Canada through our operating company Paladin Labs Inc. (Paladin). This segment’s key products serve growing therapeutic areas, including attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), pain, women’s health and oncology.
Select Development Projects
U.S. Generic Pharmaceuticals Pipeline
Our primary approach to generic pharmaceutical product development is to target high-barrier-to-entry generic products, including first-to-file or first-to-market opportunities. We expect such product opportunities to result in products that are either the exclusive generic or have two or fewer generic competitors when launched, which we believe tends to lead to more sustainable market share and profitability for our product portfolio.
As of December 31, 2017, our U.S. Generic Pharmaceuticals segment has over 175 products in its pipeline, which included approximately 100 ANDAs pending with the FDA representing approximately $30 billion of combined annual sales for the corresponding branded products in 2017. Of the 100 ANDAs, approximately 40 represent first-to-file opportunities or first-to-market opportunities. We periodically review our generic products pipeline in order to better direct investment toward those opportunities that we expect will deliver the greatest returns. This process can lead to decisions to discontinue certain R&D projects that may reduce the number of products in our previously reported generic pipeline.

Collagenase Clostridium Histolyticum
Collagenase clostridium histolyticum (CCH) is currently approved and marketed in the U.S. under the trademark XIAFLEX® for the treatment of both DC and PD (two separate indications). We are progressing the branded cellulite treatment development program for CCH. We completed a Phase 2b clinical trial for this program, the results of which were released in November 2016. An End of Phase 2 meeting with the FDA occurred in early 2017 and, in February 2018, we initiated two identical Phase 3 clinical trials for CCH for the treatment of cellulite. The multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies will evaluate the safety and ability of CCH to reduce the appearance of cellulite.
We have global marketing rights for CCH for the treatment of cellulite. We also have the right to further develop CCH for additional indications, including Dupuytren’s nodules, adhesive capsulitis, lateral hip fat, plantar fibromatosis and human and canine lipomas.
Competition
Generic Pharmaceuticals
In the generic pharmaceutical market, we face intense competition from other generic drug manufacturers, brand name pharmaceutical companies through authorized generics, existing brand equivalents and manufacturers of therapeutically similar drugs. Our major competitors in the generics market, including Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Limited (Teva), Mylan N.V., Sandoz (a division of Novartis AG) and Impax Laboratories, Inc. (Impax), vary by product.
We make a significant portion of our sales to a relatively small number of drug wholesalers and retail drug store chains. These customers play a key role in the distribution chain of our pharmaceutical products. Drug wholesalers and retail drug store chains have undergone, and are continuing to undergo, significant consolidation, which has resulted in these groups gaining additional purchasing leverage that has increased the pricing pressures on our business. Additionally, the emergence of large buying groups representing independent retail pharmacies and other drug distributors, and the prevalence and influence of managed care organizations and similar institutions, enable those groups to demand larger price discounts on our products. For example, McKesson Corporation and Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. entered into an agreement to jointly source generic pharmaceuticals and Express Scripts, through a wholly owned subsidiary, Innovative Product Alignment, LLC, announced it will participate in Walgreens Boots Alliance Development GmbH group purchasing organization. As a result of these alliances, the consolidation among wholesale distributors and the growth of large retail drug store chains, a small number of purchasers control a significant share of purchases and have gained more purchasing power that has heightened competition among generic drug producers for the business of this consolidated customer base.
Newly introduced generic products with limited or no other generic competition typically garner higher prices relative to commoditized generic products. As such, our primary strategy is to compete in the generic product market with a focus on high-value, first-to-file or first-to-market opportunities, regardless of therapeutic category, and products that present significant barriers to entry for reasons such as complex formulation or regulatory or legal challenges. For additional detail, see “Our Competitive Strengths - Focus on the differentiated products of our generics business.”
At the expiration of any statutory generic exclusivity period, other generic distributors may enter the market, resulting in significant price declines. Consequently, maintaining profitable operations in generic pharmaceuticals depends, in part, on our continuing ability to select, develop, procure regulatory approvals of, overcome legal challenges to, launch and commercialize new generic products in a timely and cost efficient manner and to maintain efficient, high quality manufacturing capabilities. For additional detail, see “Our Competitive Strengths-Operational excellence.”
Branded Pharmaceuticals
Our branded pharmaceutical products compete with products manufactured by many other companies in highly competitive markets throughout the U.S. and internationally, primarily through Paladin. Competitors include many of the major brand name and generic manufacturers of pharmaceuticals. With respect to branded pharmaceuticals, our competitors, including Mylan N.V., Allergan plc (Allergan), Purdue Pharma, L.P. (Purdue), Jazz Pharmaceuticals plc (Jazz), Shire plc (Shire), Horizon Pharma plc (Horizon) and Mallinckrodt plc (Mallinckrodt), among others, vary depending on therapeutic and product category, dosage strength and drug-delivery systems.
We compete principally through targeted product development and our acquisition and in-licensing strategies. The competitive landscape in the acquisition and in-licensing of pharmaceutical products has intensified in recent years as a result of a reduction in the number of compounds available and an increase in competitors bidding on available assets. In addition to product development and acquisitions, other competitive factors in the pharmaceutical industry include product efficacy, safety, ease of use, price, demonstrated cost-effectiveness, marketing effectiveness, service, reputation and access to technical information.
7

Most new products that we introduce must compete with other products already on the market or products that are later developed by competitors. If competitors introduce new products, delivery systems or processes with therapeutic or cost advantages, our products can be subject to progressive price reductions and/or decreased volume of sales. Accordingly, the competitive environment of the branded product business requires us to continually seek out technological innovations and to market our products effectively. To successfully compete for business of managed care and pharmacy benefits management organizations, we must often demonstrate that our products offer not only medical benefits but also cost advantages as compared with other forms of care.
Some of our current branded products face competition not only from other brands, but also from generic versions. Such products include, among others, PERCOCET®, VOLTAREN® Gel, LIDODERM® and TESTIM®. Manufacturers of generic pharmaceuticals typically invest far less in R&D than research-based pharmaceutical companies and therefore can price their products significantly lower than branded products. Accordingly, when a branded product loses its market exclusivity, it normally faces intense price competition from generic forms of the product. Due to their significantly lower prices, generic versions, where available, may be substituted by pharmacies or required in preference to the branded version under third-party reimbursement programs.
In addition to those listed above, we are aware of certain competitive activities involving certain of our branded products. For a description of these competitive activities, including the litigation related to Paragraph IV Certification Notices, see Note 14. Commitments and Contingencies in the Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Part IV, Item 15 of this report "Exhibits, Financial Statement Schedules".
Seasonality
Although our business is affected by the purchasing patterns and concentration of our customers, our business is not materially impacted by seasonality.
Major Customers
We primarily sell our generic and branded pharmaceuticals to wholesalers, retail drug store chains, supermarket chains, mass merchandisers, distributors, mail order accounts, hospitals and government agencies. Our wholesalers and distributors purchase products from us and, in turn, supply products to retail drug store chains, independent pharmacies and managed health care organizations. Customers in the managed health care market include health maintenance organizations, nursing homes, hospitals, clinics, pharmacy benefit management companies and mail order customers. Total revenues from customers that accounted for 10% or more of our total consolidated revenues during the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 are as follows:

 | 2017 | | 2016 | | 2015
Cardinal Health, Inc. | 25 | % | | 26 | % | 21 | %
McKesson Corporation | 25 | % | | 27 | % | 31 | %
AmerisourceBergen Corporation | 25 | % | | 25 | % | 23 | %

Revenues from these customers are included within each of our segments.
As a result of consolidation among wholesale distributors and the growth of large retail drug store chains, a small number of large wholesale distributors control a significant share of the market, and the number of independent retail drug stores and small retail drug store chains has decreased. Some wholesale distributors have demanded that pharmaceutical manufacturers, including us, enter into distribution service agreements (DSAs) pursuant to which the wholesale distributors provide the pharmaceutical manufacturers with specific services, including the provision of periodic retail demand information and current inventory levels and other information. We have entered into certain of these agreements.

* | Our license agreements for the patents in the table above extend to or beyond the patent expiration dates.

The effect of these issued patents is that they provide us with protection by virtue of our ability to exclude others from making, using, selling, offering for sale and importing that which is covered by their claims. The coverage claimed in a patent application can be significantly reduced before the patent is issued. Accordingly, we do not know whether any of the applications we acquire or license will result in the issuance of patents, or, if any patents are issued, whether they will provide significant proprietary protection or will be challenged, circumvented or invalidated. Because unissued U.S. patent applications are maintained in secrecy for a period of eighteen months and U.S. patent applications filed prior to November 29, 2000 are not disclosed until such patents are issued, and since publication of discoveries in the scientific or patent literature often lags behind actual discoveries, we cannot be certain of the priority of inventions covered by pending patent applications. Moreover, we may have to participate in interference and other inter parties proceedings declared by the PTO to determine priority of invention, or in opposition proceedings in a foreign patent office, either of which could result in substantial cost to us, even if the eventual outcome is favorable to us. There can be no assurance that any patents, if issued, will be held valid by a court of competent jurisdiction. An adverse outcome could subject us to significant liabilities to third parties, require disputed rights to be licensed from third parties or require us to cease using such technology.
We believe that our patents, the protection of discoveries in connection with our development activities, our proprietary products, technologies, processes and know-how and all of our intellectual property are important to our business. Many of our products, including certain of our generic products, are sold under trademarks. To achieve a competitive position, we rely on trade secrets, non-patented proprietary know-how and continuing technological innovation, where patent protection is not believed to be appropriate or attainable. In addition, as outlined above, we have a number of patent licenses from third parties, some of which may be important to our business. See Note 11. License and Collaboration Agreements in the Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Part IV, Item 15 of this report "Exhibits, Financial Statement Schedules". There can be no assurance that any of our patents, licenses or other intellectual property rights will afford us any protection from competition.
We rely on confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants and other parties to protect, among other things, trade secrets and other proprietary technology. There can be no assurance that these agreements will not be breached, that we will have adequate remedies for any breach, that others will not independently develop equivalent proprietary information or that other third parties will not otherwise gain access to our trade secrets and other intellectual property.

We may find it necessary to initiate litigation to enforce our patent rights, to protect our intellectual property or trade secrets or to determine the scope and validity of the proprietary rights of others. Litigation is costly and time-consuming, and there can be no assurance that our litigation expenses will not be significant in the future or that we will prevail in any such litigation. See Note 14. Commitments and Contingencies in the Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Part IV, Item 15 of this report "Exhibits, Financial Statement Schedules".
Governmental Regulation
United States Food and Drug Administration and Drug Enforcement Administration
The pharmaceutical industry in the U.S. is subject to extensive and rigorous government regulation. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA), the Controlled Substances Act (CSA) and other federal and state statutes and regulations govern or influence the testing, manufacturing, packaging, labeling, storage, record keeping, approval, advertising, promotion, sale and distribution of pharmaceutical products. Noncompliance with applicable requirements can result in fines, recall or seizure of products, total or partial suspension of production and/or distribution, injunctions, refusal of the government to enter into supply contracts or to approve NDAs, ANDAs and Biologics License Applications (BLAs), civil penalties and criminal prosecution.
FDA approval is typically required before any new drug can be marketed. An NDA or BLA is a filing submitted to the FDA to obtain approval of new chemical entities and other innovations for which thorough applied research is required to demonstrate safety and effectiveness in use. The process generally involves:

• | Completion of preclinical laboratory and animal testing and formulation studies in compliance with the FDA’s Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) regulations;


• | Submission to the FDA of an Investigational New Drug (IND) application for human clinical testing, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin in the U.S.;


• | Approval by an independent institutional review board (IRB) before each trial may be initiated, and continuing review during the trial;


• | Performance of human clinical trials, including adequate and well-controlled clinical trials in accordance with good clinical practices (GCPs) to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug product for each intended use;


• | Submission of an NDA or BLA to the FDA;


• | Satisfactory completion of an FDA pre-approval inspection of the product’s manufacturing processes and facility or facilities to assess compliance with the FDA’s current Good Manufacturing Practice (cGMP) regulations, and/or review of the Chemistry, Manufacturing and Controls (CMC) section of the NDA or BLA to require that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the drug’s identity, strength, quality, purity and potency;


• | Satisfactory completion of an FDA advisory committee review, if applicable; and


• | Approval by the FDA of the NDA or BLA.

Clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases, although the phases may overlap.

• | Phase 1 trials generally involve testing the product for safety, adverse effects, dosage, tolerance, absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion and other elements of clinical pharmacology.


• | Phase 2 trials typically involve a small sample of the intended patient population to assess the efficacy of the compound for a specific indication, to determine dose tolerance and the optimal dose range as well as to gather additional information relating to safety and potential adverse effects.


• | Phase 3 trials are undertaken in an expanded patient population at typically dispersed study sites, in order to determine the overall risk-benefit ratio of the compound and to provide an adequate basis for product labeling.

Each trial is conducted in accordance with certain standards under protocols that detail the objectives of the study, the parameters to be used to monitor safety and efficacy criteria to be evaluated. Each protocol must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND.
Data from preclinical testing and clinical trials are submitted to the FDA in an NDA or BLA for marketing approval and to foreign government health authorities in a marketing authorization application, consistent with each health authority’s specific regulatory requirements. Clinical trials are also subject to regulatory inspections by the FDA and other regulatory authorities to confirm compliance with applicable regulatory standards. The process of completing clinical trials for a new drug may take many years and require the expenditures of substantial resources. See Item 1A. Risk Factors - “The pharmaceutical industry is heavily regulated, which creates uncertainty about our ability to bring new products to market and imposes substantial compliance costs on our business” for further discussion on FDA approval. As a condition of approval, the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities may require further studies, including Phase 4 post-marketing studies or post-marketing data reporting. Results of post-marketing programs may limit or expand the further marketing of the products.
10

For some drugs, the FDA may require a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) to confirm a drug’s benefits outweigh its risks. REMS could include medication guides, physician communication plans or other elements. See Item 1A. Risk Factors - “The pharmaceutical industry is heavily regulated, which creates uncertainty about our ability to bring new products to market and imposes substantial compliance costs on our business” for further discussion, including examples of products sold by us that have been impacted by REMS.
In most instances, FDA approval of an ANDA is required before a generic equivalent of an existing or reference-listed drug can be marketed. The ANDA process is abbreviated in that the FDA waives the requirement of conducting complete preclinical and clinical studies and generally instead relies principally on bioequivalence studies. Bioequivalence generally involves a comparison of the rate of absorption and levels of concentration of a generic drug in the body with those of the previously approved drug. When the rate and extent of absorption of systemically acting test and reference drugs are considered the same under the bioequivalence requirement, the two drugs are considered bioequivalent and are generally regarded as therapeutically equivalent, meaning that a pharmacist can substitute the product for the reference-listed drug. Under certain circumstances, an ANDA may also be submitted for a product authorized by approval of an ANDA suitability petition. Such petitions may be submitted to secure authorization to file an ANDA for a product that differs from a previously approved drug in active ingredient, route of administration, dosage form or strength. In September 2007 and July 2012, Congress re-authorized pediatric testing legislation, which now requires ANDAs approved via the suitability petition route to conduct pediatric testing. The timing of final FDA approval of ANDA applications depends on a variety of factors, including whether the applicant challenges any listed patents for the drug and whether the manufacturer of the reference listed drug is entitled to one or more statutory exclusivity periods, during which the FDA is prohibited from approving generic products. In certain circumstances, a regulatory exclusivity period can extend beyond the life of a patent, and thus block ANDAs from being approved until after the patent expiration date.
Certain of our products are or could become regulated and marketed as biologic products pursuant to BLAs. Our BLA-licensed products were licensed based on a determination by the FDA of safety, purity and potency as required under the Public Health Service Act (PHSA). Although the ANDA framework referenced above does not apply to generics of BLA-licensed biologics, there is an abbreviated licensure pathway for products deemed to be biosimilar to, or interchangeable with, FDA-licensed reference biological products pursuant to the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 (BPCIA). Under the BPCIA, following the expiration of a 12-year reference exclusivity period, the FDA may license, under section 351(k) of the PHSA, a biologic that it determines is biosimilar to, or interchangeable with, a reference product licensed under section 351(a) of the PHSA. Biosimilarity is defined to mean that the section 351(k) product is highly similar to the reference product, notwithstanding minor differences in clinically inactive components, and that there are no clinically meaningful differences between the section 351(k) product and the reference product in terms of the safety, purity and potency. To be considered interchangeable, a product must be biosimilar to the reference product, be expected to produce the same clinical result as the reference product in any given patient and, if administered more than once to an individual, the risks in terms of safety or diminished efficacy of alternating or switching between use of the product and its reference product is not greater than the risk of using the reference product without such alternation or switch.
Once any regulatory exclusivity period for our BLA-licensed biologics expires, the FDA may approve another company’s BLA for a biosimilar or interchangeable version of our product. Although licensure of a biosimilar or interchangeable product is generally expected to require less than the full complement of product-specific preclinical and clinical data required for innovator products, the FDA has considerable discretion over the kind and amount of scientific evidence required to demonstrate biosimilarity and interchangeability.
Based on scientific developments, post-market experience or other legislative or regulatory changes, the current FDA standards of review for approving new pharmaceutical products are sometimes more stringent than those that were applied in the past, including for certain opioid products. As a result, the FDA does not have safety databases on these products that are as extensive as some products developed more recently. Accordingly, we believe the FDA has expressed an intention to develop such databases for certain of these products, including many opioids.
The 21st Century Cures Act (Cures Act) was signed into law on December 13, 2016. The Cures Act includes various provisions to accelerate the development and delivery of new treatments, such as those intended to expand the types of evidence manufacturers may submit to support FDA drug approval, to encourage patient-centered drug development, to liberalize the communication of healthcare economic information (HCEI) to payers and to create greater transparency with regard to manufacturer expanded access programs. Central to the Cures Act are provisions that enhance and accelerate the FDA’s processes for reviewing and approving new drugs and supplements to approved NDAs. These include, but are not limited to, provisions that (i) require the FDA to establish a program to evaluate the potential use of real world evidence to help to support the approval of a new indication for an approved drug and to help to support or satisfy post-approval study requirements, (ii) provide that the FDA may rely upon qualified data summaries to support the approval of a supplemental application with respect to a qualified indication for an already approved drug, (iii) require the FDA to issue guidance for purposes of assisting sponsors in incorporating complex adaptive and other novel trial designs into proposed clinical protocols and applications for new drugs and (iv) require the FDA to establish a process for the qualification of drug development tools for use in supporting or obtaining FDA approval for or investigational use of a drug.
11

The Cures Act also includes $1 billion in new funding to address what the act refers to as the “opioid abuse crisis.” Specifically, the Cures Act authorizes the awarding of grants to states for the purpose of addressing opioid abuse within each state, with preference to be given to states with an incidence or prevalence of opioid use disorders that is substantially higher relative to other states. Funding would be provided for states to supplement opioid abuse prevention and treatment activities, such as improving prescription drug monitoring programs, implementing prevention activities, providing training for health care providers and expanding access to opioid treatment programs. States receiving such grants would be required to report on activities funded by the grant in the substance abuse block grant report.
We cannot determine what effect changes in the FDA’s laws or regulations (including legal or regulator interpretations), when and if promulgated, or upcoming advisory committee meetings may have on our business in the future. Changes could, among other things, require expanded or different labeling, additional testing, the recall or discontinuance of certain products and additional record keeping. Such changes could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. See Item 1A. Risk Factors - “The pharmaceutical industry is heavily regulated, which creates uncertainty about our ability to bring new products to market and imposes substantial compliance costs on our business” for further discussion. 
In September 2013, the FDA announced class-wide safety labeling changes and new post-market study requirements for all extended-release and long-acting (ER/LA) opioids. Among other things, the updated indication states that, because of the risks of addiction, abuse and misuse, even at recommended doses, and because of the greater risks of overdose and death, these drugs should be reserved for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options are ineffective, not tolerated or would be otherwise inadequate to provide sufficient management of pain; ER/LA opioid analgesics are not indicated for as-needed pain relief. The FDA is also requiring drug companies that make these products to conduct further studies and clinical trials to further assess the known serious risks of misuse, abuse, increased sensitivity to pain (hyperalgesia), addiction, overdose and death. It is not presently known what impact, if any, these changes to the indications for use or results from the post-marketing studies may have on our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows.
A sponsor of an NDA is required to identify, in its application, any patent that claims the drug or a use of the drug subject to the application. Upon NDA approval, the FDA lists these patents in a publication referred to as the Orange Book. Any person that files an NDA under Section 505(b)(2) of the FFDCA must make a certification in respect to listed patents, the type of NDA that may rely upon the data in the application for which the patents are listed or an ANDA to secure approval of a generic version of this first, or listed drug. The FDA may not approve such an application for the drug until expiration of the listed patents unless (i) the generic applicant certifies that the listed patents are invalid, unenforceable or not infringed by the proposed generic drug and gives notice to the holder of the NDA for the listed drug of the basis upon which the patents are challenged and (ii) the holder of the listed drug does not sue the later applicant for patent infringement within 45 days of receipt of notice. Under the current law, if an infringement suit is filed, the FDA may not approve the later application until the earliest of: (i) 30 months after submission, (ii) entry of an appellate court judgment holding the patent invalid, unenforceable or not infringed, (iii) such time as the court may order or (iv) expiration of the patent.
One of the key motivators for challenging patents is the 180-day marketing exclusivity period granted to the developer of a generic version of a product that is the first to have its ANDA accepted for filing by the FDA and whose filing includes a certification that the applicable patent(s) are invalid, unenforceable and/or not infringed (a Paragraph IV certification) and that otherwise does not forfeit eligibility for the exclusivity. Under the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 (2003 Medicare Act), with accompanying amendments to the Hatch-Waxman Act (Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act), this marketing exclusivity would begin to run upon the earlier of the commercial launch of the generic product or upon an appellate court decision in the generic company’s favor or in favor of another ANDA applicant who had filed with a Paragraph IV certification and has tentative approval. In addition, the holder of the NDA for the listed drug may be entitled to certain non-patent exclusivity during which the FDA cannot approve an application for a competing generic product or 505(b)(2) NDA product.
The FDA also regulates pharmacies and outsourcing facilities that prepare “compounded” drugs pursuant to section 503A and 503B of the FFDCA, respectively. For instance, pharmacies may compound drugs for an identified individual based on the receipt of a valid prescription order, or notation approved by the prescribing practitioner, that a compounded product is necessary for the identified patient. Similarly, outsourcing facilities may compound drugs and sell them to healthcare providers, but not wholesalers or distributors. Although section 503A pharmacies and section 503B outsourcing facilities are subject to many regulatory requirements, compounded drugs are not subject to premarket review by FDA and, therefore, may not have the same level of safety and efficacy assurances of drugs subject to premarket review and approval by the FDA. Because they are not subject to premarket review, compounded drugs are frequently lower cost than either branded or generic drug products.
The FDA enforces regulations to require that the methods used in, and the facilities and controls used for, the manufacture, processing, packing and holding of drugs conform to cGMPs. The cGMP regulations the FDA enforces are comprehensive and cover all aspects of manufacturing operations. Compliance with the regulations requires a continuous commitment of time, money and effort in all operational areas.
12

The FDA conducts pre-approval inspections of facilities engaged in the development, manufacture, processing, packing, testing and holding of the drugs subject to NDAs and ANDAs. In addition, manufacturers of both pharmaceutical products and active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) used to formulate the drug also ordinarily undergo a pre-approval inspection. Failure of any facility to pass a pre-approval inspection will result in delayed approval and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
The FDA also conducts periodic inspections of drug facilities to assess the cGMP status of marketed products. Following such inspections, the FDA may issue an untitled letter as an initial correspondence that cites violations that do not meet the threshold of regulatory significance for a Warning Letter. FDA guidelines also provide for the issuance of Warning Letters for violations of “regulatory significance” for which the failure to adequately and promptly achieve correction may be expected to result in an enforcement action. Finally, the FDA could issue a Form 483 Notice of Inspectional Observations, which could cause us to modify certain activities identified during the inspection. If the FDA were to find serious cGMP non-compliance during such an inspection, it could take regulatory actions that could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Imported API and other components needed to manufacture our products could be rejected by U.S. Customs. In respect to domestic establishments, the FDA could initiate product seizures or request, or in some instances require, product recalls and seek to enjoin or otherwise limit a product’s manufacture and distribution. In certain circumstances, violations could support civil penalties and criminal prosecutions. In addition, if the FDA concludes that a company is not in compliance with cGMP requirements, sanctions may be imposed that include preventing that company from receiving the necessary licenses to export its products and classifying that company as an unacceptable supplier, thereby disqualifying that company from selling products to federal agencies.
Certain of our subsidiaries sell products that are “controlled substances” as defined in the CSA and implementing regulations, which establish certain security and record keeping requirements administered by the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA). The DEA regulates controlled substances as Schedule I, II, III, IV or V substances, with Schedule I and II substances considered to present the highest risk of substance abuse and Schedule V substances the lowest risk. The active ingredients in some of our products are listed by the DEA as Schedule II or III substances under the CSA. Consequently, their manufacture, shipment, storage, sale and use are subject to a high degree of regulation.
The DEA limits the availability of the active ingredients that are subject to the CSA used in several of our products as well as the production of these products. We or our contract manufacturing organizations must annually apply to the DEA for procurement and production quotas in order to obtain and produce these substances. As a result, our quotas may not be sufficient to meet commercial demand or complete clinical trials. Moreover, the DEA may adjust these quotas from time to time during the year, although the DEA has substantial discretion in whether or not to make such adjustments. See Item 1A. Risk Factors - “The DEA limits the availability of the active ingredients used in many of our products as well as the production of these products, and, as a result, our procurement and production quotas may not be sufficient to meet commercial demand or complete clinical trials” for further discussion on DEA regulations. To meet its responsibilities, the DEA conducts periodic inspections of registered establishments that handle controlled substances. Annual registration is required for any facility that manufactures, tests, distributes, dispenses, imports or exports any controlled substance. The facilities must have the security, control and accounting mechanisms required by the DEA to prevent loss and diversion of controlled substances. Failure to maintain compliance can result in enforcement action that could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. The DEA may seek civil penalties, refuse to renew necessary registrations, or initiate proceedings to revoke or restrict those registrations. In certain circumstances, violations could result in criminal proceedings.
Individual states also regulate controlled substances and we, as well as our third-party API suppliers and manufacturers, are subject to such regulation by several states with respect to the manufacture and distribution of these products.
Government Benefit Programs
As described further in Item 1A. Risk Factors, statutory and regulatory requirements for government healthcare programs such as Medicaid, Medicare and TRICARE govern access and provider reimbursement levels, and provide for other cost-containment measures such as requiring pharmaceutical companies to pay rebates or refunds for certain sales of products reimbursed by such programs, or subjecting sales of their products to certain price ceilings. In addition to the cost-containment measures described in Item 1A. Risk Factors, drug sales to retail pharmacies under the TRICARE Retail Pharmacy Program are subject to certain price ceilings which require manufacturers to, among other things, pay refunds for prescriptions filled based on the applicable ceiling price limits. Beginning in the first quarter of 2017, pursuant to the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015, drug manufacturers are required to pay additional rebates to state Medicaid programs if the prices of their non-innovator drugs rise at a rate faster than inflation (as continues to be the case for innovator products).
13

The federal government may continue to pursue legislation aimed at containing or reducing payment levels for prescription pharmaceuticals paid for in whole or in part with government funds. As is the case in California and Nevada, the state governments also may continue to enact similar cost containment or transparency legislation. We cannot predict the nature of these or other such measures or their impact on our profitability and cash flows. These efforts could, however, have material consequences for the pharmaceutical industry and the Company.
From time to time, legislative changes are made to government healthcare programs that impact our business. Congress continues to examine various Medicare and Medicaid policy proposals that may result in a downward pressure on the prices of prescription drugs in these programs. See Item 1A. Risk Factors - “The availability of third party reimbursement for our products is uncertain, and thus we may find it difficult to maintain current price levels. Additionally, the market may not accept those products for which third party reimbursement is not adequately provided” for further discussion on Medicare and Medicaid reimbursements.
Under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA), pharmaceutical manufacturers of branded prescription drugs must pay an annual fee to the federal government. Each individual pharmaceutical manufacturer must pay a prorated share of the total industry fee (the fee was $3 billion for 2016 and is $4 billion for 2017, $4.1 billion for 2018 and $2.8 billion for years thereafter) based on the dollar value of its branded prescription drug sales to specified federal programs. PPACA also expanded health insurance coverage to many previously uninsured Americans, through a combination of federal subsidies for lower-income individuals who enrolled in health plans through health insurance exchanges and enabling states to expand Medicaid eligibility with the federal government paying a high share of the cost.
Following the November 2016 U.S. elections, uncertainty continues to exist about the future of federal subsidies and of insurance coverage expansion; the current administration and congressional leaders continue to express interest in repealing these PPACA provisions and replacing them with alternatives that may be less costly and provide state Medicaid programs and private health plans more flexibility. The recent U.S. tax reform legislation enacted by Congress and signed into law by President Trump, The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, repealed the requirement that individuals maintain health insurance coverage or face a penalty (known as the “individual mandate”). The removal of this provision, coupled with the threat of the repeal of other PPACA provisions, threaten the stability of the insurance marketplace and may have consequences for the coverage and accessibility of prescription drugs.
Healthcare Fraud and Abuse Laws
We are subject to various federal, state and local laws targeting fraud and abuse in the healthcare industry, violations of which can lead to civil and criminal penalties, including fines, imprisonment and exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs. These laws are potentially applicable to us as both a manufacturer and a supplier of products reimbursed by federal healthcare programs, and they also apply to hospitals, physicians and other potential purchasers of our products.
The federal Anti-Kickback Statute (42 U.S.C. § 1320a-7b(b)) prohibits persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, to induce either the referral of an individual, or the furnishing, recommending, or arranging for a good or service, for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Remuneration is not defined in the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value, including for example, gifts, discounts, coupons, the furnishing of supplies or equipment, credit arrangements, payments of cash, waivers of payments, ownership interests and providing anything at less than its fair market value. Under the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and the applicable criminal healthcare fraud statutes contained within 42 U.S.C. § 1320a-7b, a person or entity need not have actual knowledge of this statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. In addition, the government may assert that a claim, including items or services resulting from a violation of 42 U.S.C. § 1320a-7b, constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the civil False Claims Act (discussed below) or the civil monetary penalties statute, which imposes fines against any person who is determined to have presented or caused to be presented claims to a federal healthcare program that the person knows or should know is for an item or service that was not provided as claimed or is false or fraudulent. The federal Anti-Kickback Statute and implementing regulations provide for certain exceptions for “safe harbors” for certain discounting, rebating or personal services arrangements, among other things. However, the lack of uniform court interpretation of the Anti-Kickback Statute makes compliance with the law difficult. Violations of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute can result in significant criminal fines, exclusion from participation in Medicare and Medicaid and follow-on civil litigation, among other things, for both entities and individuals.
Other federal healthcare fraud-related laws also provide criminal liability for violations. The Criminal Healthcare Fraud statute, 18 U.S.C. § 1347 prohibits knowingly and willfully executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payers. Federal criminal law at 18 U.S.C. § 1001, among other sections, prohibits knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. See Item 1A. Risk Factors - “We are subject to various regulations pertaining to the marketing of our products and services” for further discussion on the Anti-Kickback Statute.
14

The civil False Claims Act and similar state laws impose liability on any person or entity who, among other things, knowingly presents, or causes to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment by a federal healthcare program. The qui tam provisions of the False Claims Act and similar state laws allow a private individual to bring civil actions on behalf of the federal or state government and to share in any monetary recovery. The Federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act and similar state laws impose reporting requirements for various types of payments to physicians and teaching hospitals. Failure to comply with required reporting requirements under these laws could subject manufacturers and others to substantial civil money penalties. In addition, government entities and private litigants have asserted claims under state consumer protection statutes against pharmaceutical and medical device companies for alleged false or misleading statements in connection with the marketing, promotion and/or sale of pharmaceutical and medical device products, including state investigations of the Company regarding the Company’s vaginal mesh devices and investigations and litigation by certain government entities regarding the Company’s marketing of opioid products.
International Regulations
Through our international operations, the Company is subject to laws and regulations that differ from those under which the Company operates in the U.S. In most cases, non-U.S. regulatory agencies evaluate and monitor the safety, efficacy and quality of pharmaceutical products, govern the approval of clinical trials and product registrations and regulate pricing and reimbursement. Certain international markets have differing product preferences and requirements and operate in an environment of government-mandated, cost-containment programs, including price controls. Certain governments have placed restrictions on physician prescription levels and patient reimbursements, emphasized greater use of generic drugs and enacted across-the-board price cuts as methods of cost control.
Whether or not FDA approval has been obtained for a product, approval of the product by comparable regulatory authorities of other governments must be obtained prior to marketing the product in those jurisdictions. The approval process may be more or less rigorous than the U.S. process and the time required for approval may be longer or shorter than is required in the U.S.
Service Agreements
We contract with various third parties to provide certain critical services including manufacturing, supply, warehousing, distribution, customer service, certain financial functions, certain research and development activities and medical affairs.
For a complete description of our significant manufacturing, supply and other service agreements, see Note 11. License and Collaboration Agreements and Note 14. Commitments and Contingencies in the Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Part IV, Item 15 of this report "Exhibits, Financial Statement Schedules".
We primarily purchase our raw materials for the production and development of our products in the open market from third party suppliers. However, some raw materials are only available from one source. We attempt, when possible, to mitigate our raw material supply risks through inventory management and alternative sourcing strategies. We are required to identify the suppliers of all raw materials for our products in the drug applications that we file with the FDA. If the raw materials from an approved supplier for a particular product become unavailable, we would be required to qualify a substitute supplier with the FDA, which would likely interrupt manufacturing of the affected product. See Item 1A. Risk Factors for further discussion on the risks associated with the sourcing of our raw materials.
License & Collaboration Agreements and Acquisitions
We continue to seek to enhance our product line and develop a balanced portfolio of differentiated products through product acquisitions and in-licensing, or acquiring licenses to products, compounds and technologies from third parties. The Company enters into strategic alliances and collaborative arrangements with third parties, which give the Company rights to develop, manufacture, market and/or sell pharmaceutical products, the rights to which are primarily owned by these third parties. These alliances and arrangements can take many forms, including licensing arrangements, co-development and co-marketing agreements, co-promotion arrangements, research collaborations and joint ventures. Such alliances and arrangements enable us to share the risk of incurring all research and development expenses that do not lead to revenue-generating products; however, because profits from alliance products are shared with the counter-parties to the collaborative arrangement, the gross margins on alliance products are generally lower, sometimes substantially so, than the gross margins that could be achieved had the Company not opted for a development partner. For a discussion of material agreements and acquisitions, including agreement terms and status, see our disclosures in Note 5. Acquisitions and Note 11. License and Collaboration Agreements in the Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Part IV, Item 15 of this report "Exhibits, Financial Statement Schedules".

Environmental Matters
Our operations are subject to substantial federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations concerning, among other matters, the generation, handling, storage, transportation, treatment and disposal of, and exposure to, hazardous substances. Violation of these laws and regulations, which frequently change, can lead to substantial fines and penalties. Many of our operations require environmental permits and controls to prevent and limit pollution of the environment. We believe that our facilities and the facilities of our third party service providers are in substantial compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations and we do not believe that future compliance will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.

As of February 20, 2018, we have 3,039 employees, of which 484 are engaged in research and development and regulatory work, 398 in sales and marketing, 1,087 in manufacturing, 558 in quality assurance and 512 in general and administrative capacities.
