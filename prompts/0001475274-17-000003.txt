Item 1. Business.
Company Overview
We operate a leading savings destination, connecting consumers with retailers, restaurants and brands, both online and in-store. In 2016, our marketplace featured more than 700,000 digital offers each month. Digital offers are offers, offer codes and brand or category specific discounts made available online or through mobile applications that are used by consumers to make online or in-store purchases directly from merchants. We define merchants to include retailers, restaurants and brands, but excluding grocery retailers. Digital offers can include coupons, sales, consumer tips, advertisements, discounted digital and physical gift cards redeemable at merchants or cash-back rebates associated with the purchase of a product or a consumer action. Our websites, mobile applications, email newsletters and alerts and social media presence enable consumers to search for, discover and redeem hundreds of thousands of relevant digital offers from paid merchants, or merchants with which we had a contract in 2016. Our marketplace features digital offers across multiple product categories, including clothing; electronics; health and beauty; home and office; travel, dining and entertainment; personal and business services; and shoes. We believe our investments in digital offer content quality, product innovation and direct merchant relationships allow us to offer a compelling experience to consumers looking to save money.
We believe we are a trusted partner to paid merchants. We provide our paid merchants access to a large and engaged consumer audience. We help paid merchants drive sales and acquire new customers online and in-store through our websites and mobile applications. In addition, our pay-for-performance model, from which a substantial majority of our revenues are derived, enables us to structure mutually beneficial relationships with our paid merchants. These arrangements provide our paid merchants control and flexibility with respect to their marketing spend and, in many cases, result in payment of a commission to us only after a sale is made. We also enter into additional types of arrangements with our paid merchants, including flat fee arrangements and CPM, or cost per thousand impression, arrangements. 
Our results from 2016 include the following:

• | Net revenues for 2016 were $280.4 million, an increase of 12.6% from $249.1 million in 2015. This increase is primarily attributable to a $43.5 million increase in net revenues from our Gift Card segment, offset by a $12.2 million decrease in net revenues from our Core segment.


• | Net income for 2016 was $2.0 million, an 83.4% decrease from $11.8 million in 2015. The decrease in net income is primarily attributable to the $12.2 million decrease in net revenues from our Core segment and the investments being made to grow our in-store and advertising business and scale our gift card business.


• | Adjusted EBITDA for 2016 was $61.3 million, a 14.8% decrease from $71.9 million in 2015.


• | Total visits to our desktop and mobile websites for 2016 were approximately 650 million, a 9.5% decrease from 718 million visits in 2015. Visits to our mobile websites represented approximately 46% and 41%, respectively, of the total visits to our websites in 2016 and 2015.


• | During the three months ended December 31, 2016, we averaged approximately 23.1 million mobile unique visitors per month, essentially flat to the approximately 23.2 million mobile unique visitors per month during the three months ended December 31, 2015.

Our Strategy
Our objective is to become the leading savings destination, both online and in-store. Our 2017 strategies to achieve this goal include:
Enhance the ease of use of our marketplace. Innovation is a key element of our strategy, and we will continue to make significant investments in research and development to further improve our user interface, solution and platform integration, features and functionality on our desktop and mobile websites and mobile applications, as well as our data collection and analytic capabilities. 
Increase the likelihood that a consumer will save each time they visit. We intend to make it easier for consumers to save each time they visit our marketplace. We expect to accomplish this principally by adding cash-back rebates to incentivize consumers to transact with merchants and increasing the selection and inventory of discounted digital and physical gift cards for purchase at leading paid merchants We also plan to make other enhancements to our websites and mobile applications, including efforts to minimize friction in consumers’ shopping experience with digital offers from start to finish and providing our paid merchants with solutions that increase consumer sales. In 2016, we acquired GiftcardZen Inc, a secondary marketplace for gift cards. This acquisition has significantly expanded the discounted digital and physical gift card content available to the users of our RetailMeNot.com website and mobile application. We believe that discounted gift cards and cash-back rebates are differentiated content that will delight consumers by offering new savings opportunities. This in turn, should increase the frequency with which consumers use our marketplace and may enhance our value to consumers during more stages of their shopping journey.
Enhance the breadth of available offers. We intend to continue to expand our offering of cash-back rebates and loyalty programs to incentivize consumers to transact with our paid merchants. We believe that this differentiated content will delight consumers by offering new savings opportunities. This in turn, should increase the frequency with which consumers use our solutions and improve monetization of those solutions. Cash-back rebates also enhance the value of our marketplace to our paid merchants by allowing them to more efficiently target their promotions.
Leverage our consumer audience to expand advertising reach for our paid merchants. We also aim to further strengthen our value proposition for paid merchants by expanding our advertising solutions. We continue to enhance the technology powering our advertising solutions, improving our ability to serve targeted advertising to visitors to our websites and users of our mobile applications. We also plan to continue to leverage our sales force to expand the breadth and depth of merchants utilizing our advertising products.
Pursue strategic acquisitions. We intend to continue pursuing expansion opportunities in existing and new markets, as well as in core and adjacent categories and complementary technology through strategic acquisitions.
Our Products and Services
We operate a leading savings destination, both online and in-store. We offer products and services to allow consumers to save money and for paid merchants to generate sales. 
Products and Services for Consumers
Our product development approach is centered on building products that enable consumers to discover quality digital offers, virtually anytime and anywhere, and redeem them online or in-store. Our products and services for consumers are free of charge and available through our websites and mobile applications.
Websites. We offer our consumers hundreds of thousands of digital offers from tens of thousands of merchants across multiple product categories. We aggregate digital offers available from paid merchants, performance marketing networks, our large user community, our employees and outsourced providers, including digital offers exclusive to our marketplace. In 2016, more than two-thirds of the digital offers featured in our marketplace were submitted by users or sourced internally by us. The remainder of the digital offers featured in our marketplace were provided through performance marketing networks. In the year ended December 31, 2016, our marketplace featured digital offers from over 70,000 merchants, and we had contracts with more than 12,000 paid merchants.

Consumers visiting our websites search for and discover digital offers based on retailer name, product, category, digital offer type, popularity, success rate and other characteristics. Once a consumer discovers a relevant online digital offer, the consumer clicks on that digital offer and is typically directed to the website of the merchant, where the consumer can purchase products and redeem the digital offer. Consumers can redeem these digital offers in-store by simply scanning the barcode at the merchant’s register or by having the sales associate enter the promotional code shown on the consumer’s mobile screen into their point-of-sale system. Additionally, consumers can purchase discounted digital and physical gift cards directly from us via our RetailMeNot.com and GiftcardZen.com websites.
Mobile applications. Our mobile applications allow consumers to shop when they want, where they want. Consumers use our mobile applications to discover, store for use later and access the digital offers they want and to redeem them both online and in-store. They can browse top digital offers, popular stores and product category listings. Our mobile applications also allow users to share digital offers with others via email, text message or through social media channels. Consumers are able to discover food and dining content, store their coupons and gift cards in a centralized mobile wallet, and visually navigate deals from stores at their local malls. In addition, utilizing location-based technology, the RetailMeNot mobile applications notify consumers of savings opportunities when they are shopping near shopping malls and centers by sending consumers alerts for digital offers that can be used in these locations. Once a consumer discovers a relevant online digital offer, the consumer clicks on that digital offer and is typically directed to the website of the respective retailer, where the consumer can purchase products and redeem the digital offer. Consumers also can redeem certain of these digital offers in-store by simply scanning the barcode at the retailer’s register or by having the sales associate enter the promotional code shown on the consumer’s mobile screen into their point-of-sale system. Additionally, consumers can purchase discounted digital gift cards directly from us via our RetailMeNot mobile applications.
Email newsletters and alerts. Consumers can subscribe to receive our periodic email newsletters and alerts. Our email newsletters allow consumers to stay informed about featured digital offers, while our alerts notify consumers when digital offers from their preferred merchants become available.


• | Email newsletters: Our newsletters are sent several times a week and typically include the top digital offers for featured merchants. A portion of these newsletters feature digital offers that are targeted to our consumers based on their past activity on our websites, their affinity for certain merchants or certain types of shopping categories and other proprietary data about the user.


• | Alerts: Our alerts provide consumers with new digital offers for their favorite merchants as they become available.

Products and Services for Paid Merchants
We provide paid merchants with access to a large and engaged consumer audience.
Multichannel access to a large consumer audience. We provide paid merchants access to a large marketplace dedicated to digital offers, offering a large and engaged audience of consumers with intent to purchase. In 2016, we had more than 650 million visits to our websites and during the three month period ending December 31, 2016, averaged approximately 23.1 million mobile unique visitors each month. We also had approximately 53.6 million email subscribers as of December 31, 2016. 
Paid merchants can access new consumers through multiple channels online on our websites and mobile applications, by email newsletters and alerts and our social media presence, and in-store by displaying a digital offer on a mobile device or presenting a printed offer. We allow merchants to provide consistent digital offers across these multiple channels. Additionally, we offer a wide range of digital offer types for merchants to help drive their desired outcomes. For example, in 2016 we expanded our cash-back rebates onto certain of our websites and mobile applications. We believe this digital offer type appeals both to our traditional retail partners as well as to brands because it allows them to provide discounts directly to consumers that are not specific to a particular retailer. We believe this content type also appeals to merchants that do not traditionally use coupons and with which we did not traditionally have a paid relationship. The variety of solutions available in our marketplace, in our view, provides merchants with a differentiated platform to drive brand recognition and sales. 
Advertising. We provide our paid merchants with a variety of advertising opportunities to increase the impact of their digital offer campaigns. Our most common advertising opportunities include prominent placement within the top digital offer listings of our homepage, our category pages, our email newsletter, solo retailer newsletter campaigns and on the landing page of our mobile websites and applications. We also offer digital circulars and product showcases, which provide our paid merchants the opportunity to display digital offers with brand imagery through our websites and mobile applications. We are able to assist our paid merchants in identifying users likely to engage with their digital offers through analysis of the data we 
3

collect related to our users’ preferences and shopping habits. We typically charge a flat fee for these advertising opportunities on a campaign basis for a given period of time. Advertising rates may vary depending upon the distribution channel, seasonality, placement prominence, traffic and the length of time a paid merchant runs an advertisement through our marketplace.
Our Websites, Mobile Applications and Brands
We operate a portfolio of digital offer websites and mobile applications that span multiple geographic locations and languages. We acquired the majority of the websites we operate today and have typically maintained the brand name we acquired in each local market given the brand awareness of each website created prior to our acquisition. Each of these websites and mobile applications provides the same core set of solutions: consumers use these websites and mobile applications at no charge to search for and discover digital offers they can redeem online or in-store with leading paid merchants, as well as purchase discounted digital and physical gift cards.
In 2016, our primary websites and mobile applications included:

In December 2016 we decided to no longer support certain of our European websites, including Actiepagina.nl, RetailMeNot.de, RetailMeNot.es, RetailMeNot.it and RetailMeNot.pl, in order to focus on the other geographies that our websites and mobile applications serve.
Technology and Infrastructure
Product development and innovation are core pillars of our strategy. Our product team works to regularly deliver innovative products and features in an effort to provide the best possible consumer experience and drive sales for paid merchants. The responsibilities of our product team span the lifecycle of identifying consumer and paid merchant needs, defining and designing products, testing, developing go-to-market strategies, and measuring the performance of new products and features. The team is focused on enhancing our core solutions, optimizing the user experience for consumers, and building better business results for our paid merchants. We provide our online and mobile solutions using a combination of in-house and third-party technology solutions and products.
We have developed proprietary systems architecture for use in creating, maintaining and operating our websites and mobile applications. This technology consists of internal development by our staff of designers and engineers and makes use of software acquired or licensed from outside developers and companies. Our systems are designed to serve consumers and our paid merchants’ operations teams in an automated and scalable fashion. Our software is comprised of four major areas:

• | public facing websites and mobile applications;


• | content quality management systems;


• | data management and reporting; and


• | infrastructure tools.

As of December 31, 2016, our websites and mobile applications are hosted in the U.S., U.K., France, Ireland and the Netherlands using a combination of third-party co-location hosting centers and cloud-based hosting services. Our systems architecture has been designed to manage increases in traffic on our websites and mobile applications through the addition of server and network hardware without making software changes. Our third-party data centers provide our websites, mobile applications and online tools with scalable and redundant Internet connectivity and redundant power and cooling to our hosting environments. We use security methods in an effort to ensure the integrity of our networks and to protect confidential data collected and stored on our servers. For example, we use firewall technology to protect access to our networks and to our servers and databases on which we store confidential data. We have developed and use internal policies and procedures to protect the personal information of our users. We test for unauthorized external access to the network daily using automated services and conduct periodic audits performed by outsourced security consultants.
Competition
The market to attract consumers seeking to save money on purchases online and in-store, and merchants seeking to drive sales and acquire new customers is highly competitive, fragmented and rapidly changing with limited barriers to entry.
Our competition for traffic from consumers seeking to save money on online or in-store purchases includes digital offer websites and mobile applications, cash-back, loyalty and discounted gift card websites and mobile applications, merchants, search engines, social networks, comparison shopping websites, newspapers and direct mail campaigns. We believe that our primary competition is from other digital offer websites, including Goodsearch, dealspl.us, bradsdeals, savings.com, Tech Bargains and Coupon Cabin. In addition to such competitors, we are experiencing increasing competition from other businesses that offer digital offers similar to ours as an add-on to their core business. For example, Groupon, Living Social, Coupons.com and Facebook provide digital offers, Google promotes product-listing advertisements adjacent to its search results and Google, Facebook and PayPal provide digital offers for in-store purchases. Further, with the introduction of cash-back rebates and discounted digital gift cards, we now compete with businesses that provide similar offerings, including eBates, Raise, Cardcash and Cardpool. While some of our actual and potential competitors enjoy substantial competitive advantages over us, such as superior name recognition, substantially greater financial, technical and other resources and longer history of competing in relevant geographies, we believe that we compete favorably based on our leadership position in digital offers, our strong brand awareness, our broad selection and quality of digital offers from leading merchants, our trusted partnerships with paid merchants and our large community of actively engaged users.
Merchants have a number of marketing options to choose from when deciding how to reach consumers. Our competition for marketing spend includes digital offer sites that offer a pay-for-performance model, search engines and social networks that compete for online advertising spend and television, magazines and newspapers that compete for offline advertising spend. We believe the principal factors that make us appealing in the competition for merchants’ marketing spend include our large and engaged audience of consumers, our multichannel engagement across online, mobile, social and in-store, our trusted marketplace that protects merchants, and our pay-for-performance model that provides merchants measurable return on investment, reporting and analytics.
Intellectual Property
Our intellectual property includes the content of our websites, our registered domain names, our registered and unregistered trademarks and our patent applications. We believe that our intellectual property is an important asset of our business and that our RetailMeNot.com, VoucherCodes.co.uk, Poulpeo.com, Ma-Reduc.com, RetailMeNot.ca, GiftcardZen.com and other domain names and our technology infrastructure give us a competitive advantage in the digital offer market. We rely on a combination of trademark, copyright and trade secret laws in the U.S. and Europe, as well as contractual provisions, to protect our proprietary technology and our brands. We currently have trademarks registered or pending in the U.S., Europe, Australia, Canada, India, Pakistan, South Korea, Singapore, and China for our name and certain words and phrases that we use in our business. We also rely on copyright laws to protect software relating to our websites and our proprietary technologies, although we have not registered for copyright protection to date. We have registered numerous Internet domain names related to our business in order to protect our proprietary interests. As of December 31, 2016, we had four patents issued, four patent applications that have been allowed and 97 pending patent applications related to the use and operation of discount websites and related mobile applications as well as the provision and redemption of digital offers. We also enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees and consultants and seek to control access to and distribution of our proprietary information in a commercially prudent manner. In addition, we license third-party technologies that are incorporated into some elements of our solutions.
The efforts we have taken to protect our intellectual property rights may not be sufficient or effective, and, despite these precautions, it may be possible for other parties to copy or otherwise obtain and use the content of our websites without authorization. We may be unable to prevent competitors from acquiring domain names or trademarks that are similar to, 
5

infringe upon or diminish the value of our domain names, trademarks, service marks and our other proprietary rights. Failure to protect our proprietary rights adequately could significantly harm our competitive position and operating results.
Employees
As of December 31, 2016, we had 565 employees. We consider our current relationship with our employees to be good. Other than our French employees, none of our employees is represented by a labor union or is a party to a collective bargaining agreement.
Culture
We believe that a critical component of our success has been our corporate culture, which we believe fosters innovation, encourages teamwork, cultivates creativity, diversity and inclusiveness and promotes a focus on execution. We have nurtured this culture since our inception and maintained an environment designed to promote openness, honesty, responsibility, mutual respect and the pursuit of common goals. We believe our culture gives us a competitive advantage in recruiting talent in the highly competitive fields that are critical to our success.
Segments
We have two operating and reporting segments. Our Gift Card segment consists of our marketplace for gift cards, and our Core segment consists of all other products and services that are related to our marketplace for digital offers. For detailed financial information regarding our reportable operating segments, see Note 15 “Segment Reporting” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8: “Financial Statements” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Geographic Information
Financial information about geographic areas is set forth in Note 13 "Domestic and Foreign Operations" of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Part II, Item 8: “Financial Statements” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. For a discussion of the risks attendant to foreign operations, see the information in Part 1, Item 1A: “Risk Factors” under the caption “We are subject to international business uncertainties that could adversely affect our operations and operating results.”
Seasonality
Our operating results fluctuate from quarter to quarter as a result of a variety of factors, including seasonal factors and economic cycles that influence consumer purchasing of retail products. Historically, we have experienced the highest number of visitors to our websites and mobile applications and net revenues in the fourth quarter of the year, which coincides with the winter holiday season in the U.S. and Europe. Net revenues from our advertising and in-store products are more heavily weighted to the fourth quarter of the year. As net revenues from this part of our business grow as a percentage of net revenues of our Core segment, for example to 27.7% from 20.4% of such net revenues for 2016 and 2015, respectively, our seasonality may increase. We do not yet have sufficient operating history with respect to our Gift Card segment to forecast its seasonality.
Our investments have led to uneven quarterly operating results due to increases in personnel costs, brand marketing, product and technology enhancements and the impact of strategic projects. The return on these investments is generally achieved in future periods and, as a result, these investments can adversely impact near term results.
Our business is directly affected by the behavior of consumers. Economic conditions and competitive pressures can impact, both positively and negatively, the types of digital offers featured on our websites and the rates at which consumers use them. Consequently, the results of any prior quarterly or annual periods should not be relied upon as indications of our future operating performance.
