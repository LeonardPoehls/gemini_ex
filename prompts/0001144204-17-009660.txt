 Liquids 
 The map below presents the locations of our current Liquids systems assets and projects being constructed. The map also depicts some Liquids Pipelines assets owned by other Enbridge affiliates and projects being constructed to provide an understanding of how they interconnect with our Liquids systems. 

The following discussion provides an overview of North American production that is transported on our pipelines and the projects that we are pursuing to connect the growing supplies of this production to key refinery markets in the United States. 
 In 2016, we transported production from the Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin, or WCSB, and the North Dakota Bakken formation. Western Canadian crude oil is an important source of supply for the United States. According to the latest available data for 2016 from the United States Department of Energys, or DOE, Energy Information Administration, or EIA, Canada supplied approximately 3.2 million barrels per day, or Bpd, of crude oil to the United States, the largest source of United States imports. Over half of the Canadian crude oil moving into the United States was transported on the Enbridge Mainline system. The Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers, or CAPP, forecasted as of June 2016 that future production from the Alberta oil sands will continue to experience steady growth during the next two decades with an additional 1.3 million Bpd of production by 2030, based on a subset of currently approved applications and announced expansions. We are well positioned to deliver growing volumes of crude oil that are expected from the WCSB to our existing as well as new markets.

 TABLE OF CONTENTS
 North Dakota, Montana and Saskatchewan, Canada saw a leveling off in the development of crude oil, natural gas, and NGLs from the Bakken and Three Forks formations. The latest data released in 2013 by the United States Geological Survey estimates that technically recoverable oil in the Bakken and Three Forks formation in North Dakota is approximately 7.4 billion barrels. 
 Along with Enbridge, we are actively working with our customers to develop transportation options that will alleviate capacity constraints in addition to providing access to new markets in the United States. Our market strategy is to provide safe, timely, economic, competitive and integrated transportation solutions to connect growing supplies of North American crude oil production to key refinery markets in the United States and Canada. Together, our existing and future plans advance our vision of being the leading energy delivery company in North America. In addition to this vision, we have advanced our Operational Risk Management Program. It includes a state-of-the-art Liquids Pipelines control center and the most extensive maintenance, integrity and inspection program in the history of the North American pipeline industry, with 1,105 in-line inspections and 14,237 pipeline integrity verification digs completed by Enbridge and us from 2010 through 2016. 
 We have a multi-billion dollar growth program underway, with projects coming into service through 2019 in addition to options to increase our economic interest in projects that are jointly funded by us and Enbridge. This growth program includes expansions to our Mainline system as well as replacement of the Line 3 pipeline to ensure WCSB production has efficient and reliable access to markets in the U.S. Midwest and beyond. In addition, in February 2017, we completed the acquisition of an effective 27.6% equity interest in the Bakken Pipeline System through our joint venture with Marathon Petroleum Corporation, or MPC. This system, upon completion, will further enhance our strategy of providing efficient market access solutions for Bakken production while providing the opportunity for the implementation of joint tolls with the Energy Transfer Crude Oil Pipeline, or ETCOP, and will also enhance market access opportunities for our customers and create a new flow path through the Mainline system to the eastern U.S. Gulf Coast. Refer to Part II. Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  Future Prospects Update for Liquids for further details. 
 Furthermore, while the Line 3 Replacement Program will not provide an increase in the overall capacity of the mainline system but will restore approximately 370,000 Bpd and supports the safety and operational reliability of the system, enhances flexibility and will allow us and Enbridge to optimize throughput from Western Canada into Superior, Wisconsin. This project, along with the other projects on the Mainline, will provide increased market access for producers to refineries in the United States upper-Midwest, Eastern Canada, and the United States Gulf Coast refining centers. For further details regarding our projects, refer to Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Results of Operations  By Segment. 
 Natural Gas 
 The map below presents the locations of our current Natural Gas systems assets. These assets are owned by Midcoast Energy Partners, L.P., or MEP, and its subsidiaries. MEP is a Delaware limited partnership we formed to serve as our primary vehicle for owning and growing our natural gas and NGL midstream business in the United States. MEP completed its initial public offering, or the Offering, in November of 2013, but we continue to own all of the equity interests in MEPs general partner, a 51.9% limited partner interest in MEP and a 48.4% limited partner interest in MEPs operating subsidiary, Midcoast Operating. 
 On January 27, 2017, MEP announced that it entered into a definitive merger agreement with our General Partner, whereby our General Partner will acquire, for cash, subject to the terms and conditions thereof, all of the outstanding publicly held common units of MEP at a price of $8.00 per common unit for an aggregate transaction value of $170.2 million. Subject to certain conditions, the transaction is expected to close in the second quarter of 2017. Upon closing, MEP will cease to be a publicly traded partnership. The transaction arises from the strategic alternatives review process, announced on May 2, 2016.

 TABLE OF CONTENTS
 This map depicts some assets owned or under development by Enbridge to provide an understanding of how they relate to our Natural Gas systems. 

Our natural gas assets are primarily located in Texas and Oklahoma, a region which continues to see limited drilling activity as a result of extended commodity pricing challenges. These core basins are known as the East Texas basin, the Fort Worth basin and the Anadarko basin. Our focus has primarily been on developing and expanding the service capability of our existing pipeline systems and acquiring assets with strong growth prospects located in or near the areas we serve or have competitive advantage. Our Natural Gas business also includes rail and liquids marketing operations that we use to enhance the value of the NGLs produced at our processing plants. 
 The operations and commercial activities of our gathering and processing assets and intrastate pipelines are integrated to provide better service to our customers. From an operations perspective, our key strategies are to provide safe and reliable service at reasonable costs to our customers and capitalize on opportunities for attracting new customers. From a commercial perspective, our focus is to provide our customers with a greater value for their commodity. We intend to achieve this latter objective by increasing customer access to preferred markets for natural gas and NGLs. The aim is to be able to move significant quantities of natural gas and NGLs from our Anadarko, North Texas and East Texas systems to the major market hubs in Texas and Louisiana. From these market hubs, natural gas can be used in the local Texas markets or transported to consumers in the Midwest, Northeast and Southeast United States. The primary market hub for NGLs is the fractionation center in Mont Belvieu, Texas, with its access to refineries, petro-chemical plants, export terminals and outbound pipelines. 
 The long term prospects in our core areas remain favorable, primarily as a result of technological advancements that have enhanced production of natural gas and NGLs from tight sand and shale formations. The reserves and resource potential in all three of our operating basins is substantial. The extended low price environment has forced producers to be more selective in their drilling efforts, with many producers high-grading well selection to the core portion of production areas. When and if natural gas and NGL prices recover to the level that will incentivize producers to drill their lean gas and NGL prospects, our core assets are well positioned to gather, treat and transport this gas to market. Our goal is to offer our customers the ability to gather, process, and transport their liquids to major markets.

 Lakehead system 
 Our Lakehead system, together with the Enbridge system in Canada, form the Mainline system, which has been in operation for over 60 years and forms the longest liquid petroleum pipeline system in the world. The Mainline system operates in a segregated, or batch, mode allowing the transportation of over 30 crude oil commodities typically classified as light, medium, or heavy crude oil, condensate, and NGLs. The Mainline system serves all the major refining centers in the Great Lakes and Midwest regions of the United States and the provinces of Ontario and Quebec, Canada. The Lakehead system is the U.S. portion of the Mainline system. It is an interstate common carrier pipeline system regulated by the FERC, and is the primary transporter of crude oil and liquid petroleum from Western Canada to the United States. 
 Over the past seven years, we have completed the largest pipeline expansion program in our history in order to accommodate the growing upstream supply that will feed our completed downstream market access projects. Our customers have long development timelines and need assurance that adequate pipeline infrastructure will be in place in time to transport the additional production resulting from completion of their projects. The projects included in our Eastern Access, Light Oil Market Access, U.S. Gulf Coast access, and associated Mainline/Lakehead expansion initiatives will provide the needed incremental market access for both our producer and refiner customers located in our primary target markets. 
 Our Lakehead system is strategically interconnected to multiple refining centers and transportation hubs located within Petroleum Administration for Defense Districts, or PADD II, such as: Chicago, Illinois; Patoka, Illinois; and Cushing, Oklahoma. In addition, we are also strategically connected to the largest U.S. refining center in the U.S. Gulf Coast through other pipelines owned by Enbridge and its affiliates. WCSB production in excess of Western Canadian demand moves on existing pipelines into primarily PADD II, with secondary markets including: the U.S. Gulf Coast (PADD III); the Rocky Mountain states (PADD IV); the Anacortes area of Washington state (PADD V); and to Eastern Canada (Ontario and Quebec).The Lakehead system mainly serves the PADD II market directly and the PADD III market indirectly. Bakken production in excess of local demand primarily moves on existing pipelines into PADD II or is transported by rail to coastal Canadian and U.S. refining markets. The U.S. Gulf Coast continues to be an attractive market for WCSB producers due to the markets large refining capacity designed to process heavy crude oil. The forecasted long-term incremental growth of Canadian oil sands and Bakken production provides stability for existing pipeline throughputs to historical markets as well as creating new growth opportunities available to both us and our competitors. 
 Customers.  Our Lakehead system operates under month-to-month transportation arrangements with our shippers. During 2016, approximately 38 shippers tendered crude oil and liquid petroleum for delivery through our Lakehead system. We consider multiple companies that are controlled by a common entity to be a single shipper for purposes of determining the number of shippers delivering crude oil and liquid petroleum on our Lakehead system. Our customers include integrated oil companies, major independent oil producers, refiners and marketers.

 TABLE OF CONTENTS
 Supply and Demand.  Our Lakehead system is part of the longest crude oil pipeline in the world and is a critical component of the North American crude oil supply pipeline network. Lakehead is well positioned as the primary transporter of Western Canadian crude oil and continues to benefit from past and anticipated future crude oil production growth from the Alberta Oil Sands, as well as recent development in tight oil production in North Dakota. Aside from the receipt locations on the Mainline system within Canada, our Lakehead system receives injections from locations within the United States. Clearbrook, Minnesota is the receipt location for U.S. Bakken production, and other U.S. sources are received at Lewiston, Michigan and Mokena, Illinois. 
 Crude oil originating from the WCSB comprises the majority of Lakehead system deliveries. According to the Energy Information Administration, or EIA, Canada is currently ranked third in the world for total proved reserves, just behind Venezuela and Saudi Arabia, respectively. The NEB estimates that 97% of Canadas total proved reserves are attributed to Albertas oil sands bitumen, with the remainder being conventional oil sources. The Alberta Energy Regulator, or AER, estimates 166.8 billion total barrels, or approximately 165 billion and 1.8 billion barrels of established proved bitumen and conventional reserves, respectively, remain for the region as of 2016. The NEB estimates that total production from the WCSB averaged approximately 3.6 million Bpd in 2016 and 3.7 million in 2015. Furthermore, these production levels are expected to grow in the future, as previously discussed. 
 The growth forecast in the oil sands will be primarily driven by steam assisted gravity drainage, or SAGD, projects in the long-term. Mining projects are the main contributor to near-term growth, with other development projects on hold until prices recover and well economics improve. Based on projects currently under construction in Western Canada, the incremental productive capacity that would have access to our systems is reported to increase over the next three years by approximately 450,000 Bpd. 
 Lakehead throughput volumes are primarily supplied by crude oil produced in the Canadian oil sands and Bakken resource plays. North Dakotas Bakken/Three Forks resource play has become a major component of United States domestic supply. By 2014, crude oil supply from the region had grown to over 1.2 million Bpd, but has since retracted in response to the low price environment. In 2016, production averaged one million Bpd and is expected to remain at that level through 2017. Forecasts of Western Canadian crude oil supply are periodically completed by Enbridge, CAPP and the NEB, among others. The June 2016 CAPP forecast predicts Western Canada oil sands production is expected to grow by 1.3 million Bpd to over 3.7 million Bpd by 2030. This compares with an expected decrease of 80,000 Bpd from conventional production sources over the same time frame. CAPP revised its oil sands production forecast downward by 285,000 Bpd in 2016 from 4.0 million Bpd to 3.7 million Bpd due to the low oil price environment and constraints arising from oil sands cost competitiveness and delays in project schedules. Despite the revisions, the production growth forecasted out of our primary supply markets requires additional pipeline capacity. 
 PADD II is the primary demand market for our Lakehead system. Deliveries on our Lakehead system are negatively affected by periodic maintenance, other competitive transportation alternatives, or refinery turnarounds and other shutdowns at producing plants that supply crude oil. Based on growth in Western Canadian and Bakken crude oil supply and Lakehead operational performance improvements, deliveries on our Lakehead system are expected to grow beyond the 2.6 million Bpd of actual deliveries experienced during 2016. 
 The latest data available from the EIA shows that total PADD II demand was 3.6 million Bpd. PADD II produced 1.7 million Bpd and imported 2.2 million Bpd from Canada and other regions located in the United States, with exports comprising the remaining difference between PADD II supply and demand. Imports from Canada comprised 98% of total PADD II crude oil imports, with approximately 65% or 1.4 million Bpd transported on our Lakehead system. The remaining barrels were imported via competitor pipelines from Alberta and offshore sources via the U.S. Gulf Coast or regional transfers from PADD III or PADD IV. 
 Lakehead system deliveries for 2016 were approximately 259,000 Bpd higher than delivery volumes for 2015. Total deliveries from our Lakehead system averaged 2.6 million Bpd in 2016, meeting approximately 71% of the refinery capacity in the greater Chicago area; 78% of the Minnesota refinery capacity; and 77% of Ontario refinery capacity. Refinery configurations and crude oil requirements within PADD II continue to create an attractive market for Western Canadian and Bakken supply. However, Crude oil demand in PADD II averaged 3.6 million Bpd, an increase of only 73,000 Bpd from 2015. Moreover, overall refining utilization remained relatively flat in 2016 at 92%.

 TABLE OF CONTENTS
 Competition.  WCSB crude oil competes with local and imported crude oil. Of all the pipeline systems that transport crude oil out of Canada, the Mainline system transported approximately half of all Canadian crude oil imports into the United States in 2016. 
 Our Eastern Access, Light Oil Market Access, U.S. Gulf Coast Access, and associated Mainline expansion projects will improve the flexibility of our system and are designed to increase Lakehead throughput by reaching new markets. Given the expected increase in crude oil production from the Alberta Oil Sands over the next 10 years, alternative transportation proposals have been presented to crude oil producers. Competitors proposals to WCSB and Bakken shippers include expanding, twinning, extending and building new pipeline assets. These proposals and projects are in various stages of regulatory approval. 
 Transportation of crude oil by rail has also emerged as a competitor primarily due to the lack of pipeline capacity for the WCSB and Bakken regions. As a result, a significant amount of rail loading capacity has been constructed and is proposed in both markets. Rail transportation becomes less competitive, however, as crude oil price differentials narrow between key markets due to high transportation costs relative to cost of transportation by pipeline. 
 These competing alternatives for delivering Western Canadian crude oil into the United States and other markets could erode shipper support for further expansion of our Lakehead system. Accordingly, competition could also impact throughput on and utilization of the Mainline system. The Mainline system, however, offers significant cost savings and flexibility to shippers. 
 Deliveries for our Lakehead system over the past five years were as follows:

 Mid-Continent system 
 Our Mid-Continent system, which we have owned since 2004, is located within PADD II and is comprised of our Ozark pipeline and storage terminals at Cushing, Oklahoma. Our Ozark pipeline transports crude oil from Cushing, Oklahoma to Wood River, Illinois, where it delivers to the WRB refinery, a joint venture between Cenovus Energy and Phillips 66 located at Wood River, and interconnects with the Woodpat Pipeline and the Wood River Pipeline, each owned by unrelated parties. 
 In December 2016, we entered into an agreement to sell the Ozark pipeline system to a subsidiary of MPLX LP for cash proceeds of approximately $209.0 million plus an estimated $10.2 million in reimbursable capital costs up to the closing date of the transaction. Subject to certain pre-closing conditions, the transaction is expected to close by the end of the first quarter of 2017. For more information, refer to Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 11. Property, Plant and Equipment. 
 The storage terminals consist of 109 individual storage tanks ranging in size from 78,000 to 570,000 barrels. Of the approximately 25.1 million barrels of storage shell capacity on our Mid-Continent system, the Cushing terminal accounts for approximately 19.7 million barrels. A portion of the storage facilities are used for operational purposes, while we contract the remainder of the facilities with various crude oil market participants for their term storage requirements. Contract fees include fixed monthly capacity fees as well as utilization fees, which we charge for injecting crude oil into and withdrawing crude oil from the storage facilities.

 TABLE OF CONTENTS
 Customers.  Our Mid-Continent system operates under month-to-month transportation arrangements as well as long-term and short-term storage arrangements with shippers. During 2016, approximately 45 shippers tendered crude oil for service on our Mid-Continent system. We consider multiple companies that are controlled by a common entity to be a single shipper for purposes of determining the number of shippers delivering crude oil and liquid petroleum on our Mid-Continent system. These customers include integrated oil companies, independent oil producers, refiners and marketers. 
 Supply and Demand.  Our Mid-Continent system is positioned to capitalize on increasing demand for both domestic and imported crude oil, specifically Canadian imports into the United States. Our Ozark pipeline system currently serves an exclusive corridor between Cushing, Oklahoma and Wood River, Illinois, delivering crude commodities with low viscosities and sulfur content at more competitive prices than similar commodities accessible from other sources. In 2016, PADD II imported 2.2 million Bpd of foreign crude oil, the majority of which were imported from Canada primarily on our Lakehead system. The remaining barrels of crude oil were imported from PADDs III and IV as well as offshore sources. We expect the demand for local supply to increase and the demand for Canadian crude to stay strong, thus displacing the necessity for other foreign sources. Our Ozark system continued to be highly utilized in 2016, although average deliveries on the Ozark pipeline system were 188,000 Bpd for 2016 down from 212,000 Bpd for 2015. 
 Demand for storage capacity at Cushing, Oklahoma has remained high as customers continue to value the flexibility and optionality available with this service as well as the superior connectivity that our terminal offers. Our storage terminals rely on demand for storage service from numerous oil market participants. Producers, refiners, marketers and traders value our storage capacity in Cushing, Oklahoma for a number of different reasons, including batch scheduling, stream quality control, inventory management, and speculative trading opportunities. 
 Competition.  As previously mentioned, our Ozark pipeline system currently serves an exclusive corridor between Cushing, Oklahoma and Wood River, Illinois. However, refineries connected to Wood River, Illinois have crude oil supply options available from Canada via our Lakehead system as well as third-party pipelines. These same refineries also have access to the United States Gulf Coast and foreign crude oil supply through a third-party pipeline system, which is an undivided joint interest pipeline that is owned by unrelated parties. In addition, refineries located east of Patoka, Illinois with access to crude oil through our Ozark system also have access to west Texas supply from the Permian Basin through the West Texas Gulf/Mid-Valley Pipeline systems owned by unrelated parties. Our Ozark pipeline system faces competition from a competitors pipeline from Hardisty, Alberta to Patoka, Illinois. 
 Furthermore, the anticipated completion of the Dakota Access Pipeline in 2017 will enable the delivery of crude oil similar to the crude oil currently delivered by our Ozark pipeline, increasing pipeline competition into the refining markets currently served by the Ozark pipeline and impacting Ozarks current competitive advantages. Through our joint venture with MPC, on February 15, 2017 we acquired a minority interest in the Bakken Pipeline system, which includes the Dakota Access Pipeline. Refer to Part II. Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  Recent Developments for further details. 
 Competitors to our storage facilities at Cushing, Oklahoma include large integrated oil companies, private entities and other midstream energy partnerships. Many of these competitors have the capability to expand in the future and better compete on quality of service, reliability, increased connectivity and price. 
 North Dakota system 
 Our North Dakota system is a crude oil gathering and interstate pipeline transportation system servicing the Williston Basin in North Dakota and Montana, which includes the highly publicized Bakken and Three Forks formations. The gathering pipelines that comprise our North Dakota system collect crude oil from nearly 80 different receipt facilities located throughout western North Dakota, including nearly 20 third party gathering pipeline connections, and deliver a fungible common stream to a variety of interconnecting pipeline and rail export facilities.

 TABLE OF CONTENTS
 Traditionally, the majority of our pipeline deliveries have been made into interconnecting pipelines at Clearbrook, Minnesota where two other pipelines originate: (1) a third-party pipeline serving St. Paul, Minnesota refinery markets; and (2) our Lakehead system providing further pipeline transportation on the Enbridge system into the Great Lakes, eastern Canada and U.S. Midwest refinery markets that include Cushing, Oklahoma, Patoka, Illinois, and other pipelines delivering crude oil to the U.S. Gulf Coast. We have significantly increased the pipeline capacity of our North Dakota system through a series of projects in recent years while continuing to serve the systems traditional markets in order to provide an array of market options and services. 
 Customers.  Customers of our North Dakota system include refiners of crude oil, producers of crude oil and purchasers of crude oil at the wellhead, such as marketers, that require crude oil gathering and transportation services. Producers range in size from small independent owner/operators to large integrated oil companies. During 2016, approximately 246 shippers tendered crude oil for service on our North Dakota system. 
 Supply and Demand.  Similar to our Lakehead system, our North Dakota system depends upon demand for crude oil in the Great Lakes and Midwest regions of the United States and the ability of crude oil producers to maintain their crude oil production and exploration activities. The state of North Dakota reported production levels of 1.0 million Bpd as of November 2016 with projections remaining at that level through 2017. 
 Competition.  Due to the growth in production from these formations over the last several years, competition has increased substantially. Traditional competitors of our North Dakota system include refiners, integrated oil companies, interstate and intrastate pipelines or their affiliates and other crude oil gatherers. Many crude oil producers in the oil fields served by our North Dakota system have alternative gathering facilities available to them or have the ability to build their own assets, including their own rail loading facilities. 
 Currently, the primary competition to our North Dakota system is rail. Initially considered a niche or alternative form of transportation, rail currently represents about 30% of the total Bakken crude exported from North Dakota. 
 There are also a number of third-party pipelines with proposed expansions to increase capacity and take advantage of the Bakken and Three Forks volume growth. Many of these third party pipeline projects include pipeline connections into our North Dakota system as part of their project scope. As discussed above, through our joint venture with MPC we own a minority stake in the Bakken Pipeline System. As pipeline expansion projects create more export capacity from the Bakken and other pipeline projects provide increased access to more refinery markets across the United States, we expect North Dakota customers will shift volumes back to pipelines. 
 Natural Gas Segment 
 Our natural gas business includes natural gas and NGL gathering and transportation pipeline systems, natural gas processing and treating facilities, condensate stabilizers and an NGL fractionation facility, as well as rail and liquids marketing operations. We gather natural gas from the wellhead and central receipt points on our systems, deliver it to our facilities for processing and treating and deliver the residue gas to intrastate or interstate pipelines for transmission to wholesale customers such as power plants, industrial customers and local distribution companies. We deliver the NGLs produced at our processing and fractionation facilities to intrastate and interstate pipelines for transportation to the NGL market hubs in Mont Belvieu, Texas and Conway, Kansas. In addition, using the Texas Express NGL system, we gather NGLs from certain of our facilities for delivery on the Texas Express NGL mainline to Mont Belvieu, Texas.

Anadarko System 
 Our Anadarko system includes production from the Granite Wash tight sand formation. Productive horizons in the Granite Wash play include the Hogshooter, Checkerboard, Cleveland, Skinner, Red Fork, Atoka and Morrow formations. Recent decreases in NGL and condensate prices have resulted in decreased activity in the region. The Anadarko basin wells generally have long lives with predictable flow rates. Producers generally pursue wells with higher condensate and oil production relative to historical activity that was focused on natural gas and NGL prospects. 
 With recent commodity prices in extended decline resulting in reduced production, we have idled approximately seven of our less efficient processing plants and consolidated volumes to our more efficient plants. These plants are available for restart when production increases. 
 Our Anadarko system has numerous market outlets for the natural gas that we gather and process and NGLs and condensate that we recover on our system. We have connections to major intrastate and interstate transportation pipelines that connect our facilities to major market hubs in the Mid-Continent and Gulf Coast regions of the United States. NGLs produced at our Anadarko system processing plants are transported by pipeline to third-party fractionation facilities and NGL market hubs in Conway, Kansas and Mont Belvieu, Texas. 
 East Texas System 
 Our East Texas system gathers production from: the Cotton Valley, James Lime and lean Bossier Shale plays, which are located on the western side of our East Texas system; the Haynesville/Bossier Shale plays, which run from western Louisiana into East Texas and are among the largest natural gas resources in the United States; and the Cotton Valley Sand formation, which also runs from western Louisiana into East Texas and has a high content of NGLs and condensate on the eastern side of our East Texas system. The East Texas basin also includes multiple other natural gas and oil formations that are frequently explored, including among others, the Woodbine, Travis Peak, Rodessa, and Pettite. The East Texas wells generally have long lives with predictable flow rates. 
 In May 2015, we placed into service a cryogenic natural gas processing plant near Beckville in Panola County, Texas, which we refer to as the Beckville Processing Plant. This plant serves existing and prospective customers pursuing production in the Cotton Valley formation, which is comprised of approximately ten counties in East Texas. Our Beckville processing plant is capable of processing approximately 150 MMcf/d of natural gas and producing approximately 8,500 Bpd of NGLs to accommodate the additional liquids-rich natural gas within this geographical area in which our East Texas system operates. Related NGL takeaway infrastructure connecting the Beckville plant to third-party NGL transportation systems was also constructed. In 2016, our processing plants in East Texas were near or at full capacity. 
 Our East Texas system has numerous market outlets for the natural gas that we gather and process and NGLs and condensate that we recover on our system. We have connections to major intrastate and interstate transportation pipelines that connect our facilities to major market hubs in the United States Gulf Coast, as well as to several wholesale customers. A portion of the NGLs produced at one of our East Texas system processing plants is fractionated by us and sold directly to a third-party chemical company. The remainder of the NGLs recovered at our plants are transported by pipeline to Mont Belvieu, Texas for fractionation.

 TABLE OF CONTENTS
 North Texas System 
 A substantial portion of natural gas on our North Texas system is produced in the Barnett Shale play within the Fort Worth basin. The North Texas wells are located in the Fort Worth basin and generally have long lives with predictable flow rates. As producers have shifted to more economic advantaged basins, we have seen our natural gas volumes decline in this basin. 
 Our North Texas system has numerous market outlets for the natural gas that we gather and process and NGLs that we recover on our system. We have connections to major intrastate transportation pipelines that connect our facilities to market centers in the Dallas-Fort Worth area. 
 Texas Express NGL System 
 The Texas Express NGL system consists of an NGL gathering system and an NGL intrastate mainline transportation pipeline that originates in Skellytown, Texas and extends to NGL fractionation and storage facilities located in Mont Belvieu, Texas. Volumes from the Rockies, Permian basin and Mid-Continent regions are delivered to the Texas Express NGL system utilizing the Mid-America Pipeline between the Conway hub and the Hobbs NGL fractionation facility in West Texas, both of which are owned by a third party. In addition, volumes from the Denver-Julesburg basin in Weld County, Colorado can access the system through the Front Range Pipeline which is also owned by third parties. 
 Customers.  Our natural gas business serves customers predominantly in the Gulf Coast region of the United States and includes both upstream customers and purchasers of natural gas and NGLs. Upstream customers served by our systems primarily consist of small, medium and large independent operators and large integrated energy companies, while our natural gas sales customers primarily consist of large users of natural gas, such as power plants, industrial facilities, local distribution companies and other large consumers. Our condensate and NGLs are marketed to chemical facilities, refiners, various third parties and end users. Due to the cost of making physical connections from the wellhead to gathering systems, the majority of our customers tend to renew their gathering and processing contracts with us rather than seeking alternative gathering and processing services. 
 Supply and Demand.  Demand for our gathering, processing and transportation services primarily depends upon the supply of natural gas reserves and associated natural gas crude oil development and the drilling rate for new wells. The level of impurities in the natural gas gathered also affects treating services. All of our natural gas systems exist in regions that have shale or tight sands formations where hydraulic fracturing technology can be utilized to increase production from the natural gas wells. Demand for these services depends upon overall economic conditions, drilling activity and the prices of natural gas, NGLs, and condensates. Commodity prices for natural gas, NGLs, and condensates remained low throughout 2016. As a result, there has been reduction in drilling activity by producers and reduced volumes on the systems we operate. Our existing systems are located in basins that have the opportunity to grow in an improved pricing environment. 
 Competition.  Competition in our natural gas business is significant in all of the markets we serve. Competitors include interstate and intrastate pipelines or their affiliates and other midstream businesses that gather, treat, process and market natural gas or NGLs. Our gathering businesss principal competitors are other midstream companies and, to a lesser extent, producer-owned gathering systems. Some of these competitors are substantially larger than we are. Because pipelines are generally the only practical mode of transportation for natural gas over land, the most significant competitors of our natural gas pipelines are other pipeline companies. Pipelines typically compete with each other based on location, capacity, price and reliability. 
 Competition for the services we provide varies based upon the location of gathering, treating and processing facilities. Most upstream customers have alternate gathering, treating and processing facilities available to them. In addition, they have alternatives such as building their own gathering facilities or, in some cases, selling their natural gas supplies without treating and processing. In addition to location, competition also varies based upon pricing arrangements and reputation. On sour natural gas systems, such as parts of our East Texas system, competition is more limited in certain locations due to the infrastructure required to treat sour natural gas. Many of the large wholesale customers we serve have multiple pipelines connected or adjacent to their facilities. Accordingly, many of these customers have the ability to purchase natural gas directly from a number of pipelines or third parties that may hold capacity on the various pipelines. In addition, several new interstate natural gas pipelines have been constructed in areas currently served by our natural gas transportation pipelines. Some of these new pipelines may compete for customers with our existing pipelines.

 TABLE OF CONTENTS
 Marketing Operations 
 The primary role of our marketing business is to provide marketing services of natural gas, NGLs and condensate. We purchase and receive natural gas, NGLs and other products from pipeline systems and processing plants, including those owned by us, and sell and deliver them to wholesale customers, distributors, refiners, fractionators, chemical facilities, various third parties and end users. A majority of the natural gas and NGLs we purchase are produced in Texas markets where we have expanded interstate deliverability alternatives over the past several years. We can use our connectivity to interstate pipelines to improve value for the producers by delivering natural gas into premium markets and NGLs to primary markets where we sell them to major customers. Additionally, our marketing business derives operating income from providing logistics services for our customers from the wellhead to markets. 
 On August 15, 2016, our NGL Logistics and Marketing business, ELTM, sold its transport trucks and trailers (alternatively our trucking business) to a third party. In conjunction with the sale ELTM entered into a long-term trucking services agreement with the purchaser, insuring no interruption of our logistics activities. 
 As of December 31, 2016, the physical assets of our marketing business primarily consist of:
 
 | Approximately 190 railcars for transporting NGLs;
--+--------------------------------------------------


 | Our TexPan liquids railcar facility near Pampa, Texas, and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------


 | Our Petal truck & rail facility near Hattiesburg, Mississippi.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------

 We also enter into agreements with various third parties to obtain NGL supply, transportation, gas balancing, fractionation and storage capacity in support of the marketing services provided. These agreements supply us with the following:
 
 | Up to approximately 79,000 Bpd through 2022 of firm NGL fractionation capacity;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Up to approximately 75,000 Bpd on average in 2017 to 120,000 Bpd in 2022 of firm NGL transportation capacity on the Texas Express NGL system;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Up to approximately 39,000 Bpd through 2022 of additional firm NGL transportation capacity on third-party pipelines;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Up to approximately 42,555 Bpd through April 2017 and 8,500 Bpd continuing May 2017 through March 2019 of NGL capacity via exchange agreements with various counterparties; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Approximately 5.0 million barrels of liquids, or MMBbls, of NGL storage capacity.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Customers.  Most of our customers are wholesale customers, refiners and petrochemical producers, fractionators, propane distributors and industrial, utility and power plant customers. In addition, we sell natural gas and NGLs to marketing companies at various market hubs. 
 Supply and Demand.  Supply for our marketing business depends to a large extent on the natural gas reserves, associated natural gas from crude oil development and rate of drilling within the areas served by our gathering, processing and transportation business. Demand is typically driven by a number of factors such as physical domestic and international industrial requirements. 
 Since major market hubs for natural gas, NGLs and related products are located in the Mid-Continent and Gulf Coast regions of the United States and our marketing assets are geographically located within Texas, Louisiana, Oklahoma and Mississippi, the majority of activities are conducted within those states. Our interconnected gathering and transportation systems and our long-term trucking and railcar arrangements mitigate the risk that our natural gas and NGLs will be shut in by capacity constraints on downstream NGL pipelines and other facilities. 
 One of the key components of our marketing business is our natural gas and NGL purchase and resale activities. Through our natural gas and NGL purchase and resale services, we can efficiently manage the transportation and delivery of natural gas from our gathering, processing and transportation systems and deliver them to on-system industrial plant customers, and NGLs to marketing companies at various market hubs. We typically price our sales based on multiple published daily or monthly price indices. In addition, sales to wholesale customers include a pass-through charge for costs of transportation and additional margin to compensate us for the associated services we provide.

 TABLE OF CONTENTS
 We also use third-party storage facilities and pipelines for the right to store NGLs for various periods of time to mitigate risk associated with sales and purchase contracts. We have also entered into multiple long-term fractionation contracts with third-party fractionators to provide access to fractionation capacity for our customers. 
 Competition.  Our marketing operations have numerous competitors, including large natural gas and NGL marketing companies, marketing affiliates of pipelines, major oil, natural gas and NGL producers, other trucking, railcar and pipeline operations, independent aggregators and regional marketing companies. 
Seasonality 
 The drilling activities of producers within our areas of operations generally do not vary materially by season but may be affected by adverse weather. Generally, the demand for natural gas and NGLs decreases during the spring and fall months and increases during the winter months and, in some areas, during the summer months. Seasonal anomalies such as mild winters or hot summers can lessen or intensify this fluctuation. Demand for natural gas with respect to power plant customers is typically driven by weather-related factors. 
REGULATION 
 Regulation by the FERC of Interstate Common Carrier Liquids Pipelines 
 The FERC regulates the interstate pipeline transportation of crude oil, petroleum products, and other liquids such as NGLs. Our Lakehead, North Dakota, Bakken and Ozark systems are our primary interstate common carrier liquids pipelines subject to regulation by the FERC under the Interstate Commerce Act, or ICA, the Energy Policy Act of 1992, or EP Act, and rules and orders promulgated thereunder. As common carriers in interstate commerce, these pipelines provide service to any shipper who makes a reasonable request for transportation services, provided that the shipper satisfies the conditions and specifications contained in the applicable tariff. The ICA requires us to maintain tariffs on file with the FERC that set forth the rates we charge for providing transportation services on our interstate common carrier pipelines, as well as the rules and regulations governing these services. 
 The ICA gives the FERC the authority to regulate the rates we can charge for service on interstate common carrier pipelines. The ICA requires, among other things, that such rates be just and reasonable and that they not be unduly discriminatory or unduly preferential to certain shippers. The ICA permits interested parties to challenge newly proposed or changed rates and authorizes the FERC to suspend the effectiveness of such rates for a period of up to seven months and to investigate the rates to determine if they are just and reasonable. If the FERC finds the new or changed rate unlawful, it is authorized to require the carrier to refund, with interest, the amount of any revenues in excess of the amount that would have been collected during the term of the investigation at the rate properly determined to be lawful. The FERC also may investigate, upon complaint or on its own motion, rates that are already in effect and may order a carrier to change its rates prospectively. Upon an appropriate showing, a shipper may obtain reparations for damages sustained for a period of up to two years prior to the filing of a complaint. 
 In October 1992, Congress passed the EP Act, which deemed petroleum pipeline rates that were in effect for the 365-day period ending on the date of enactment, or that were in effect on the 365th day preceding enactment and had not been subject to complaint, protest or investigation during the 365-day period, to be just and reasonable under the ICA (i.e., grandfathered). The EP Act also limited the circumstances under which a complaint can be made against such grandfathered rates. In order to challenge grandfathered rates, a party must show: (1) that it was contractually barred from challenging the rates during the relevant 365-day period; (2) that there has been a substantial change after the date of enactment of the EP Act in the economic circumstances of the pipeline or in the nature of the services that were the basis for the rate, or (3) that the rate is unduly discriminatory or unduly preferential. 
 The FERC determined our Lakehead system rates are not covered by the grandfathering provisions of the EP Act because they were subject to challenge prior to the effective date of the statute. The rates for our North Dakota and Ozark systems in effect at the time of the EP Act should be found to be subject to the grandfathering provisions of the EP Act because those rates were not suspended or subject to protest or complaint during the 365-day period established by the EP Act. 
 The EP Act required the FERC to issue rules establishing a simplified and generally applicable ratemaking methodology for petroleum pipelines and to streamline procedures in petroleum pipeline proceedings. The FERC responded to this mandate by issuing Order No. 561 which adopted an indexing rate methodology for petroleum pipelines. Under these regulations, which became effective January 1, 1995, petroleum pipelines are able to change 

14



 TABLE OF CONTENTS
 their rates within prescribed ceiling levels that are tied to an inflation index. Rate increases made within the ceiling levels may be protested, but such protests generally must show that the rate increase resulting from application of the index is substantially in excess of the pipelines increase in costs. If the indexing methodology results in a reduced ceiling level that is lower than a pipelines filed rate, Order No. 561 requires the pipeline to reduce its rate to comply with the lower ceiling, although a pipeline is not required to reduce its rate below the level grandfathered under the EP Act. Under Order No. 561, a pipeline must as a general rule utilize the indexing methodology to change its rates. The FERC, however, uses cost-of-service ratemaking, market-based rates and settlement rates as alternatives to the indexing approach in certain specified circumstances. 
 In 2015, the tariff rate for our Ozark system was reset on a cost-of-service basis and is subject to the FERC indexing rules. The tariff rates for our Lakehead, North Dakota and Bakken systems are set using a combination of the FERC indexing rules (which apply to the base rates on those systems), FERC-approved surcharges for particular projects that were approved under the FERCs settlement rules and, in the case of the North Dakota and Bakken systems, contractual agreements. 
 The inflation index applied to those rates subject to the FERC indexing rules is determined by a formula that is established by FERC and is subject to review every five years. On December 16, 2010, the FERC set the index for the period from July 2011 through June 2016 at the Producer Price Index for Finished Goods, or PPI-FG, plus 2.65 percentage points. Based on this formula, the index resulted in an increase of approximately 3.9%, 4.6%, and (2.0)% for 2014, 2015 and 2016, respectively. On December 18, 2015, the FERC set the index for the period from July 2016 through June 2021 at PPI-FG plus 1.23 percentage points. 
 On October 20, 2016, the FERC issued an Advanced Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (ANOPR) seeking comments on proposed changes to its review of oil pipeline index rate filings and reporting requirements. Specifically, the Commission proposes to reject increases to indexed rates and indexed rate ceilings if certain criteria are met. Such rate increase rejections would be outright and would not be prompted by a shipper protest (as is the case currently) or involve a hearing into the merits of the rate increase. An ANOPR is an initial step taken by a regulatory agency to obtain comments from impacted parties. Before issuing a final rule regarding these issues the FERC must also undertake a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NOPR) process. As a result, it is unlikely that this issue will be resolved in 2017. 
 FERC Allowance for Income Taxes in Interstate Common Carrier Pipeline Rates 
 Under current FERC policy, pipelines regulated by FERC that are owned by entities organized as Master Limited Partnerships, or MLPs, may include an income tax allowance in their cost-of-service rates to the extent the income generated from regulated activities was subject to an actual or potential income tax liability. Pursuant to this policy, a FERC-regulated pipeline that is a tax pass-through entity seeking such an income tax allowance must establish that its owners, partners or members have an actual or potential income tax obligation on the companys income from regulated activities. Whether a particular pipelines owners have an actual or potential income tax liability is reviewed by the FERC on a case-by-case basis. To the extent any of our FERC-regulated oil pipeline systems were to file cost-of-service rates, their entitlement to an income tax allowance would be assessed under the FERC policy statement and the facts existing at the relevant time. 
 The current FERC income tax allowance policy has recently been drawn into question by a decision of the United States Court of Appeals (D.C. Circuit). In its July 1, 2016 decision in the United Airlines case the court found that the FERC had failed to demonstrate that its income tax allowance policy  in conjunction with its rate of return methodology  does not result in double recovery of taxes for partnerships and asked the FERC to establish an income tax recovery mechanism for which it can demonstrate that there is no double recovery. It is unclear at this point whether the current FERC income tax recovery mechanism will be upheld or whether the FERC will need to change its income tax recovery mechanism and if so what the new mechanism might look like. It is not expected that this issue will be fully resolved in 2017. 
 FERC Return on Equity Policy for Oil Pipelines 
 The FERC Return on Equity, or ROE, for oil pipelines is determined using a two-step discounted cash flow methodology. This methodology accounts for a long-term growth estimate in addition to a short-term growth rate estimate. For purposes of calculating the long-term growth rate, the FERC has traditionally used projected Gross Domestic Product, or GDP, growth as a proxy for the long-term growth rate. The current FERC policy for calculating ROE was set out in the FERCs Policy Statement regarding Composition of Proxy Groups for Determining Gas and Oil Pipeline Return on Equity. According to the Policy Statement, MLPs are included in the 

15



 TABLE OF CONTENTS
 ROE proxy group for oil pipelines, and there is no ceiling on the level of distributions included in the FERCs discounted cash flow methodology. The Policy Statement further indicates that the Institutional Brokers Estimate System, or IBES, forecasts should remain the basis for the short-term growth forecast used in the discounted cash flow calculation and the respective two-thirds and one-third weightings of the short and long-term growth factors should be used. The Policy Statement also indicates that the GDP forecast used for the long-term growth rate should be reduced by 50% for all MLPs included in the proxy group. The actual ROEs to be calculated under the Policy Statement are dependent on the companies included in the proxy group and the specific conditions existing at the time the ROE is calculated in each case. The FERCs ROE policy for MLPs is also potentially impacted by the United Airlines decision discussed above. 
Accounting for Pipeline Assessment Costs 
 The FERCs policies describe how FERC-regulated companies should account for costs associated with implementing the pipeline integrity management requirements of the United States Department of Transportation, or DOT, and the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration, or PHMSA. FERC-regulated companies are generally required to recognize costs incurred for performing pipeline assessments that are part of a pipeline integrity management program as a maintenance expense in the period in which the costs are incurred. Costs for items such as rehabilitation projects designed to extend the useful life of the system can continue to be capitalized to the extent permitted under the existing rules. Consistent with the FERCs policies, we expense all internal inspection costs for all our pipeline systems, whether or not they are subject to the FERCs regulation. Refer to Part II. Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies included in our consolidated financial statements of this annual report on Form 10-K for additional discussion. 
 Regulation of Intrastate Natural Gas Pipelines 
 Our operations in Texas are subject to regulation under the Texas Utilities Code and the Texas Natural Resources Code, as implemented by the Texas Railroad Commission, or TRRC. Generally, the TRRC is vested with authority to ensure that rates charged for natural gas sales and transportation services are just and reasonable. The rates we charge for transportation services are deemed just and reasonable under Texas law, unless challenged in a complaint. We cannot predict whether such a complaint may be filed against us or whether the TRRC will change its method of regulating rates. Pursuant to authority granted to it by the Texas Natural Resources Code, the TRRC has adopted by rule an Informal Complaint Process that applies to rate issues associated with gathering or transmission systems, thus subjecting gathering and intrastate pipeline activities of Enbridge to the jurisdiction of the TRRC. 
 In Oklahoma, intrastate natural gas pipelines and gathering systems are subject to regulation by the Oklahoma, Corporation Commission, or OCC. Specifically, the OCC is vested with the authority to prescribe and enforce maximum rates for the transportation and transmission of natural gas. These rates may be amended or altered at any time by the OCC. However, a company affected by a rate change will be given at least ten days notice in order to introduce evidence of opposition to such amendment. Adjustment of claims or settlement of controversies regarding rates between transportation and transmission companies and customers will be mediated by the OCC prior to any hearing on the dispute, upon request. An entity operating an intrastate natural gas pipeline or gathering system in Oklahoma is subject to the jurisdiction of the OCC, and failure to comply with an OCC order regarding rate requirements could result in contempt proceedings instituted before the OCC by any affected party. 
 Regulation by the FERC of Intrastate Natural Gas Pipelines 
 Our Texas and Oklahoma intrastate pipelines are generally not subject to regulation by the FERC. However, to the extent our intrastate pipelines transport natural gas in interstate commerce, the rates, terms and conditions of such transportation are subject to FERC jurisdiction under Section 311 of the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978, or NGPA. In addition, under FERC regulations we are subject to market manipulation and transparency rules. This includes the annual reporting requirements pursuant to FERC Order No. 735 et al. Failure to comply with FERC rules, regulations and orders can result in the imposition of administrative, civil and criminal penalties. 
 Natural Gas Gathering Regulation 
 Section 1(b) of the Natural Gas Act of 1938, or NGA, exempts natural gas gathering facilities from the jurisdiction of the FERC. We own certain natural gas facilities that we believe meet the traditional tests the FERC has used to establish a facilitys status as a gatherer not subject to FERC jurisdiction. However, to the extent our gathering systems buy and sell natural gas that is processed or that can be sold into the market without being processed, such gatherers, in their capacity as buyers and sellers of natural gas, are subject to certain reporting requirements resulting from the FERC Order 704 series. 

16



 TABLE OF CONTENTS
 State regulations of gathering facilities typically address the safety and environmental concerns involved in the design, construction, installation, testing and operation of gathering facilities. In addition, in some circumstances, nondiscriminatory requirements are also addressed; however, state regulators have not historically taken an active role in setting or reviewing rates for gathering facilities absent a shipper protest. Many of the producing states have previously adopted some form of complaint-based regulation that generally allows natural gas producers and shippers to file complaints with state regulators in an effort to resolve grievances relating to natural gas gathering access or perceived rate discrimination. Our gathering operations could be adversely affected should they be subject in the future to significant and unduly burdensome state or federal regulation of rates and services. 
NGL Pipeline Regulation 
 The mainline and gathering portions of the Texas Express NGL system are common carriers subject to regulation by various federal agencies and/or the TRRC. The FERC regulates the interstate pipeline transportation of crude oil, petroleum products, and other liquids such as NGLs, collectively called petroleum pipelines. The FERC regulates these operations pursuant to the Interstate Commerce Act, or ICA, and the Energy Policy Act of 1992, or EP Act of 1992. The ICA and its implementing regulations require that tariff rates for interstate service on petroleum pipelines be just and reasonable and must not be unduly discriminatory or confer undue preference on any shipper. 
 The EP Act of 1992 required the FERC to establish a simplified and generally applicable ratemaking methodology for interstate petroleum pipelines. As a result, the FERC adopted an indexed rate methodology. If the rate levels on Texas Express NGL system were subject to formal review or challenge before the FERC, the Texas Express NGL system would be required to produce a traditional cost of service review justifying its revenues or demonstrate it lacks significant market power. 
 Two of our other NGL lines, which do not provide service to third parties, operate under FERC-granted waivers from the reporting requirements of Sections 6 and 20 of the ICA. These waivers are effective until a third party shipper requests service. In addition, certain of our NGL lines are subject to regulation as a common carrier by the TRRC. The TRRCs jurisdiction extends to both rates and pipeline safety. The rates we charge for NGL transportation service are deemed just and reasonable under Texas law unless challenged by a complaint. Complaints to state agencies have been infrequent and are usually informally resolved, but ongoing industry practice might indicate an increase in complaints and TRRC oversight. Although we cannot assure that our intrastate rates would ultimately be upheld if challenged, we believe that, given this history, the tariffs now in effect are not likely to be challenged or, if challenged, are not likely to be ordered to be reduced. 
 Sales of Natural Gas, Crude Oil, Condensate and Natural Gas Liquids 
 The price at which we sell natural gas currently is not subject to federal or state regulation except for certain systems in Texas. Our sales of natural gas are affected by the availability, terms and cost of pipeline transportation. As noted above, the price and terms of access to pipeline transportation are subject to extensive federal and state regulation. The FERC is continually proposing and implementing new rules and regulations affecting those segments of the natural gas industry, most notably interstate natural gas transmission companies that remain subject to the FERCs jurisdiction. These initiatives also may affect the intrastate transportation of natural gas under certain circumstances. The stated purpose of many of these regulatory changes is to promote competition among the various sectors of the natural gas industry and to facilitate price transparency in markets for the wholesale sale of physical natural gas. 
 Our sales of crude oil, condensate and NGLs currently are not regulated and are made at market prices. In a number of instances, however, the ability to transport and sell such products is dependent on pipelines whose rates, terms and conditions of service are subject to the FERCs jurisdiction under the ICA. Regulations implemented by the FERC could increase the cost of transportation service on certain petroleum products pipelines, however, we do not believe that these regulations will affect us any differently than other marketers of these products transporting on ICA-regulated pipelines. 
 Other Regulation 
 The governments of the United States and Canada have, by treaty, agreed to reduce barriers to foreign trade and stimulate the flow of goods and services between the United States and Canada, which includes the passage of oil and natural gas through the pipelines of one country across the territory of the other. Individual international border crossing points require United States government permits that may be terminated or amended at the 

17



 TABLE OF CONTENTS
 discretion of the United States Government. These permits provide that pipelines may be inspected by or subject to orders issued by federal and, on occasion, state government agencies. 
 FERC Tariffs and Transportation 
 Lakehead system 
 Under the published rate tariff as of December 31, 2016 for transportation on the Lakehead system, the rates for transportation of light, medium and heavy crude oil from the Canada-United States international border near Neche, North Dakota and from Clearbrook, Minnesota to principal delivery points are set forth below: 


 | Published Transportation Rate Per Barrel(1)
 | Light | | Medium | Heavy
From the international border near Neche, North Dakota: | | | | | | | 
To Clearbrook, Minnesota | $ | 0.4608 | | $ | 0.4884 | $ | 0.5370
To Superior, Wisconsin | $ | 0.9712 | | $ | 1.0377 | $ | 1.1540
To Chicago, Illinois area | $ | 2.1393 | | $ | 2.3011 | $ | 2.5849
To Marysville, Michigan area | $ | 2.5778 | | $ | 2.7746 | $ | 3.1201
To Buffalo, New York area | $ | 2.6415 | | $ | 2.8437 | $ | 3.1974
Clearbrook, Minnesota to Chicago | $ | 1.8906 | | $ | 2.0248 | $ | 2.2601


(1) | Pursuant to FERC Tariff No. 43.21.0 as filed with the FERC and with an effective date of July 1, 2016 (converted from $/cubic meters of liquid, or m3, to $/Barrel of liquids, or Bbl).
----+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The transportation rates as of December 31, 2016 for medium and heavy crude oil are higher than the transportation rates for light crude oil set forth in this table to compensate for differences in the costs of shipping different types and grades of liquid hydrocarbons. The Lakehead system periodically adjusts transportation rates as allowed under the FERCs index methodology and the tariff agreements described below. 
 Base Rates 
 The Lakehead systems base rates are subject to an annual adjustment, which cannot exceed established ceiling rates as approved by the FERC and are determined in compliance with the FERC approved index methodology. On May 31, 2016, Enbridge filed FERC tariff No. 43.21.0 that decreased rates in compliance with the indexed rate ceilings allowed by the FERC, which incorporates the multiplier of 0.979865 issued by the FERC on May 19, 2016 in Docket No. RM93-11-000. 
Facilities Surcharge Mechanism 
 In June 2004, the FERC approved an Offer of Settlement in Docket No. OR04-2-000 between Lakehead and CAPP, which implemented a Facilities Surcharge Mechanism, or FSM, to be calculated separately from and incrementally to the then-existing surcharges in its tariff rates. The FSM includes additional projects negotiated and agreed upon between Lakehead and CAPP as a transparent, cost-of-service based tariff mechanism. This allows the Lakehead system to recover the costs associated with particular shipper-requested projects through an incremental surcharge layered on top of the existing base rates. The FSM Settlement requires the Lakehead system to adjust the FSM annually to reflect the latest estimates for the upcoming year and to adjust for the difference between estimates and actual cost and throughput from the prior year. 
 The FERC approved the FSM to take effect as of July 1, 2004, and the FSM was expressly designed to be open-ended. In its approval of the FSM Settlement, the FERC accepted the Lakehead systems proposal to submit for FERC review and approval future agreements resulting from negotiations with CAPP where the parties have agreed that recovery of costs through the FSM is desirable and appropriate. At the time it was initially established, four projects were included in the FSM. Over the course of several years, the FERC subsequently approved the addition of new projects to the FSM, and as of December 31, 2016, 25 projects are included in the FSM. 
 On August 14, 2008, the FERC approved an Amendment to the FSM Settlement to allow the Lakehead system to include in the FSM particular shipper-requested projects that are not yet in service as of April 1 of each year, provided there is an annual adjustment for differences between actual and estimated throughput and costs. 
 On December 15, 2015, Enbridge filed a Supplement to the Settlement in Docket No. OR16-9-000 seeking approval for the recovery of a negotiated amount for the costs associated with the Interim Lakehead Operational Tank Service project. This project permits the recovery of a negotiated cost of $1.5 million per month for the

 provision of tank service. The FERC accepted the Supplement on February 1, 2016 to permit the recovery of the negotiated cost of $1.5 million per month for the provision of tank service. On February 29, 2016, Enbridge filed FERC tariff 43.20.0 which included the costs related to the monthly negotiated fee for the Interim Lakehead Operational Tank Services project. 
 On December 14, 2016, Enbridge filed a Supplement to the Settlement in Docket No. OR17-3-000 seeking approval to recover $30 million of early development costs related to the Line 61 Twin Project. 
 As of December 31, 2016, the FSM was $1.1899 per barrel for light crude oil movements from the Canada-United States international border near Neche, North Dakota to Chicago, Illinois. 
 International Joint Tariff 
 FERC Tariff No. 45.11.0, issued May 31, 2016, revised the International Joint Tariff, or IJT, effective July 1, 2016, by decreasing the transportation tolls by 0.46%. The IJT provides rates applicable to the transportation of petroleum from all receipt points in Western Canada on the Enbridge Pipelines Inc., or Enbridge Pipelines, Canadian Mainline system to all delivery points on the Lakehead Pipeline system owned by Enbridge Energy, Limited Partnership, or OLP, and to delivery points on the Canadian Mainline located downstream of the Lakehead system. In summary, the IJT provides a simplified tolling structure to cover transportation services that cross the international border and provides a rate that is equal to or less than the sum of the combined Canadian Mainline and Lakehead system rates on file and in effect. 
 FERC Tariff No. 45.12.0, issued July 22, 2016, revised the IJT, effective September 1, 2016, by adjusting certain expansion surcharges for negative inflation. 
 Mid-Continent system 
 The Ozark system is located in the Mid-Continent region of the United States. Specifically, the system originates in Cushing, Oklahoma, and offers transportation service to Wood River, Illinois. 
 Effective July 1, 2016, FERC Tariff No. 48.7.0 did not affect the transportation rate because the cost of service application Enbridge Ozark filed in 2015 used a test period that fell within the calendar year on which the 2016 index was based. Accordingly, the rate was not eligible for the index adjustment. The viscosity surcharge on that tariff decreased in compliance with the indexed rate ceilings allowed by the FERC, which incorporated the multiplier of 0.979865 issued by the FERC on May 19, 2016 in Docket No. RM93-11-000. However due to rounding, the viscosity surcharge remained unchanged on the tariff. 
 On December 15, 2016, Enbridge Ozark launched a public open season to offer approximately 115,000 barrels per day of expansion capacity on its system from Cushing, Oklahoma to Wood River, Illinois for committed volumes of crude petroleum that would not be subject to prorationing. The open season provided an opportunity for potential shippers to support the expansion by making minimum volume commitments for a ten-year term. The open season closed on January 19, 2017. In December 2016, we entered into an agreement to sell the Ozark pipeline system to a subsidiary of MPLX LP. For further details, see Item 1. Financial Statements, Note 11. Property, Plant and Equipment. 
 The transportation rate for light crude oil on the Ozark system is set forth below:

North Dakota system 
 The North Dakota Pipeline system consists of both gathering and trunkline assets. North Dakota Pipeline rates consist of a base rate that is subject to the annual FERC index, and two cost of service surcharges, the Phase 5 Looping and the Phase 6 surcharges, which are applicable to specific receipt and delivery points. In addition, the North Dakota Pipeline system includes both committed and uncommitted rates for service on the Bakken Project for deliveries to Berthold, North Dakota.

 TABLE OF CONTENTS
 Phase 5 Looping and Phase 6 Expansion Surcharges 
 Effective January 1, 2008, the looping surcharge was implemented as a part of the North Dakota Phase 5 expansion program, referred to as North Dakota Phase 5. The Phase 5 Offer of Settlement that was filed with the FERC for an expansion of the system was approved by the Commission on October 31, 2006 in Docket No. OR06-9-000. The Phase 5 Offer of Settlement outlined the looping surcharge as a cost-of-service based surcharge that is adjusted each year for differences between estimated and actual costs and throughput and is not subject to the FERC indexing methodology. This surcharge was initially applicable for five years immediately following the in-service date of North Dakota Phase 5, which was January 2008. The looping surcharge was applied to volumes originating at Trenton, Little Muddy or Alexander, North Dakota. Effective April 1, 2010, the term of the looping surcharge on the North Dakota system was extended by four years, and ended on December 31, 2016. The impact of the term extension reduced the looping surcharge substantially thereby moderating the rate impact on shippers. 
 The FERC approved the Phase 6 expansion Offer of Settlement submitted by Enbridge North Dakota on October 20, 2008, in Docket No. OR08-6-000. Under the terms of the settlement, expansion costs are recovered through a cost-of-service based surcharge on all shipments to Clearbrook, Minnesota. The surcharge was in addition to existing base rates and the Phase 5 surcharges and was adjusted on an annual basis to actual costs and throughput. It was not subject to the FERC index methodology. The Phase 6 surcharge became effective on January 1, 2010 and expired on December 31, 2016. 
 Phase 5 Looping and Phase 6 Surcharge Rate Adjustments 
 Effective April 1, 2016, FERC Tariff No. 3.18.0 updated the calculation of the Phase 5 Looping and Phase 6 surcharges. These cost-of-service based surcharges are adjusted each year to actual costs and throughput and are not subject to the FERC indexing methodology. The Phase 5 Looping surcharge increased by approximately $0.05 per barrel to $0.24 per barrel, primarily due to a decrease in forecasted throughput. The Phase 6 surcharge decreased by approximately $0.08 per barrel to $0.31 per barrel, primarily due to return of prior period over-recoveries to shippers. 
 FERC Tariff No. 3.22.0 was filed to reflect the December 31, 2016 expiration of the Phase 5 Looping surcharge and the Phase 6 surcharge, effective, January 1, 2017. Additionally, this tariff discounted four existing base system rates to Tioga, North Dakota. 
 The Bakken Loop Project 
 On August 26, 2010, the North Dakota system and Enbridge Pipelines (Bakken) L.P. filed a Petition for Declaratory Order seeking the approval of priority service for the North Dakota portion of the Bakken Loop Project as well as the overall tariff and rate structure for the United States portions of the program. The Petition for Declaratory Order was approved by the FERC on November 22, 2010 in Docket No. OR10-19-000, and the Bakken Loop Project went into service on March 1, 2013. The uncommitted trunkline rates to Berthold, North Dakota consist of a base rate whereas the committed trunkline rates consist of both a base committed rate and a flow-through operating cost charge component. 
The Bakken Loop Project Rate Adjustments 
 Effective July 1, 2016, in accordance with the Bakken Project Transportation Services Agreement, or TSA, FERC Tariff No. 3.20.0 adjusted the operating cost charge component of the committed trunkline rates to Berthold, North Dakota to the actual operating costs and throughput for 2015 and the forecasted operating costs and throughput for 2016. The operating cost charge decreased by $0.32 from $0.38 to $0.06. 
Base System Rate Adjustments 
 Effective March 1, 2016 FERC Tariff No. 2.6.0 established a Storage in Transit service at Minot, North Dakota which permits shippers to park crude petroleum and re-enter crude petroleum at a later date for transportation to Clearbrook, Minnesota. Nominations to the Minot Storage in Transit Site are subject to the applicable tariff rate from the initial receipt point to Clearbrook, Minnesota. 
Effective July 1, 2016, FERC Tariff No. 3.19.0 established new delivery points at Grenora, North Dakota to Grenora, Merchant Storage, North Dakota and Little Muddy, North Dakota to Little Muddy, Merchant Storage, North Dakota. 
 Effective July 1, 2016, FERC Tariff No. 3.20.0 decreased rates in compliance with the indexed rate ceilings allowed by the FERC, which incorporates the multiplier of 0.979865 issued by the FERC on May 19, 2016 in 

20



 TABLE OF CONTENTS
 Docket No. RM93-11-000. In addition, this tariff discounted the terminal charge for gathering or truck unloading at Little Muddy, North Dakota from the established 2016 ceiling rate of $0.22 to $0.01 per barrel. 
 Effective December 1, 2016 FERC Tariff No. 3.21.0 was filed to cancel trunkline transportation rates from Reserve, Montana to Clearbrook, Minnesota, Grenora, Merchant Storage, North Dakota, Tioga, North Dakota and Stanley, North Dakota, to reflect that the pipeline is no longer providing service from this receipt point. 
 The rates and surcharges for transportation of light crude oil on the North Dakota system are set forth below:

Bakken Pipeline 
 The Bakken Pipeline extends from Berthold, North Dakota to the international border near Portal, North Dakota. Tariff rates on the Bakken Pipeline consist of a local tariff with a local uncommitted rate for service to the international border, and an international joint tariff with both committed and uncommitted joint rates for service to Cromer, Manitoba. 
 As previously mentioned, the North Dakota system and Enbridge Pipelines (Bakken) L.P. filed a Petition for Declaratory Order seeking approval to provide priority service for the North Dakota portion of the Bakken pipeline as well as the overall tariff and rate structure for the U.S. portions of the Bakken pipeline. The Petition for Declaratory Order was approved by the FERC on November 22, 2010 in Docket No. OR10-19-000, and the Bakken pipeline went into service on March 1, 2013. 
 Local Tariff 
 Effective July 1, 2016, FERC Tariff No. 2.3.0 decreased rates in compliance with the indexed rate ceilings allowed by the FERC, which incorporates the multiplier of 0.979865 issued by the FERC on May 19, 2016, in Docket No. RM93-11-000.

 International Joint Tariff 
 Effective July 1, 2016, the Bakken system filed FERC Tariff No. 3.5.0. This filing was a compliance filing in accordance with transportation service agreements included in the Petition for Declaratory Order filed on August 26, 2010 in Docket No. OR10-19-000. This tariff included an adjustment for the operating cost charge, which is part of the committed rate structure. The committed rate structure consists of two components  a base committed rate and an operating cost charge. The operating cost charge is a flow-through of the related operating costs, and is based on throughput. The operating cost charge for Bakken as of July 1, 2016, increased by $0.65 from a credit of $0.12 to a charge of $0.53.

Safety Regulation and Environmental 
 General 
 Our transmission and gathering pipelines, storage and processing facilities and railcar operations are subject to extensive environmental, operational and safety regulation at the federal and state level. The added costs imposed by regulations are generally no different than those imposed on our competitors. The failure to comply with such rules and regulations can result in substantial penalties and/or enforcement actions and added operational costs. 
Pipeline Safety and Transportation Regulation 
 Our transmission and gathering pipelines are subject to regulation by the Department of Transportation, or DOT, and the Pipeline and Hazardous Material Safety Administration, or PHMSA, under the Pipeline Safety Act, or PSA, specifically Volume 49 of the Code of Federal Regulations, Parts 192 (gas) and 195 (hazardous liquids). The regulations pertain to the design, installation, testing, construction, operation, replacement and management of transmission and gathering pipeline facilities. PHMSA is the agency charged with regulating the safe transportation of hazardous materials under all modes of transportation, including interstate and intrastate pipelines. Periodically the PSA has been reauthorized and amended, imposing new mandates on the regulator to promulgate new regulations and imposing direct mandates on operators of pipelines. The most recent reauthorization occurred in 2016. 
 The National Transportation Safety Board has recommended that the PHMSA make a number of changes to its rules, including removing an exemption from most safety inspections for natural gas pipelines installed before 1970. Congress also has mandated that PHMSA adopt regulations to implement these recommendations, along with a number of additional regulatory measures. While we cannot predict the outcome of legislative or regulatory initiatives, such legislative and regulatory changes could have a material effect on our operations, particularly by extending through more stringent and comprehensive safety regulations (such as integrity management requirements) to pipelines and gathering lines not previously subject to such requirements. While we expect any legislative or regulatory changes to allow us time to become compliant with new requirements, costs associated with compliance may have a material effect on our operations. 

22



 TABLE OF CONTENTS
 We have incorporated all existing requirements into our programs by the required regulatory deadlines, and are continually incorporating any new requirements into procedures and budgets. We expect to incur increasing regulatory compliance costs, based on the intensification of the regulatory environment and upcoming changes to regulations as outlined above. 
 In addition to regulatory changes, costs may be incurred when there is an accidental release of a commodity transported by our system, or a regulatory inspection identifies a deficiency in our required programs. 
 When hydrocarbons are released into the environment or violations identified during an inspection, PHMSA may issue a civil penalty or enforcement action, which can require internal inspections, pipeline pressure reductions and other methods to manage or verify the integrity of a pipeline in the affected area. In addition, the National Transportation Safety Board, or NTSB, may perform an investigation of a significant accident to determine the probable cause and issue safety recommendations to prevent future accidents. Any release that results in an enforcement action or NTSB investigation, such as those associated with Line 6B near Marshall, Michigan and Line 14 near Grand Marsh, Wisconsin, could have a material impact on system throughput or compliance costs. As part of the Corrective Action Order, or CAO, related to the Grand Marsh release, we were required to develop and implement a comprehensive plan to address wide-ranging safety initiatives not only for Line 14, but for our entire Lakehead System. 
 We believe that our pipeline and railcar operations are in substantial compliance with applicable operational and safety requirements. In instances of non-compliance, we have taken actions to remediate the situations. Nevertheless, significant operating expenses and capital expenditure could be incurred in the future if additional safety measures are required or if safety standards are raised and exceed the capabilities of our current pipeline control system or other safety equipment. 
 Environmental Regulation 
 General.  Our operations are subject to complex federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of health and the environment, including laws and regulations that govern the handling, storage and release of crude oil and other liquid hydrocarbon materials or emissions from natural gas processing, treating, or compression facilities. As with the pipeline and processing industry in general, complying with current and anticipated environmental laws and regulations increases our overall cost of doing business, including our capital costs to construct, maintain and upgrade equipment and facilities. While these laws and regulations affect our maintenance capital expenditures and net income, we believe that they do not affect our competitive position since the operations of our competitors are generally similarly affected. 
 In addition to compliance costs, violations of environmental laws or regulations can result in the imposition of significant administrative, civil and criminal fines and penalties and, in some instances, injunctions, banning or delaying certain activities. We believe that our operations are in substantial compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations. 
 There are also risks of accidental releases into the environment associated with our operations, such as releases or spills of crude oil, natural gas liquids, natural gas or other substances from our pipelines or storage facilities. Such accidental releases could, to the extent not insured, subject us to substantial liabilities arising from environmental cleanup and restoration costs, claims made by neighboring landowners and other third parties for personal injury and property damage and fines, penalties or damages for related violations of environmental laws or regulations. 
 Although we are entitled, in certain circumstances, to indemnification from third parties for environmental liabilities relating to assets we acquired from those parties, these contractual indemnification rights are limited, and accordingly, we may be required to bear substantial environmental expenses. However, we believe that through our due diligence process, we identify and manage substantial issues. 
 Air and Water Emissions.  Our operations are subject to the Clean Air Act, or CAA, and the Clean Water Act, or CWA, and comparable state and local statutes. We anticipate, therefore, that we will incur costs in the next several years for air pollution control equipment and spill prevention measures in connection with maintaining existing facilities and obtaining permit approvals for any new or acquired facilities. The operations of our pipeline facilities subject to the Environmental Protection Agencys, or EPA, Spill Prevention, Control, and Countermeasures Rule are currently in substantial compliance. Our facilities subject to existing EPA Part 98 Subpart C and W Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program, or GHGRP, rules have reported emissions prior to the annual filing deadlines. 

23



 TABLE OF CONTENTS
 On October 22, 2015, the EPA finalized amendments to the GHGRP to include natural gas gathering and boosting systems, well completions, and blowdown emissions associated with transmission pipelines. The rule effective date for data collection was January 1, 2016 and reporting begins for calendar year 2017 for applicable facilities. 
 On October 31, 2016, the EPA finalized rule revisions in the Code of Federal Regulations, or CFR, relating to test methods and performance specifications impacting facilities with stationary spark ignition internal combustion engines. 
 In addition, on September 18, 2015, the EPA published a proposed rule, Subpart OOOOa, which would update the original 2012 standards to include additional reductions in methane and VOCs in the oil and gas industry. On June 3, 2016, EPA published NSPS OOOOa in the Federal Register which includes seven areas of applicability for previously unaffected sources. On July 15, 2016 fifteen states filed suit in the District of Columbia Circuit Court objecting the rule. The current compliance deadline for OOOOa is June 2017. 
 On October 22, 2015, the EPA responded to a petition made by the Environmental Integrity Project to include the oil and gas extraction industrial sector in the scope of covered sectors of Section 313 of the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act, commonly known as the Toxic Release Inventory, or TRI. On January 6, 2017, EPA proposed a rule to add all natural gas processing facilities meeting applicability thresholds as a covered sector. As part of the proposal, EPA declined to extend TRI reporting requirements to the oil and gas extraction activities. 
 The EPA has issued the Oil and Gas Information Request, or ICR, scoped to the oil and gas industry. MEP received notification of ICR on November 22, 2016 in which EPA will ask the oil and gas industry members to provide extensive information for EPA to develop regulations to further reduce methane and VOC emissions. EPA responses are due 180 days from receipt of the mailed ICR document. 
 On June 29, 2015, the EPA published the Clean Water Rule: Definition of Waters of the United States. The new rule is intended to clarify what is considered Waters of the United States, or WOTUS, with respect to discharges of pollutants, including fill material during construction and maintenance operations, to the covered water. This regulation is the subject of an ongoing legal challenge and has the potential to increase our operating and capital costs to construct, maintain and upgrade equipment and facilities. The Oil Pollution Act, or OPA, was enacted in 1990 and amends parts of the CWA and other statutes as they pertain to the prevention of and response to oil spills. Under the OPA, we could be subject to strict, joint and potentially unlimited liability for removal costs and other consequences of an oil spill from our facilities into navigable waters, along shorelines or in an exclusive economic zone of the United States. The OPA also imposes certain spill prevention, control and countermeasure requirements for many of our non-pipeline facilities, such as the preparation of detailed oil spill emergency response plans and the construction of dikes or other containment structures to prevent contamination of navigable or other waters in the event of an oil overflow, rupture or release. For our liquid pipeline facilities, the OPA imposes requirements for emergency plans to be prepared, submitted and approved by the DOT. For our non-transportation facilities, such as storage tanks that are not integral to our pipeline transportation system, the OPA regulations are promulgated by the EPA. We believe that we are in material compliance with these laws and regulations. 
 For all proposed rules, we will continue to track the progress through involvement in industry groups and will comply with regulatory requirements. We do not expect a material effect on our financial statements as a result of compliance efforts. 
 Hazardous Substances and Waste Management.  The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, or CERCLA (also known as the Superfund law), and similar state laws impose liability without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct, on certain classes of persons, including the owners or operators of waste disposal sites and companies that disposed or arranged for disposal of hazardous substances found at such sites. We may generate some wastes that fall within the definition of a hazardous substance. We may, therefore, be jointly and severally liable under CERCLA for all or part of any costs required to clean up and restore sites at which such wastes have been disposed. In addition, it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by hazardous substances or other pollutants released into the environment. Analogous state laws may apply to a broader range of substances than CERCLA and, in some instances, may offer fewer exemptions from liability. We have not received any notification that we may be potentially responsible for material cleanup costs under CERCLA or similar state laws.

 TABLE OF CONTENTS
 Site Remediation.  We own and operate a number of pipelines, gathering systems, storage facilities and processing facilities that have been used to transport, distribute, store and process crude oil, natural gas and other petroleum products. Many of our facilities were previously owned and operated by third parties whose handling, disposal and release of petroleum and waste materials were not under our control. The age of the facilities, combined with the past operating and waste disposal practices, which were standard for the industry and regulatory regime at the time, have resulted in soil and groundwater contamination at some facilities due to historical spills and releases. Such contamination is not unusual within the natural gas and petroleum industry. Historical contamination found on, under or originating from our properties may be subject to CERCLA, the Resource Conservation & Recovery Act and analogous state laws as described above. 
 Under these laws, we could incur substantial expense to remediate such contamination, including contamination caused by prior owners and operators. In addition, Enbridge Management, as the entity with managerial responsibility for us, could also be liable for such costs to the extent that we are unable to fulfill our obligations. We have conducted site investigations at some of our facilities to assess historical environmental issues, and we are currently addressing soil and groundwater contamination at various facilities through remediation and monitoring programs, with oversight by the applicable governmental agencies where appropriate. 
 EMPLOYEES 
 Neither we nor Enbridge Management have any employees. Our General Partner has delegated to Enbridge Management, pursuant to a delegation of control agreement, substantially all of the responsibility for our day-to-day management and operation. Our General Partner, however, retains certain functions and approval rights over our operations. To fulfill its management obligations, Enbridge Management has entered into agreements with Enbridge and several of its affiliates to provide Enbridge Management with the necessary services and support personnel who act on Enbridge Managements behalf as its agents. We are ultimately responsible for reimbursing these service providers based on the costs that they incur in performing these services. 
INSURANCE 
 Our operations are subject to many hazards inherent in the liquid petroleum and natural gas gathering, treating, processing and transportation industry. Our assets may experience physical damage as a result of an accident or natural disaster. These hazards can also cause personal injury and loss of life, severe damage to and destruction of property and equipment, pollution or environmental damage, and suspension of operations. We maintain commercial liability insurance coverage that is consistent with coverage considered customary for our industry. We are included in the comprehensive insurance program that is maintained by Enbridge for its subsidiaries through the policy renewal date of May 1, 2017. The insurance coverage also includes property insurance coverage on our assets that includes earnings interruption resulting from an insurable event, except for pipeline assets that are not located at water crossings. In the unlikely event multiple insurable incidents occur which exceed coverage limits within the same insurance period, the total insurance coverage will be allocated among the Enbridge entities on an equitable basis based on an insurance allocation agreement we have entered into with Enbridge and other Enbridge subsidiaries. 
 The insurance policy coverage limits and deductible amounts at December 31, 2016 for Enbridge, Inc. and its subsidiaries are: 


Insurance Type | Coverage Limits | | Deductible Amount
 | (in millions) 
Property and business interruption | | Up to $650.0 | | $ | 10.0
General liability | | Up to $900.0 | | $ | 0.1 
Pollution liability (as included under General Liability) | | Up to $900.0 | | $ | 30.0

 We can make no assurance that the insurance coverage we maintain will be available or adequate for any particular risk or loss or that we will be able to maintain adequate insurance in the future at rates we consider reasonable. Although we believe that our assets are adequately covered by insurance, a substantial uninsured loss could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.

 TAXATION 
 We are not a taxable entity for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Generally, U.S. federal and state income taxes on our taxable income are borne by our individual partners through the allocation of our taxable income. In a limited number of states, an income tax is imposed upon us and generally, not our individual partners. The income tax that we bear is reflected in our consolidated financial statements. The allocation of taxable income to our individual partners may vary substantially from net income reported in our consolidated statements of income.
