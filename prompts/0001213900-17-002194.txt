Company History
 
In July 2015, we issued 10,062,500 shares of common stock (“founders’ shares”) to Capitol Acquisition Management 3 LLC and Capitol Acquisition Founder 3 LLC (our “sponsors”) for $25,000 in cash, at a purchase price of approximately $0.002 share, in connection with our organization. Capitol Acquisition Management 3 LLC and Capitol Acquisition Founder 3 LLC subsequently transferred a portion of these founders’ shares to certain individuals, including our independent directors, for the same purchase price originally paid for such shares. In October 2015, our sponsors then contributed back to our capital, for no additional consideration, an aggregate of 1,437,500 founders’ shares, leaving our initial stockholders, including our sponsors and directors, with an aggregate of 8,625,000 founders’ shares. This number included an aggregate of 1,125,000 shares that were subject to forfeiture if the underwriters’ over-allotment option was not exercised in full in our initial public offering (“Offering”).
 
On October 19, 2015, we consummated the Offering of 32,500,000 units, including 2,500,000 units under the underwriters’ over-allotment option, with each unit consisting of one share of common stock and one half of one warrant, each whole warrant to purchase one share of common stock. An aggregate of 500,000 founders’ shares were forfeited based on the amount of units sold pursuant to the overallotment. The shares of common stock and the warrants included in the units traded as a unit until December 6, 2015 when separate trading of common stock and warrants began. No fractional warrants were or will be issued and only whole warrants will trade. Holders now have the option to continue to hold units or separate their units into the component pieces. Each whole warrant entitles its holder, upon exercise, to purchase one share of common stock for $11.50 subject to certain adjustments, during the period commencing 30 days after we complete an initial business combination and terminating on the five-year anniversary of the completion of our initial business combination. The units were sold at an offering price of $10.00 per unit, generating gross proceeds of $325,000,000.

Simultaneously with the consummation of the Offering, we consummated the private placement (“Private Placement”) of 8,250,000 warrants (“founders’ warrants”) at a price of $1.00 per warrant, generating total proceeds of $8,250,000. The founders’ warrants are identical to the warrants included in the units sold in the Offering except that the founders’ warrants: (i) are not redeemable by us and (ii) are exercisable for cash or on a cashless basis, in each case so long as they are held by the initial purchasers or any of their permitted transferees. The purchasers of the founders’ warrants have also agreed not to transfer, assign or sell any of the founders’ warrants, including the common stock issuable upon exercise of the founders’ warrants (except to certain permitted transferees), until 30 days after the completion of an initial business combination.
 
We paid a total of $6.5 million in underwriting discounts and commissions and $834,447 for other costs and expenses related to our formation and the Offering.
 
After deducting the underwriting discounts and commissions and the offering expenses, the total net proceeds to us from the Offering were $317,665,553 and net proceeds from the Private Placement were $8,250,000 (up to an additional $11,375,000 of deferred underwriting expenses may be paid upon the completion of a business combination). Of these amounts, $325,000,000 we received from the sale of units in the Offering and the Private Placement of founders’ warrants was deposited into a trust account. Except as described in this Form 10-K, these funds will not be released to us until the earlier of the completion of a business combination or our liquidation upon our failure to consummate a business combination within the required time period (which may not occur until October 19, 2017).
 
Business Strategy
 
We have identified the following criteria and guidelines that we believe are important in evaluating prospective target businesses. While these are being used in evaluating business combination opportunities, we may decide to enter into a business combination with a target business(es) that does not meet all of the criteria and guidelines.
 
Growth Orientation. We intend to acquire companies that we expect to experience substantial growth post-acquisition. We believe that we are well-positioned to evaluate a company’s current growth prospects and opportunities to enhance its growth post-acquisition.
 
Strong Competitive Position in Industry. We intend to acquire businesses that have developed leading positions within industries that exhibit strong fundamentals. We evaluate each industry based on several factors including its growth characteristics, competitive landscape, profitability margins and sustainability. We also analyze the strengths and weaknesses of target businesses relative to their competitors in order to identify those best positioned to grow their market share and profitability.
 
Hidden Intrinsic Value. We are seeking situations where we are able to acquire target companies that have unseen value or other characteristics that have been disregarded by the marketplace. We intend to leverage the operational experience and financial acumen of our team to focus on unlocking value others may have overlooked, as a means to generate significant growth post-closing.
 
Attractive Return on Investment. We intend to identify businesses that will offer an attractive risk-adjusted return on investment for our shareholders. We will look to consummate an acquisition on attractive terms and to use our corporate structure as an asset in negotiations with owners of prospective targets. Financial returns are evaluated based on both organic cash flow growth potential and an ability to create value through new initiatives such as future acquisitions, repositioning the company, increasing investment in new products or distribution channels and operational restructuring. This potential upside from growth in the business is weighed against the downside risks inherent in the plan and in the business.
 
Outstanding Management Team. We believe that experienced, proven entrepreneurial managers working as a complementary team are a critical component to creating and sustaining long-term value. We are looking for businesses that have management teams with a proven track record for delivering top line growth and bottom line profits, but, in each situation, we assess opportunities to improve a target’s management team and to recruit additional talent through our extensive network of contacts.
 
Competitive Strengths
 
We believe we have the following competitive strengths:
 
Status as a public company
 
We believe our structure makes us an attractive business combination partner to target businesses. As an existing public company, we offer a target business an alternative to the traditional initial public offering through a merger or other business combination. In this situation, the owners of the target business would exchange their shares of stock in the target business for shares of our stock or for a combination of shares of our stock and cash. We believe target businesses might find this method a more certain and cost effective method to becoming a public company than the typical initial public offering. In a typical initial public offering, there are additional expenses incurred in marketing, roadshow and public reporting efforts that will likely not be present to the same extent in connection with a business combination with us. Furthermore, once the business combination is consummated, the target business will have effectively become public, whereas an initial public offering is always subject to the underwriters’ ability to complete the offering, as well as general market conditions, that could prevent the offering from occurring. Once public, we believe the target business would then have greater access to capital and an additional means of providing management incentives consistent with stockholders’ interests than it would have as a privately-held company. It can offer further benefits by augmenting a company’s profile among potential new customers and vendors and aid in attracting talented employees.

While we believe that our status as a public company makes us an attractive business partner, some potential target businesses may view the inherent limitations in our status as a blank check company as a deterrent and may prefer to effect a business combination with a more established entity or with a private company. These inherent limitations include limitations on our available financial resources, which may be inferior to those of other entities pursuing the acquisition of similar target businesses; the requirement that we seek shareholder approval of a business combination, which may delay the consummation of a transaction; and the existence of our outstanding warrants, which may represent a source of future dilution.
 
Financial position
 
With a trust account initially in the amount of approximately $325,000,000 (including $11,375,000 of deferred underwriting commissions), we offer a target business a variety of options. Having these funds could allow us to structure a business combination where a portion of the consideration payable to owners of a target business is paid in cash. Such funds could also provide capital for the potential growth and expansion of our target’s operations or strengthening its balance sheet by reducing its debt burden. Because we are able to consummate our initial business combination using our cash, debt or equity securities, or a combination of the foregoing, we have the flexibility to use the most efficient combination that will allow us to tailor the consideration to be paid to the target business to fit its needs and desires.
 
Management Expertise and Prior Blank Check Experience
 
We seek to capitalize on the extensive experience and significant contacts of our executive officers in consummating an initial business combination. Mark D. Ein, our Chief Executive Officer, has 25 years of private equity and venture capital investing experience, and L. Dyson Dryden, our President and Chief Financial Officer, has over 16 years of investment banking and investing experience.
 
Over the past nine years, Mr. Ein and Mr. Dryden have successfully executed two public acquisition vehicles.
 
Capitol Acquisition Corp., or Capitol I, was a special purpose acquisition company that completed its initial public offering in June 2007. Mr. Ein was the founder, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Capitol I. Capitol I completed its business combination with Two Harbors Investment Corp., or Two Harbors, a Maryland real estate investment trust, in October 2009. Two Harbors was a newly formed shell company established to focus on residential mortgage backed securities in partnership with Pine River Capital Management L.P. Mr. Ein played the lead role in Capitol I’s search for a target business and in consummating its business combination, including, among other things, assisting in identifying and evaluating numerous prospective target businesses, including the ultimate target, and the business plan presented by its control persons, and assisting in the solicitation of stockholder approval for such a transaction. While Mr. Ein did not evaluate the specific assets that Two Harbors anticipated acquiring prior to consummation of the business combination with Capitol I, nor has he evaluated the specific assets that Two Harbors has since acquired, Mr. Ein served as Vice-Chairman of the board of directors from October 2009 to May 2015. In addition, CLA Founders LLC, an entity controlled by Mr. Ein and for which he plays an active role, provided services as sub-manager to the manager of Two Harbors (PRCM Advisers LLC) pursuant to a Sub-Management Agreement that was entered into in connection with the transaction. Mr. Dryden served as Capitol I’s financial advisor throughout the search process and assisted with the execution of the Two Harbors transaction.
 
Capitol Acquisition Corp. II, or Capitol II, was a special purpose acquisition company that completed its initial public offering in May 2013. Mr. Ein was the Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer, Treasurer and Secretary and Mr. Dryden was Chief Financial Officer and Director of Capitol II. Capitol II completed its business combination with Lindblad Expeditions, Inc. in July 2015. Lindblad Expeditions provides expedition cruising and adventure travel experiences. Lindblad Expeditions works in partnership with National Geographic to inspire people to explore and care about the planet. The partnership’s educationally oriented voyages allow guests to interact with and learn from leading scientists, naturalists and researchers while discovering stunning natural environments, above and below the sea, through state-of-the-art exploration tools. Since the closing of the business combination, Mr. Ein continues to serve as the Chairman of the Board and Mr. Dryden as a member of the board of Lindblad Expeditions. Lindblad’s common stock is traded on the NASDAQ under the symbol LIND and its public warrants are traded on the NASDAQ under the symbol LINDW.
 
Messrs. Ein and Dryden together lead Capitol II’s search for a target business and in consummating its business combination, including, among other things, assisting in identifying and evaluating numerous prospective target businesses, including the ultimate target, and assisting in the solicitation of stockholder approval for such a transaction.

Effecting a Business Combination
 
General
 
We are not presently engaged in, and we will not engage in, any substantive commercial business for an indefinite period of time. We intend to utilize cash derived from the proceeds of our Offering and the Private Placement, our share capital, debt or a combination of these in effecting a business combination. Although substantially all of the net proceeds of our Offering and the Private Placement will be applied generally toward effecting a business combination as described in the prospectus for our Offering and this Form 10-K, the proceeds have not been otherwise designated for any more specific purposes. Accordingly, our investors do not have the opportunity to evaluate the specific merits or risks of any one or more business combinations prior to making an investment in us. A business combination may involve the acquisition of, or merger with, a company which does not need substantial additional capital but which desires to establish a public trading market for its shares, while avoiding what it may deem to be adverse consequences of undertaking a public offering itself. These include time delays, significant expense, loss of voting control and compliance with various Federal and state securities laws. In the alternative, we may seek to consummate a business combination with a company that may be financially unstable or in its early stages of development or growth. While we may seek to effect simultaneous business combinations with more than one target business, we will probably have the ability, as a result of our limited resources, to effect only a single business combination.
Sources of Target Businesses
 
We anticipate that target business candidates will be brought to our attention from various unaffiliated sources, including investment bankers, venture capital funds, private equity funds, leveraged buyout funds, management buyout funds and other members of the financial community. Target businesses may be brought to our attention by such unaffiliated sources as a result of being solicited by us through calls, advertisements or mailings. These sources may also introduce us to target businesses they think we may be interested in on an unsolicited basis, since many of these sources will have read the prospectus for our Offering and know what types of businesses we are targeting. Our officers and directors, as well as their affiliates, may also bring to our attention target business candidates that they become aware of through their business contacts as a result of formal or informal inquiries or discussions they may have, as well as attending trade shows or conventions. Our management has experience in evaluating transactions, but will retain advisors as they deem necessary to assist them in their due diligence efforts. In no event, however, will any of our officers, directors or sponsors, or any entity with which they are affiliated, be paid any finder’s fee, consulting fee or other compensation prior to, or for any services they render in order to effectuate, the consummation of a business combination (regardless of the type of transaction that it is) other than the $10,000 monthly aggregate rent and administrative services fee, the payment of consulting or success fees (none of which payments will be made from the proceeds of the Offering held in the trust account prior to the completion of our initial business combination) and reimbursement of any out-of-pocket expenses. If we determine to enter into a business combination with a target business that is affiliated with our officers, directors or sponsors or their affiliates, we would do so only if such transaction is approved by a majority of our disinterested independent directors and we obtained an opinion from an independent investment banking firm that the business combination is fair to our unaffiliated shareholders from a financial point of view.
 
Selection of a Target Business and Structuring of a Business Combination
 
Subject to the limitations that a target business have a fair market value of at least 80% of the balance in the trust account (excluding the deferred underwriting commissions and taxes payable on the income earned on the trust account) at the time of the execution of a definitive agreement for our initial business combination, and that we must acquire a controlling interest in the target business, our management will have virtually unrestricted flexibility in identifying and selecting a prospective target business. Except for the general criteria and guidelines set forth above under the caption “Business Strategy,” we have not established any specific attributes or criteria (financial or otherwise) for prospective target businesses. In evaluating a prospective target business, our management may consider a variety of factors, including one or more of the following:
 

● | financial condition and results of operation; 
--+--------------------------------------------------


● | growth potential; 
--+----------------------


● | brand recognition and potential; 
--+-------------------------------------


● | experience and skill of management and availability of additional personnel; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | capital requirements; 
--+--------------------------


● | competitive position; 
--+--------------------------


● | barriers to entry; 
--+-----------------------


● | stage of development of its products, processes or services; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------


4
-


● | existing distribution and potential for expansion; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------


● | degree of current or potential market acceptance of the products, processes or services; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | proprietary aspects of products and the extent of intellectual property or other protection for its products, processes or services; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | impact of regulation on the business; 
--+------------------------------------------


● | regulatory environment of the industry; 
--+--------------------------------------------


● | costs associated with effecting the business combination; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------


● | industry leadership, sustainability of market share and attractiveness of market industries in which a target business participates; and 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | macro competitive dynamics in the industry within which the company competes. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
We believe such factors will be important in evaluating prospective target businesses. We will generally use these criteria and guidelines in evaluating acquisition opportunities although this list is not intended to be exhaustive. Furthermore, we may decide to enter into a business combination with a target business that does not meet these criteria and guidelines.
 
Any evaluation relating to the merits of a particular business combination will be based, to the extent relevant, on the above factors as well as other considerations deemed relevant by our management in effecting a business combination consistent with our business objective. In evaluating a prospective target business, we will conduct an extensive due diligence review which will encompass, among other things, meetings with incumbent management and inspection of facilities, as well as review of financial and other information which is made available to us. This due diligence review will be conducted either by our management or by unaffiliated third parties we may engage.
 
The time and costs required to select and evaluate a target business and to structure and complete the business combination cannot presently be ascertained with any degree of certainty. Any costs incurred with respect to the identification and evaluation of a prospective target business with which a business combination is not ultimately completed will result in a loss to us and reduce the amount of capital available to otherwise complete a business combination.
 
Fair Market Value of Target Business
 
The target business or businesses that we acquire must collectively have a fair market value equal to at least 80% of the balance of the funds in the trust account (excluding the deferred underwriting commissions and taxes payable on the income earned on the trust account) at the time of the execution of a definitive agreement for our initial business combination, although we may acquire a target business whose fair market value significantly exceeds 80% of the trust account balance.
 
We currently anticipate structuring a business combination to acquire 100% of the equity interests or assets of the target business or businesses. We may, however, structure our initial business combination where we merge directly with the target business or where we acquire less than 100% of such interests or assets of the target business in order to meet certain objectives of the target management team or shareholders or for other reasons, but we will only complete such business combination if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act. Even if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the voting securities of the target, our stockholders prior to the business combination may collectively own a minority interest in the post-transaction company, depending on valuations ascribed to the target and us in the business combination transaction. For example, we could pursue a transaction in which we issue a substantial number of new shares in exchange for all of the outstanding capital stock of a target. In this case, we could acquire a 100% controlling interest in the target; however, as a result of the issuance of a substantial number of new shares, our stockholders immediately prior to our initial business combination could own less than a majority of our outstanding shares subsequent to our initial business combination. If less than 100% of the equity interests or assets of a target business or businesses are owned or acquired by the post-transaction company, the portion of such business or businesses that is owned or acquired is what will be valued for purposes of the 80% of trust account balance test. In order to consummate such an acquisition, we may issue a significant amount of our debt or equity securities to the sellers of such businesses and/or seek to raise additional funds through a private offering of debt or equity securities. Since we have no specific business combination under consideration, we have not entered into any such fund raising arrangement and have no current intention of doing so. The fair market value of the target will be determined by our board of directors based upon one or more standards generally accepted by the financial community (such as actual and potential sales, earnings, cash flow and/or book value). The proxy solicitation materials used by us in connection with any proposed transaction will provide public stockholders with our analysis of the fair market value of the target business, as well as the basis for our determinations. If our board is not able to independently determine that the target business has a sufficient fair market value, we will obtain an opinion from an unaffiliated, independent investment banking firm with respect to the satisfaction of such criteria.
 

5
-

 

We will not be required to obtain an opinion from an investment banking firm as to the fair market value if our board of directors independently determines that the target business complies with the 80% threshold.
 
Prior to approval of a business combination, our board of directors will determine whether the transaction is fair to and in the best interests of us and our stockholders. We will disclose the basis of our board of director’s determination in the proxy solicitation materials distributed to stockholders in connection with the business combination.
 
Lack of Business Diversification
 
We may seek to effect a business combination with more than one target business, and there is no required minimum valuation standard for any target at the time of such acquisition. We expect to complete only a single business combination, although this process may entail the simultaneous acquisitions of several operating businesses. Therefore, at least initially, the prospects for our success may be entirely dependent upon the future performance of a single business operation. Unlike other entities which may have the resources to complete several business combinations of entities operating in multiple industries or multiple areas of a single industry, it is probable that we will not have the resources to diversify our operations or benefit from the possible spreading of risks or offsetting of losses. By consummating a business combination with only a single entity, our lack of diversification may:

● | subject us to numerous economic, competitive and regulatory developments, any or all of which may have a substantial adverse impact upon the particular industry in which we may operate subsequent to a business combination, and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | result in our dependency upon the performance of a single operating business or the development or market acceptance of a single or limited number of products, processes or services. 

 
If we determine to simultaneously acquire several businesses and such businesses are owned by different sellers, we will need for each of such sellers to agree that our purchase of its business is contingent on the simultaneous closings of the other acquisitions, which may make it more difficult for us, and delay our ability, to complete the business combination. With multiple acquisitions, we could also face additional risks, including additional burdens and costs with respect to possible multiple negotiations and due diligence investigations (if there are multiple sellers) and the additional risks associated with the subsequent assimilation of the operations and services or products of the acquired companies in a single operating business.
 
Limited Ability to Evaluate the Target Business’ Management
 
Although we intend to scrutinize the management of a prospective target business when evaluating the desirability of effecting a business combination, we cannot assure you that our assessment of the target business’ management will prove to be correct. In addition, we cannot assure you that the future management will have the necessary skills, qualifications or abilities to manage a public company. Furthermore, the future role of our officers and directors, if any, in the target business following a business combination cannot presently be stated with any certainty. While it is possible that some of our key personnel will remain associated in senior management or advisory positions with us following a business combination, it is unlikely that they will devote their full time efforts to our affairs subsequent to a business combination. Moreover, they would only be able to remain with the company after the consummation of a business combination if they are able to negotiate employment or consulting agreements in connection with the business combination. Such negotiations would take place simultaneously with the negotiation of the business combination and could provide for them to receive compensation in the form of cash payments and/or our securities for services they would render to the company after the consummation of the business combination. The personal and financial interests of our key personnel may influence their motivation in identifying and selecting a target business. Additionally, we cannot assure you that our officers and directors will have significant experience or knowledge relating to the operations of the particular target business.
 
Following a business combination, we may seek to recruit additional managers to supplement the incumbent management of the target business. We cannot assure you that we will have the ability to recruit additional managers, or that any such additional managers we do recruit will have the requisite skills, knowledge or experience necessary to enhance the incumbent management.
 
Stockholder Approval of Business Combination
 
In connection with any proposed business combination, we will seek stockholder approval of an initial business combination at a meeting called for such purpose at which stockholders may seek to convert their shares, regardless of whether they vote for or against the proposed business combination, into their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account as of two business days prior to the consummation of the initial business combination, less any taxes then due but not yet paid, subject to the limitations described herein. As of December 31, 2016, there was approximately $325,732,000 in the trust account (including approximately $165,000 of accrued interest and $567,000 in cash from interest earned available to pay taxes). We will consummate our initial business combination only if we have net tangible assets of at least $5,000,001 upon such consummation and a majority of the outstanding shares of common stock voted are voted in favor of the business combination.

6
-

 

Our sponsors, officers and directors have agreed (i) to vote any shares owned by them in favor of any proposed business combination and (ii) not to convert any shares in connection with a stockholder vote to approve a proposed initial business combination. No minimum number of public shares is required to be voted in favor of a business combination. Because a business combination may be approved by a majority of the outstanding shares voted, under certain circumstances a business combination could be approved without the affirmative vote of any of our public shares. Notwithstanding, all of our public stockholders will have the right to convert their shares into cash in connection with a business combination.
 
None of our officers, directors, sponsors or their affiliates has indicated any intention to purchase any units or shares of common stock from persons in the open market or in private transactions. However, if a significant number of stockholders votes, or indicates an intention to vote, against such proposed business combination, our officers, directors, sponsors or their affiliates could make such purchases in the open market or in private transactions in order to influence the vote. The purpose of such arrangements would be to increase the likelihood of satisfaction of the requirements that the holders of a majority of our shares of common stock outstanding vote in favor of a proposed business combination and that we have at least $5,000,001 of net tangible assets upon consummation of such business combination where it appears that such requirements would otherwise not be met. All shares purchased by our sponsors, officers, directors or their affiliates would be voted in favor of the proposed business combination. No such arrangements currently exist.
 
Conversion Rights
 
In connection with any proposed initial business combination, public stockholders may seek to convert their shares, regardless of whether they vote for or against the proposed business combination, into their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, less any taxes then due but not yet paid.
 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, a public stockholder, together with any affiliate of his or any other person with whom he is acting in concert or as a “group” (as defined in Section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act) will be restricted from seeking conversion rights with respect to 20% or more of the shares of common stock sold in the Offering. Such a public stockholder would still be entitled to vote against a proposed business combination with respect to all shares of common stock owned by him or his affiliates. We believe this restriction will prevent stockholders from accumulating large blocks of shares before the vote held to approve a proposed business combination and attempt to use the conversion right as a means to force us or our management to purchase their shares at a significant premium to the then current market price. By limiting a stockholder’s ability to convert no more than 20% of the shares of common stock sold in the Offering, we believe we have limited the ability of a small group of stockholders to unreasonably attempt to block a transaction which is favored by our other public stockholders.
 
Our sponsors, officers and directors will not have conversion rights with respect to any shares of common stock owned by them, directly or indirectly.
 
We may also require public stockholders, whether they are a record holder or hold their shares in “street name,” to either tender their certificates to our transfer agent at any time through the vote on the business combination or to deliver their shares to the transfer agent electronically using Depository Trust Company’s DWAC (Deposit/Withdrawal At Custodian) System, at the holder’s option.
 
There is a nominal cost associated with the above-referenced delivery process and the act of certificating the shares or delivering them through the DWAC System. The transfer agent will typically charge the tendering broker $45.00 and it would be up to the broker whether or not to pass this cost on to the holder. However, this fee would be incurred regardless of whether or not we require holders seeking to exercise conversion rights. The need to deliver shares is a requirement of exercising conversion rights regardless of the timing of when such delivery must be effectuated. However, in the event we require stockholders seeking to exercise conversion rights prior to the consummation of the proposed business combination and the proposed business combination is not consummated this may result in an increased cost to stockholders.
 
The proxy solicitation materials that we will furnish to stockholders in connection with the vote for any proposed business combination will indicate whether we are requiring stockholders to satisfy such certification and delivery requirements. Accordingly, a stockholder would have from the time the stockholder received our proxy statement through the vote on the business combination to deliver his shares if he wishes to seek to exercise his conversion rights. This time period varies depending on the specific facts of each transaction. However, as the delivery process can be accomplished by the stockholder, whether or not he is a record holder or his shares are held in “street name,” in a matter of hours by simply contacting the transfer agent or his broker and requesting delivery of his shares through the DWAC System, we believe this time period is sufficient for an average investor. However, we cannot assure you of this fact.
 
The foregoing is different from the procedures used by many blank check companies. Traditionally, in order to perfect conversion rights in connection with a blank check company’s business combination, the company would distribute proxy materials for the stockholders’ vote on an initial business combination, and a holder could simply vote against a proposed business combination and check a box on the proxy card indicating such holder was seeking to exercise his conversion rights. After the business combination was approved, the company would contact such stockholder to arrange for him to deliver his certificate to verify ownership. As a result, the stockholder then had an “option window” after the consummation of the business combination during which he could monitor the price of the company’s stock in the market. If the price rose above the conversion price, he could sell his shares in the open market before actually delivering his shares to the company for cancellation. As a result, the conversion rights, to which stockholders were aware they needed to commit before the stockholder meeting, would become a “continuing” right surviving past the consummation of the business combination until the holder delivered its certificate. The requirement for physical or electronic delivery prior to the meeting ensures that a holder’s election to convert his shares is irrevocable once the business combination is approved.

Any request to convert such shares once made, may be withdrawn at any time up to the vote on the proposed business combination. Furthermore, if a holder of a public share of common stock delivered his certificate in connection with an election of their conversion and subsequently decides prior to the applicable date not to elect to exercise such rights, he may simply request that the transfer agent return the certificate (physically or electronically).
 
If the initial business combination is not approved or completed for any reason, then our public stockholders who elected to exercise their conversion rights would not be entitled to convert their shares for the applicable pro rata share of the trust account. In such case, we will promptly return any shares delivered by public holders.
 
Liquidation if No Business Combination
 
Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that we have only until October 19, 2017 to complete an initial business combination. If we do not complete an initial business combination by such date, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that we will (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem 100% of the outstanding public shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including any interest but net of franchise and income taxes payable (less up to $100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses), divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public stockholders’ rights as stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidation distributions, if any), subject to applicable law, and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining stockholders and our board of directors, dissolve and liquidate, subject (in the case of (ii) and (iii) above) to our obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law.
 
Our sponsors, officers and directors have agreed that they will not propose any amendment to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation that would affect the substance or timing of our obligation to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete a business combination by October 19, 2017 unless we provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to convert their shares of common stock upon such approval at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including interest not previously released to us but net of franchise and income taxes payable, divided by the number of then outstanding public shares. This redemption right shall apply in the event of the approval of any such amendment, whether proposed by our sponsors, any executive officer, director or director nominee, or any other person.
 
Under the Delaware General Corporation Law, stockholders may be held liable for claims by third parties against a corporation to the extent of distributions received by them in a dissolution. The pro rata portion of our trust account distributed to our public stockholders upon the redemption of 100% of our outstanding public shares in the event we do not complete our initial business combination within the required time period may be considered a liquidation distribution under Delaware law. If the corporation complies with certain procedures set forth in Section 280 of the Delaware General Corporation Law intended to ensure that it makes reasonable provision for all claims against it, including a 60-day notice period during which any third-party claims can be brought against the corporation, a 90-day period during which the corporation may reject any claims brought, and an additional 150-day waiting period before any liquidating distributions are made to stockholders, any liability of stockholders with respect to a liquidating distribution is limited to the lesser of such stockholder’s pro rata share of the claim or the amount distributed to the stockholder, and any liability of the stockholder would be barred after the third anniversary of the dissolution.
 
Furthermore, if the pro rata portion of our trust account distributed to our public stockholders upon the redemption of 100% of our public shares in the event we do not complete our initial business combination within the required time period is not considered a liquidation distribution under Delaware law and such redemption distribution is deemed to be unlawful, then pursuant to Section 174 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, the statute of limitations for claims of creditors could then be six years after the unlawful redemption distribution, instead of three years, as in the case of a liquidation distribution. If we are unable to complete a business combination within the prescribed time frame, we will (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem 100% of the outstanding public shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including any interest but net of franchise and income taxes payable, divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public stockholders’ rights as stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidation distributions, if any), subject to applicable law and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining stockholders and our board of directors, dissolve and liquidate, subject (in the case of (ii) and (iii) above) to our obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. Accordingly, it is our intention to redeem our public shares as soon as reasonably possible following October 19, 2017 and, therefore, we do not intend to comply with those procedures. As such, our stockholders could potentially be liable for any claims to the extent of distributions received by them (but no more) and any liability of our stockholders may extend well beyond the third anniversary of such date.

Because we will not be complying with Section 280 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, Section 281(b) of the Delaware General Corporation Law requires us to adopt a plan, based on facts known to us at such time that will provide for our payment of all existing and pending claims or claims that may be potentially brought against us within the subsequent ten years. However, because we are a blank check company, rather than an operating company, and our operations will be limited to searching for prospective target businesses to acquire, the only likely claims to arise would be from our vendors (such as lawyers, investment bankers, etc.) or prospective target businesses.
 
We are required to have all third parties (including any vendors or other entities we engage) and any prospective target businesses enter into valid and enforceable agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind they may have in or to any monies held in the trust account. As a result, the claims that could be made against us will be limited, thereby lessening the likelihood that any claim would result in any liability extending to the trust. We therefore believe that any necessary provision for creditors will be reduced and should not have a significant impact on our ability to distribute the funds in the trust account to our public stockholders. Nevertheless, we cannot assure you of this fact as there is no guarantee that vendors, service providers and prospective target businesses will execute such agreements. Nor is there any guarantee that, even if they execute such agreements with us, they will not seek recourse against the trust account. Our executive officers have agreed that they will be personally liable to pay debts and obligations to target businesses or vendors or other entities that are owed money by us for services rendered or contracted for or products sold to us, but we cannot assure you that they will be able to satisfy their indemnification obligations if they are required to do so. Additionally the agreement they entered into by our executive officers specifically provides for two exceptions to the personal indemnity they have given: they will have no personal liability (1) as to any claimed amounts owed to a target business or vendor or other entity who has executed a valid and enforceable agreement with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind they may have in or to any monies held in the trust account, or (2) as to any claims under our indemnity with the underwriters of our Offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. As a result, if we liquidate, the per-share distribution from the trust account could be less than $10.00 due to claims or potential claims of creditors. We will distribute to all of our public stockholders, in proportion to their respective equity interests, an aggregate sum equal to the amount in the trust account, inclusive of any interest, plus any remaining net assets (subject to our obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors as described below).
 
We anticipate notifying the trustee of the trust account to begin liquidating such assets promptly after such date and anticipate it will take no more than 10 business days to effectuate such distribution. Our sponsors have waived their rights to participate in any liquidation distribution with respect to their founders’ shares. There will be no distribution from the trust account with respect to our warrants, including the founders’ warrants, which will expire worthless. We will pay the costs of any subsequent liquidation from our remaining assets outside of the trust account and the up to $100,000 of interest earned on the funds held in the trust account that we are permitted to withdraw to pay such expenses.
 
If we are unable to complete an initial business combination, the per-share redemption price would be $10.00, without taking into account interest, if any, earned on the trust account. The per share redemption price includes the deferred commissions that would also be distributable to our public stockholders. The proceeds deposited in the trust account could, however, become subject to claims of our creditors that are in preference to the claims of public stockholders.
 
Our public stockholders shall be entitled to receive funds from the trust account only in the event of our failure to complete a business combination within the required time period or if the stockholders seek to have us convert or purchase their respective shares upon a business combination which is actually completed by us. In no other circumstances shall a stockholder have any right or interest of any kind to or in the trust account.
 
If we are forced to file a bankruptcy case or an involuntary bankruptcy case is filed against us which is not dismissed, the proceeds held in the trust account could be subject to applicable bankruptcy law, and may be included in our bankruptcy estate and subject to the claims of third parties with priority over the claims of our stockholders. To the extent any bankruptcy claims deplete the trust account, we cannot assure you we will be able to return to our public stockholders at least $10.00 per share.
 
If we are forced to file a bankruptcy case or an involuntary bankruptcy case is filed against us which is not dismissed, any distributions received by stockholders could be viewed under applicable debtor/creditor and/or bankruptcy laws as either a “preferential transfer” or a “fraudulent conveyance.” As a result, a bankruptcy court could seek to recover all amounts received by our stockholders. Furthermore, because we intend to distribute the proceeds held in the trust account to our public stockholders promptly after twenty-four months from the date of our Offering, this may be viewed or interpreted as giving preference to our public stockholders over any potential creditors with respect to access to or distributions from our assets. Furthermore, our board may be viewed as having breached their fiduciary duties to our creditors and/or may have acted in bad faith, and thereby exposing itself and our company to claims of punitive damages, by paying public stockholders from the trust account prior to addressing the claims of creditors. We cannot assure you that claims will not be brought against us for these reasons.

Competition
 
In identifying, evaluating and selecting a target business, we may encounter intense competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours. Many of these entities are well established and have extensive experience identifying and effecting business combinations directly or through affiliates. Many of these competitors possess greater technical, human and other resources than us and our financial resources will be relatively limited when contrasted with those of many of these competitors. While we believe there may be numerous potential target businesses that we could acquire with the net proceeds of our Offering, our ability to compete in acquiring certain sizable target businesses may be limited by our available financial resources.
 
The following also may not be viewed favorably by certain target businesses:
 

● | our obligation to seek stockholder approval of a business combination may delay the completion of a transaction; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | our obligation to convert shares of common stock held by our public stockholders may reduce the resources available to us for a business combination; and 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | our outstanding warrants, and the potential future dilution they represent. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Any of these factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating a business combination. Our management believes, however, that our status as a public entity and potential access to the United States public equity markets may give us a competitive advantage over privately-held entities having a similar business objective as ours in acquiring a target business with significant growth potential on favorable terms.
 
If we succeed in effecting a business combination, there will be, in all likelihood, intense competition from competitors of the target business. We cannot assure you that, subsequent to a business combination, we will have the resources or ability to compete effectively.
 
Employees
 
We have two executive officers. These individuals are not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our matters and devote only as much time as they deem necessary to our affairs. The amount of time they devote in any time period varies based on whether a target business has been selected for the business combination and the stage of the business combination process the company is in. Accordingly, once management locates a suitable target business to acquire, they will spend more time investigating such target business and negotiating and processing the business combination (and consequently spend more time to our affairs) than they would prior to locating a suitable target business. We do not have any full time employees as of the date of this Form 10-K and we do not plan to have any full time employees prior to the consummation of a business combination.
