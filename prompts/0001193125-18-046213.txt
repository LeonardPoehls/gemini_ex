Item 1. Business 
Overview 
 
Seattle Genetics is a biotechnology company focused on the development and commercialization of targeted therapies for the treatment of cancer. Our marketed product ADCETRIS®, or brentuximab vedotin, is approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, and the European Commission for four indications, encompassing several settings for the treatment of relapsed Hodgkin lymphoma, for relapsed systemic anaplastic large cell lymphoma, or sALCL, and for certain types of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, or CTCL. ADCETRIS is commercially available in 70 countries, including in the United States, Canada, members of the European Union and Japan. We are collaborating with Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited, or Takeda, to develop and commercialize ADCETRIS on a global basis. Under this collaboration, Seattle Genetics has retained commercial rights for ADCETRIS in the United States and its territories and in Canada, and Takeda has commercial rights in the rest of the world. 
 
Beyond our current labeled indications, we have a broad development strategy for ADCETRIS, including to evaluate its therapeutic potential in newly diagnosed patients with Hodgkin lymphoma or mature T-cell lymphoma, or MTCL, also known as peripheral T-Cell lymphoma, or PTCL, including sALCL. We are also evaluating ADCETRIS in combination with a checkpoint inhibitor, or CPI. We and our partners are currently conducting these phase 3 clinical trials of ADCETRIS as described below: 
 

 | ECHELON-1: In collaboration with Takeda, we are investigating ADCETRIS plus AVD (adriamycin, vinblastine, dacarbazine) versus ABVD (adriamycin, bleomycin, vinblastine, dacarbazine) as frontline combination therapy in patients with previously untreated advanced classical Hodgkin lymphoma. The ECHELON-1 trial met its primary endpoint, demonstrating that treatment with ADCETRIS plus AVD resulted in a statistically significant improvement in modified progression-free survival. Interim analysis of overall survival, the key secondary endpoint, also trended in favor of the ADCETRIS plus AVD arm. The FDA granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation, or BTD, to ADCETRIS in combination with chemotherapy for the frontline treatment of patients with advanced classical Hodgkin lymphoma. In December 2017, the FDA granted Priority Review for the supplemental Biologics License Application, or sBLA, we submitted in November 2017 seeking approval of ADCETRIS as part of a frontline

combination chemotherapy regimen in patients with previously untreated advanced classical Hodgkin lymphoma, and the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, target action date is May 1, 2018.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | ECHELON-2: In collaboration with Takeda, we are evaluating ADCETRIS in combination with CHP versus CHOP (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine and prednisone) for the treatment of newly-diagnosed MTCL patients. In November 2016, we and Takeda completed enrollment of 452 patients in the ECHELON-2 trial, and we expect to report top-line data in 2018.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | CHECKMATE 812: In collaboration with Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, or BMS, we are evaluating the combination of BMSs immunotherapy nivolumab (Opdivo) with ADCETRIS for the treatment of relapsed or refractory, or transplant-ineligible, advanced classical Hodgkin lymphoma.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
ECHELON-1 and ECHELON-2 are both being conducted under Special Protocol Assessment, or SPA, agreements with the FDA and pursuant to scientific advice from the European Medicines Agency, or EMA. A SPA is an agreement with the FDA regarding the design of the clinical trial, including size and clinical endpoints, to support an efficacy claim in a new drug application or a Biologics License Application, or BLA, submission to the FDA if the trial achieves its primary endpoints. 
 
Our clinical-stage pipeline includes two antibody-drug conjugates, or ADCs, for solid tumors with potential accelerated approval pathways. In collaboration with Astellas Pharma, Inc., or Astellas, we are developing enfortumab vedotin, formerly known as ASG-22ME. We and Astellas are conducting a pivotal phase 2 clinical trial for patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial cancer who have been previously treated with CPI therapy. We and Astellas also initiated a phase 1b trial of enfortumab vedotin in combination with CPI therapy for patients with first- or second-line locally advanced or metastatic urothelial cancer. 
 
In collaboration with Genmab A/S, or Genmab, we are developing tisotumab vedotin. We and Genmab are planning to conduct a pivotal phase 2 clinical trial for patients with recurrent and/or metastatic cervical cancer. In addition, we and Genmab plan to evaluate tisotumab vedotin as part of combination therapy for first-line cervical cancer as well as in other types of solid tumors. 
 
Our earlier-stage clinical pipeline includes six other ADC programs consisting of ladiratuzumab vedotin, or SGN-LIV1A, denintuzumab mafodotin, or SGN-CD19A, SGN-CD19B, SGN-CD123A, SGN-CD33A and SGN-CD352A, as well as two immuno-oncology agents, SEA-CD40, which is based on our sugar-engineered antibody, or SEA, technology, and SGN-2FF, which is a novel small molecule. In addition, we have multiple preclinical and research-stage programs that employ our proprietary technologies, including SGN-CD48A.

We have collaborations for our ADC technology with a number of biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, including AbbVie Biotechnology Ltd., or AbbVie; Bayer Pharma AG, or Bayer; Celldex Therapeutics, Inc., or Celldex; Genentech, Inc., a member of the Roche Group, or Genentech; GlaxoSmithKline LLC, or GSK; Pfizer, Inc., or Pfizer; and PSMA Development Company LLC, a subsidiary of Progenics Pharmaceuticals Inc., or Progenics. In addition, we have a collaboration with Unum Therapeutics, Inc., or Unum, to develop and commercialize novel antibody-coupled T-cell receptor, or ACTR, therapies incorporating our antibodies for the treatment of cancer, and a collaboration agreement with Pieris Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and Pieris Pharmaceuticals AG, or together, Pieris, to develop multiple targeted bispecific immuno-oncology treatments for solid tumors and blood cancers. 
 
Proposed Acquisition of Cascadian Therapeutics 
 
On January 30, 2018, we and our wholly owned subsidiary, Valley Acquisition Sub, Inc., or Purchaser, entered into a definitive Agreement and Plan of Merger, or the Merger Agreement, with Cascadian Therapeutics, Inc., or Cascadian, a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company based in Seattle, Washington, pursuant to which Purchaser has commenced an offer, or the Tender Offer, to acquire all of the outstanding shares of Cascadian common stock at a price of $10.00 per share net to the seller in cash, without interest, less any applicable 
 
2 
 
 withholding taxes. As soon as practicable following the consummation of the Tender Offer, and subject to the satisfaction or waiver of certain conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, Purchaser will merge with and into Cascadian, or the Merger, and Cascadian will survive as our subsidiary. We refer to the Tender Offer and Merger together in this Annual Report on Form 10-K as the Cascadian Acquisition. We estimate that the aggregate cash amount we will pay for shares of Cascadian common stock in the Cascadian Acquisition is approximately $614.1 million. The obligations of us and Purchaser to complete the Cascadian Acquisition are subject to customary closing conditions. We expect to consummate the Cascadian Acquisition in the first quarter of 2018. Cascadians most advanced program is tucatinib, an investigational oral, small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor, or TKI, that is highly selective for HER2, a growth factor receptor that is overexpressed in multiple cancers, including breast, colorectal, ovarian, and gastric. Tucatinib is currently being evaluated in a randomized global pivotal trial called HER2CLIMB for patients with HER2-positive, or HER2+, metastatic breast cancer, including patients with or without brain metastases. Tucatinib has been evaluated as a single agent and in combination with both chemotherapy and other HER2-directed agents including trastuzumab (Herceptin) and trastuzumab emtansine (Kadcyla). 
 
Our Antibody-Drug Conjugate (ADC) Technologies 
 
ADCETRIS and many product candidates in our pipeline of clinical-stage monoclonal antibody-based product candidates utilize our ADC technology. ADCs are monoclonal antibodies that are linked to cytotoxic or cell-killing agents. Our ADCs utilize monoclonal antibodies that internalize within target cells after binding to a specified cell-surface receptor. Enzymes present inside the cell catalyze the release of the cytotoxic agent from the monoclonal antibody, which then results in the desired activity, specific killing of the target cell. 
 
A key component of our ADCs are the linkers that attach the cell-killing agent to the monoclonal antibody, which are designed to hold the cytotoxic agent to the monoclonal antibody until it binds to the cell surface receptor on the target cell and then to release the cytotoxic agent upon internalization within the target cell. This targeted delivery of the cell-killing agent is intended to maximize delivery of the cytotoxic agent to targeted cells while minimizing toxicity to normal tissues. Our ADCs use proprietary auristatins, which are microtubule disrupting agents, or pyrrolobenzodiazepine, or PBD, dimers, which are DNA cross-linkers, as cell-killing agents. In contrast to natural products that are often more difficult to produce and link to antibodies, the cytotoxic drugs used in our ADCs are synthetically produced and easier to scale for manufacturing. ADCETRIS, enfortumab vedotin (ASG-22ME), tisotumab vedotin, ladiratuzumab vedotin, denintuzumab mafodotin, SGN-CD19B, SGN-CD123A, SGN-CD33A and SGN-CD352A each utilize our proprietary ADC technologies. These technologies are also the basis of our corporate collaborations. In addition, we are advancing a preclinical product candidate, SGN-CD48A, which utilizes a novel linker technology, PEG-Glucuronide linker, attached to an auristatin. We own or hold exclusive or partially-exclusive licenses to multiple issued patents and patent applications covering our ADC technology. We continue to evaluate new linkers, antibody formats, and cell-killing agents for use in our ADC programs. 
 
Our Sugar-Engineered Antibody (SEA) Technology 
 
Our proprietary SEA technology is a method to selectively reduce fucose incorporation in monoclonal antibodies as they are produced in cell line-based manufacturing. We believe that this may result in increased effector function and antitumor activity. Our SEA technology is a novel approach to modify the activity of monoclonal antibodies that is complementary to our ADC technology. 
 
A key feature of our SEA technology is that no genetic modification of the antibody-producing cell line is necessary and standard cell culture conditions can be used while maintaining the underlying manufacturing processes, yields and product quality. We believe the SEA approach may be simpler and more cost-effective to implement as compared to existing technologies for enhancing antibody effector function, most of which require development of new cell lines. 
 
SEA-CD40 is a clinical-stage non-fucosylated monoclonal antibody developed using SEA technology. Enhanced binding to effector cells results in crosslinking and activation of CD40 signaling in cells of the immune 
 
3 
 
 system. We hypothesize that this increased stimulation of the patients own immune cells may result in meaningful antitumor activity. We are developing SEA-CD40 as a novel immuno-oncology agent. A phase 1 clinical trial of SEA-CD40 for solid tumors and hematologic malignancies is ongoing. 
 
Other Technologies 
 
In addition, we utilize other technologies designed to maximize antitumor activity and reduce toxicity of antibody-based therapies. Genetic engineering enables us to produce antibodies that are optimized for their intended uses. For ADCs, we screen and select antibodies that bind to antigens that are differentially expressed on tumor cells versus vital normal tissues, rapidly internalized within target cells and utilize native or engineered conjugation sites to optimize drug attachment. In some cases, we evaluate the use of our monoclonal antibodies and ADCs in combination with conventional chemotherapy and other anticancer agents, which may result in increased antitumor activity. 
Our Strategy 
 
Our strategy is to become a leading developer and marketer of targeted therapies for cancer. Key elements of our strategy are to: 
 

 | Successfully Execute our ADCETRIS Commercial Plan. An important near-term objective is to continue to execute our ADCETRIS commercial plan by driving market penetration and duration of therapy consistent with the current ADCETRIS label. We continue to focus our efforts on commercializing ADCETRIS in the United States and Canada through the coordinated efforts of our sales, marketing, reimbursement and market planning groups. ADCETRIS is approved by the FDA and the European Commission for four indications, encompassing several settings for the treatment of relapsed Hodgkin lymphoma, relapsed sALCL and for certain types of CTCL. In addition, as of January 2018, ADCETRIS had received marketing authorizations in relapsed Hodgkin lymphoma and sALCL from regulatory authorities in 70 countries, and we are continuing to support Takedas efforts to obtain regulatory approvals and conduct commercial launches in additional countries worldwide.

 | Expand the Therapeutic Potential of ADCETRIS. We believe ADCETRIS may have applications in earlier lines of therapy for Hodgkin lymphoma and MTCL and in other types of CD30-expressing lymphomas. In this regard, during 2017 we reported data from the phase 3 ECHELON-1 trial, received BTD from the FDA and submitted a sBLA to the FDA in November 2017 seeking approval for a new indication of ADCETRIS in combination with chemotherapy for the frontline treatment of patients with advanced classical Hodgkin lymphoma. The FDA has granted Priority Review for the sBLA, and the PDUFA target action date is May 1, 2018. The phase 3 ECHELON-2 trial evaluating ADCETRIS in frontline therapy for MTCL, also known as PTCL, and the phase 3 CHECKMATE 812 trial evaluating ADCETRIS in relapsed Hodgkin lymphoma in combination with a CPI are also ongoing. Clinical trials are also being conducted by us, by our collaborators and as investigator-sponsored trials in different CD30-expressing indications, including multiple stages of Hodgkin lymphoma, novel combinations of ADCETRIS plus immuno-oncology or other anticancer agents and in other areas of medical and scientific interest.

 | Advance Enfortumab Vedotin in a Pivotal Trial for Urothelial Cancer. We and Astellas are conducting a pivotal phase 2 clinical trial of enfortumab vedotin for patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial cancer who have been previously treated with CPI therapy. In addition, to evaluate its potential in earlier lines of metastatic urothelial cancer, we and Astellas initiated a phase 1b trial of enfortumab vedotin in combination with CPI therapy for patients with first- or second-line locally advanced or metastatic urothelial cancer. We also believe enfortumab vedotin

may have application in other types of solid tumors based on the expression of Nectin-4 in cancers, such as ovarian and non-small cell lung, and are considering potential future clinical trials.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Advance Tisotumab Vedotin into a Pivotal Trial for Cervical Cancer. We and Genmab plan to initiate in the first half of 2018 a pivotal phase 2 clinical trial of tisotumab vedotin for patients with recurrent and/or metastatic cervical cancer. In addition, as part of our strategy to broadly investigate tisotumab vedotin for cancer, we and Genmab plan to evaluate tisotumab vedotin as part of combination therapy for first-line cervical cancer as well as in other types of solid tumors. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Continue to Develop our Other Pipeline Programs. We believe that it is important to maintain a diverse pipeline of product candidates to sustain our future growth. To accomplish this, we are continuing to advance the development of our other clinical product candidates as well as other preclinical and research-stage programs that employ our proprietary technologies. We are evaluating our programs as monotherapy, and in some cases in combination with other anti-cancer agents such as CPIs to broadly assess the potential of our pipeline as part of existing and emerging therapeutic regimens. In addition, we are co-developing immuno-oncology programs with each of Unum and Pieris. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Support Growth of our Pipeline through Internal Research Efforts and Strategic Transactions. We have internal research programs directed toward identifying novel antigen targets, monoclonal antibodies and other targeting molecules, creating new antibody engineering techniques and developing new classes of stable linkers and cell-killing agents for our ADC technology. In addition, we supplement these internal efforts through ongoing initiatives to identify product candidates, products and technologies to acquire or in-license from biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies and academic institutions. For example, in January 2018, we announced the Cascadian Acquisition. If we are successful in consummating the Cascadian Acquisition, we plan to advance Cascadians most advanced program, tucatinib, in its current pivotal trial, HER2CLIMB, for patients with HER2-positive, or HER2+, metastatic breast cancer, including patients with or without brain metastases, and also to evaluate other potential development opportunities for tucatinib.

 | Expand Globally. We have established operations in Zug, Switzerland to support clinical trials, regulatory, medical affairs, manufacturing, and future potential commercial activities for our pipeline. In 2018, we will continue to develop our European presence in support of our global expansion. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Continue to Leverage our Industry-Leading ADC Technology. We have developed proprietary ADC technology designed to empower monoclonal antibodies. We are currently developing multiple product candidates that employ our ADC technology and we have also licensed this technology to biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies to generate collaboration revenues and funding, as well as potential milestones and potential future royalties. Presently, we have active ADC collaborations with AbbVie, Bayer, Celldex, Genentech, GSK, Pfizer, and Progenics, as well as ADC co-development agreements with Agensys (which subsequently became an affiliate of Astellas) and Genmab. These ADC collaboration and co-development agreements have generated over $375 million as of December 31, 2017 through a combination of upfront payments, research support, and other fees, milestone payments and equity purchases. Several of these collaborators are advancing ADCs using our technology in late-stage clinical development across a range of cancer types, illustrating our leadership in the field.

ADCETRIS also has accelerated approval in the United States for the treatment of patients with relapsed sALCL. In addition, ADCETRIS has approval with conditions in Canada for the treatment of patients with relapsed or refractory Hodgkin lymphoma or sALCL, and non-conditional approval for post-autologous stem cell transplant, or ASCT, consolidation treatment of Hodgkin lymphoma patients at increased risk of relapse or progression. As of January 2018, ADCETRIS had received marketing authorizations in relapsed Hodgkin lymphoma or relapsed sALCL from regulatory authorities in 70 countries. In particular, ADCETRIS has conditional marketing authorization in the European Union for the treatment of adult patients with (i) relapsed or refractory CD30-positive Hodgkin lymphoma, (ii) relapsed or refractory sALCL, (iii) CD30-positive Hodgkin lymphoma at increased risk of relapse or progression following ASCT and (iv) CD30-positive CTCL after at least one prior systemic therapy. Ongoing trials of ADCETRIS include: 
 | | | The ECHELON-1 phase 3 randomized trial ongoing for patients with newly diagnosed advanced stage classical Hodgkin lymphoma comparing adriamycin, bleomycin, vinblastine and dacarbazine, or ABVD, versus AVD plus ADCETRIS. In 2017, we reported that the ECHELON-1 phase 3 trial met its primary endpoint. Based on the 

 
6 
 

 | | | results of the trial, in September 2017 the FDA granted BTD to ADCETRIS in combination with chemotherapy for the frontline treatment of patients with advanced classical Hodgkin lymphoma. We submitted a sBLA to the FDA in November 2017 for approval of a new indication for ADCETRIS as part of a frontline combination chemotherapy regimen in patients with previously untreated advanced classical Hodgkin lymphoma. In December 2017, the FDA granted Priority Review for the sBLA, and the PDUFA target action date is May 1, 2018. 
 | | | The ECHELON-2 phase 3 randomized trial ongoing for patients with newly diagnosed CD30-expressing MTCL, including sALCL, comparing cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine and prednisone, or CHOP, versus CHP plus ADCETRIS. We and Takeda completed enrollment of 452 patients in November 2016, and we expect to report top-line data in 2018. 
 | | | The CHECKMATE 812 phase 3 trial ongoing evaluating ADCETRIS in combination with nivolumab for patients with relapsed or refractory, or transplant-ineligible, advanced classical Hodgkin lymphoma. Phase 2 trial ongoing for patients age 60 or older with newly diagnosed Hodgkin lymphoma evaluating ADCETRIS in combination with bendamustine, dacarbazine or nivolumab. Phase 1/2 trial ongoing for patients with relapsed or refractory Hodgkin lymphoma after failure of frontline therapy evaluating ADCETRIS in combination with nivolumab. Phase 1/2 trial ongoing for patients with relapsed or refractory B-cell and T-cell non-Hodgkin lymphomas, including DLBCL and other rare B-cell lymphomas, evaluating ADCETRIS in combination with nivolumab. 
Enfortumab vedotin (ASG-22ME) | Anti-Nectin-4 ADC | 50: 50 co-development and commercialization with Astellas | Pivotal phase 2 trial ongoing for patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial cancer who have been previously treated with CPI therapy.

 | | | Phase 1b trial for patients with first- or second-line locally advanced or metastatic urothelial cancer evaluating enfortumab vedotin in combination with CPI therapy. Phase 1 trial for Nectin-4-positive solid tumors, including urothelial cancers such as bladder cancer. 
Tisotumab vedotin | Anti-Tissue Factor ADC | 50: 50 co-development and commercialization with Genmab | Planned pivotal phase 2 clinical trial for patients with recurrent and/or metastatic cervical cancer. Planned phase 2 trial to evaluate tisotumab vedotin as part of combination therapy for first-line cervical cancer. Planned phase 2 trial in solid tumors. Phase 1/2 trial ongoing in solid tumors. 
Ladiratuzumab vedotin (SGN-LIV1A) | Anti-LIV-1 ADC | Seattle Genetics | Phase 1 trial ongoing for patients with LIV-1-positive metastatic breast cancer, in particular triple negative disease. Phase 2 trial ongoing evaluating ladiratuzumab vedotin as part of neo-adjuvant therapy in patients with breast cancer (the I-SPY2 trial). Planned phase 1b/2 trial of ladiratuzumab vedotin in combination with pembrolizumab for first-line metastatic triple negative breast cancer. Planned phase 1b/2 trial of ladiratuzumab vedotin in combination with atezolizumab for second-line metastatic triple negative breast cancer (the MORPHEUS trial). 

ADCETRIS 
 
ADCETRIS is an ADC comprised of an anti-CD30 monoclonal antibody attached by a protease-cleavable linker to a proprietary microtubule disrupting agent, monomethyl auristatin E, or MMAE. ADCETRIS employs a linker system that is designed to be stable in the bloodstream and to release MMAE upon internalization into CD30-expressing cells. We believe that the CD30 antigen is an attractive target for cancer therapy because it is expressed on multiple types of cancer, but has limited expression on normal tissues. We are collaborating with Takeda on the global development and commercialization of ADCETRIS. Under this collaboration, we have rights to commercialize ADCETRIS in the United States and Canada. Takeda has exclusive rights to commercialize ADCETRIS in the rest of the world. ADCETRIS has received regulatory approvals as follows: 

 | United States. ADCETRIS® (brentuximab vedotin) injection for intravenous infusion has received approval from the FDA for four indications: (1) regular approval for the treatment of adult patients with classical Hodgkin lymphoma after failure of auto-HSCT or after failure of at least two prior multi-agent chemotherapy regimens in patients who are not auto-HSCT candidates, (2) regular approval for the treatment of classical Hodgkin lymphoma adult patients at high risk of relapse or progression as post-auto-HSCT consolidation, (3) accelerated approval for the treatment of adult patients with sALCL after 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
8 
 

failure of at least one prior multi-agent chemotherapy regimen, and (4) regular approval for the treatment of adult patients with pcALCL and CD30-expressing MF who have received prior systemic therapy. The sALCL indication is approved under accelerated approval based on overall response rate. Continued approval for the sALCL indication is contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in a confirmatory phase 3 trial.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Canada. Health Canada has issued a Notice of Compliance with conditions, authorizing marketing of ADCETRIS for two lymphoma indications: (1) the treatment of patients with Hodgkin lymphoma after failure of ASCT, or after failure of at least two multi-agent chemotherapy regimens in patients who are not ASCT candidates, and (2) the treatment of patients with sALCL after failure of at least one multi-agent chemotherapy regimen. In addition, Health Canada granted non-conditional approval for post-ASCT consolidation treatment of Hodgkin lymphoma patients at increased risk of relapse or progression. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | European Union. ADCETRIS was granted conditional marketing authorization by the European Commission in October 2012 for two indications: (1) for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory CD30-positive Hodgkin lymphoma following ASCT, or following at least two prior therapies when ASCT or multi-agent chemotherapy is not a treatment option, and (2) the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory sALCL. The European Commission extended the current conditional approval of ADCETRIS and approved ADCETRIS for the treatment of adult patients with CD30-positive Hodgkin lymphoma at increased risk of relapse or progression following ASCT. In addition, in January 2018, the European Commission further extended the marketing authorization for ADCETRIS for the treatment of adult patients with CD30-positive cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) after at least one prior systemic therapy. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Worldwide. As of January 2018, ADCETRIS is commercially available in 70 countries for relapsed or refractory Hodgkin lymphoma and relapsed or refractory sALCL. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
ADCETRIS was granted approval for the treatment of patients with sALCL after failure of at least one prior multi-agent chemotherapy regimen under the FDAs accelerated approval regulations, which allows the FDA to approve products for cancer or other serious or life-threatening illnesses based on surrogate endpoints or on a clinical endpoint other than survival or irreversible morbidity. Under the FDAs accelerated approval regulations, we are subject to certain post-approval requirements that require an additional confirmatory phase 3 trial to verify and describe the clinical benefit of ADCETRIS. In addition, we are subject to extensive ongoing obligations and continued regulatory review from the FDA and other applicable regulatory agencies, such as continued adverse event reporting requirements and the requirement to have our promotional materials pre-cleared by the FDA. 
 
In the United States, while ECHELON-2 is a required post-approval study in connection with the accelerated approval of the relapsed sALCL indication, results from either the ECHELON-1 or the ECHELON-2 trial may be sufficient to confirm the clinical benefit of ADCETRIS in relapsed sALCL and convert the approval of ADCETRIS from accelerated approval to regular approval in its currently approved relapsed sALCL indication. In Canada, the ECHELON-2 trial is a required post-approval study to remove conditions on the approval of ADCETRIS in the relapsed sALCL indication. In Europe, there are separate post-approval requirements to convert the conditional marketing authorization of ADCETRIS to a standard marketing authorization in the relapsed sALCL indication. 
 
In addition, with respect to the accelerated approval of ADCETRIS for relapsed Hodgkin lymphoma in Canada and Europe, ECHELON-1 is a required post-approval study to remove conditions on the approval of ADCETRIS in relapsed Hodgkin lymphoma in Canada, and in Europe, there are separate post-approval requirements to convert the conditional marketing authorization of ADCETRIS to a standard marketing authorization in the relapsed Hodgkin lymphoma indication.

Market Opportunities 
 
According to the American Cancer Society, more than 8,200 cases of Hodgkin lymphoma were expected to be diagnosed in the United States during 2017, and an estimated 1,070 people were expected to die of the disease. Approximately 4,000 patients are diagnosed annually in the United States with a type of CD30-expressing MTCL, including sALCL. The use of combination chemotherapy as frontline therapy for malignant lymphomas has resulted in high remission rates; however, these frontline chemotherapy regimens have substantial associated toxicities and a significant number of lymphoma patients relapse and require additional treatments including other chemotherapy regimens and ASCT. For the reasons discussed in Item 1ARisk Factors, we may not be able to obtain regulatory approvals to market ADCETRIS for frontline Hodgkin lymphoma or MTCL, or otherwise continue to expand its labeled indications of use. An estimated 1,000 people annually have CD30-expressing mycosis fungoides or primary cutaneous ALCL requiring systemic therapy. 
ADCETRIS Clinical Development Status and Plan 
 
In collaboration with our partners, we are pursuing a broad development strategy for ADCETRIS that includes clinical trials of ADCETRIS evaluating its therapeutic potential in newly diagnosed patients with Hodgkin lymphoma, or MTCL, also known as PTCL, including sALCL. We are also evaluating ADCETRIS in combination with a CPI. These ongoing clinical trials include: 
 
Phase 3 Frontline Hodgkin Lymphoma (ECHELON-1).    In June 2017, we and Takeda announced positive top line data from the ECHELON-1 trial, a randomized, open-label, phase 3 trial investigating ADCETRIS plus AVD versus ABVD as frontline combination therapy in 1,334 patients with previously untreated advanced classical Hodgkin lymphoma. Additional data were reported at the 59th American Society of Hematology (ASH) annual meeting. The ECHELON-1 trial met its primary endpoint, demonstrating that treatment with ADCETRIS plus AVD resulted in a statistically significant improvement in modified progression-free survival, or PFS, versus the control arm as assessed by an independent review facility (hazard ratio=0.770; p-value=0.035). The two-year modified PFS rate per independent review for patients in the ADCETRIS plus AVD arm was 82.1 percent compared to 77.2 percent in the control arm. Per investigator assessment, the two-year modified PFS rate for patients in the ADCETRIS plus AVD arm was 81.0 percent compared to 74.4 percent in the control arm. All secondary endpoints trended in favor of the ADCETRIS plus AVD arm, including interim analysis of overall survival (hazard ratio=0.72; p-value=0.19), the key secondary endpoint. The safety profile of ADCETRIS plus AVD in the ECHELON-1 trial was generally consistent with that known for the single-agent components of the regimen. The most common clinically relevant adverse events of any grade that occurred in at least 15 percent of patients in the ADCETRIS plus AVD and ABVD arms were: neutropenia (58 and 45 percent, respectively), constipation (42 and 37 percent, respectively), vomiting (33 and 28 percent, respectively), fatigue (both 32 percent), peripheral sensory neuropathy (29 and 17 percent, respectively), diarrhea (27 and 18 percent, respectively), pyrexia (27 and 22 percent, respectively), peripheral neuropathy (26 and 13 percent, respectively), abdominal pain (21 and 10 percent, respectively) and stomatitis (21 and 16 percent, respectively). In both the ADCETRIS plus AVD and ABVD arms, the most common Grade 3 or 4 events were neutropenia, febrile neutropenia and neutrophil count decrease. Febrile neutropenia was reduced through the use of prophylactic growth factors (G-CSF) in a subset of patients. In the ADCETRIS plus AVD arm of the study, the rate of febrile neutropenia without the use of G-CSF was 21 percent and with the use of G-CSF was reduced to 11 percent. G-CSF primary prophylaxis with ADCETRIS plus AVD resulted in an overall comparable safety profile to ABVD, decreasing the incidence of febrile neutropenia, neutropenia and serious adverse events. Primary prophylaxis with G-CSF was used in a subset of patients enrolled in the study. In the ADCETRIS plus AVD arm, peripheral neuropathy events were observed in 67 percent of patients compared to 43 percent on the ABVD arm. In the ADCETRIS plus AVD arm, the majority of peripheral neuropathy events were Grade 1 or 2. Grade ³3 events were reported in 11 percent of patients and Grade 4 events were reported in less than 1 percent of patients. In the ABVD arm, Grade ³3 events were reported in 2 percent of patients and there were no Grade 4 events. Two-thirds of the patients with peripheral neuropathy in the ADCETRIS plus AVD arm reported resolution or improvement at last follow-up. Pulmonary toxicity, defined as events related to interstitial lung disease, was reported in 2 percent of patients in the ADCETRIS plus AVD arm versus 7 percent of patients in the ABVD arm; 
 
10 
 
 Grade ³3 events were reported in less than 1 percent versus 3 percent, in the ADCETRIS plus AVD arm and the ABVD arm, respectively. 9 on study deaths occurred in the ADCETRIS plus AVD arm, of which 7 were due to neutropenia or associated complications (all occurred in patients who had not received primary prophylaxis with G-CSF with the exception of 1 patient who entered the trial with pre-existing neutropenia). The remaining 2 deaths were due to myocardial infarction. In the ABVD arm, there were 13 on study deaths, of which 11 were due to or associated with pulmonary-related toxicity, 1 was due to cardiopulmonary failure and 1 death had unknown cause. ECHELON-1 is being conducted under a SPA agreement with the FDA and pursuant to scientific advice from the EMA. 
 
In September 2017, the FDA granted BTD to ADCETRIS in combination with chemotherapy for the frontline treatment of patients with advanced classical Hodgkin lymphoma. In November 2017, we submitted a sBLA to the FDA seeking approval of ADCETRIS as part of a frontline combination chemotherapy regimen in patients with previously untreated advanced classical Hodgkin lymphoma. In December 2017, the FDA granted Priority Review for the sBLA, and the PDUFA target action date is May 1, 2018. 
 
Phase 3 Frontline Mature T-Cell Lymphoma (ECHELON-2).    We and Takeda have completed patient enrollment of 452 patients in a global randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled multi-center phase 3 clinical trial known as ECHELON-2. This trial is evaluating ADCETRIS in combination with CHP versus CHOP for the treatment of newly diagnosed CD30-expressing MTCL patients, including patients with sALCL and other types of peripheral T-cell lymphomas. The primary endpoint of the trial is PFS per independent review facility assessment. Secondary endpoints include overall survival, complete remission rate and safety. Based on reviews of pooled, blinded data, we have observed a lower rate of reported PFS events than anticipated in the ECHELON-2 trial. We plan to discuss with the FDA the potential to unblind the trial prior to achieving the target number of PFS events specified in our SPA agreement. We cannot predict the outcome of those discussions or whether we would be able to reach agreement with the FDA. See Item 1ARisk FactorsRisks Related to Our BusinessOur near-term prospects are substantially dependent on ADCETRIS. If we and/or Takeda are unable to effectively commercialize ADCETRIS for the treatment of patients in its approved indications and to continue to expand its labeled indications of use, our ability to generate significant revenue and our prospects for profitability will be adversely affected and Clinical trials are expensive and time consuming, may take longer than we expect or may not be completed at all, and their outcome is uncertain. Based on the length of follow-up and the slow rate at which PFS events are occurring, we believe the primary endpoint data will be mature and expect to report top-line data in 2018. A companion diagnostic test is being used in this trial to assess CD30-expression. We expect that concurrent approval of a CD30 companion diagnostic will be required for any approval of ADCETRIS in the frontline MTCL indication. We are developing a companion diagnostic under a collaboration agreement with Ventana Medical Systems, or Ventana, and Takeda. The ECHELON-2 trial is being conducted under a SPA agreement with the FDA and also received scientific advice from the EMA. We are required to conduct this trial as part of our ADCETRIS post-marketing requirement for the relapsed sALCL indication, and the trial is designed to be confirmatory in the United States and Canada. 
 
Data from a phase 1 trial that evaluated ADCETRIS plus chemotherapy for frontline sALCL, which was subsequently amended to include patients with any CD30-expressing MTCL, supported our decision to initiate the ECHELON-2 trial. Among the 26 patients who received the combination regimen of ADCETRIS plus CHP, 88 percent achieved a complete remission. At the December 2017 ASH annual meeting, follow-up data were reported showing that the estimated five-year PFS rate was 52 percent, with no patients receiving a consolidative stem cell transplant in first remission. The estimated five-year overall survival rate was 80 percent. There were no progression events or deaths in the trial since the three-year follow up. 73 percent of patients (19 of 26) experienced peripheral neuropathy, the majority of which was Grade 1 or 2. 95 percent of these patients had complete resolution or some improvement of their symptoms at last follow-up with a median time to resolution of 4.2 months and a median time to improvement of symptoms of 2.6 months. 
 
Phase 3 Relapsed/Refractory Hodgkin Lymphoma (CHECKMATE 812).    We and BMS are conducting a pivotal phase 3 clinical trial, or the CHECKMATE 812 trial, to evaluate the combination of BMSs 
 
11 
 
 immunotherapy nivolumab (Opdivo) with ADCETRIS for the treatment of relapsed or refractory, or transplant-ineligible, advanced classical Hodgkin lymphoma. Nivolumab is a programmed death-1, or PD-1, immune checkpoint inhibitor that is designed to harness the bodys own immune system to help restore antitumor immune response. The primary endpoint for the CHECKMATE 812 trial is PFS and targeted enrollment is 340 patients. 
 
The CHECKMATE 812 trial is supported by interim data from a phase 1/2 trial in second-line Hodgkin lymphoma, which is one of three trials being conducted under a clinical trial collaboration agreement between us and BMS to evaluate the investigational combination of ADCETRIS and nivolumab. 
 
Updated interim data from the phase 1/2 trial evaluating the combination of ADCETRIS and nivolumab for patients with second line Hodgkin lymphoma were presented at the 2017 ASH annual meeting. Data were reported from 62 patients with relapsed or refractory Hodgkin lymphoma who received the combination regimen of ADCETRIS plus nivolumab after failure of frontline therapy. After completion of the fourth cycle of treatment, patients were eligible to undergo an ASCT. Of 60 response-evaluable patients, 83 percent had an objective response, including 62 percent with a complete response. The estimated six-month PFS rate was 89 percent. The most common adverse events of any grade occurring prior to ASCT or subsequent salvage therapy in at least 20 percent of patients were nausea, fatigue, infusion-related reaction, or IRR, pruritus, diarrhea, headache, cough, vomiting, dyspnea, nasal congestion, pyrexia and rash. IRRs were observed in 44 percent of patients, of which the majority (41 percent) were Grade 1 or 2. No patients discontinued treatment due to an IRR. 
 
The third ongoing trial under our clinical collaboration with BMS is evaluating the combination of ADCETRIS and nivolumab in patients with relapsed or refractory B-cell and T-cell non-Hodgkin lymphomas, including DLBCL and rare B-cell lymphomas, including gray zone and mediastinal B-cell lymphomas. 
 
Frontline Therapy for Hodgkin Lymphoma Patients Age 60 and Over.    In October 2012, we initiated a phase 2 clinical trial evaluating ADCETRIS monotherapy as a frontline therapy for patients age 60 or older with newly diagnosed Hodgkin lymphoma. The trial was subsequently amended to include the administration of ADCETRIS in combination with bendamustine or dacarbazine. In 2015, the bendamustine arm was closed because the tolerability of the combination did not meet study goals for this fragile patient population. Subsequently, the study was further expanded to evaluate the combination of ADCETRIS and nivolumab. ADCETRIS monotherapy is included in National Comprehensive Cancer Network, or NCCN, guidelines for older patients with relapsed or refractory Hodgkin lymphoma as a palliative therapy option. 
 
Investigator-Sponsored Trials.    In addition to our corporate-sponsored trials, as of December 31, 2017, there were more than 40 reported investigator-sponsored trials of ADCETRIS in the United States. In addition, we and Takeda are reviewing proposals from multiple clinical investigators and cooperative groups in the United States, Canada and Europe about potential investigator-sponsored trials of ADCETRIS. The investigator-sponsored trials to date include the use of ADCETRIS in a number of malignant hematologic indications such as CTCL, DLBCL, untreated limited stage Hodgkin lymphoma, salvage therapy for patients with Hodgkin lymphoma prior to auto-HSCT and graft versus host disease. There are also numerous other investigator-sponsored trials for the use of ADCETRIS in other CD30-expressing and select CD30-undetectable settings, and in solid tumors such as mesothelioma and testicular germ cell tumors. Several investigator-sponsored trials are currently evaluating ADCETRIS with immuno-oncology compounds in Hodgkin lymphoma, and we expect additional investigator-sponsored trials might evaluate ADCETRIS in novel combination regimens. 
 
Enfortumab Vedotin (ASG-22ME)

Enfortumab vedotin is an ADC composed of an anti-Nectin-4 monoclonal antibody linked to a potent auristatin compound using our proprietary ADC technology. Nectin-4 is a novel target expressed in multiple cancers including urothelial cancers, such as bladder cancer, as well as ovarian and lung cancers. We are developing enfortumab vedotin as a potential treatment for solid tumors under our co-development collaboration with Astellas, and we share all costs and, if commercialized, profits for the product candidate with Astellas on a 50:50 basis. 
 
12 
 
Approximately 15,000 people are diagnosed annually in the United States with metastatic urothelial cancer. Several CPIs have been approved for urothelial cancer in the past several years and are improving outcomes for some patients, yet the vast majority of patients do not benefit, or relapse, and require additional treatment options. There are no approved agents in the post-CPI setting, representing an unmet medical need and potential rapid development pathway. 
 
In October 2017, we and Astellas initiated a pivotal, single-arm phase 2 clinical trial of single-agent enfortumab vedotin for locally advanced or metastatic urothelial cancer patients who have been previously treated with CPI therapy. The primary endpoint of the trial is confirmed objective response rate per independent review. The trial will also assess overall survival, PFS, safety and tolerability. The study is designed to enroll approximately 120 patients at multiple centers globally. 
 
Data from a phase 1 trial that evaluated enfortumab vedotin in solid tumors, primarily urothelial cancer, supported our decision to initiate the pivotal phase 2 trial. In June 2017, we and Astellas reported updated data from the phase 1, open-label, dose-escalation, multi-center clinical trial of enfortumab vedotin at the American Society of Clinical Oncology, or ASCO, annual meeting. Of the 71 patients with metastatic urothelial cancer evaluated for response, 41 percent had an objective response, including 4 percent who achieved a complete response. The preliminary estimate of median duration of response for all patients was 24 weeks. In 30 patients treated at the recommended phase 2 dose of 1.25 mg/kg, 53 percent had an objective response, including 3 percent who achieved a complete response. Of the 32 patients previously treated with CPIs and evaluated for response, 44 percent had an objective response, including three percent with complete response. Among the 17 CPI-treated patients treated at the recommended phase 2 dose, 47 percent achieved a partial response. The most common treatment-related adverse events of any grade occurring in 10 percent or more of patients were nausea (36 percent), pruritus (31 percent), fatigue (30 percent) and diarrhea (28 percent). In February 2018, we and Astellas reported updated data on this trial in a poster presentation the American Society of Clinical Oncology 2018 Genitourinary Cancers Symposium. As of October 2, 2017, the data cut date for the poster, a total of 67 patients with metastatic urothelial carcinoma whose disease progressed after treatment with CPIs received the recommended phase 2 dose of 1.25 mg/kg of enfortumab vedotin once a week for three of every four-week cycle. For the 55 patients with evaluable data, the confirmed response rate was reported as 31 percent (N=17). Since October 2, 2017, an additional 6 patients have achieved a confirmed response. Updated data from these and additional patients, who continue to be enrolled in the trial, are expected to be reported at an upcoming medical meeting in 2018. In data presented, the most common treatment-emergent adverse event(s), or TEAE, of any grade for all patients were fatigue (55 percent), nausea (48 percent), decreased appetite (45 percent), and diarrhea and alopecia (43 percent each). In the presentation, 4 fatalities were reported possibly related to enfortumab vedotin treatment, two reported prior to October 2, 2017 due to respiratory failure and urinary tract obstruction and two cases after October 2, 2017 due to hyperglycemia. Since October 2, 2017, the study protocol has been amended to address the hyperglycemia finding. Hyponatremia (six percent), or low sodium in the blood, was the only Grade 3 or 4 TEAE occurring in greater than five percent of the cohort population. 
 
As part of our effort to evaluate enfortumab vedotin in earlier lines of therapy, we and Astellas initiated in November 2017 a phase 1b trial evaluating the safety and tolerability of enfortumab vedotin in combination with pembrolizumab for first- or second-line treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial cancer. The single arm multi-center trial is designed to enroll up to 85 patients who are ineligible for first-line cisplatin-based chemotherapy or have progressed following treatment with a regimen containing platinum-based chemotherapy. The primary objective of the trial is to assess the safety and tolerability of enfortumab vedotin in combination with CPI therapy. 
 
Tisotumab Vedotin 
 
Tisotumab vedotin is an ADC composed of a human antibody that binds to tissue factor linked to a potent auristatin compound using our proprietary ADC technology. Tissue factor is expressed on many solid tumors, including cervical, ovarian, prostate and bladder. In August 2017, we exercised our option to co-develop

13 
 
 tisotumab vedotin with Genmab, sharing all future costs and, if commercialized, profits for the product candidate with Genmab on a 50:50 basis. 
 
According to the American Cancer Society, approximately 13,000 women are diagnosed annually in the United States with cervical cancer and 4,000 are expected to die. Despite improvements in detecting and preventing metastatic cervical cancer, this remains a substantial unmet medical need. 
 
In the first half of 2018, we and Genmab plan to initiate a pivotal phase 2 clinical trial of tisotumab vedotin in patients with recurrent and/or metastatic cervical cancer. The single-arm trial is expected to enroll approximately 100 patients who have relapsed or progressed on or after platinum-containing chemotherapy and who have received or are ineligible for bevacizumab (Avastin). The primary endpoint of the study will be overall response rate as assessed by independent review. The planned trial will also assess duration of response and safety. 
 
Data from a phase 1/2 trial that evaluated tisotumab vedotin in solid tumors, including cervical cancer, supported our decision to initiate the pivotal phase 2 trial. In September 2017, we and Genmab reported data from part 2 of the phase 1/2 trial at the European Society for Medical Oncology, or ESMO, Congress. In an expansion cohort of 34 patients with relapsed, recurrent and/or metastatic cervical cancer, 32 percent achieved a response. Median duration of confirmed responses was 8.3 months. The most common adverse events of any grade were conjunctivitis (50 percent), epistaxis, fatigue and alopecia (47 percent each) and nausea (44 percent). 
 
Beyond recurrent and/or metastatic cervical cancer, we believe there may be opportunities for tisotumab vedotin in earlier lines of cervical cancer and in other solid tumors that express tissue factor. In 2018, we and Genmab also plan to initiate at least two additional clinical trials of tisotumab vedotin. One trial will evaluate tisotumab vedotin as part of a combination regimen for first-line cervical cancer. The second trial will evaluate tisotumab vedotin in other types of solid tumors. 
 
Ladiratuzumab Vedotin (SGN-LIV1A)

Ladiratuzumab vedotin is an ADC composed of an anti-LIV-1 monoclonal antibody linked to a potent auristatin compound using our proprietary ADC technology, and is being developed as a potential treatment of metastatic breast cancer. 
 
In October 2013 we initiated a phase 1, open-label, dose-escalation clinical trial to evaluate the safety and antitumor activity of ladiratuzumab vedotin in patients with LIV-1-positive metastatic breast cancer. At the December 2017 San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium annual meeting, updated interim data were reported showing that among the 60 efficacy-evaluable patients with metastatic triple negative breast cancer, 25 percent achieved a partial response. At the recommended dose, 29 percent of patients achieved a partial response. The median PFS and median duration of response for patients treated across all dose levels were 11 weeks and 13.3 weeks, respectively. In 19 patients treated at the recommended dose, the median PFS was 12.1 weeks, and the median duration of response was 17.4 weeks. Of the 81 patients treated in the study, peripheral neuropathy events occurred in 20 percent and were generally low grade (Grades 1/2) and manageable. Grades 3/4 adverse events included neutropenia and anemia. Enrollment continues for patients with metastatic triple negative breast cancer at the recommended dose of 2.5 mg/kg, with a maximum dose of 200 mg per cycle. 
 
Ladiratuzumab vedotin is also being evaluated in several other settings for metastatic breast cancer. In mid-2018, we plan to initiate a phase 1b/2 clinical trial in combination with pembrolizumab (Keytruda) in patients with locally advanced or metastatic triple negative breast cancer. This single arm, open label multicenter study will be conducted under a collaboration agreement with Merck and is anticipated to enroll up to 72 patients. 
 
Ladiratuzumab vedotin is also being evaluated in the I-SPY 2 trial, a phase 2 trial being conducted by a consortium that includes major cancer research centers and receives support from multiple industry partners. In 
 
14 
 
 this trial, ladiratuzumab vedotin followed by standard chemotherapy as a neo-adjuvant treatment (prior to surgery) is being evaluated for women with newly diagnosed, locally advanced Stage 2 or 3 HER2-negative breast cancer. This trial is anticipated to enroll up to 75 patients in the ladiratuzumab vedotin treatment arm. 
 
Under a clinical collaboration with Genentech, ladiratuzumab vedotin will be evaluated in combination with atezolizumab (Tecentriq) as part of the MORPHEUS trial. The planned phase 1b/2 MORPHEUS trial will evaluate the combination as second-line therapy in patients with metastatic triple negative breast cancer who have not been previously treated with immunotherapy. This multi-arm study is anticipated to enroll up to 45 patients in the ladiratuzumab vedotin arm. 
 
Additional Product Candidates 
 
Our earlier stage clinical pipeline includes five other ADC programs consisting of denintuzumab mafodotin, or SGN-CD19A, SGN-CD19B, SGN-CD123A, SGN-CD352A and SGN-CD33A as well as two immuno-oncology agents, SEA-CD40 and SGN-2FF. We continue to evaluate these product candidates and will advance them into further development as we determine appropriate based on clinical data and resource prioritization. 
 
In June 2017, we announced that we were discontinuing the phase 3 CASCADE clinical trial of SGN-CD33A, or vadastuximab talirine, in frontline older AML patients, and suspending patient enrollment and treatment in all other SGN-CD33A trials. We took this action following consultation with the Independent Data Monitoring Committee, or IDMC, and after reviewing unblinded data from the CASCADE trail which indicated a higher rate of deaths, including fatal infections, in the SGN-CD33A-containing arm versus the control arm of the trial. In addition, the Investigational New Drug application, or IND, for SGN-CD33A has been placed on hold, and no clinical trials may resume under the IND until the FDA lifts the clinical hold. We are continuing to review data for the SGN-CD33A program; however, at this time we have no plans to initiate additional clinical trials of SGN-CD33A. 
 
Research Programs 
 
In addition to our pipeline of product candidates and antibody-based and SEA technologies, we have internal research programs directed toward developing new classes of potent, cell-killing agents and stable linkers, identifying novel antigen targets, monoclonal antibodies and other targeting molecules, and advancing our antibody engineering initiatives. 
 
New Cell-Killing Agents.    We continue to study new cell-killing agents that can be linked to antibodies, such as the auristatins and PBDs that we currently use in our ADC technology, and new classes of cell-killing agents. 
 
New Stable Linkers.    We are conducting research with the intent to develop new linker systems that are more stable in the bloodstream and more effective at releasing the cell-killing agent once inside targeted cancer cells. 
 
Novel Monoclonal Antibodies and Antigen Targets.    We are actively engaged in internal efforts to identify and develop monoclonal antibodies and other targeting molecules and ADCs with novel specificities and activities against selected antigen targets. We focus on antigen targets that are highly expressed on the surface of cancer cells that may serve as targets for monoclonal antibodies or ADCs. We may then create and screen panels of cancer-reactive monoclonal antibodies in our laboratories to identify those with the desired specificity. We supplement these internal efforts by evaluating opportunities to in-license targets and antibodies from academic groups and other biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, such as our ongoing co-development collaborations with Astellas and Genmab. 
 
Antibody Engineering.    We have substantial internal expertise in antibody engineering, both for antibody humanization and non-fucosylation, as well as engineering of antibodies to improve drug linkage sites for use 
 
15 
 
 with our ADC technology. By modifying the number and type of drug-linkage sites found on our antibodies, we believe that we can improve the robustness and cost-effectiveness of our manufacturing processes for conjugation of ADCs. 
 
Research and Development Expense 
 
Since inception, we have devoted a significant amount of resources to develop ADCETRIS, our product candidates and our antibody-based technologies. For the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015, we recorded $456.7 million, $379.3 million, and $294.5 million, respectively, in research and development expenses. 
Corporate Collaborations 
 
We enter into collaborations with biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies to advance the development and commercialization of our product candidates and to supplement our internal pipeline. We seek collaborations that will allow us to retain significant future participation in product sales through either profit-sharing or royalties paid on net sales. We also have licensed our ADC technology to collaborators to be developed with their own antibodies. These ADC collaborations benefit us in many ways, including generating cash flow and revenues that partially offset expenditures on our internal research and development programs, expanding our knowledge base regarding ADCs across multiple targets and antibodies provided by our collaborators and providing us with future pipeline opportunities through co-development or opt-in rights to new ADC product candidates. 
Takeda ADCETRIS Collaboration 
 
In 2009, we entered into a collaboration agreement with Takeda to develop and commercialize ADCETRIS, under which Seattle Genetics retains commercial rights in the United States and its territories and in Canada, and Takeda and its affiliates have commercial rights in the rest of the world. As of December 31, 2017, we had received an upfront payment of $60 million and had achieved milestone payments totaling $70 million related to regulatory and commercial progress by Takeda. As of December 31, 2017, we were entitled to receive additional progress- and sales-dependent milestone payments of up to $165 million based on Takedas achievement of significant events under the collaboration in addition to tiered royalties with percentages ranging from the mid-teens and to the mid-twenties based on net sales of ADCETRIS within Takedas licensed territories. Takeda also bears a portion of third-party royalty costs owed on sales of ADCETRIS in its territory. We and Takeda equally co-fund the cost of selected development activities conducted under the collaboration. Although we are funding half of the development activities conducted under the collaboration, Takeda is responsible for the achievement of the progress- and sales-dependent milestone payments that we may receive. Either party may terminate the collaboration agreement if the other party materially breaches the agreement and such breach remains uncured. Takeda may terminate the collaboration agreement for any reason upon prior written notice to us and we may terminate the collaboration agreement in certain circumstances. The collaboration agreement can also be terminated by mutual written consent of the parties. If neither party terminates the collaboration agreement, then the agreement automatically terminates on the expiration of all payment obligations. 
Astellas Co-Development Collaboration 
 
In 2007, we entered into an agreement with Agensys, which subsequently became an affiliate of Astellas, to jointly research, develop and commercialize ADCs for the treatment of several types of cancer. The collaboration encompasses combinations of our ADC technology with fully-human antibodies developed by Astellas to proprietary cancer targets. 
 
Under this collaboration, we and Astellas are co-funding all development and commercialization costs for enfortumab vedotin and will share on a 50:50 basis in any profits that may come from this product candidate if successfully commercialized. Costs associated with co-development activities are included in research and development expense. Either party may opt out of co-development and profit-sharing in return for receiving milestones and royalties from the continuing party. The agreement contemplates that the parties will enter into supplemental agreements pursuant to which they will allocate responsibilities. 
 
16 
 
Either party may terminate the collaboration agreement if the other party becomes insolvent or the other party materially breaches the agreement and such breach remains uncured. Subject to certain restrictions, either party may terminate the collaboration agreement for any reason upon prior written notice to the other party. The collaboration agreement can also be terminated by mutual written consent of the parties. If neither party exercises its option to terminate the collaboration agreement, then the agreement will automatically terminate on the later of (a) the expiration of all payment obligations pursuant to the collaboration agreement, or (b) the day upon which we and Astellas cease to develop and commercialize products under the agreement. 
 
Genmab Co-Development Collaboration 
 
In 2011, we entered into an ADC research collaboration agreement with Genmab. Under the agreement, Genmab has rights to utilize our ADC technology with its HuMax-TF antibody targeting the Tissue Factor, or TF, antigen, which is expressed on numerous types of solid tumors. 
 
Under this agreement, we exercised a co-development option for tisotumab vedotin in August 2017. We and Genmab will share all future costs and profits for development and commercialization of tisotumab vedotin on a 50:50 basis. Costs associated with co-development activities are included in research and development expense. We will be responsible for tisotumab vedotin commercialization activities in the U.S., Canada, and Mexico, while Genmab will be responsible for commercialization activities in all other territories. Each party has the option to co-promote up to a specified percentage of the sales effort in the other partys territories. Either party may opt out of co-development and profit-sharing in return for receiving milestones and royalties from the continuing party. 
 
Either party may terminate the collaboration agreement if the other party becomes insolvent or materially breaches the agreement and such breach remains uncured. In addition, either party may terminate the collaboration agreement if such partys patent rights subject to the agreement are challenged by the other party or its sublicensees. 
 
Unum Therapeutics Collaboration 
 
In June 2015, we entered into a collaboration agreement with Unum to develop and commercialize novel ACTR therapies incorporating our antibodies for the treatment of cancer. Unums proprietary ACTR technology enables programming of a patients T-cells to attack tumor cells when co-administered with tumor-specific therapeutic antibodies. Under the terms of the agreement, we and Unum are developing two ACTR product candidates that combine Unums ACTR technology with our antibodies. Unum is obligated to conduct preclinical research and clinical development activities through phase 1 clinical trials, and we are obligated to provide funding for these activities. The agreement calls for us to work together to co-develop and jointly fund programs after phase 1 clinical trials unless either company opts out. We and Unum would co-commercialize any successfully developed product candidates and share any profits 50:50 on any co-developed programs in the United States. We retain exclusive commercial rights outside of the United States, paying Unum a royalty that is a high single digit to mid-teens percentage of ex-U.S. sales. The potential future licensing and progress-dependent milestone payments to Unum under the collaboration may total up to $400 million between the two ACTR programs, payment of which is triggered by the achievement of development, regulatory and commercial milestones. 
Pieris Pharmaceuticals Collaboration 
 
In February 2018, we entered into a license and collaboration agreement and related platform technology license agreement with Pieris to develop novel bispecifics incorporating our antibodies and Pieris proprietary Anticalin proteins for the treatment of cancer. The agreements provide for an upfront payment totaling $30 million to Pieris. Under the terms of the license and collaboration agreement, Pieris is obligated to conduct preclinical research, and we are obligated to provide funding for these activities. Following this initial research phase, we will have the option to select up to three product candidates for further development. We would then develop the product candidates independently, subject to a limited opt in right held by Pieris. Prior to the initiation of pivotal trials with respect to the first product candidate developed, 
 
17 
 
 we may in our discretion provide Pieris the option to co-develop that product candidate. Unless Pieris elects to co-develop the first product candidate, we are required to provide Pieris the option to co-develop the second product candidate. Regardless of any prior elections made by Pieris, we have no obligation to provide Pieris with a right to opt in to the development of the third product candidate. In the event Pieris does elect to opt in to the development of the first or second product candidate, Pieris would be required to reimburse us 100% of milestone payments received as of the date of exercise and 50% of post-GLP toxicology development costs. We and Pieris would share costs and profits associated with the co-developed product candidate on a 50:50 basis. Pieris would be responsible for commercialization in the U.S. and we would be responsible for commercialization activities in all other territories. With respect to the other two product candidates, or all three if Pieris does not exercise its right to opt-in, we would have sole responsibility for development, funding and commercialization and would owe Pieris development and sales milestones and royalties on sales in the mid-single digits to low double digits. The potential future licensing and progress-dependent milestone payments to Pieris under the collaboration for the three product candidates total up to $1.2 billion based on the achievement of development, regulatory and commercial milestones. We also have the right to select additional candidates for further development subject to the payment of additional fees, milestone payments and royalties. 
 
Other ADC Collaborations 
 
We have other active collaborations with a number of companies to allow them to use our proprietary ADC technology. Under these ADC collaborations, which we have entered into in the ordinary course of business, we typically receive or are entitled to receive upfront cash payments, progress- and sales-dependent milestones and royalties on net sales of products incorporating our ADC technology, as well as annual maintenance fees and support fees for research and development services and materials provided under the agreements. Our ADC collaborators are solely responsible for research, product development, manufacturing and commercialization of any product candidates under these collaborations, which includes the achievement of the potential milestones. 
 
Our current ADC collaborations are at various stages of clinical and preclinical development. Our ability to generate significant future revenues from our current ADC collaboration agreements will largely depend on a product that incorporates our ADC technology entering late-stage clinical development and receiving marketing approval from the FDA at which point the milestone payments, royalties or other rights and benefits would become more substantial and material to our company. 
 
License Agreements 
 
We have in-licensed antibodies, targets and enabling technologies from pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies and academic institutions for use in our pipeline programs and ADC technology, including the following: 
 
Bristol-Myers Squibb License.    In March 1998, we obtained rights to some of our technologies and product candidates, portions of which are exclusive, through a license agreement with Bristol-Myers Squibb. Through this license, we secured rights to use various targeting technologies. Under the terms of the license agreement, we are required to pay royalties in the low single digits on net sales of products, including ADCETRIS, which incorporate various technologies owned by Bristol-Myers Squibb. 
 
University of Miami License.    In September 1999, we entered into an exclusive license agreement with the University of Miami, Florida, covering an anti-CD30 monoclonal antibody that is the basis for the antibody component of ADCETRIS. Under the terms of this license, we made an upfront payment and progress-dependent milestone payments. We are required to pay annual maintenance fees and royalties in the low single digits on net sales of products, including ADCETRIS, incorporating technology licensed from the University of Miami. 
 
Patents and Proprietary Technology 
 
Our owned and licensed patents and patent applications are directed to ADCETRIS, our product candidates, monoclonal antibodies, our ADC and SEA technologies and other antibody-based and/or enabling technologies. We commonly seek patent claims directed to compositions of matter, including antibodies, ADCs, and drug-
 
18 
 
 linkers containing highly potent cell-killing agents, as well as methods of using such compositions. When appropriate, we also seek claims to related technologies, such as methods of using certain sugar analogs utilized in our SEA technology. For ADCETRIS and each of our product candidates, we have filed or expect to file multiple patent applications. We maintain patents and prosecute applications worldwide for technologies that we have out-licensed, such as our ADC technology. Similarly, for partnered products and product candidates, such as ADCETRIS, enfortumab vedotin and tisotumab vedotin, we seek to work closely with our development partners to coordinate patent efforts, including patent application filings, prosecution, term extension, defense and enforcement. As ADCETRIS and our development product candidates advance through research and development, we seek to diligently identify and protect new inventions, such as combination therapies, improvements to methods of manufacturing, and methods of treatment. We also work closely with our scientific personnel to identify and protect new inventions that could eventually add to our development pipeline. 
 
We have the following patents relating to ADCETRIS and our pipeline: 
 

 | For ADCETRIS and our related ADC technology, we own ten patents in the United States and Europe that will expire between 2020 and 2031.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | For enfortumab vedotin and our related ADC technology, we own, co-own or have licensed rights to ten patents in the United States and Europe that will expire between 2022 and 2031. Of these patents, we own or co-own eight patents and have licensed rights to two patents.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | For tisotumab vedotin and our related ADC technology, we own, co-own or have licensed rights to ten patents in the United States and Europe that will expire between 2022 and 2032. Of these patents, we own or co-own five patents and have licensed rights to five patents.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | For ladiratuzumab vedotin and our related ADC technology, we own, co-own or have licensed rights to nine patents in the United States and Europe that will expire between 2020 and 2032. Of these patents, we own or co-own rights to seven patents and have licensed rights to two patents.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | For denintuzumab mafodotin and our related ADC technology, we own or co-own eleven patents in the United States and Europe that will expire between 2024 and 2029.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | For SEA-CD40 and our related SEA technology, we own, co-own or have licensed rights to twelve patents in the United States and Europe that will expire between 2019 and 2030. Of these patents, we own or co-own nine patents and have licensed rights to three patents.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
The actual protection afforded by a patent, which can vary from country to country, depends on the type of patent, the scope of its coverage as determined by the patent office or courts in the country, and the availability of legal remedies in the country. This list above does not identify all patents that may be related to ADCETRIS and our product candidates. For example, in addition to the listed patents, we have patents on platform technologies (that relate to certain general classes of products or methods), as well as patents that relate to methods of using, manufacturing or administering a product or product candidate, that may confer additional patent protection. We also have pending patent applications that may give rise to new patents related to one or more of these agents. 
 
The information in the above list is based on our current assessment of patents that we own or control or have exclusively licensed. The information is subject to revision, for example, in the event of changes in the law or legal rulings affecting our patents or if we become aware of new information. Significant legal issues remain unresolved as to the extent and scope of available patent protection for biotechnology products and processes in the U.S. and other important markets outside the U.S. We expect that litigation will likely be necessary to determine the term, validity, enforceability, and/or scope of certain of our patents and other proprietary rights. An adverse decision or ruling with respect to one or more of our patents could result in the loss of patent protection for a product and, in turn, the introduction of competitor products or follow-on biologics to the market earlier than anticipated, and could force us to either obtain third-party licenses at a material cost or cease using a technology or commercializing a product. 
 
19 
 
Patents expire, on a country by country basis, at various times depending on various factors, including the filing date of the corresponding patent application(s), the availability of patent term extension and supplemental protection certificates and requirements for terminal disclaimers. Although we believe our owned and licensed patents and patent applications provide us with a competitive advantage, the patent positions of biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies can be uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions. We and our corporate collaborators may not be able to develop patentable products or processes or obtain patents from pending patent applications. Even if patent claims are allowed, the claims may not issue. In the event of issuance, the patents may not be sufficient to protect the proprietary technology owned by or licensed to us or our corporate collaborators. Our or our collaborators current patents, or patents that issue on pending applications, may be challenged, invalidated, infringed or circumvented. In addition, changes to patent laws in the United States or in other countries may limit our ability to defend or enforce our patents, or may apply retroactively to affect the term and/or scope of our patents. Our patents have been and may in the future be challenged by third parties in post-issuance administrative proceedings or in litigation as invalid, not infringed or unenforceable under U.S. or foreign laws, or they may be infringed by third parties. As a result, we are or may be from time to time involved in the defense and enforcement of our patent or other intellectual property rights in a court of law and administrative tribunals, such as in U.S. Patent and Trademark Office inter partes review or reexamination proceedings, foreign opposition proceedings or related legal and administrative proceedings in the United States and elsewhere. The costs of defending our patents or enforcing our proprietary rights in post-issuance administrative proceedings or litigation may be substantial and the outcome can be uncertain. An adverse outcome may allow third parties to use our proprietary technologies without a license from us or our collaborators. Our and our collaborators patents may also be circumvented, which may allow third parties to use similar technologies without a license from us or our collaborators. 
 
Our commercial success depends significantly on our ability to operate without infringing patents and proprietary rights of third parties. Organizations such as pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, universities and research institutions may have filed patent applications or may have been granted patents that cover technologies similar to the technologies owned or licensed to us or to our collaborators. In addition, we are monitoring the progress of multiple pending patent applications of other organizations that, if granted, may require us to license or challenge their validity or enforceability in order to continue commercializing ADCETRIS or to commercialize our product candidates. Our challenges to patents of other organizations may not be successful, which may affect our ability to commercialize ADCETRIS or our product candidates. We cannot determine with certainty whether patents or patent applications of other parties may materially affect our or our collaborators ability to make, use or sell ADCETRIS or any other products or product candidates. 
 
We require our scientific personnel to maintain laboratory notebooks and other research records in accordance with our policies, which are designed to strengthen and support our intellectual property protection. In addition to our patented intellectual property, we also rely on trade secrets and other proprietary information, especially when we do not believe that patent protection is appropriate or can be obtained. Our policy is to require each of our employees, consultants and advisors to execute a proprietary information and inventions assignment agreement before beginning their employment, consulting or advisory relationship with us. These agreements provide that the individual must keep confidential and not disclose to other parties any confidential information developed or learned by the individual during the course of their relationship with us except in limited circumstances. These agreements also provide that we will own all inventions conceived or reduced to practice by the individual in the course of rendering services to us. Our agreements with collaborators require them to have a similar policy and agreements with their employees, consultants and advisors. Our policy and agreements and those of our collaborators may not sufficiently protect our confidential information, or third parties may independently develop equivalent information. 
 
Government Regulation 
 
The FDA and comparable regulatory agencies in state and local jurisdictions and in foreign countries impose substantial requirements upon the clinical development, pre-market approval, manufacture, marketing 
 
20 
 
 and distribution of biopharmaceutical products. These agencies and other regulatory agencies regulate research and development activities and the testing, approval, manufacture, quality control, safety, efficacy, labeling, storage, distribution, import, export, recordkeeping, advertising and promotion of products and product candidates. Failure to comply with applicable FDA or other requirements may result in Warning Letters, civil or criminal penalties, suspension or delays in clinical development, recall or seizure of products, partial or total suspension of production or withdrawal of a product from the market. The development and approval process requires substantial time, effort and financial resources, and we cannot be certain that any approvals for our product candidates will be granted on a timely basis, if at all. We must obtain approval of our product candidates from the FDA before we can begin marketing them in the United States. Similar approvals are also required in other countries. 
 
Product development and approval within this regulatory framework is uncertain, can take many years and requires the expenditure of substantial resources. The nature and extent of the governmental review process for our product candidates will vary, depending on the regulatory categorization of particular product candidates and various other factors. 
 
The necessary steps before a new biopharmaceutical product may be sold in the United States ordinarily include: 
 

 | preclinical in vitro and in vivo tests, some of which must comply with Good Laboratory Practices, or GLP;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | submission to the FDA of an IND which must become effective before clinical trials may commence, and which must be updated at least annually with a report on development;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | development of a drug formulation and manufacture of the drug product for clinical trials, and commercial sale, if approved;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | completion of adequate and well controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the product candidate for its intended use;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | submission to the FDA of a marketing authorization application in the form of a BLA, which must be accompanied by a substantial user fee unless the fee is waived;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | FDA pre-approval inspection of manufacturing facilities for current Good Manufacturing Practices, or GMP, compliance and FDA inspection of select clinical trial sites for Good Clinical Practice, or GCP, compliance; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | FDA review and approval of the marketing authorization application and product prescribing information prior to any commercial sale.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
The results of preclinical tests (which include laboratory evaluation as well as preclinical GLP studies to evaluate toxicity) for a particular product candidate, together with related manufacturing information and analytical data, and a clinical protocol are submitted as part of an IND to the FDA. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA, within the 30 day time period, raises concerns or questions about the conduct of the clinical trial, including concerns that human research subjects will be exposed to unreasonable health risks. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. IND submissions may be authorized by the FDA, for example, to commence a clinical trial. A separate submission to an existing IND must also be made for each successive clinical trial conducted during product development. Further, an independent institutional review board, or IRB, for each medical center proposing to conduct the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial before it commences at that center and it must monitor the study until completed. The FDA, the IRB or the sponsor may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Clinical testing also must satisfy extensive GCP regulations and regulations for informed consent and privacy of individually-identifiable information. 
 
21 
 
Clinical trials generally are conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or in some instances, be skipped. In phase 1, the initial introduction of the product into humans, the product candidate is tested to assess safety, metabolism, pharmacokinetics and pharmacological actions associated with increasing doses. Phase 2 usually involves trials in a limited patient population to evaluate the efficacy of the potential product for specific, targeted indications, determine dosage tolerance and optimum dosage and further identify possible adverse reactions and safety risks. Phase 3 and pivotal trials are undertaken to evaluate further clinical efficacy and safety often in comparison to standard therapies within a broader patient population, generally at geographically dispersed clinical sites. Phase 4, or post-marketing, trials may be required as a condition of commercial approval by the FDA and may also be voluntarily initiated by us or our collaborators. Since we received accelerated approval for ADCETRIS from the FDA for the relapsed sALCL indication, we are subject to certain post-approval requirements pursuant to which we are conducting an additional confirmatory phase 3 trial, the ECHELON-2 trial, to verify and describe the clinical benefit of ADCETRIS in the relapsed sALCL indication. Results from either the ECHELON-1 trial or the ECHELON-2 trial could fulfill this requirement in the United States. Phase 1, phase 2 or phase 3 testing may not be completed successfully within any specific period of time, if at all, with respect to any of our product candidates. Similarly, suggestions of safety, tolerability or efficacy in earlier stage trials do not necessarily predict findings of safety and efficacy in subsequent trials. Furthermore, the FDA, an IRB or we may suspend a clinical trial at any time for various reasons, including a finding that the subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Clinical trials are subject to central registration and results reporting requirements, such as on www.clinicaltrials.gov. 
 
The results of preclinical studies, pharmaceutical development and clinical trials, together with information on a products chemistry, manufacturing, and controls, are submitted to the FDA in the form of a BLA, for approval of the manufacture, marketing and commercial shipment of the pharmaceutical product. Data from clinical trials are not always conclusive and the FDA may interpret data differently than we or our collaborators interpret data. The FDA may also convene an Advisory Committee of external advisors to answer questions regarding the approvability and labeling of an application. The FDA is not obligated to follow the Advisory Committees recommendation. The submission of a BLA is required to be accompanied by a substantial user fee, with few exceptions or waivers. The user fee is administered under PDUFA, which sets goals for the timeliness of the FDAs review. A standard review period is twelve months from submission of the application, while priority review is eight months from submission of the application. The testing and approval process is likely to require substantial time, effort and resources, and there can be no assurance that any approval will be granted on a timely basis, if at all. The FDA may deny review of an application by refusing to file the application or not approve an application by issuance of a complete response letter if applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied, require additional testing or information, or require post-market testing and surveillance to monitor the safety or efficacy of the product. Approval may occur with significant Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies, or REMS, that limit the clinical use in the prescribing information, distribution or promotion of a product. Once an approval is issued, the FDA may require safety-related labeling changes or withdraw product approval if ongoing regulatory requirements are not met or if safety problems occur after the product reaches the market. In addition, the FDA may require further testing of ADCETRIS, including phase 4 clinical trials, and surveillance programs to monitor the safety of ADCETRIS, and the FDA has the power to prevent or limit further marketing of ADCETRIS based on the results of these post-marketing programs or other information. 
 
Products manufactured or distributed pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including manufacture, labeling, distribution, advertising, promotion, recordkeeping, annual product quality review and reporting requirements. Adverse event experience with the product must be reported to the FDA in a timely fashion and pharmacovigilance programs to proactively look for these adverse events are mandated by the FDA. Manufacturers and their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with ongoing regulatory requirements, including cGMPs, which impose certain procedural and documentation requirements upon us and our third-party manufacturers. Following such inspections, the FDA may issue notices on Form FDA 483 and Warning Letters that could cause us to modify certain activities. A Form FDA 483 notice, if issued at the conclusion of an FDA inspection, can list conditions 
 
22 
 
 the FDA investigators believe may have violated cGMP or other FDA regulations or guidance. Failure to adequately and promptly correct the observations(s) can result in further regulatory enforcement action. In addition to Form FDA 483 notices and Warning Letters, failure to comply with the statutory and regulatory requirements can subject a manufacturer to possible legal or regulatory action, such as suspension of manufacturing, seizure of product, injunctive action or possible civil penalties. We cannot be certain that we or our present or future third-party manufacturers or suppliers will be able to comply with the cGMP regulations and other ongoing FDA regulatory requirements. If we or our present or future third-party manufacturers or suppliers are not able to comply with these requirements, the FDA may halt our clinical trials, not approve our products, require us to recall a product from distribution or withdraw approval of the BLA for that product. Failure to comply with ongoing regulatory obligations can result in delay of approval or Warning Letters, product seizures, criminal penalties, and withdrawal of approved products, among other enforcement remedies. 
 
The FDA strictly regulates marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of products that are placed on the market. These regulations include standards and restrictions for direct-to-consumer advertising, industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities, promotional activities involving the internet, and off-label promotion. While physicians may prescribe products for off label uses, manufacturers may only promote products for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA has very broad enforcement authority under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, and failure to abide by these regulations can result in penalties, including the issuance of a Warning Letter directing entities to correct deviations from FDA standards, and state and federal civil and criminal investigations and prosecutions. 
 
FDA Regulation of Companion Diagnostics 
 
ADCETRIS and certain of our product candidates may rely upon in vitro companion diagnostics for use in selecting the patients that we believe will respond to our therapeutics. If safe and effective use of a therapeutic product depends on an in vitro diagnostic, the FDA generally will require approval or clearance of a reproducible, validated diagnostic test to be used with our therapeutic product at the same time that FDA approves the therapeutic product. This policy is described in an August 2014 FDA guidance document. The review of these in vitro companion diagnostics in conjunction with the review of our cancer treatments involves coordination of review by FDAs Center for Drug Evaluation and Research and by FDAs Center for Devices and Radiological Health. The FDAs premarket approval, or PMA, process is costly, lengthy, and uncertain. The receipt and timing of PMA approval may have a significant effect on the receipt and timing of commercial approval for ADCETRIS or our product candidates. Human diagnostic products are subject to pervasive and ongoing regulatory obligations, including the submission of medical device reports, adherence to the Quality Systems Regulation, recordkeeping and product labeling, as enforced by the FDA and comparable state authorities. We and Takeda have formed a collaboration with Ventana under which Ventana is working to develop, manufacture and commercialize a companion diagnostic test with the goal of identifying patients who might respond to treatment with ADCETRIS based on CD30 expression levels in their tissue specimens. In this regard, we expect that concurrent approval of a CD30 companion diagnostic will be required for any approval of ADCETRIS in the frontline MTCL indication. 
 
Regulation Outside of the United States 
 
In addition to regulations in the U.S., we and our collaborators are and will be subject to regulations of other countries governing clinical trials and commercial sales, manufacturing and distribution of our products. We must obtain approval by the regulatory authorities of countries outside of the U.S. before we can commence clinical trials in such countries and approval of the regulators of such countries or economic areas, such as Canada, before we may market products in those countries or areas. The approval process and requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary greatly from place to place, and the time may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval. 
 
23 
 
Healthcare Regulation 
 
Federal and state healthcare laws and regulations, including fraud and abuse and health information privacy and security laws and regulations, may also be applicable to our business. If we fail to comply with those laws, we could face substantial penalties and our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects could be adversely affected. The healthcare laws and regulations that may affect our ability to operate include, without limitation, anti-kickback and false claims laws, data privacy and security laws, as well as transparency laws regarding payments or other items of value provided to healthcare providers. 
 
The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or paying remuneration, directly or indirectly, to induce, or in return for, purchasing, leasing, ordering, or arranging for or recommending the purchase, lease, or order of any good, facility, item, or service reimbursable, in whole or in part, under a federal healthcare program, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. The term remuneration has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value. Although there are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting some common activities from prosecution, the exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly. Practices that involve remuneration that may be alleged to be intended to induce prescribing, purchases or recommendations may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exception or safe harbor. Failure to meet all of the requirements of a particular applicable statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor does not make the conduct per se illegal under the Anti-Kickback Statute. Instead, the legality of the arrangement will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis based on a cumulative review of all its facts and circumstances. Several courts have interpreted the statutes intent requirement to mean that if any one purpose of an arrangement involving remuneration is to induce referrals of federal healthcare covered business, the Anti-Kickback Statute has been violated. Additionally, the intent standard under the Anti-Kickback Statute was amended by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, collectively PPACA, to a stricter standard such that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. In addition, PPACA codified case law that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal civil False Claims Act. 
 
The federal civil and criminal false claims laws, including the federal civil False Claims Act, prohibit, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment to or approval by the federal government, including the Medicare, and Medicaid programs, or knowingly making, using, or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim or to avoid, decrease, or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government. 
 
The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, created additional federal criminal statutes that prohibit, among other actions, knowingly and willfully executing or attempting to execute a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third party payors, knowingly and willfully embezzling or stealing from a healthcare benefit program, willfully obstructing a criminal investigation of a healthcare offense, and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing, or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items, or services. Like the Anti-Kickback Statute, PPACA amended the intent standard for certain healthcare fraud under HIPAA such that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. 
 
The civil monetary penalties statute imposes penalties against any person or entity that, among other things, is determined to have presented or caused to be presented a claim to a federal health program that the person knows or should know is for an item or service that was not provided as claimed or is false or fraudulent. 
 
HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, and their implementing regulations, imposes certain requirements on certain types of individuals and 
 
24 
 
 entities relating to the privacy and security of individually identifiable health information. Among other things, HITECH makes HIPAAs security standards directly applicable to business associates, independent contractors or agents of covered entities that receive or obtain protected health information in connection with providing a service for or on behalf of a covered entity. HITECH also created four new tiers of civil monetary penalties, amended HIPAA to make civil and criminal penalties directly applicable to business associates, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorneys fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. 
 
The federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act, created under PPACA and its implementing regulations, requires certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologicals and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid, or the Childrens Health Insurance Program to annually report information related to certain payments or other transfers of value provided to physicians and teaching hospitals, or to entities or individuals at the request of, or designated on behalf of, the physicians and teaching hospitals, and to report annually certain ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. Failure to submit timely, accurately and completely the required information for all payments, transfers of value and ownership or investment interests may result in civil monetary penalties of up to an aggregate of $150,000 per year and up to an aggregate of $1 million per year for knowing failures. Covered manufacturers are required to submit reports on aggregate payment data to the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services on an annual basis. 
 
Many states have similar statutes or regulations to the above federal laws and regulations that may be broader in scope than the aforementioned federal versions and apply regardless of payor, and many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, further complicating compliance efforts. Additionally, our business operations in foreign countries and jurisdictions, including Canada and the European Union, may subject us to additional regulation. 
 
Because of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of the statutory exceptions and safe harbors available under such laws, it is possible that some of our business activities could be subject to challenge under one or more of such laws. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the health regulatory laws described above or any other laws that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including potentially significant criminal and civil and/or administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, imprisonment, exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs, contractual damages, reputational harm, administrative burdens, diminished profits and future earnings additional reporting requirements and oversight if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or similar agreement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations. 
 
Coverage and Reimbursement 
 
Sales of ADCETRIS and any future products depend, in significant part, on the extent to which the costs of our products will be covered by third-party payors, such as government health programs, commercial insurance and managed healthcare organizations. Patients who are prescribed treatment for their conditions and providers performing the prescribed services generally rely on third-party payors to reimburse all or part of the associated healthcare costs. Patients and providers are unlikely to use our products unless coverage is provided and reimbursement is adequate to cover a significant portion of the cost of our products. Pharmaceutical products are typically reimbursed based on FDA labeled indications, recognized compendia listings, available medical literature, evidence of favorable clinical outcomes, determination of medical necessity and cost effectiveness. 
 
Additionally, a third-party payors decision to provide coverage for a product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. In the United States, no uniform policy of coverage and reimbursement for products exists among third-party payors. Therefore, coverage and reimbursement for products can differ significantly from payor to payor. Decisions regarding the extent of coverage and amount of 
 
25 
 
 reimbursement to be provided for each of our product candidates is individual to each insurer, can vary based on provider contract, and will be affected by state and federal laws providing for reimbursement formulas based on acquisition cost. Third party payors continue to work diligently to control their spending on prescription drugs and medical service. The containment of healthcare costs has become a priority of the U.S. government and abroad, and the prices of drugs have been a focus in this effort. The U.S. government, state legislatures and foreign governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products. Adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could further limit our net sales and negatively impact our operating results. Payors, commercial and public in the U.S. and abroad, must review the therapeutics value of our products before extending coverage under their plans to reimburse our products. If third-party payors do not find a product to be of therapeutic value, they may not cover it or, if they do, the level of payment may not be sufficient to allow us to sell our products on a profitable basis. 
 
Many of the patients in the U.S. who seek treatment with ADCETRIS may be eligible for Medicare or Medicaid benefits. The Medicare and Medicaid programs are administered by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, and coverage and reimbursement for products and services under these programs are subject to changes in CMS regulations and interpretive policy determinations, in addition to statutory changes made by Congress. For example, PPACA increased the mandated Medicaid rebate from 15.1% to 23.1%, expanded the rebate to Medicaid managed care utilization and increased the types of entities eligible for the federal 340B drug discount program. In January 2017, the White House Office of Management and Budget withdrew the draft August 2015 Omnibus Guidance document that was issued by the Department of Health and Human Services Health Resources and Services Administration, or HRSA, that addressed a broad range of topics including, among other items, the definition of a patients eligibility for 340B drug pricing. Federal budget decisions have and may result in reduced Medicare payment rates. Federal budget decisions have and may result in reduced Medicare payment rates. In addition, as a condition of federal funds being made available to cover our products under Medicaid, we are required to participate in the Medicaid drug rebate program. The rebate amount under this program varies by quarter, and is based on pricing data we report to CMS. In addition, because we participate in the Medicaid drug rebate program, we must make ADCETRIS available to authorized users of the Federal Supply Schedule of the General Services Administration. This requires compliance with additional laws and requirements, including offering ADCETRIS at a reduced price to federal agencies including the United States Department of Veterans Affairs and United States Department of Defense, the Public Health Service and the Indian Health Service. We are also required to offer discounted pricing to certain eligible not for profit entities that are eligible for 340B pricing under the Public Health Services Act. Participation in these programs requires submission of pricing data and calculation of discounts and rebates pursuant to complex statutory formulas, as well as the entry into government procurement contracts governed by the Federal Acquisition Regulations and the guidance governing such calculations is not always clear. Compliance with such requirements can require significant investment in personnel, systems and resources, but failure to properly calculate our prices, or offer required discounts or rebates could subject us to substantial criminal, civil and/or administrative penalties, as well as, administrative burdens and exclusion from or contract termination regarding these programs. The terms of these government programs could change in the future which may increase the discounts or rebates we are required to offer, possibly reducing the revenue derived from sales of ADCETRIS to these entities. 
 
The requirements governing drug pricing vary widely from country to country. There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for pharmaceutical products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any of our products. 
 
Healthcare Reform 
 
PPACA substantially changes the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers and significantly affects the pharmaceutical industry. PPACA aims to, among other things, expand coverage for the 
 
26 
 
 uninsured while at the same time containing overall healthcare costs. With regard to biopharmaceutical products, PPACA is expected to, among other things, expand and increase industry rebates for products covered under Medicaid programs and make changes to the coverage requirements under the Medicare Part D program. We cannot yet predict the full impact of PPACA at this time for many reasons including that many of its provisions require the promulgation of detailed implementing regulations, which are subject to review and revision. 
 
Many provisions of PPACA may impact the biopharmaceutical industry, including that in order for a biopharmaceutical product to receive federal reimbursement under the Medicare Part B and Medicaid programs or to be sold directly to U.S. government agencies, the manufacturer must extend discounts to entities eligible to participate in the drug pricing program under the Public Health Services Act, or PHS. The required PHS discount on a given product is calculated based on the Average Manufacturers Price, or AMP, and Medicaid rebate amounts reported by the manufacturer. PPACA expanded the types of entities eligible to receive discounted PHS pricing, although, under the current state of the law, with the exception of childrens hospitals, these newly eligible entities will not be eligible to receive discounted PHS pricing on orphan drugs when used for the orphan indication. In addition, as PHS drug pricing is determined based on AMP and Medicaid rebate data, revisions, including the recently published AMP rule, to the Medicaid rebate formula and AMP definition described above could cause the required PHS discount to increase. 
 
Since its enactment, there have been judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of PPACA. In January 2017, Congress voted to adopt a budget resolution for fiscal year 2017, or the Budget Resolution, that authorizes the implementation of legislation that would repeal portions of PPACA. The Budget Resolution is not a law; however, it was widely viewed as the first step toward the passage of legislation that would repeal certain aspects of PPACA. Further, on January 20, 2017, President Trump signed an Executive Order directing federal agencies with authorities and responsibilities under PPACA to waive, defer, grant exemptions from, or delay the implementation of any provision of PPACA that would impose a fiscal or regulatory burden on states, individuals, healthcare providers, health insurers, or manufacturers of pharmaceuticals or medical devices. The potential impact of these efforts to repeal or defer and delay enforcement of PPACA on our business remains unclear. Congress also could consider subsequent legislation to replace elements of PPACA that are repealed. While Congress has not passed repeal or replace legislation, the tax reform legislation signed into law on December 22, 2017 includes a provision repealing, effective January 1, 2019, the tax-based shared responsibility payment imposed by the ACA on certain individuals who fail to maintain qualifying health coverage for all or part of a year that is commonly referred to as the individual mandate. Because of the continued uncertainty about the implementation of the PPACA, including the potential for further legal challenges or repeal of PPACA, we cannot quantify or predict with any certainty the likely impact of the PPACA or its repeal on our business, prospects, financial condition or results of operations. 
 
In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since PPACA was enacted. The Budget Control Act of 2011, among other things, created the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction to recommend to Congress proposals in spending reductions. The Joint Select Committee did not achieve a targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for the years 2013 through 2021, triggering the legislations automatic reduction to several government programs. This includes reductions to Medicare payments to providers, which went into effect in April 2013 and, following passage of the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015, will remain in effect through 2025 unless additional congressional action is taken. The American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, among other things, reduced Medicare payments to several providers and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. 
 
Further, the recently enacted Drug Supply Chain Security Act imposes on manufacturers of certain pharmaceutical products new obligations related to product tracking and tracing, among others, which will be phased in over several years beginning in 2015. Among the requirements of this legislation, manufacturers subject to this federal law will be required to provide certain information regarding the drug product to individuals and entities to which product ownership is transferred, label drug product with a product identifier, and keep certain records regarding the drug product. The transfer of information to subsequent product owners by 
 
27 
 
 manufacturers will eventually be required to be done electronically. Covered manufacturers will also be required to verify that purchasers of the manufacturers products are appropriately licensed. Further, under this new legislation, covered manufacturers will have drug product investigation, quarantine, disposition, and notification responsibilities related to counterfeit, diverted, stolen, and intentionally adulterated products, as well as products that are the subject of fraudulent transactions or which are otherwise unfit for distribution such that they would be reasonably likely to result in serious health consequences or death. 
 
Additionally, there has been increasing legislative and enforcement interest in the United States with respect to specialty drug pricing practices. Specifically, there have been several recent U.S. Congressional inquiries and proposed bills designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, reduce the cost of prescription drugs under Medicare, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drugs. 
 
We cannot predict what healthcare reform initiatives may be adopted in the future. However, we anticipate that Congress, state legislatures, and third-party payors may continue to review and assess alternative healthcare delivery and payment systems and may in the future propose and adopt legislation or policy changes or implementations effecting additional fundamental changes in the healthcare delivery system. We also expect ongoing legislative and regulatory initiatives to increase pressure on drug pricing. We cannot assure you as to the ultimate content, timing, or effect of changes, nor is it possible at this time to estimate the impact of any such potential legislation; however, such changes or the ultimate impact of changes could negatively affect our revenue or sales of ADCETRIS or any future approved products. 
 
Competition 
 
The biotechnology and biopharmaceutical industries are characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition and a strong emphasis on proprietary products. Many third parties compete with us in developing various approaches to treating cancer. They include pharmaceutical companies, biotechnology companies, academic institutions and other research organizations. 
 
Many of our competitors have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approval and marketing than we do. In addition, many of these competitors are active in seeking patent protection and licensing arrangements in anticipation of collecting royalties for use of technology that they have developed. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. These third parties compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to our programs. 
 
With respect to ADCETRIS, there are several other FDA-approved drugs for its approved indications. Bristol-Myers Squibbs nivolumab (Opdivo) and Mercks pembrolizumab (Keytruda) are approved for the treatment of certain patients with relapsed or refractory classical Hodgkin lymphoma, and Celgenes romidepsin (Istodax) and Spectrum Pharmaceuticals pralatrexate (Folotyn) and belinostat (Beleodaq) are approved for relapsed or refractory sALCL among other T-cell lymphomas. The competition ADCETRIS faces from these and other therapies is intensifying. Additionally, Merck is conducting a phase 3 clinical trial in relapsed or refractory classical Hodgkin lymphoma comparing pembrolizumab (Keytruda) with ADCETRIS. If this clinical trial demonstrates that pembrolizumab is more effective than ADCETRIS in that treatment setting, our sales of ADCETRIS would be negatively impacted. We are also aware of multiple investigational agents that are currently being studied, including Roches atezolizumab, Pfizers avelumab, and Kyowas mogamulizumab, which, if successful, may compete with ADCETRIS in the future. Data have also been presented on several developing technologies, including bispecific antibodies and CAR modified T-cell therapies that may compete with ADCETRIS in the future. Further, there are many competing approaches used in the treatment of patients in ADCETRIS four approved indications, including auto-HSCT, allogeneic stem cell transplant, combination chemotherapy, clinical trials with experimental agents and single-agent regimens. 
 
28 
 
With respect to enfortumab vedotin, treatment in second line metastatic urothelial cancer is limited to CPI monotherapy or generic chemotherapy. There are other investigational agents that, if approved, could be competitive with enfortumab vedotin, including Immunomedics sacituzumab govitecan and Lillys ramucirumab. 
 
With respect to tisotumab vedotin, we are aware of other companies that currently have products in development for the treatment of late-stage cervical cancer which could be competitive with tisotumab vedotin, including Agenus, Astrazeneca, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Immunomedics, Innovent Biologics, Merck, and Roche. In addition, several CPIs that are FDA-approved in other treatment settings are being explored for the treatment of late-stage cervical cancer in ongoing phase 2 clinical trials. 
 
Many other pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies are developing and/or marketing therapies for the same types of cancer that our product candidates are designed and being developed to treat. For example, we believe that companies including AbbVie, ADC Therapeutics, Affimed, Agios, Amgen, Astellas, Bayer, Biogen, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Celgene, Eisai, Genentech, GSK, Gilead, ImmunoGen, Immunomedics, Infinity, Karyopharm, MedImmune, MEI Pharma, Merck, Novartis, Pfizer, Sanofi-Aventis, Spectrum Pharmaceuticals, Takeda, Teva, and Xencor are developing and/or marketing products or technologies that may compete with ours. In addition, our ADC collaborators may develop compounds utilizing our technology that may compete with product candidates that we are developing. 
 
We are aware of other companies that have technologies that may be competitive with ours, including Astellas, AstraZeneca, Bristol-Myers Squibb, ImmunoGen, Immunomedics, MedImmune, Mersana and Pfizer, all of which have ADC technology. ImmunoGen has several ADCs in development that may compete with our product candidates. ImmunoGen has also established partnerships with other pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies to allow those other companies to utilize ImmunoGens technology, including Sanofi-Aventis, Genentech, Novartis, Takeda and Lilly. We are also aware of a number of companies developing monoclonal antibodies directed at the same antigen targets or for the treatment of the same diseases as our product candidates. For example, we believe Amgen and Xencor have anti-CD19 programs that may be competitive with our product candidates. 
 
In addition, in the United States, the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 created an abbreviated approval pathway for biological products that are demonstrated to be highly similar or biosimilar to or interchangeable with an FDA-approved biological product. This pathway allows competitors to reference the FDAs prior approvals regarding innovative biological products and data submitted with a BLA to obtain approval of a biosimilar application 12 years after the time of approval of the innovative biological product. The 12-year exclusivity period runs from the initial approval of the innovator product and not from approval of a new indication. In addition, the 12-year exclusivity period does not prevent another company from independently developing a product that is highly similar to the innovative product, generating all the data necessary for a full BLA and seeking approval. Exclusivity only assures that another company cannot rely on the FDAs prior approvals in approving a BLA for an innovators biological product to support the biosimilar products approval. Further, under the FDAs current interpretation, it is possible that a biosimilar applicant could obtain approval for one or more of the indications approved for the innovator product by extrapolating clinical data from one indication to support approval for other indications. The FDA approved the first biosimilar product in the United States in May 2015. In the European Union, the European Commission has granted marketing authorizations for several biosimilars pursuant to a set of general and product class-specific guidelines for biosimilar approvals issued since 2005. We are aware of many pharmaceutical and biotechnology and other companies that are actively engaged in research and development of biosimilars or interchangeable products. 
 
It is possible that our competitors will succeed in developing technologies that are more effective than ADCETRIS, enfortumab vedotin, tisotumab vedotin or our other product candidates or that would render our technology obsolete or noncompetitive, or will succeed in developing biosimilar or interchangeable products for ADCETRIS, enfortumab vedotin, tisotumab vedotin or our other product candidates. We anticipate that we will 
 
29 
 
 continue to face increasing competition in the future as new companies enter our market and scientific developments surrounding biosimilars and other cancer therapies continue to accelerate. We cannot predict to what extent the entry of biosimilars or other competing products will impact potential future sales of ADCETRIS, enfortumab vedotin, tisotumab vedotin or our other product candidates. 
 
With respect to our current and potential future product candidates, we believe that our ability to compete effectively and develop products that can be manufactured cost-effectively and marketed successfully will depend on our ability to: 
 

 | advance our technology platforms;
--+----------------------------------


 | license additional technology;
--+-------------------------------


 | complete clinical trials which position our products for regulatory and commercial success;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | maintain a proprietary position in our technologies and products;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------


 | obtain required government and other public and private approvals on a timely basis;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | attract and retain key personnel;
--+----------------------------------


 | commercialize effectively;
--+---------------------------


 | obtain reimbursement for our products in approved indications;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------


 | comply with applicable laws, regulations and regulatory requirements and restrictions with respect to the commercialization of our products, including with respect to any changed or increased regulatory restrictions; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | enter into additional collaborations to advance the development and commercialization of our product candidates.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Manufacturing 
 
We do not currently manufacture the drug products that we sell or need to conduct our clinical trials, and we therefore rely on corporate collaborators and contract manufacturing organizations to supply drug product for commercial supply and our IND-enabling studies and clinical trials. For the monoclonal antibody used in ADCETRIS, we have contracted with AbbVie for clinical and commercial supplies. For the drug linker used in ADCETRIS, we have contracted with Sigma Aldrich Fine Chemicals, or SAFC, for clinical and commercial supplies. We have multiple contract manufacturers for conjugating the drug linker to the antibody and producing the ADCETRIS product. For our ADC product candidates, multiple contract manufacturers, including AbbVie and SAFC, perform antibody and drug-linker manufacturing and several other contract manufacturers perform conjugation of the drug-linker to the antibody and fill/finish of the drug product. In addition, we rely on other third parties to perform additional steps in the manufacturing process, including shipping and storage of ADCETRIS and our product candidates. 
 
We established our commercial scale supply chain for ADCETRIS prior to commercial launch. For the foreseeable future, we expect to continue to rely on contract manufacturers and other third parties to produce, vial and store sufficient quantities of ADCETRIS for use in our clinical trials and for commercial sale. In addition, we depend on outside vendors for the supply of raw materials used to produce ADCETRIS. For our pipeline programs, we believe that our existing supplies of drug product and our contract manufacturing relationships will be sufficient to accommodate clinical trials through phase 3. However, we may need to obtain additional manufacturing arrangements or increase our own manufacturing capability to meet our future commercial needs, both of which could require significant capital investment. In addition, we have committed to provide Takeda with their needs of certain parts of the ADCETRIS supply chain for a limited period of time, which may require us to arrange for additional manufacturing supply. We may also enter into collaborations with pharmaceutical or larger biotechnology companies to enhance the manufacturing capabilities for our product candidates.

AbbVie Biotechnology.    In 2004, we entered into a development and supply agreement with AbbVie (formerly a part of Abbott Laboratories) to manufacture developmental, clinical and commercial quantities of anti-CD30 monoclonal antibody, which is a component of ADCETRIS. The agreement generally provides for the supply by AbbVie and the purchase by us of such anti-CD30 monoclonal antibody. Under terms of the supply agreement, we may purchase a portion of our required anti-CD30 monoclonal antibody from a second source third-party supplier. We are required to make a minimum annual purchase. The anti-CD30 monoclonal antibody is purchased by us based upon a rolling forecast. The supply agreement will continue until 2025 with an automatic one-year term extension unless either party provides written termination notice to the other party. Either party has the right to terminate the supply agreement if the other party materially breaches its obligations thereunder. 
 
SAFC.    In 2010, we entered into a commercial supply agreement with SAFC to manufacture commercial quantities of drug linker that is a component of ADCETRIS. The agreement generally provides for the supply by SAFC and the purchase by us of drug linker. Under terms of the supply agreement, we may purchase a portion of our required drug linker from a second source third-party supplier. We are required to make a minimum annual purchase. The drug linker is purchased by us based upon a rolling forecast. The supply agreement will continue until the completion of the tenth contract year following the initial commercial order with automatic term extension unless either party provides written termination notice to the other party. Either party has the right to terminate the supply agreement if the other party materially breaches its obligations thereunder. 
 
In October 2017, we acquired a biologics manufacturing facility located in Bothell, Washington. At that time, we also entered into a clinical manufacturing services agreement with Bristol Myers Squibb Company, or BMS, under which we agreed to manufacture certain BMS clinical product candidates in accordance with prescribed production schedules and quantities through the later of December 31, 2018 or when certain technical transfer activities have been completed, and to maintain personnel, equipment and expertise sufficient to perform the agreed upon services. BMS compensates us for services rendered under the clinical manufacturing services agreement based on an agreed upon rate for use of the facility and employees. Following the completion of the clinical manufacturing services agreement, we plan to use the facility to support our clinical supply needs. However, we nonetheless expect to continue to rely on corporate collaborators and contract manufacturing organizations to supply drug product and intermediates for commercial supply and our IND-enabling studies and clinical trials. 
 
Commercial Operations and Information about Geographic Areas 
 
We have allocated commercial resources, including sales, marketing, supply chain management and reimbursement capabilities, to commercialize ADCETRIS in the United States and Canada. We believe the U.S. and Canadian markets for ADCETRIS in the approved indications are addressable with a targeted sales and marketing organization, and we intend to continue promoting ADCETRIS ourselves in the United States and Canada for these and any additional indications we may obtain in the future. Takeda has commercial rights in the rest of the world. As of January 2018, we and Takeda had received marketing authorizations by regulatory authorities in 70 countries, and Takeda continues to pursue marketing authorizations in multiple other countries. 
 
We sell ADCETRIS through a limited number of pharmaceutical distributors. Health care providers order ADCETRIS through these distributors. We receive orders from distributors and generally ship product directly to the health care provider. Three of our major distributors, together with entities under their common controlAmerisourceBergen Corporation, Cardinal Health, Inc., and McKesson Corporationeach accounted for 10% or more of our total revenue in 2017, 2016 and 2015. Our net product sales of ADCETRIS in 2017, 2016, and 2015 were $307.6 million, $265.8 million, and $226.1 million, respectively. Revenues generated outside the United States as determined by customer location were less than 10% of total revenues in 2017, 2016 and 2015. Substantially all of our long-lived assets are located in the United States. 
 
31 
 
Employees 
 
As of December 31, 2017, we had 1,100 employees. Of these employees, 783 were engaged in or support research, development and clinical activities, 169 were in administrative and business related positions, and 148 were in sales and marketing. Each of our employees has signed confidentiality and inventions assignment agreements and none are covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We have never experienced employment-related work stoppages and consider our employee relations to be good.
