 ITEM 1.  BUSINESS
 ﻿
 Business
 ﻿
 General
 ﻿
 We are a financial holding company headquartered in Stillwater, Oklahoma for our banking subsidiary, Bank SNB, a state-chartered member bank. We were organized in 1981 as the holding company for Bank SNB, which was chartered in 1894. We are registered as a financial holding company pursuant to the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended by the Financial Services Modernization Act or Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (the "Holding Company Act"). As a financial holding company, we are subject to supervision and regulation by the Federal Reserve. Bank SNB’s deposit accounts are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) to the maximum extent permitted by law.

﻿
 On December 14, 2016, we entered into a definitive agreement and plan of merger (the “Merger Agreement”) with Simmons First National Corporation (“Simmons”), an Arkansas corporation, pursuant to which, and subject to its terms and conditions, Simmons will acquire all of our outstanding capital stock for $95.0 million in cash and 7,250,000 shares of Simmons’s common stock (the “Merger”), representing an aggregate Merger consideration of approximately $564.4 million (based on Simmons’ common stock closing price as of December 13, 2016), subject to potential adjustments.
 ﻿
 Simmons conducts banking operations through 150 financial centers located in communities throughout Arkansas, Kansas, Missouri and Tennessee. As of December 31, 2016, Simmons had $8.4 billion in total assets, $5.6 billion in loans and $6.7 billion in deposits. The completion of the Merger is subject to, among other things, regulatory and shareholder approval and other customary closing conditions.
 ﻿
 Products and Services
 ﻿
 We focus on providing customers with exceptional service and meeting all of their banking needs by offering a wide variety of commercial and retail financial services including commercial and consumer lending, deposit products and services, specialized cash management, and other financial products and services. Our areas of expertise focus on the special financial needs of healthcare and health professionals, commercial real estate borrowers, businesses and their managers and owners, commercial lending, and energy banking. The healthcare and real estate industries make up the majority of our loan portfolio.
 ﻿
 Our commercial lending services include (i) commercial real estate loans, (ii) working capital loans, (iii) construction loans, (iv) loans to small businesses, (v) loans for equipment and general business expansion, (vi) loans to energy companies based on proved producing reserves and (vii) loans to a broad variety of healthcare providers, business, and related concerns.

 ﻿
 We have developed internet banking services, called Bank SNB DirectBanker®, for consumer and commercial customers, a highly automated lockbox, document imaging, and information service for commercial customers called “Bank SNB Digital Lockbox,” and deposit products that automatically sweep excess funds from commercial demand deposit accounts and invest them in interest bearing funds.  
 ﻿
 Strategic Focus
 ﻿
 Our bank has and will continue to position itself for future growth. We seek to produce consistent and sustainable revenue growth by enhancing, clarifying, and expanding our geographic markets and increasing and diversifying our revenue base. This consists of, but is not limited to: building out existing markets with robust and profitable growth potential; expanding our professional team; and identifying, targeting, and acquiring earning assets under appropriate risk guidelines. We are focused on consummating the Merger with Simmons and will be conducting our operations with the intent to satisfy all of the covenants and conditions to closing contained in the Merger Agreement.
 ﻿
 We also seek to provide customers with exceptional service while, at the same time, improving operating efficiency. Over many years, we have refined our approach to customer service by listening to our customers’ needs and desires. We actively seek to make the customer experience consistent over time and across all of our locations. We improve operating efficiency by focusing on internal policy, process and procedure, along with technology, with the goal of continuous improvement while providing an exceptional experience to our clients.

﻿
 Organization
 ﻿
 Our business operations are conducted through four operating segments that include Oklahoma Banking, Texas Banking, Kansas Banking, and an Other Operations segment that includes funds management (investment portfolio and funding) and corporate investments. Our organizational structure is designed to facilitate high-level customer service, prompt response, efficiency, and appropriate, uniform credit standards and other controls.    ﻿
 Banking Segments – Our banking segments include Oklahoma Banking, which includes the Stillwater division, the Central Oklahoma division based in Oklahoma City, the Tulsa division, and the Colorado division based in Denver; Texas Banking, which includes the Dallas, Austin, and San Antonio divisions; and Kansas Banking, which includes the Wichita and Hutchinson divisions. All of the regional divisions focus on providing commercial and consumer financial services, including deposit products and services, to local businesses and their senior employees and to other managers and professionals living and working in our market areas. The Stillwater, Hutchinson, and Denver divisions serve their respective markets as full-service community banks, emphasizing commercial and consumer lending. The other six divisions pursue a more focused marketing strategy, targeting managers, professionals, and businesses for lending, and offering more specialized services. We originate and produce mortgages in our Stillwater, Oklahoma City, Tulsa, Austin, Wichita, and Denver divisions. Mortgage operations are managed through our home office located in Stillwater, Oklahoma. We originate conventional, jumbo, Federal Housing Administration ("FHA"), Veterans' Administration ("VA"), and other types of first mortgage loans for sale to the Federal National Mortgage Association (“FNMA”) or private investors. Servicing on these loans may be released or retained in connection with the sale.
 ﻿
 Support and Control Functions – Support and control functions are centralized, although each segment has support and control personnel. Costs of centrally managed support and control functions other than funds management (which is included in the Other Operations segment) are allocated to the Banking segments. Our philosophy of customer service extends to our support and control functions. We manage and offer products that are technology based, or that otherwise are more efficiently offered centrally through our home office. These include products that are marketed through the regional offices, such as our internet banking product for commercial and retail customers (Bank SNB DirectBanker®), commercial information, and item processing services (Bank SNB Digital Lockbox). Our technology products are marketed to existing customers and to help develop new customer relationships. Use of these products by customers enables us to serve our customers more effectively, use our resources more efficiently, and increase our fee income.
 ﻿
 For additional information regarding our operating segments, please see “Note 20:  Operating Segments” in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.  
 ﻿
 Banking Centers and Geographic Markets
 ﻿
 The majority of our banking centers are located along the heavily populated areas on the I-35 corridor through Texas, Oklahoma, and Kansas. As of December 31, 2016, Bank SNB had thirty banking centers: six located in Stillwater, Oklahoma (which includes our operations center that facilitates electronic banking), nine located in the Oklahoma City, Oklahoma metropolitan area, three located in Denver, Colorado, two each located in Tulsa, Oklahoma, San Antonio, Texas, Hutchinson, Kansas and Wichita, Kansas and, one each in Chickasha, Oklahoma, Austin, Texas, Dallas, Texas, and Tilden, Texas. In addition, we have a fully dedicated loan production office in Denver, Colorado.
 ﻿
 We focus our efforts on markets with characteristics that will allow us to capitalize on our strengths and to continue establishing new offices in those markets. We extend loans beyond Oklahoma, Texas, Kansas, and Colorado to our borrowers who conduct business in other states. 
 ﻿
 Employees
 ﻿
 Another major component of our strategy is to be an employer of choice in our markets. We aim to employ talented and devoted people who embrace our vision and feel invested in our success. As of December 31, 2016, we employed 387 persons on a full-time equivalent basis, including executive officers, loan and other banking officers, branch personnel, and others. None of our employees or any of our consolidated subsidiary employees are represented by a union or covered under a collective bargaining agreement. Our management considers our employee relations to be excellent.
 ﻿

﻿
 Competition
 ﻿
 We encounter competition in seeking deposits and in obtaining loan, cash management, investment, and other customers. The level of competition for deposits is high. Our principal competitors for deposits are other financial institutions, including national banks, state banks, federal savings banks, and credit unions. Competition among these institutions is based primarily on interest rates and other terms offered, service charges imposed on deposit accounts, the quality of services rendered, and the convenience of banking facilities. Additional competition for depositors' funds comes from U.S. Government securities, private issuers of debt obligations, and suppliers of other investment alternatives for depositors, such as securities firms. Competition from credit unions has intensified as historic federal limits on membership have been relaxed. Because federal law subsidizes credit unions by giving them a general exemption from federal income taxes, credit unions have a significant cost advantage over national banks, federal savings banks, and state banks, which are fully subject to federal income taxes. Credit unions may use this advantage to offer rates that are more competitive than those offered by national banks, federal savings banks, and state banks.
 ﻿
 We also compete in our lending activities with other financial institutions such as securities firms, insurance companies, small loan companies, finance companies, mortgage companies, real estate investment trusts, and other sources of funds. The level of competition for loans is high. Many of our nonbank competitors are not subject to the same extensive federal regulations that govern bank holding companies and federally-insured banks. As a result, such nonbank competitors have advantages over us in providing certain services. A number of the financial institutions with which we compete in lending, deposit, investment, cash management, and other activities are larger than us or have significantly larger market share in the markets we serve. Our Texas, Kansas, and Colorado divisions compete for loans, deposits, and other services against local and nationally based financial institutions, many of which have much larger market shares and widespread office networks. In recent years, competition has increased in our Oklahoma market areas as new entrants and existing competitors have sought to more aggressively expand their loan and deposit market shares. 
 ﻿
 The business of mortgage banking is highly competitive. We compete for loan originations with other financial institutions, such as mortgage bankers, state and national banks, federal savings banks, credit unions, and insurance companies. Many of our competitors have financial resources that are substantially greater than those available to us. We compete principally by providing competitive pricing, by motivating our sales force through the payment of commissions on loans originated and by providing high quality service to builders, borrowers, and realtors.
 ﻿
 Supervision and Regulation    ﻿
 We are a financial holding company under the Holding Company Act and are regulated by the Federal Reserve. Our banking subsidiary, Bank SNB, is an Oklahoma banking corporation and is subject to regulation, supervision, and examination by the Oklahoma State Banking Department and the Federal Reserve. This regulation is intended primarily for the protection of depositors, the deposit insurance fund, and the banking system as a whole, and not for the protection of our shareholders. 
 ﻿

The following summarizes certain provisions of existing laws and regulations that affect our operations and those of Bank SNB. Any discussion of laws and regulations applicable to a bank holding company also apply to us as a financial holding company. This summary does not address all aspects of these laws and regulations or include all laws and regulations that affect us now or may affect us in the future.
 ﻿
 General – As a financial holding company, we are regulated under the Holding Company Act and are subject to supervision and regular examination by the Federal Reserve. Under the Holding Company Act, we are required to furnish to the Federal Reserve quarterly and annual reports of our operations and additional information and reports.  
 ﻿

A financial holding company may engage in certain financial activities, including, without limitation, securities underwriting and dealing, insurance agency and underwriting activities and merchant banking activities. To engage in any such new financial activity, each insured depository institution of the financial holding company must have received a rating of at least “satisfactory” in its most recent examination under the Community Reinvestment Act, and the financial holding company must notify the Federal Reserve within 30 days of engaging in such new activity. We are currently eligible to engage in new financial activities but have no immediate plan to do so.    ﻿

﻿
 Under the Holding Company Act, a bank holding company must obtain the prior approval of the Federal Reserve before (1) acquiring direct or indirect ownership or control of any class of voting securities of any bank or bank holding company if, after the acquisition, the bank holding company would directly or indirectly own or control more than 5% of the class; (2) acquiring all or substantially all of the assets of another bank or bank holding company; or (3) merging or consolidating with another bank holding company.
 ﻿
 Also under the Holding Company Act, any company must obtain approval of the Federal Reserve prior to acquiring control of us or Bank SNB. For purposes of the Holding Company Act, "control" is defined as ownership of more than 25% of any class of voting securities, the ability to control the election of a majority of the directors, or the exercise of a controlling influence over management or policies.
 ﻿
 The federal Change in Bank Control Act and the related regulations of the Federal Reserve require any person or persons acting in concert (except for companies required to make application under the Holding Company Act) to file a written notice with the Federal Reserve before the person or persons acquire control of us or Bank SNB. The Change in Bank Control Act defines "control" as the direct or indirect power to vote 25% or more of any class of voting securities or to direct the management or policies of a bank holding company or an insured bank.
 ﻿
 The Holding Company Act also limits the investments and activities of bank holding companies. In general, a bank holding company is prohibited from acquiring direct or indirect ownership or control of more than 5% of the voting shares of a company that is not a bank or a bank holding company or from engaging directly or indirectly in activities other than those of banking, managing, or controlling banks, providing services for its subsidiaries, non-bank activities that are closely related to banking and other financially related activities. Our activities are subject to these legal and regulatory limitations under the Holding Company Act and Federal Reserve regulations. Non-bank and financially related activities of bank holding companies also may be subject to regulation and oversight by regulators other than the Federal Reserve. 
 ﻿
 The Federal Reserve has the power to order a bank holding company or its subsidiaries to terminate any activity, or to terminate its ownership or control of any subsidiary, when it has reasonable cause to believe that the continuation of such activity or such ownership or control constitutes a serious risk to the financial safety, soundness, or stability of any banking subsidiary of that bank holding company.
 ﻿
 The Federal Reserve has adopted guidelines regarding the capital adequacy of bank holding companies, which require bank holding companies to maintain specified minimum ratios of capital to total assets and capital to risk-weighted assets. See “Regulatory Capital Requirements” on page 9 of this report.
 ﻿
 The Federal Reserve has the power to prohibit dividends by bank holding companies if their actions constitute unsafe or unsound practices. The Federal Reserve has issued a policy statement on the payment of cash dividends by bank holding companies, which expresses the Federal Reserve's view that a bank holding company should pay cash dividends only to the extent that the company's net income for the past year is sufficient to cover both the cash dividends and a rate of earnings retention that is consistent with the company's capital needs, asset quality, and overall financial condition.
 ﻿
 Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (“Dodd-Frank Act”) – The Dodd-Frank Act, enacted in July 2010, made significant changes in laws regarding the structure of banking regulation, the powers of the Federal Reserve and other federal and state banking regulators, deposit insurance assessments, the handling of troubled institutions, regulatory capital calculations, reporting and governance obligations of public companies, and many other provisions affecting supervision of banks, bank holding companies, and other financial services organizations. Among other things, the Dodd-Frank Act:
 ﻿

· | Created the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (“CFPB”), whose regulations may adversely affect the business operations of financial institutions offering consumer financial products or services, including us. Although the CFPB has jurisdiction over banks with $10 billion or greater in assets, the rules, regulations and policies issued by the CFPB may also apply to Bank SNB through the adoption of similar policies by the Federal Reserve, FDIC, and state banking regulators.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Made permanent the $250,000 deposit insurance limit for insured deposits.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------

· | Revised the assessment base for calculating an insured depository institution’s deposit insurance premiums paid to the Deposit Insurance Fund to be based on average consolidated total assets minus average tangible equity rather than on deposits, and makes changes to the minimum designated reserve ratio of the Deposit Insurance Fund.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Eliminated the prohibition against payment of interest on demand deposits, which allows businesses to have interest bearing demand accounts formerly prohibited by law and Federal Reserve regulations.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Changed the requirements for certain transactions with affiliates and insiders.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Required banking regulators to establish standards prohibiting as an unsafe and unsound practice any compensation plan of a bank holding company that provides an insider or other employee with excessive compensation or compensation that gives rise to excessive risk or could lead to a material financial loss to the institution.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Limited the use of new trust preferred securities issued after May 19, 2010 as regulatory capital.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Permitted banks to engage in de novo branching outside of their home states, provided that the laws of the target state permit banks chartered in that state to branch within that state.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  ﻿
 Significant elements of the Dodd-Frank Act have been implemented, but implementation of other elements of the Act requires additional regulations, many of which have not yet been established. 
 ﻿
 Source of Strength Doctrine – Federal Reserve policy requires a bank holding company to serve as a source of financial and managerial strength to its subsidiary banks and does not permit a bank holding company to conduct its operations in an unsafe or unsound manner. Under this "source of strength doctrine", a bank holding company is expected to stand ready to use its available resources to provide adequate capital funds to its subsidiary banks during periods of financial stress or adversity, and to maintain resources and the capacity to raise capital that it can commit to its subsidiary banks. Any capital loans by a bank holding company to any of its subsidiary banks are subordinate in right of payment of deposits and to certain other indebtedness of such subsidiary banks. The Holding Company Act provides that, in the event of a bank holding company's bankruptcy, any commitment by the bank holding company to a federal bank regulatory agency to maintain the capital of a subsidiary bank will be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee and entitled to priority of payment. Furthermore, the Federal Reserve has the right to order a bank holding company to terminate any activity that the Federal Reserve believes is a serious risk to the financial safety, soundness or stability of any subsidiary bank. The Dodd-Frank Act codified the "source of strength doctrine".
 ﻿
 State Member Bank Regulation – As an Oklahoma state-chartered bank that is a member of the Federal Reserve System, Bank SNB is subject to the primary supervision of the Oklahoma State Banking Department and the Federal Reserve. Prior regulatory approval is required for Bank SNB to establish or relocate a branch office or to engage in any merger, consolidation, or significant purchase or sale of assets.
 ﻿
 The Oklahoma State Banking Department and the Federal Reserve regularly examine the operations and condition of Bank SNB, including, but not limited to, its capital adequacy, loans, allowance for loan losses, investments, liquidity, interest rate risk, and management practices. In addition, Bank SNB is required to furnish quarterly and annual reports to the Federal Reserve. Oklahoma State Banking Department and the Federal Reserve enforcement authority includes the power to remove officers and directors and the authority to issue cease-and-desist orders to prevent a state member bank from engaging in unsafe or unsound practices or violating laws or regulations governing its business.
 ﻿
 Dividend Restrictions – Dividends from Bank SNB constitute the principal source of our cash revenues. The payment of dividends by Bank SNB is subject to regulatory restrictions. Bank SNB is subject to legal and regulatory limitations on the amount of dividends that it may pay without prior approval of the Oklahoma State Banking Department and the Federal Reserve. Under these regulations, the total amount of dividends that may be paid in any calendar year by Bank SNB to us without regulatory approval is limited to the current year’s net profits, combined with the retained net profits of the preceding two years. In addition, Bank SNB is prohibited by federal statute from paying dividends or making any other capital distribution that would cause Bank SNB to fail to meet its regulatory capital requirements or when the payment of dividends would be an unsafe and unsound banking practice. 
 ﻿
 Limits on Loans to One Borrower – As an Oklahoma state-chartered bank, Bank SNB is subject to limits on the amount of loans it can make to one borrower. With certain limited exceptions, loans and extensions of credit from Oklahoma state-chartered banks outstanding to any borrower (including certain related entities of the borrower) at any one time may not exceed 

 
8



30% of the capital of the bank. An Oklahoma state-chartered bank may lend an additional amount if the loan is fully secured by certain types of collateral, like bonds or notes of the United States. Certain types of loans are exempted from the lending limits, including loans secured by segregated in-bank deposits. We have established an internal limit of $20.0 million to any one borrower.
 ﻿
 Transactions with Affiliates – Bank SNB is subject to restrictions imposed by federal law on extensions of credit to, and certain other transactions with, us and other affiliates and on investments in our and their stock or other securities. These restrictions prevent us and our nonbanking subsidiaries from borrowing from Bank SNB unless the loans are secured by specified collateral. Additionally, the restrictions require our transactions with Bank SNB to have terms comparable to terms of arms-length transactions with unaffiliated third persons. In addition, secured loans and investments by Bank SNB are generally limited to 10% of Bank SNB’s capital and surplus with respect to us and Bank SNB’s other affiliates on an individual basis, and to 20% of Bank SNB’s capital and surplus with respect to us and all other Bank SNB affiliates in the aggregate. Certain exemptions to these limitations apply to extensions of credit by, and other transactions between, Bank SNB and our other subsidiaries. These regulations and restrictions may limit our ability to obtain funds from Bank SNB for our cash needs, including funds for acquisitions and for payment of dividends, interest, and operating expenses.  
 ﻿
 Real Estate Lending Guidelines – Under federal and state banking regulations, banks must adopt and maintain written policies that establish appropriate limits and standards for extensions of credit secured by liens or interests in real estate or that are made for the purpose of financing permanent improvements to real estate. These policies must establish loan portfolio diversification standards; prudent underwriting standards, including loan-to-value limits, that are clear and measurable; loan administration procedures; and documentation, approval, and reporting requirements. A bank’s real estate lending policy must reflect consideration of the Interagency Guidelines for Real Estate Lending Policies (the "Guidelines") adopted by the federal banking regulators. The Guidelines, among other things, call for internal loan-to-value limits for real estate loans that are not in excess of the limits specified in the Guidelines. The Guidelines state, however, that it may be appropriate in individual cases to originate or purchase loans with loan-to-value ratios in excess of the supervisory loan-to-value limits.
 ﻿
 Federal Deposit Insurance – Bank SNB pays deposit insurance premiums to the FDIC. For additional information, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis – FDIC and other insurance” on page 37 of this report.
 ﻿

Regulatory Capital Requirements – The Federal Reserve, the Oklahoma State Banking Department, and the FDIC have established guidelines for maintenance of appropriate levels of capital by bank holding companies and banks. The regulations impose two sets of capital adequacy requirements: minimum leverage rules, which require bank holding companies and banks to maintain a specified minimum ratio of capital to total average assets, and risk-based capital rules, which require the maintenance of specified minimum ratios of capital to "risk-weighted" assets.
 ﻿
 Federal regulations require bank holding companies and banks to maintain a minimum leverage ratio of Tier 1 capital (as defined in the risk-based capital guidelines discussed in the following paragraphs) to total assets of 3.0%. The capital regulations state, however, that only the strongest bank holding companies and banks with composite examination ratings of 1 under the rating system used by the federal banking regulators would be permitted to operate at or near this minimum level of capital. All other bank holding companies and banks are expected to maintain a leverage ratio of at least 1% to 2% above the minimum ratio, depending on the assessment of an individual organization's capital adequacy by its primary regulator. A bank or bank holding company experiencing or anticipating significant growth is expected to maintain capital well above the minimum levels. In addition, the Federal Reserve has indicated that it also may consider the level of an organization's ratio of Tier 1 capital to total assets in making an overall assessment of capital.  
 ﻿
 The risk-based capital rules require bank holding companies and banks to maintain minimum regulatory capital levels based upon a weighting of their assets and off-balance sheet obligations according to risk. The risk-based capital rules have two basic components: a core capital (Tier 1) requirement and a supplementary capital (Tier 2) requirement. Core capital consists primarily of common stockholders' equity and, subject to certain limitations, qualifying perpetual preferred stock, trust preferred securities, minority interests in the equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries, and deferred tax assets, less all intangible assets, except for certain mortgage servicing rights and purchased credit card relationships. Supplementary capital elements include, subject to certain limitations, the allowance for losses on loans and leases, and the amount of perpetual preferred stock and trust preferred securities that does not qualify as Tier 1 capital, long-term preferred stock with an original maturity of at least 20 years from issuance, hybrid capital instruments, including perpetual debt and mandatory convertible securities, subordinated debt, intermediate-term preferred stock, and up to 45% of pre-tax net unrealized gains on available for sale equity securities.

﻿
 The Dodd-Frank Act includes certain provisions concerning the components of regulatory capital. Certain of these provisions are intended to eliminate or significantly reduce the use of hybrid capital instruments, especially trust preferred securities, as regulatory capital. Under these provisions, trust preferred securities issued before May 19, 2010 by a company, such as us, with total consolidated assets of less than $15 billion, are eligible to be treated as regulatory capital, but any such securities issued after May 19, 2010 are not eligible to be treated as regulatory capital.
 ﻿
 The risk-based capital regulations assign balance sheet assets and credit equivalent amounts of off-balance sheet obligations to one of four broad risk categories based principally on the degree of credit risk associated with the obligor. The assets and off-balance sheet items in the four risk categories are weighted at 0%, 20%, 50%, and 100%. These computations result in the total risk-weighted assets. The risk-based capital regulations require all banks and bank holding companies to maintain a minimum ratio of total capital to total risk-weighted assets of 8%, with at least 4% as core capital. For the purpose of calculating these ratios: (i) supplementary capital is limited to no more than 100% of core capital; and (ii) the aggregate amount of certain types of supplementary capital is limited. In addition, the risk-based capital regulations limit the allowance for loan losses that may be included in capital to 1.25% of total risk-weighted assets.
 ﻿
 The federal and state banking regulatory agencies have established a joint policy regarding the evaluation of banks' capital adequacy for interest rate risk. Under the policy, the assessment of a bank's capital adequacy includes an assessment of exposure to adverse changes in interest rates. Management believes our interest rate risk management systems and our capital relative to our interest rate risk are adequate.
 ﻿
 Federal and state banking regulations also require banks with significant trading assets or liabilities to maintain supplemental risk-based capital based upon their levels of market risk. Bank SNB did not have any trading assets or liabilities during 2016, 2015, or 2014 and was not required to maintain such supplemental capital.  
 ﻿
 The federal and state banking regulators have established regulations that classify banks by capital levels and provide for various "prompt corrective actions" to resolve the problems of any bank that fails to satisfy the capital standards. Under these regulations, a well-capitalized bank is one that is not subject to any regulatory order or directive to meet any specific capital level and that has a total risk-based capital ratio of 10% or more, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 8% or more, and a leverage ratio of 5% or more. An adequately capitalized bank is one that does not qualify as well-capitalized but meets or exceeds the following capital requirements: a total risk-based capital ratio of 8%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6%, and a leverage ratio of either (i) 4% or (ii) 3% if the bank has the highest composite examination rating. A bank that does not meet these standards is categorized as undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized, or critically undercapitalized, depending on its capital levels. A bank that falls within any of these three undercapitalized categories is subject to severe regulatory sanctions. As of December 31, 2016, Bank SNB was well-capitalized as defined in applicable banking regulations. For information regarding Bank SNB’s compliance with its regulatory capital requirements, see “Management's Discussion and Analysis – Capital Resources” on page 45 of this report and in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this report, “Note 16 Capital Requirements and Regulatory Matters”.
 ﻿
 Basel III – United States banking regulators are members of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision. This committee issues accords, which include capital guidelines for use by regulators in individual countries, generally referred to as Basel I (1988), Basel II (2004), and Basel III (2011). U.S. banking agencies have published the final proposed rules to implement Basel III in the United States (the “Basel III Capital Rules”), which were effective for us January 1, 2015 (subject to a phase-in period for certain provisions). The Basel III Capital Rules introduced a comprehensive new regulatory framework for U.S. banking organizations, which is consistent with international standards. The implementation of Basel III is intended to help ensure that banks of all sizes maintain strong capital positions to keep them viable during times of financial stress and severe economic downturns.
 ﻿
 The Basel III Capital Rules, among other things, introduce a new capital measure called “Common Equity Tier 1” (“CET1”), specify that Tier 1 capital consists of CET1 and “Additional Tier 1 capital” instruments meeting specified requirements, define CET1 narrowly by requiring that most deductions/adjustments to regulatory capital measures be made to CET1 and not to the other components of capital, and expand the scope of the deductions/adjustments as compared to existing regulations.
 ﻿
 ﻿
 ﻿


 
10



﻿
 Under the Basel III Capital Rules, the initial minimum capital ratios that became effective on January 1, 2015 are as follows:

· | 4.5% CET1 to risk weighted assets
--+----------------------------------


· | 6.0% Tier 1 capital to risk weighted assets
--+--------------------------------------------


· | 8.0% Total capital to risk weighted assets
--+-------------------------------------------


· | 4.0% Tier 1 capital to average quarterly assets
--+------------------------------------------------

  ﻿
 When fully phased in on January 1, 2019, the Basel III Capital Rules will require us to maintain (i) a minimum ratio of CET1 to risk-weighted assets of at least 4.5%, plus a “capital conservation buffer” equal to 2.5% of total risk-weighted assets (the “Capital Buffer”), (ii) a minimum ratio of Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 6.0%, plus the Capital Buffer, (iii) a minimum ratio of Total capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 8.0%, plus the Capital Buffer and (iv) a minimum leverage ratio of 4%, calculated as the ratio of Tier 1 capital to average quarterly assets. The Capital Buffer will be tested on a quarterly basis. Our ability to pay dividends, discretionary bonuses, or repurchase stock will be restricted unless we maintain the Capital Buffer. As of December 31, 2016, we were well-capitalized even if we apply the Capital Buffer, which does not go into effect until future years.
 ﻿
 The Basel III Capital Rules also prescribe a standardized approach for risk weightings that expand the risk-weighting categories from the four Basel I-derived categories to a much larger and more risk-sensitive number of categories, depending on the nature of the assets and resulting in higher risk weights for a variety of asset categories. Specific changes to the rules impacting our determination of risk-weighted assets include a 150% risk weight instead of a 100% risk weight for certain high volatility commercial real estate acquisition, development and construction loans, and a 150% risk weight to exposures that are 90 days past due.
 ﻿
 Banks with under $250 billion in assets were given a one-time, opt-out election under the Basel III Capital Rules to filter from regulatory capital certain accumulated other comprehensive income (“AOCI”) components. Without this election, a bank must reflect unrealized gains and losses on “available for sale” securities in regulatory capital. This AOCI opt-out election had to be made on a bank’s first regulatory report filed after January 1, 2015.  
 ﻿
 We timely made the AOCI opt-out election. Accordingly, amounts reported as accumulated other comprehensive income/loss related to securities available for sale and effective cash flow hedges do not increase or reduce regulatory capital and are not included in the calculation of risk-based capital and leverage ratios. Regulatory agencies for banks and bank holding companies utilize capital guidelines designed to measure capital and take into consideration the risk inherent in both on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet items.
     Brokered Deposits – Well-capitalized institutions are not subject to limitations on brokered deposits, while an adequately capitalized institution is able to accept, renew, or rollover brokered deposits only with a waiver from the FDIC and subject to certain restrictions on the yield paid on such deposits. Undercapitalized institutions are not permitted to accept brokered deposits. Bank SNB is well-capitalized and therefore is eligible to accept brokered deposits without limitation.    ﻿
 Supervision and Regulation of Mortgage Banking Operations – Bank SNB’s mortgage banking business is subject to the rules and regulations of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, FHA, VA, and FNMA with respect to originating, processing, selling, and servicing mortgage loans. Those rules and regulations, among other things, prohibit discrimination and establish underwriting guidelines, which include provisions for inspections and appraisals, require credit reports on prospective borrowers, and fix maximum loan amounts. Lenders such as Bank SNB are required to submit financial statements to FNMA, FHA, and VA annually. Each regulatory entity has its own financial requirements. Lenders’ affairs are also subject to examination by the Federal Reserve, FNMA, FHA, and VA at all times to assure compliance with the applicable regulations, policies, and procedures. Mortgage origination activities are subject to, among others, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, Federal Truth-in-Lending Act, Fair Housing Act, Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, Fair Credit Reporting Act, the National Flood Insurance Act, and the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, and related regulations that prohibit discrimination and require the disclosure of certain basic information to mortgagors concerning credit terms and settlement costs. Bank SNB mortgage banking operations are also affected by various state and local laws and regulations and the requirements of various private mortgage investors.

 Community Reinvestment – Under the Community Reinvestment Act (“CRA”), a financial institution has a continuing and affirmative obligation to help meet the credit needs of its entire community, including low and moderate income neighborhoods. The CRA does not establish specific lending requirements or programs for financial institutions or limit an institution’s discretion to develop the types of products and services that it believes are best suited to its particular community. However, institutions are rated on their performance in meeting the needs of their communities. Performance is tested in three areas: (a) lending, to evaluate the institution’s record of making loans in its assessment areas; (b) investment, to evaluate the institution’s record of investing in community development projects, affordable housing, and programs benefiting low- or moderate-income individuals and businesses; and (c) service, to evaluate the institution’s delivery of services through its branches, ATMs and other offices. The CRA requires each federal banking agency, in connection with its examination of a financial institution, to assess and assign one of four ratings to the institution’s record of meeting the credit needs of its community and to take such record into account in its evaluation of certain applications by the institution, including applications for charters, branches, and other deposit facilities, relocations, mergers, consolidations, acquisitions of assets or assumptions of liabilities, bank and bank holding company acquisitions, and savings and loan holding company acquisitions. The CRA also requires that all institutions make public disclosure of their CRA ratings. Bank SNB was assigned a “satisfactory” rating as a result of its last CRA examination.        Bank Secrecy Act; Patriot Act – Under the Bank Secrecy Act (“BSA”), a financial institution is required to have systems in place to detect certain transactions based on the size and nature of the transaction. Financial institutions are generally required to report cash transactions involving more than $10,000 to the U.S. Treasury. In addition, financial institutions are required to file suspicious activity reports for transactions that involve more than $5,000 and which the financial institution knows, suspects, or has reason to suspect involves illegal funds, is designed to evade the requirements of the BSA, or has no lawful purpose. The Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act, commonly referred to as the “USA PATRIOT Act” or the “Patriot Act,” enacted in response to the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, contains prohibitions against specified financial transactions and account relationships, as well as enhanced due diligence standards intended to prevent the use of the United States financial system for money laundering and terrorist financing activities. The Patriot Act requires banks and other depository institutions, brokers, dealers and certain other businesses involved in the transfer of money to establish anti-money laundering programs, including employee training and independent audit requirements meeting minimum standards specified by the act, to follow standards for customer identification and maintenance of customer identification records, and to compare customer lists against lists of suspected terrorists, terrorist organizations, and money launderers. The Patriot Act also requires federal bank regulators to evaluate the effectiveness of an applicant in combating money laundering in determining whether to approve a proposed bank acquisition.

In addition, Bank SNB is subject to numerous federal and state laws and regulations that include specific restrictions and procedural requirements with respect to the establishment of branches, investments, interest rates on loans, credit practices, the disclosure of credit terms, and discrimination in credit transactions. 
 ﻿
 Enforcement Actions – Federal statutes and regulations provide financial institution regulatory agencies with great flexibility to undertake an enforcement action against an institution that fails to comply with regulatory requirements.
