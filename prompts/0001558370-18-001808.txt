     Item 1.  Business
     General
     Glu Mobile develops, publishes and markets a portfolio of free-to-play mobile games designed to appeal to a broad cross section of users who download and make purchases within our games through direct-to-consumer digital storefronts, such as the Apple App Store, Google Play Store, Amazon Appstore and others.   Free-to-play games are games that a player can download and play for free, but which allow players to access a variety of additional content and features for a fee and to engage with various advertisements and offers that generate revenue for us.   We have a portfolio of compelling games based on our own intellectual property such as Contract Killer, Cooking Dash, Covet Fashion, Deer Hunter, Design Home and QuizUp, as well as games based on or significantly incorporating third party licensed brands including Restaurant Dash with Gordon Ramsay, Kim Kardashian: Hollywood, MLB Tap Sports Baseball and Racing Rivals.  We are headquartered in San Francisco, California, with U.S. offices in California in the cities of Burlingame and San Mateo, and international locations in Canada and India. 
     We were incorporated in Nevada in May 2001 as Cyent Studios, Inc. and changed our name to Sorrent, Inc. later that year.  In November 2001, we incorporated a wholly owned subsidiary in California, and, in December 2001, we merged the Nevada corporation into this California subsidiary to form Sorrent, Inc., a California corporation.  In May 2005, we changed our name to Glu Mobile Inc.  In March 2007, we completed our initial public offering and our common stock is traded on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol “GLUU.”   Except where the context requires otherwise, in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, references to “Company,” “Glu,” “Glu Mobile,” “we,” “us” and “our” refer to Glu Mobile Inc., and where appropriate, its subsidiaries.

 Strategy and Business Developments
     Our Strategy
     Our goal is to become the leading developer and publisher of free-to-play mobile games. Our strategy for achieving this goal is comprised of three parts:

· | Building Growth Games and Maximizing the Value of Evergreen Games;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Attracting and Fostering Creative Leaders; and
--+-----------------------------------------------


· | Cultivating Highly Creative Environments.
--+------------------------------------------

  Building Growth Games and Maximizing the Value of Evergreen Games 
 The first prong of our strategy is to build growth games for smartphones and tablets as well as maximize the value we derive from our evergreen games. Growth games are titles that we continue to update with additional content and features and which grow revenue year over year. We believe a key component of driving revenue growth year over year from a growth title is the inclusion of community features which may involve users competing with each other, forming clubs or groups to cooperate in completing goals or events, or contributing their own original content to the game.  Covet Fashion, Design Home and MLB Tap Sports Baseball are examples of our existing titles that are, or have the potential to be, growth games. We are focused on building growth games in what we refer to as “blue oceans,” meaning that we seek to identify genres that are not oversaturated with competitive titles and where we believe we can become the leader in that genre.  We currently publish titles primarily in four genres: home décor, sports and action, fashion and celebrity, and time management. We believe these are genres in which we have already established a leadership position, are otherwise aligned with our strengths or are conducive to the establishment of a growth game. 
 Evergreen titles are similar to growth titles in that we continue to update them with additional content and features, but differ from growth games in that our focus is to reduce and potentially reverse their year over year revenue declines; to the extent that we succeed in our efforts to grow annual revenue from an evergreen title, we would then consider such evergreen title to be a growth game.  For example, we have recently succeeded in growing the quarterly revenues from Kim Kardashian: Hollywood, a title that we first released in June 2014.  Cooking Dash, Deer Hunter 2018, Kim Kardashian: Hollywood, Restaurant Dash with Gordon Ramsay and Racing Rivals are examples of our existing evergreen titles.
 While we have generally designed our games to incorporate social features that enhance the user’s gameplay experience, as part of our product strategy we have further prioritized adding new social and community-based features, systems, and modes into our growth and evergreen titles.  For example, Covet Fashion allows users to join “Fashion Houses” with other users and then borrow each others’ clothes, receive advice on their looks, chat and work together to unlock additional rewards in special style challenges, Racing Rivals enables players across Apple’s iOS and Google’s Android platforms to compete against each other in real-time, synchronous racing, and our Tap Sports Baseball franchise allow players to challenge their friends to head-to-head matchups.  We intend to continue to innovate to further enable our titles’ ability to function as successful growth or evergreen titles. Many of our games also leverage technologies such as Apple’s Game Center or Facebook Connect, which enables players to compare their high scores and achievements with their friends and against the global leaderboard.  
 We have begun to emphasize developing new titles based on original intellectual property.  Reflecting this strategy, revenue from games based on our own intellectual property increased from 39.7% of our total revenues in 2016 to 59.1% of our total revenues in 2017. However, we also seek to selectively license and utilize key brands within our titles if we believe this will maximize their consumer appeal and revenue potential. For example, in 2017, we added content from Major League Baseball, or MLB, for the first time in our Tap Sports Baseball franchise, which helped us to meaningfully grow revenue from this franchise year over year. In addition, in 2018 we intend to release WWE Universe, a title featuring WWE Superstars, logos and marks, and have recently announced that we will be collaborating with Disney Consumer Products and Interactive Media on the development of an upcoming game.  We have also worked with our 

 
  4

 
celebrity licensors to engage their social media audiences and build games that will resonate with their unique fan bases.  In particular, Kim Kardashian: Hollywood utilizes transmedia storytelling, leveraging Ms. Kardashian West’s built-in social media fan base to drive installs and awareness of the game, and then attempts to surprise and delight those fans with real-world events and other game content based on her life.  Our Gordon Ramsay DASH title utilizes Gordon Ramsay’s personality to guide users to become a restaurateur in the image of Mr. Ramsay. We believe that we can continue to drive installs and awareness of our games through our licensing efforts with recognized brands, celebrities and social influencers that resonate with potential players of our games.  Partnering with desirable licensing partners and renewing our existing licenses requires that we continue to develop successful games based on licensed content and are able to compete with other mobile gaming companies on financial and other terms in signing such partners.  We also plan to continue introducing third-party licensed brands, properties and personalities into our games as additional licensed content, for cameo appearances or for limited time events in order to drive awareness and monetization.
 We also plan to continue monitoring the successful aspects of our games to drive downloads and enhance monetization and retention as part of our product strategy, whether by optimizing advertising revenue within each title, including deeper meta game features, building enhanced and more complex core gameplay, adding additional social features, tournaments and events or otherwise.  
 Attracting and Fostering Creative Leaders
 The second prong of our strategy is to attract, cultivate and retain proven creative leaders who will develop and update our growth and evergreen titles.  Each creative leader is responsible for the long-term planning of his or her growth and evergreen titles and to identify and invest in long-term opportunities and concepts that have the potential to become top grossing hit titles. Our talent model is to attract the industry’s finest and provide them with world-class infrastructure, tools, funding and the support to create hit games. We have made, and plan to make, significant investment in our creative leaders.  
 We have worked with our creative leaders to instill financial discipline and operational excellence in our organization by revamping our prototyping and greenlight processes. Prior to developing a new game, a creative leader works with a small team to rapidly prototype new ideas that have the potential to become growth games. We expect our creative leaders to fail fast and to either continue to iterate on a game concept or to move on to rapidly prototyping a new concept. Once the creative leader and his or her team have sufficiently iterated on their concept and are satisfied that their game has the potential to be a hit title, the creative leader will submit a playable version of the game for greenlighting. If the game is greenlit, we then commit larger investments in terms of headcount and resources.
 Cultivating Highly Creative Environments
 We believe a key part of building growth games and attracting and cultivating creative leaders is providing them with highly creative environments that are optimal for creating hit games. We recently moved into a new headquarters in San Francisco that was designed to foster collaboration among our game teams and focus the company around our core values and creative-led vision.   Creative environments that support our creative leaders and other game development personnel are also needed to attract the level of talent that will support our growth and evergreen titles.  We not only consolidated our studio footprint by moving into our new creative center in San Francisco, but have also significantly increased our investment in our low-cost, scaled center in Hyderabad, India which provides live operations for some of our evergreen titles, insourced art, quality assurance and repeatable sales, marketing and general and administrative functions.  As part of this consolidation, we closed or sold development studios in Beijing, China; Bellevue, Washington; Portland, Oregon; San Mateo and Long Beach, California; and Moscow, Russia.   Business Developments
 Since January 1, 2017, we have taken the following actions to support our business:

· | We continued to focus our efforts on developing and publishing games for smartphones and tablet devices. Our significant achievements related to these efforts include the following: 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | We generated total revenue of $286.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, a 43.0% increase compared to total revenue of $200.6 million for the year ended December 31. 2016.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
 
  5

 


· | In December 2017, we had approximately 3.8 million daily active users and 28.6 million monthly active users of our games on our primary distribution platforms, including Apple’s App Store, the Google Play Store, Amazon’s Appstore, Facebook, and the Mac App Store.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | As of December 31, 2017, we had approximately 1.7 billion cumulative installs of our games on our primary distribution platforms, including approximately 41.7 million installs during the fourth quarter of 2017.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | We successfully integrated Crowdstar following our acquisition of the company in November 2016. Most notably, we achieved significant success with our Design Home title that Crowdstar developed, which originally launched worldwide in November 2016. Design Home peaked at more than one million daily active users and has generated more than 34 million downloads as of December 31, 2017. In addition, Design Home has achieved #1 Top Free rankings on both the U.S. App Store for iPhone and the U.S. Google Play Store and peaked at the #11 and #27 rankings for Top Grossing games on the U.S. App Store for iPhone and the U.S. Google Play Store, respectively. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | We partnered with MLB to incorporate its brands and properties into our MLB Tap Sports Baseball 2017 title. MLB Tap Sports Baseball 2017 also includes current and former MLB players pursuant to our continuing agreements with the Major League Baseball Players Association, or MLBPA, and the Major League Baseball Players Alumni Association, or MLBPAA, including featuring 2016 National League Most Valuable Player Kris Bryant.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | In May 2017, we extended our partnership with award-winning chef Gordon Ramsay and launched a major update to our title featuring Chef Ramsay, rebranding the game Restaurant Dash with Gordon Ramsay.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | In June 2017, we announced that we had entered into a multi-year agreement with WWE to develop a mobile game featuring WWE Superstars, logos and marks. We expect to release our WWE Universe title during 2018 and believe it has the potential to be a growth title. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | In August 2017, we acquired Dairy Free Games, Inc., a developer of mobile real-time strategy games. Dairy Free Games has been developing Titan World, a real-time, player vs. player strategy game in which players collect and upgrade units, bases and abilities. We expect to release Titan World during 2018. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | In February 2018, we announced that we are collaborating with Disney Consumer Products and Interactive Media on the development of an upcoming mobile game that is expected to include characters and stories from across Disney and Pixar franchises.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Across the globe our industry is experiencing a trend where hit titles generally remain higher in the top grossing charts for longer.  We believe this is due to the continued specialization and investment of teams and companies in their hit titles, and the live, social nature of certain games.  Our strategy and the measures we have implemented to support our business position us to take advantage of these trends.  We plan to focus on regularly updating and otherwise supporting our growth and evergreen titles in order to ensure that those games monetize and retain users for even longer periods of time.  In addition, we plan to continue to invest in our creative leaders and the creative environments in which they and their teams work to increase our likelihood of creating significant hit growth titles in 2018 and beyond. 
 Our Products
 We develop and publish a portfolio of mobile games designed to appeal to a broad cross section of the users of smartphones and tablet devices. Our portfolio of growth and evergreen titles is spread across the following genres:
· | Home Décor
--+-----------

 
 
  6

 


o | Design Home, which launched in November 2016 and was acquired as part of our acquisition of Crowdstar, has become our most successful growth title. Design Home allows users to participate in daily Design Challenges in which they style three dimensional spaces with real, high-end furniture and décor. We are planning key updates for Design Home in 2018, including the introduction of a sixth daily event, language localization, an augmented reality mode, deeper game play and a richer social experience. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Sports and Action
--+------------------


o | MLB Tap Sports Baseball 2017, which launched in March 2017, was the fourth installment in our popular Tap Sports Baseball franchise in which we partnered with the MLB, MLBPA and MLBPAA to include real-world baseball stars from each of the MLB’s 30 teams. MLB Tap Sports Baseball 2017 was the highest ranked baseball title in the Apple App Store’s U.S. iPhone top grossing games rankings during 2017, and we meaningfully grew revenue from this franchise year over year. We expect to launch MLB Tap Sports Baseball 2018 in March 2018.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | Deer Hunter 2018, originally launched in September 2015 as Deer Hunter 2016, remained one of our top action titles during 2017. We released two major updates to this title in late 2016 and early 2017, one which added hunting dogs and the other which added an underwater hunting feature, which updates have helped increase revenue from this title. We believe that this is a good example of our ability to increase revenue from our evergreen titles and intend to apply these learnings to other titles. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | Racing Rivals, originally released in the summer of 2013, remained one of the highest ranked racing games in the Apple App Store’s U.S. iPhone top grossing games rankings during 2017. In January 2017, we transitioned the maintenance and daily operations of Racing Rivals to Carbonated, Inc. We intend to launch a major update to Racing Rivals in the second quarter of 2018 and believe that this update will have the potential to increase revenue from Racing Rivals during 2018 as compared with 2017. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | We expect to add to our portfolio of sports and action titles through the worldwide release of WWE Universe in 2018.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Fashion and Celebrity
--+----------------------


o | Covet Fashion, which we acquired as part of our acquisition of Crowdstar, is a top grossing fashion title that was our third largest revenue contributor during 2017. Covet Fashion features continually changing content and daily Style Challenges to help drive engagement and monetization of its users.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | Kim Kardashian: Hollywood, initially globally launched in June 2014, continues to be one of our top revenue-generating titles on an annual basis. In fact, we grew revenue from this title on a quarterly basis during the fourth quarter of 2017 compared with the prior quarter, demonstrating its continuing strength as an evergreen title.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Time Management
--+----------------


o | Cooking Dash, launched in June 2015, continued to be one of our top revenue-generating titles for 2017. We released a significant update to this title during 2017 and expect this to continue to be one of our top evergreen titles during 2018. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | Restaurant Dash with Gordon Ramsay, launched in June 2016, continued the success of Cooking Dash while increasing user retention and average revenue per daily active user. We extended our partnership with Chef Ramsay during 2017.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

o | We expect to add to our portfolio of time management titles through the release of Dash Town in 2018. Dash Town will offer a consolidated format bringing together many of our Dash titles in one game.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Our portfolio of evergreen titles also includes:

o | QuizUp, released in 2013 by Plain Vanilla and acquired by us in December 2016, is a multiplayer trivia game where users can challenge friends to trivia games and create their own trivia competitions.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | The Swift Life, released in December 2017, was developed in conjunction with Taylor Swift and was the first title we launched that was designed to be a true social network rather than a game.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  In addition to MLB Tap Sports Baseball 2018, WWE Universe and Dash Town, we may release additional titles during 2018, including potentially Titan World and a social casino game, depending on their performance during beta testing.
 Across genres, we view our titles as either growth titles or catalog titles, and within the catalog group, our titles are either classified as evergreen titles or legacy titles. Legacy titles are those titles that are still published by us and earn revenue, but on which we expend little to no investment in terms of updates and enhancements.
 We work to ensure that our games have consistently high production values, are visually appealing and have engaging core gameplay.  These characteristics have typically helped to drive installs and awareness of our games and resulted in highly positive consumer reviews.     
 We have continued to improve monetization in our games, with our most popular games remaining successful for longer periods of time. The longevity of our most successful games derives from strong core gameplay, deep meta game features, regular content updates and social and community features, such as tournaments, player-versus-player gameplay and live events. 
 Our games historically have had “thick clients” due to their high production values and, in some cases, 3-D graphics.  A thick client game means that our games have a large file size, often 150 megabytes or more, that resides on the player’s device.  Because of the inherent limitations of the digital platforms and telecommunications networks, which, at best, only allow applications that are less than 150 megabytes to be downloaded over a carrier’s wireless network, users often must download one of our games either via a wireless Internet (wifi) connection or initially to their computer and then load the game to their device.  
 Our Revenue
     We generate the majority of our revenue through “in-app-purchases,” with the balance of our revenue generated by offers and in-game advertising.  For certain of our games in which we incorporate licensed content, we share a portion of our revenue with the licensors featured in these titles. 
     In-App Purchases
     Although users can download and play our free-to-play games free of charge, they can purchase virtual currency or virtual items to enhance their gameplay experience – we refer to these as “in-app purchases” or “micro-transactions.”  Some of the benefits that players receive from their in-app purchases include:

· | Play Longer Through Better Equipment – We generally design our games to become significantly more challenging as the player advances through the game. For a game like Cooking Dash, players can purchase higher-quality ingredients and various boosts that can help them complete increasingly difficult levels more easily. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Play Longer Through Energy Replenishment – We design some of our games, such as Deer Hunter 2018 and Kim Kardashian: Hollywood, to have short playing sessions, the duration of which are limited by the energy available for each session. Players of Deer Hunter 2018 and Kim Kardashian: Hollywood can use 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

their virtual currency to purchase items that will replenish their energy and enable them to extend their gameplay session.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Accelerate Game Progress – Although some players are content to slowly “grind” their way through progressing in a game, others are willing to purchase items to accelerate their progression. For example, our Tap Sports Baseball titles enable players to spend their virtual currency to upgrade their roster of players and boost the effectiveness of such players, thus allowing the player to more quickly assemble a winning team. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Customization – Our games generally enable players to express themselves by customizing their character, the world the character inhabits or a room. For example, Covet Fashion and Design Home each allow users to customize the look of their avatar or room, respectively, by purchasing clothing or home design elements. While in Covet Fashion users own a clothing or accessory item indefinitely after it is purchased and can use it in multiple events, Design Home limits the player to five uses of any purchased design element. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

      We sell virtual currency to consumers at various prices ranging from $0.99 to $99.99 (adjusted for local currencies for sales to players in foreign countries), which is consistent with storefront pricing guidelines, with the significant majority of player purchases occurring at the lower price points.  The digital storefronts generally share with us 70% of the consumers’ payments for in-app purchases, although these rates are generally lower for Android-based platforms in China; we do not have any special agreement or arrangement with respect to pricing or terms with any of the digital storefronts.  Consumers may also acquire virtual currency and other virtual items through gameplay or by completing offers, as described below.
     Offers and In-Game Advertising
     In addition to in-app purchases of virtual currency, we also monetize our games through offers and in-game advertising.  Optimizing advertising revenue within our games requires us to continue taking advantage of positive trends in the mobile advertising industry, particularly as brands continue to migrate budgets from web to mobile.  Offers enable users to acquire virtual currency without paying cash but by instead taking specified actions, such as downloading another application, watching a short video, subscribing to a service or completing a survey.  We work with third parties to provide these offers to players of our free-to-play games, and we receive a payment from the third party offer provider based on consumer response to these offers.  We also work with third party advertising aggregators who embed advertising, such as ads appearing within the game between content transitions and as pop-up ads; the aggregators typically pay us based on the number of impressions, which is the number of times an advertisement is shown to a player, or conversions, which is the number of times players complete an advertiser’s desired action. In addition, from time to time we work directly with other application developers to include advertising for their applications in our games, and the developers pay us based on either the number of impressions in our games or the number of users who download the developer’s application.  We also sometimes include virtual product integrations of goods directly into certain of our titles such as Design Home, Covet Fashion and Kim Kardashian: Hollywood and expect that we may generate increasing advertising revenue from these types of product integrations in the future.
    
Licensed Content
     Following the success of Kim Kardashian: Hollywood and games incorporating licensed third-party brands and properties, like Racing Rivals and our Tap Sports Baseball titles, we increased our licensing efforts, both in terms of securing licenses to develop games based upon or significantly featuring celebrities and other third-party intellectual property and for cameo appearances or to otherwise incorporate third-party intellectual property into our games.  However, we have more recently begun to emphasize developing new titles based on original intellectual property. In 2017, 2016, and 2015, games based on our own intellectual property accounted for approximately 59.1%, 39.7%, and 42.1% of our revenue, respectively.  The increase from 2016 to 2017 was due primarily to the success of Design Home and Covet Fashion as well as the continued strength of Cooking Dash. The decrease from 2015 to 2016 was due to a higher percentage of our revenue being generated from titles that include third-party licensed brands, properties or other content, such as Kim Kardashian: Hollywood, Kendall & Kylie, Restaurant Dash with Gordon Ramsay, Tap Sports Baseball 2016 and Racing Rivals. We expect to launch two new titles in 2018, MLB Tap Sports Baseball 2018 and WWE Universe, that will include third-party licensed content.  We intend to continue to selectively license and utilize key 

 
  9

 
brands within our titles if we believe this will maximize their consumer appeal and revenue potential.
 For games based on or significantly incorporating licensed brands, properties or other content, we share a portion of our revenue with the respective licensors.  The average royalty rate that we paid on games based on licensed content (such as Kim Kardashian: Hollywood, Restaurant Dash with Gordon Ramsay and Kendall & Kylie) or significantly incorporating licensed content (such as Racing Rivals and MLB Tap Sports Baseball 2017) was approximately 18.2% of gross revenue in 2017, 21.9% in 2016, and 21.9% in 2015. However, the individual royalty rates that we pay can be meaningfully above or below the average based on a variety of factors, such as the strength of the licensed brand, our development and porting obligations, and the platforms on which we are permitted to distribute the licensed content.
     Sales, Marketing and Distribution
     We market, sell and distribute our games primarily through direct-to-consumer digital storefronts, such as Apple’s App Store, the Google Play Store and Amazon’s Appstore.  In addition to publishing our smartphone games on direct-to-consumer digital storefronts, we also publish some of our titles on other platforms, such as the Mac App Store and Facebook.  The significant majority of our smartphone revenue has historically been derived from Apple’s iOS platform, which accounted for approximately 63.0%, 62.4%, and 60.5% of our total revenue in 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively.  We generated the majority of these iOS-related revenue from the Apple App Store, which represented 54.2%, 52.7%, and 51.7% of our total revenue in 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively, with the significant majority of such revenue derived from in-app purchases. We generated the balance of our iOS-related revenue from offers and advertisements in games distributed on the Apple App Store and, to a far lesser extent, sales of premium games. In addition, we generated approximately 36.0%, 36.1%, and 38.1% of our total revenue in 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively, from the Android platform. We generated the majority of our Android-related revenue from in-app purchases and sales of premium games made through the Google Play Store, which represented 30.3%, 27.6%, and 27.4% of our total revenue in 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively.  No other customer or digital storefront accounted for more than 10% of our total revenue in 2017, 2016, or 2015.  
     Because of the fragmentation inherent in the Android platform, we need to “port” – or convert into separate versions – our games for a significant percentage of the thousands of Android-based devices that are currently commercially available, many of which have different technical requirements.   
     As part of our efforts to successfully market our games on the direct-to-consumer digital storefronts, we attempt to educate the storefront owners about our title roadmap and seek to have our games featured or otherwise prominently placed within the storefront.  We believe that the featuring or prominent placement of our games facilitates organic user discovery and is likely to result in our games achieving a greater degree of commercial success.  We believe that a number of factors may influence the featuring or placement of a game, including:
    
· | the perceived attractiveness of the title or brand;
--+----------------------------------------------------


· | the quality of the game;
--+-------------------------


· | the level of critical or commercial success of the game or of other games previously introduced by a publisher;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | incorporation of the storefront owner’s latest technology in the publisher’s title;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | how strong the consumer experience is on all of the devices that discover titles using any given digital storefront;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the publisher’s relationship with the applicable storefront owner and future pipeline of quality titles for it; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the current market share of the publisher.
--+-------------------------------------------

 The majority of our games have been featured on the Apple and Google storefronts when they were commercially released, which we believe is in part due to our efforts to be a consistently good partner with Apple and Google.  In addition to our efforts to secure prominent featuring or placement for our games, we have also undertaken a number of marketing initiatives designed to acquire players and increase downloads of our games and increase sales of virtual currency, including:
    
· | using social networking websites, such as Facebook and Twitter, to build a base of fans and followers to whom we can quickly and easily provide information about our games;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | paying third parties, including advertising networks, social media channels and social influencers, to advertise or incentivize consumers to download our games through offers or recommendations;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | using “push” notifications to alert users of sales on virtual currency or items in our games;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | cross-promoting our games through banner advertisements in our other games, as well as advertising our games in our competitors’ games;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | having our celebrity partners market their games to their fans through their social media channels; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | undertaking extensive outreach efforts with video game websites and related media outlets, such as providing reviewers with access to our games prior to launch.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

      In addition, certain of our games featuring celebrities or other licensed content like Kim Kardashian: Hollywood generate significant attention through word of mouth, particularly through social media channels.  We look to leverage existing social media presences in order to increase the virality and commercial success of our games.  In addition, in games like Racing Rivals, we are able to build and maintain a highly engaged community of players around the title.  Social-based methods for promoting our games include in-game events where players compete with and against each other, in-game social promotions and regular content updates, including in-game content that leverages real world events, such as holiday promotions or current events in the life of our celebrity partners.          We have also made significant investments in our proprietary analytics and in the development and implementation of various monetization techniques in our titles.  With our enhanced analytics capabilities, we intend to devote resources towards segmenting and learning more about the players of each of our franchises and further monetizing our highest spending and most engaged players.  We aim to connect the data, insights and knowledge gained from our analytics and monetization techniques to every element of our business – from marketing to merchandising – in order to improve player retention and monetization.
     Development Studios
 Our creative leaders have primary responsibility for overseeing game development for our growth and evergreen titles.  The internal studios that develop our games are located in San Francisco, Burlingame and San Mateo, California; and Toronto, Canada.  In addition, as part of our restructuring activities in 2016 and the acquisition of QuizUp from Plain Vanilla in December 2016, we moved certain of our catalog titles to our Hyderabad, India location to run live operations and produce content updates for these games.  Furthermore, in December 2017 we divested our Moscow, Russia development studio and are in the process of transitioning Deer Hunter 2018 as well as additional legacy titles that were developed by the Moscow studio to Hyderabad.   The divestiture of our Moscow studio was the final step in our nearly two-year long effort to consolidate our studio footprint.  In 2016 and 2017, we closed studios in Beijing, China; San Mateo, California; Long Beach, California; Portland, Oregon; and Bellevue, Washington.  In addition, in January 2017 we transitioned development and live operations of our Racing Rivals title to Carbonated.  
 Our studios are generally supported by central services personnel in our San Francisco, California headquarters who provide expertise with respect to areas such as user experience and business intelligence, with each studio leveraging such central services to varying degrees.  In August 2017, we consolidated certain central technology functions, including 

 
  11

 
business intelligence and software development kit (SDK) development, under our Chief Revenue Officer’s organization to better align these departments with Glu’s user acquisition and advertising revenue teams.  
     Our game development process involves a significant amount of creativity, particularly with respect to developing original intellectual property franchises or games in which we license intellectual property from celebrities, Hollywood studios or other owners of brands, properties and other content.  Creative and technical studio expertise is necessary to design games that appeal to players who typically play in short bursts and to develop games that work well on mobile phones and tablets with their inherent limitations, such as small screen sizes and control buttons. During 2018, we plan to hire additional game development personnel and invest in technical studio expertise to drive content and features in our growth and evergreen titles and to prototype ideas that we believe can become hit growth titles. 
 Despite our actions in 2016 and 2017 to reduce our geographical footprint and consolidate studios, our development personnel are located in five cities in three different countries, which results in certain inherent complexities.  To address these issues, we instituted our Glu University training program.  Glu University is designed to increase interaction among our studio teams, including having international studio team members regularly spend time in our U.S. studios.  The goal of this program is to ensure that we increase the uniformity, quality and commercial success of our games.  In addition, we believe that our strategy of focusing our development efforts on building and maintaining growth and evergreen titles will help ensure more efficient use of our talent and resources across our studios and further promote the sharing of expertise and best practices.    
     Product Development
     We have developed proprietary technologies and product development processes that are designed to enable us to rapidly and cost effectively develop and publish games that meet the expectations and preferences of consumers and the needs of our distributors.  These technologies and processes include: 
· | core development platforms;
--+----------------------------


· | broad development capabilities;
--+--------------------------------


· | application hosting;
--+---------------------


· | porting tools and processes;
--+-----------------------------


· | provisioning and billing capabilities;
--+---------------------------------------


· | localization capabilities, including supporting multiple languages and customization for specific markets, such as China;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | capabilities for integrating and configuring third-party advertising plug-ins, including for maximization of advertising revenue through placements that complement game flow;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | networking technologies for supporting game saves, guilds, matchmaking, leaderboards, and in-game messaging; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | merchandising, monetization tools and marketing platforms.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------

      Since the markets for our products are characterized by rapid technological change, particularly in the technical capabilities of mobile phones and tablets, and changing end-user preferences, continuous investment is required to innovate and publish new games, regularly update our games, and modify existing games for distribution on new platforms.    
     We have continued to utilize measures designed to ensure that we publish and launch games that have a greater likelihood of being commercially successful, while identifying earlier in the development process game concepts and 

 
  12

 
designs that are unlikely to produce hits.  Prior to developing a new game, a creative leader works with a small team to rapidly prototype new ideas that have the potential to become growth games. We expect our creative leaders to fail fast and to either continue to iterate on a game concept or to move on to rapidly prototyping a new concept. Once the creative leader and his or her team have sufficiently iterated on their concept and are satisfied that their game has the potential to be a hit title, the creative leader will submit a playable version of the game for greenlighting. If the game is greenlit, only at that point will we commit larger investments in terms of headcount and resources.
     In addition, we plan to continue holding detailed post-mortems for all products to review and analyze the positive and negative results from each new game launch.  These are in addition to our regular Glu University training sessions where we formally share best practices and learnings amongst the leadership of all functions of our global studios.
     We use third-party development tools to create many of our games, including a game development engine licensed from Unity Technologies to create most of our newest games.  In addition, we rely on our own servers and third-party infrastructure to operate our games and to maintain and provide our analytics data.  In particular, a significant portion of game traffic is hosted by Amazon Web Services, which provides us server redundancy by using multiple locations on various distinct power grids, and we expect to continue utilizing Amazon for a significant portion of our hosting services for the foreseeable future.     
     Research and development expenses were $92.4 million, $81.9 million, and $72.9 million for 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively.  
     Seasonality
     Many new smartphones and tablets are released in, or shortly before, the fourth calendar quarter to coincide with the holiday shopping season.  Because many players download our games soon after they purchase or receive their new devices, we generally experience seasonal sales increases based on the holiday selling period.  Although we believe that the majority of this holiday impact occurs during the fourth quarter, some of this seasonality also occurs for us in our first calendar quarter due to some lag between device purchases and game purchases.  However, the impact of this seasonality on our operating results is significantly affected by our title release schedule.  In addition, companies’ advertising budgets are generally highest during the fourth quarter and decline significantly in the first quarter of the following year, which affects the revenue we derive from advertisements and offers in our games.  Conversely, our marketing expenses also increase in the fourth quarter, since demand for marketing is higher during the holiday season and this increased demand drives up marketing costs.     Competition
     Developing, distributing and selling mobile games is a highly competitive business, characterized by frequent product introductions and rapidly emerging new platforms, technologies and storefronts.  For players, we compete primarily on the basis of game quality, brand and customer reviews.  We compete for space on user’s smartphones and tablet devices in terms of the number of applications on their device and the amount of storage consumed by such applications.  We also compete more generally for the time and attention of users of smartphones and tablet devices who are spending ever-increasing amounts of time on social media, messaging and music, movie and television streaming applications. We compete for promotional and digital storefront placement based on our relationship with the digital storefront owner, historical performance, game quality, perception of sales potential, customer reviews and relationships with celebrities and other licensors of brands and other content.  For content licensors, we compete based on royalty and other economic terms, historical financial performance, perceptions of development quality, speed of execution, distribution breadth and relationships with storefront owners.  We also compete for experienced and talented employees, which competition we expect to encounter as we execute on our strategy to hire creative leaders that have a proven track record of success. 
 We compete with a continually increasing number of companies, including Activision (the parent company of King Digital Entertainment), DeNA, Disney, Electronic Arts (EA Mobile), Gameloft, Gamevil, GREE, GungHo Online Entertainment, Netease, Netmarble, Nexon, Rovio, Warner Brothers, and Zynga and many well-funded private companies, including DoubleDown, Jam City, Machine Zone, Miniclip, Niantic, Playrix, Pocket Gems, Scopely, Storm

8/Team Lava, and Supercell.  We also face competition from online game developers and distributors who are primarily focused on specific international markets.  We could also face increased competition if those companies choose to compete more directly in the United States or the other markets that are significant to us or if large companies with significant online presences such as Apple, Google, Amazon, Facebook, Microsoft or Verizon, choose to enter or expand in the games space or develop competing games.  In addition, we also face competition from mobile applications and websites focused on the home design market, which may include games, e-commerce titles, design applications and others seeking to displace our Design Home title which is a leading title in the currently unsaturated home design application market. Competitors in this space include, or may include, established game developers, established real estate companies, interior design companies, e-commerce companies and other well-funded private companies looking to enter the home design market. We also compete for downloads and time spent on mobile devices with companies that develop popular social media and messaging applications, such as Facebook (with its Facebook, Facebook Messenger, Instagram, WhatsApp and other applications), Pinterest, Reddit, Snapchat, Twitter, Vevo and YouTube, companies that develop streaming music, movie and television applications, such as Pandora, Spotify, Tidal, HBO Go, Netflix, Amazon Prime and Hulu, and with companies that create non-gaming related software applications for celebrities.  
 In addition, given the open nature of the development and distribution for smartphones and tablets and the relatively low barriers to entry, we also compete or will compete with a vast number of small companies and individuals who are able to create and launch games and other content for these devices using relatively limited resources and with relatively limited start-up time or expertise.  As an example of the competition that we face, it has been estimated that more than 3.2 million applications, including more than 800,000 active games, were available on Apple’s U.S. App Store as of February 28, 2018.  The proliferation of titles in these open developer channels makes it difficult for us to differentiate ourselves from other developers and to compete for players without substantially increasing our marketing expenses and development costs.
 Some of our competitors and our potential competitors have one or more advantages over us, either globally or in particular geographic markets, which include:

· | significantly greater financial resources;
--+-------------------------------------------


· | greater experience with free-to-play games, building and maintaining growth or evergreen titles, and building social and community features into mobile games, as well as more effective game monetization;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | stronger brand and consumer recognition regionally or worldwide;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------


· | the capacity to leverage their marketing expenditures across a broader portfolio of mobile and non-mobile products;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | larger installed user bases from their existing mobile games;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------


· | larger installed user bases from related platforms, such as console gaming or social networking websites, to which they can market and sell mobile games;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | more substantial intellectual property of their own from which they can develop games without having to pay royalties;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | lower labor and development costs and better overall economies of scale;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | greater platform-specific focus, experience and expertise;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------


· | broader global distribution and presence; and
--+----------------------------------------------


· | greater talent, both in overall headcount and in terms of experience in creating successful titles.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Intellectual Property
     Our intellectual property is an essential element of our business.  We use a combination of trademark, copyright, trade secret and other intellectual property laws, confidentiality agreements and license agreements to protect our intellectual property.  Our employees and independent contractors are required to sign agreements acknowledging that all inventions, trade secrets, works of authorship, developments and other processes generated by them on our behalf are our property, and assigning to us any ownership that they may claim in those works.  We also vigorously defend our intellectual property.  For example, in November 2014, we filed a complaint against Hothead Games, Inc., or Hothead, in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California alleging that Hothead had willfully infringed certain of our copyrights and trade dress contained in our Deer Hunter 2014 game through Hothead’s release of its game, Kill Shot. On August 3, 2015, we entered into a settlement agreement with Hothead in which Hothead agreed to make payments to us, including ongoing payments and we agreed to allow Hothead to continue to publish the Kill Shot game.  Despite our precautions, it may be possible for third parties to obtain and use without our consent intellectual property that we own or license.  Unauthorized use of our intellectual property by third parties, including piracy, and the expenses incurred in protecting our intellectual property rights, may adversely affect our business.  In addition, some of our competitors have in the past released games that are nearly identical to successful games released by their competitors in an effort to confuse the market and divert users from the competitor’s game to the copycat game.  To the extent that these tactics are employed with respect to any of our games, it could reduce our revenue.
     Our trademarks that have been registered with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office include Glu, Crowdstar, our 2-D ‘g’ character logo, our 3-D ‘g’ character logo and several of our game titles, including Blood & Glory, Contract Killer, Cooking Dash, Deer Hunter, Diner Dash, Eternity Warriors, Frontline Commando, Gun Bros, Heroes of Destiny, QuizUp, Racing Rivals and Tap Sports.  In addition, we have trademark applications pending with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office for other of our game titles.  For certain titles we do not yet have, and do not intend to seek, trademark registration.  We also own, or have applied to own, one or more registered trademarks in certain foreign countries, depending on the relevance of each brand to other markets. Registrations of both U.S. and foreign trademarks are renewable every ten years.
     We have six patents issued by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office and have eleven patent applications pending.  In addition, we have two international patents issued through the Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT), which correspond to two of our six issued U.S. patents, and we have two international patent applications pending with the PCT, which correspond to four of our eleven U.S. patent applications.
 We also use third-party development tools to create many of our games, including a game development engine licensed from Unity Technologies to create most of our newest games.  
 From time to time, we encounter disputes over rights and obligations concerning intellectual property.  If we do not prevail in these disputes, we may lose some or all of our intellectual property protection, be enjoined from further sales of our games or other applications determined to infringe the rights of others, and/or be forced to pay substantial royalties to a third party, any of which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
     Government Regulation    We are subject to various federal, state and international laws and regulations that affect our business, including those relating to the privacy and security of customer and employee personal information and those relating to the Internet, behavioral tracking, mobile applications, advertising and marketing activities, sweepstakes and contests, and gambling.  Additional laws in all of these areas are likely to be passed in the future, which could result in significant limitations on or changes to the ways in which we can collect, use, host, store or transmit the personal information and data of our customers or employees, communicate with our customers, and deliver products and services, or may significantly increase our compliance costs.  As our business expands to include new uses or collection of data that are subject to privacy or security regulations, our compliance requirements and costs will increase and we may be subject to increased regulatory scrutiny.
