ITEM 1. Business
Overview
We are a clinical stage immunotherapy company dedicated to transforming the treatment of cancer by developing therapies that enable the immune system to attack tumors and provide long-lasting benefits to patients. Through the use of our Translational Science Platform, we first focus on specific cell types within tumors to prioritize targets, and then identify related biomarkers designed to match the right therapy to the right patient. Our strategy is to create immunotherapies targeting a variety of the diverse cellular components of the immune system, as well as non-immune cells resident within the tumor, all of which can vary greatly among tumors within and across indications. This may provide benefit to patients with tumors across the spectrum from highly inflamed, or hot, to poorly inflamed, or cold, and especially those not well served by current therapies. We believe the early identification of potential predictive biomarkers to prospectively enrich for biomarker positive cancer patients, from across many indications, may lead to shortened development timelines for our new immunotherapies. Our approach is designed to lead to a larger effect size by first identifying and then focusing on a smaller biomarker positive study population. Through this two-pronged approach, we believe our Translational Science Platform enables us to effectively and efficiently identify and develop new cancer immunotherapies.

• | Targeting T cells: Our lead product candidate, JTX-2011, is a clinical stage monoclonal antibody that binds to and activates ICOS, a protein on the surface of certain T cells commonly found in many solid tumors. We believe our JTX-2011 antibody has a dual mechanism of action that serves to amplify an immune response in T effector cells, or "good" T cells, while preferentially reducing the number of T regulatory cells, or "bad" T cells, within a tumor. Our preclinical data demonstrates that JTX-2011 stimulates a significant T cell immune response against solid tumors. We submitted our Investigational New Drug Application, or IND, for JTX-2011 to the Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, in July 2016 and began our JTX-2011 multi-arm Phase I/II clinical trial in patients with solid tumors in August 2016. We believe JTX-2011 has the potential to act both as a single agent and more importantly in combination with other therapies, such as anti-PD-1 antibodies, to offer treatment alternatives to patients who otherwise lack an effective response to currently approved therapies. We are also conducting IND enabling studies for JTX-4014, an anti-PD-1 antibody for use in future combinations with JTX-2011 as well as for use in combination with other future product candidates, as we believe combination therapy has the potential to be a mainstay of cancer immunotherapy. Safety data from our multi-arm Phase I/II JTX-2011 trial is expected in the first half of 2017, and preliminary efficacy proof of concept data is expected in the second half 2017 in both the single agent and combination setting. 


• | Beyond T effector cells: We are discovering and developing immunotherapies beyond the currently approved products targeting T effector cells. To do so, we are leveraging our Translational Science Platform to systematically and comprehensively interrogate cell types within the human tumor microenvironment, or TME, to enable us to develop therapies with the potential to benefit patients with tumors across the spectrum from hot to cold. This includes focusing on adaptive and innate immune cells, such as B and T regulatory cells, and immunosuppressive macrophages, respectively. Therapies targeting these cell types and cell subsets may have the potential to complement existing approaches that focus on T effector cells and thereby benefit many patients who do not respond to the currently approved T effector cell-focused immunotherapies. In addition, we are discovering and developing multiple approaches, including targeting stromal cells, with the potential to convert cold tumors to hot tumors, thereby making the tumors more amenable to immunotherapy, perhaps in combination approaches. 


• | Identifying potential predictive biomarkers to prioritize indications and match the right therapy to the right patients: Early in the development process, we use our Translational Science Platform to identify potential predictive biomarkers designed to enable us to enrich for a patient population more likely to respond to our immunotherapy. In addition we can also use characteristics defined by our biomarker efforts to focus on niche indications and/or niche subsets within indications to inform our clinical strategy. By taking this biomarker-driven approach, which supports enriched-enrollment clinical trial design by stratifying patients and focusing on the biomarker positive patients whose tumors express our biomarker(s) of interest, we believe that we can more efficiently develop our cancer immunotherapies. The biomarker results, coordinated to clinical response, will determine the utility of proceeding to the use of a complementary diagnostic and/or companion diagnostic for a given therapy.

Our ability to prioritize targets and potential predictive biomarkers using our Translational Science Platform was a key component leading to our strategic collaboration with Celgene Corporation, or Celgene. This global strategic collaboration, which included a $225.0 million upfront payment and a $36.1 million equity investment, is primarily focused on co-developing and co-commercializing innovative biologic immunotherapy treatments for patients with cancer. Under the agreement, we granted Celgene exclusive options to develop and commercialize our lead product candidate, JTX-2011, and up to four early-stage programs consisting of targets to be selected from a pool of certain B cell, T regulatory cell and tumor-associated macrophage targets. Additionally, Celgene has an exclusive option to develop and commercialize our product candidate JTX-4014, which, upon exercise of such option, will be a shared program that may be used by both parties in and outside of the collaboration. Under the terms of the agreement, if Celgene exercises all of its options, all programs meet all milestones, including regulatory approvals in the United States and outside the United States, and Celgene extends the initial four year research term for three additional years, we are eligible to earn up to approximately $2.6 billion in clinical, regulatory, and/or commercialization milestone payments, option-exercise fees and research term extension fees. In addition to progressing collaboration programs, we will continue to use our Translational Science Platform to progress our own programs that are not part of the collaboration and for which we retain worldwide commercial rights.
Immunotherapies are increasingly recognized as a critical component of cancer therapy and are beginning to fundamentally change the paradigm for treating patients. Fewer than half of all cancer patients respond to single agent immunotherapies. Combination therapies are beginning to yield greater responses than single agent therapies, yet there is still significant unmet medical need among large patient populations across most solid tumor indications. In addition, there is a significant number of patients with tumors that lack, or have low levels of, immune cell infiltrate where additional approaches may be required to fully realize the benefit of immunotherapy agents. We believe targeting novel immune mechanisms in combination with identifying and using predictive biomarkers may best address these areas of unmet need.
Our Translational Science Platform utilizes a suite of integrated technologies to comprehensively profile the cellular and molecular characteristics within thousands of human solid tumors, providing critical information about the TME that we believe will allow us to identify and guide new immunotherapies more efficiently through development. We utilize a systematic approach to match targets to defined patient populations, as well as niche indications and/or niche subsets within indications, which we believe are more likely to benefit from these therapies. Building on our biomarker-driven strategy, we aim to establish complementary diagnostics and/or companion diagnostics for each of our product candidates to identify the right patients for treatment.
JTX-2011, our lead program, has shown preclinical anti-tumor effects both as a single agent and in combination with existing immunotherapies such as anti-PD-1 antibodies. Single agent efficacy in preclinical models is correlated with the percentage of ICOS-expressing T cells in the tumor. Using our Translational Science Platform, we have identified human cancer indications that display high percentages of ICOS-expressing T cells and ICOS-related biomarkers within the tumors. Based on this, we have prioritized certain indications including non-small cell lung cancer or NSCLC, head and neck squamous cell cancer or HNSCC, and additional niche indications for evaluation in our ongoing JTX-2011 single agent trial. Furthermore, individual patient tumors from the selected indications will be evaluated during clinical trial enrollment for ICOS and related biomarkers so that we can enrich our trials with patients who may be more likely to respond to JTX-2011. We are also using our Translational Science Platform and biomarker-driven strategy to identify additional niche indications and/or niche subsets within indications that may be particularly amenable to JTX-2011 therapy and may provide additional patient populations for evaluation in our clinical studies. In addition, because existing immunotherapies such as anti-PD-1/anti-PD-L1 antibodies may induce ICOS upregulation on T cells, we believe that in a combination setting, JTX-2011 may exert anti-tumor activity in a broader group of indications and thus provide benefit to a greater number of patients. As a result, our ongoing Phase I/II multi-arm trial will also assess the safety and efficacy of JTX-2011 in combination with the anti-PD-1 antibody, nivolumab, in patients with NSCLC, HNSCC, triple negative breast cancer, or TNBC, melanoma, stomach cancer and additional niche indications identified through our Translational Science Platform. Assuming continued successful development, our expectation is that our anti-PD-1 antibody JTX-4014, that is currently in IND-enabling studies, will be included in subsequent clinical studies.
The majority of immunotherapy discovery and development efforts have focused on T cell targeted therapies, particularly T effector cells, which have provided long-lasting benefits to some patients, but significant unmet medical need remains. As such, we have focused our early discovery efforts on interrogating multiple cell types. We believe our approach will identify novel immunotherapies that engage different elements of the immune system and stroma and can address the broader unmet medical need across solid tumor indications. Our discovery pipeline consists of multiple programs, including several that target immunosuppressive macrophages, which are highly prevalent in many solid tumor types, as well as programs aimed at converting cold tumors to hot tumors. We 
6

believe these approaches may create options for patients who are less likely to respond to currently approved therapies, as well as enhance responses in patients who have had limited response to currently approved immunotherapies.
We have assembled a highly experienced team of experts in immunotherapy to help us leverage our Translational Science Platform to drive the development of our early discovery programs and JTX-2011. Our chief executive officer, Dr. Richard Murray, our chief scientific officer, Dr. Deborah Law, and our chief technical officer, Dr. Stephen G. Farrand, each have successful track records discovering, developing, manufacturing, and commercializing drugs across a range of therapeutic areas including immunotherapy, and have played leadership roles from the preclinical stages through the Biologics License Application, or BLA, approval of the product Keytruda. Additionally, Dr. Elizabeth Trehu, our chief medical officer, has significant oncology drug development and commercialization experience. Two of our founders, Dr. James Allison and Dr. Padmanee Sharma of the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, were initially responsible for the translational science behind ICOS. Dr. James Allison played a fundamental role in ushering in the era of checkpoint therapy in general, including contributing to the understanding of the basic science of CTLA-4 that supported the development of Yervoy, and he was recently awarded the 2015 Lasker-DeBakey Clinical Medical Research Award. Dr. Thomas Gajewski of the University of Chicago, Dr. Drew Pardoll of Johns Hopkins University, Dr. Robert Schreiber of Washington University School of Medicine, and Dr. Louis Weiner of Georgetown University are also founders of our Company.
Immuno-oncology Background
Cancer is a broad group of diseases in which normal cells are transformed into a state of rapid and uncontrolled cell growth, forming tumors. Cancer typically originates from a particular tissue in the body, such as the lung or skin, and often spreads, or metastasizes, as the disease progresses. Tumors are comprised of multiple cell types, all present to varying degrees, including cancerous cells, immune cells, and stromal cell types that collectively form the TME. The composition of the TME dictates the aggressiveness of a particular cancer, its susceptibility to treatment, and ultimately the fate of the patient.
The immune cells within the TME are now the subject of significant drug development activity. The immune system contains many different cells types that fall into two general categories, innate and adaptive. The innate immune system is a first line, ubiquitous defense aimed at combating elements which the body views as foreign. After the innate immune system is activated, its cells help to trigger an adaptive immune response that is specific to a particular antigen. The adaptive immune system is flexible and can evolve to combat multiple antigens. Importantly, it has the capacity for immune memory, or the ability of the immune system to be recalled into action if the same foreign material is reintroduced into the body in the future. The innate and adaptive components of the immune system are both essential for a productive immune response. 
A collection of innate and adaptive immune cell types are shown in Figure 1 below.

Historically, cancer treatments have focused on either killing or arresting the proliferation of the tumor cells themselves. However, fundamental work pioneered by one of our founders, Dr. James Allison, led to the discovery of immune cell checkpoint therapy. Checkpoints are key immune cell mechanisms that function as either positive or negative steps to fine tune and control the immune response. In the cancer setting, tumor cells have developed strategies for hijacking these immune checkpoints, preventing an immune response to the cancer and allowing the tumor cells to proliferate without any natural interference. Checkpoint immunotherapies have been developed to overcome this by either enhancing immune cell activation (stepping on the gas of the immune system) or blocking immune cell inhibition (releasing the brakes on the immune system) resulting in an amplification of the anti-tumor immune response. The activation of the immune cells within a tumor leads to an anti-cancer attack and can result in a long-lasting effect as some of the immune cells become memory cells that remain primed to stimulate a response to future cancer cells.
There are currently three approved immunotherapies that target the PD-1 pathway. These include two single-agent immunotherapies that target the receptor PD-1 on certain T cells: pembrolizumab, marketed as Keytruda, and nivolumab, marketed as Opdivo. Keytruda has been approved in melanoma, NSCLC, and HNSCC settings, while Opdivo has been approved in melanoma, NSCLC, renal cell carcinoma, and classical Hodgkin lymphoma, HNSCC, and urothelial cancer settings. Both agents have also shown clinical promise in a number of other tumor types. The third approved drug targeting this checkpoint pathway is the PD-L1 targeting antibody atezolizumab, marketed as Tecentriq, which has been approved in urothelial carcinoma and NSCLC. An additional single-agent immunotherapy, ipilimumab, or Yervoy, that targets a different protein receptor CTLA-4 on certain T cells, has also been approved for melanoma and is undergoing additional clinical trials. Combination therapy aimed at multiple targets has now become an important element of immunotherapy development, with the goal of creating even better long-lasting responses. For example, in 2016 Opdivo plus Yervoy was approved as the first combination immunotherapy for use in all melanoma patients.
Recent clinical data from PD-1 checkpoint inhibitor studies has highlighted the importance of a biomarker-driven patient-enrichment strategy. In October 2016, Keytruda was approved second-line in PD-L1 biomarker positive patients having advanced NSCLC. Biomarker positive patients are defined by a tumor proportion score (TPS) ≥ 1% for PD-L1 expression in tumors as measured by a companion diagnostic. Additionally, Keytruda was approved in the first-line therapeutics setting for PD-L1 high NSCLC patients defined using the same companion diagnostic but having a TPS ≥ 50% for PD-L1 expression in tumors. In contrast, Opdivo, which did not use a companion diagnostic for approval in the advanced, second-line NSCLC patient population, subsequently failed to reach its primary endpoint in first-line treatment of NSCLC patients enrolled using an untested biomarker approach with a less stringent threshold ≥ 5% PD-L1 expression in tumors. We believe that the positive data in biomarker-selected patient populations validates our proposed biomarker-driven approach and highlights the importance of a parallel development path for both the biomarker and the therapeutic starting at an early stage of clinical development.
The promise of long-lasting benefit to cancer patients has led to heightened enthusiasm for these types of immunotherapy products and a further expansion of the market opportunity. The overall market for immunotherapy has expanded significantly over the past five years, with 2015 and 2016 estimates for the 2020 market size ranging from $25 to $59 billion across solid and blood-based tumors.
Currently approved immunotherapies, such as the anti-PD-1 antibodies, are directed at the T effector cell arms of the adaptive immune response and are generally beneficial for cancer patients whose tumors are infiltrated with this cell type. However, many solid tumors lack high T cell infiltration in the TME yet possess other immune cell types, which could be the basis of more effective treatments for those patients.
The pattern of immune cell infiltration varies across solid tumors. Initial immunotherapy approaches did not take into account the immune cell composition of the tumor, and therefore treatments were not matched to defined patient populations, leading to response rates in a minority of patients. We believe it is important to identify tumors with certain immune cell characteristics, defined by biomarkers, to best predict which patients are most likely to benefit from a given therapy. Our Translational Science Platform has the potential to allow us to conduct a broad, systematic characterization of the different patterns of cell types within a range of solid tumor indications. We believe our platform enables identification of targets and related biomarkers linked to specific immune cell types that will allow us to identify and prioritize indications, including potential niche indications and/or niche subsets of indications, thereby enabling us to enroll patients in our clinical trials that may be more likely to respond to our new therapies.

Challenges in Immuno-oncology
Despite the enthusiasm surrounding immunotherapies and the benefit certain cancer patients have experienced in recent years, substantial challenges remain to maximize the impact of immunotherapy in cancer. To date, identifying the most appropriate indications and most responsive patient populations for a particular immunotherapy has presented significant challenges, including the following:

• | Established single agent immunotherapies are only effective in a minority of patients.


• | The current approach to immunotherapy target prioritization is not systematic and does not leverage a complete understanding of the TME to best identify high value targets, related to certain patient populations.


• | The current emphasis on T effector cell-focused immunotherapy targets does not harness the entire spectrum of potential immune and non-immune cell targets within the tumor leaving fewer therapeutic options for patients whose tumors are poorly infiltrated with T cells.


• | Predictive biomarkers, the value and use of which are relatively new, are not uniformly used to proactively select responsive patient populations and/or preferred indications, which drives longer development timelines with higher associated costs.

Our Differentiated Approach to Solving the Challenges of Immuno-oncology
Jounce was founded on the principle that an in-depth understanding and profiling of the immune system within human tumors can significantly enhance and expedite the development of impactful immunotherapies. Our multifaceted approach to profiling tumors yields a comprehensive understanding of the TME allowing us to efficiently prioritize promising cancer targets and related biomarkers. We believe our efforts allow us to prioritize indications and match the right therapy to the right patients, enabling an enriched-enrollment clinical trial design, which may result in shorter development timelines with lower associated costs. More specifically:

• | Our Translational Science Platform allows us to comprehensively interrogate the TME. Our Translational Science Platform utilizes a suite of integrated technologies to comprehensively characterize the TME. We analyze thousands of human solid tumors, which provides critical information that we believe will allow us to guide immunotherapies more efficiently through development. Critical components of our approach include: 


• | Proprietary bioinformatics to interrogate large tumor RNA data sets. This allows us to create and distill critical information such as gene signatures and related expression patterns across multiple solid tumor types and to correlate them to the specific cell types within the TME.


• | Multi-parametric immunohistochemistry, or IHC, to evaluate the level of specific proteins in tumor cells and healthy tissues.


• | Isolation and characterization of the specific immune system components of tumors.


• | Tumor histoculture to provide early evidence and proof of concept of our therapeutic programs in human tumor samples with in vivo-like analysis of potential therapies using patient intact tumor tissue.


• | Our ability to extensively exploit and evaluate cells within the TME, including immune cells and stromal cells, allows us to prioritize targets and develop new immunotherapies targeting the spectrum of hot to cold tumors. We systematically evaluate both adaptive and innate immune cells and stromal cells within the TME to prioritize targets that go beyond T effector cell-directed approaches. Our early discovery efforts are focused on programs targeting both adaptive immune cells including B cells and T regulatory cells, as well as innate immune cells such as immunosuppressive macrophages, which are highly prevalent in many solid tumor types. In addition, we are discovering and developing multiple approaches, including targeting stromal cells, with the potential to convert cold tumors to hot tumors, thereby making the tumors more amenable to immunotherapy, perhaps in combination approaches. We believe that targeting multiple cell types will allow us to develop therapies with the potential to benefit patients with tumors across the spectrum from hot to cold, which may enable the development of therapeutic alternatives for patients who are less likely to respond to currently approved therapies, as well as enhance responses in patients who have had limited response to currently approved immunotherapies. 


• | Our Translational Science Platform allows us to identify potential predictive biomarkers to prioritize indications and match the right therapy to the right patient. Despite the promise of newly approved agents

9

in immunotherapy, only a minority of patients respond. Biomarkers and complementary diagnostics and/or companion diagnostics are not uniformly used to identify responsive patient populations. Using our Translational Science Platform, we prioritize indications based on the levels of specific biomarkers that we have identified as relevant within the applicable tumor. For example, in our JTX-2011 program we identified and prioritized the cancer indications to study in our initial clinical trials based on the levels of ICOS-expressing T cells and ICOS-related biomarkers present within tumors. In addition, individual patient tumors from the selected indications will be evaluated during clinical trial enrollment for the same ICOS and related biomarkers so that we can enrich our trials with patients who may be more likely to respond to JTX-2011. Building on our biomarker-driven strategy, we aim to establish complementary diagnostics and/or companion diagnostics for each of our product candidates to identify the right patients for treatment with our products. In addition we can also use characteristics defined by our biomarker efforts to focus on niche indications and/or niche subsets within indications to inform our clinical strategy. By taking this biomarker-driven approach, we believe that we can more efficiently develop our cancer immunotherapies.

• | Potential for shorter development timelines and lower associated costs. We believe that our Translational Science Platform will enable us to identify optimal immune cell and non-immune cell targets, as well as enrich patient populations most likely to respond to our therapies. Unlike most currently approved immunotherapy approaches that involve significant time and costs associated with achieving effective response rates, we believe that our approach will yield a more efficient overall development process. 

Our Strategy
Our goal is to bring the right immunotherapies to the right patients to provide a long-lasting benefit that ultimately improves the patient's life. To achieve our goal, we are:

• | Aggressively developing our lead product candidate JTX-2011 both as a single agent and in combination with approved therapies including nivolumab in our ongoing study and, we expect, our anti-PD-1 antibody JTX-4014 in subsequent studies. We submitted our IND for JTX-2011 to the FDA in July 2016 and initiated our multi-arm Phase I/II clinical trial in solid tumors, including select cancer types, such as NSCLC and HNSCC in August 2016. We used our Translational Science Platform to identify the initial target cancer indications for this clinical trial, and continue to use our platform to inform on our clinical strategy through the identification of additional potential niche indications and/or niche subsets of indications that may be more amenable to treatment with JTX-2011. During clinical trial enrollment, we will assess, on a patient-by-patient basis, the levels of ICOS and related biomarkers to enrich for patients we believe may be more likely to respond. If our biomarker-driven strategies are successful, we aim to establish complementary diagnostics and/or companion diagnostics. We plan to pursue development of JTX-2011 both as a single agent and more importantly in combinations with other therapies to maximize its utility and value. Our initial trial focuses on combination with the anti-PD-1 antibody, nivolumab, and assuming continued successful development, we expect to include our anti-PD-1 antibody, JTX-4014, in subsequent clinical studies.


• | Efficiently building a broad pipeline of immunotherapies targeting defined patient populations through the use of our Translational Science Platform. We believe our platform is an efficient and productive discovery and development engine that can identify new targets across multiple cell types with the aim of creating a portfolio of novel, targeted immunotherapies. By identifying related biomarkers to prioritize indications, including potential niche indications and/or niche subsets of indications, to enable us to build a clinical population of patients who may be more likely to respond to our therapies, we believe we have the potential to shorten development timelines with lower associated costs.


• | Addressing the unmet medical needs of cancer patients with tumors unresponsive to T effector cell-directed therapies by emphasizing our discovery efforts on other cell types within the TME. We are looking beyond the initial immunotherapy approaches that focus on targeting T effector cells and are systematically and comprehensively interrogating cell types within the TME, including additional adaptive immune cells such as B cells and T regulatory cells, as well as innate immune cells, such as macrophages, and non-immune cells such as stromal cells. Therapies targeting macrophages may provide benefit to many patients who do not respond to currently approved T effector cell-directed immunotherapies by converting an immune inhibitory TME to an immune-enhancing TME. In addition, by targeting different immune cell types and mechanisms, macrophage targeted therapies may be able to combine with currently approved T effector cell approaches and provide potential benefit to a greater number of patients. Similarly, stromal cells often support tumor growth and influence immune cell function and may be an important

10

avenue for the development of more effective cancer immunotherapies particularly focused on colder tumors.

• | Maximizing the value of our early pipeline through building and/or in-licensing new technologies and methodologies to turn cold tumors to hot tumors to make them more amenable to immunotherapy. We are also looking to address the unmet needs of the significant number of patients with tumors that are immunologically cold, having little to no immune cell infiltrate, with the aim of targeting the TME to enable immune cell infiltration. This may provide the potential to change these cold, non-responsive tumors to hot tumors more amenable to immunotherapy. Such an approach may benefit from leveraging additional technologies including, but not limited to, methods of delivery of proteins to cold tumors.


• | Building the leading fully integrated discovery-to-commercial immuno-oncology company by delivering innovative immunotherapies to cancer patients. We believe that immunotherapy is changing the paradigm of cancer treatment. We have assembled a world-class team and have built a robust translational platform that we believe allows us to create a sustainable, novel pipeline in immunotherapy. If JTX-2011, JTX-4014 or any future product candidate we may develop is approved, we will consider marketing them in select markets to retain the greatest value for our shareholders.

Jounce's Translational Science Platform
Our Translational Science Platform utilizes a suite of integrated technologies to comprehensively profile the cellular and molecular characteristics within thousands of human solid tumors, providing critical information on the TME that we believe will allow us to identify and guide new immunotherapies more efficiently through development. We have built a broad network of relationships with academic institutions and clinicians to access human tumor samples with well documented clinical histories. Profiling of the TME is driven by robust analytics including proprietary bioinformatics, IHC, isolation and characterization of components of tumors, and tumor histoculture. Our current development efforts are focused on both adaptive and innate components of the immune system, as well as on potential immune and non-immune cell components that may enable the conversion of cold tumors to hot tumors. Through our Translational Science Platform, samples are profiled for the composition of immune cells within the tumors, which is then correlated with biological and clinical information, such as patient outcomes. We select targets that may be relevant for drug discovery, and employ our suite of integrated assays and in vivo models to validate these programs. In parallel with our drug discovery efforts, such as generation of lead monoclonal antibodies, we use our Translational Science Platform to identify potential predictive biomarkers that may allow us to build a clinical population of patients who may be more likely to respond to our therapies. In addition characteristics that are defined by our biomarker efforts are used to identify potential niche indications and/or niche subsets of indications that may be more amenable to our therapies. This approach is evident in our current pipeline of immunotherapy product candidates and highlight the following key differentiating features of our Translational Science Platform:

• | Target Identification. We are discovering and developing immunotherapies beyond the currently approved products targeting T effector cells. To do so, we are leveraging our Translational Science Platform to systematically and comprehensively interrogate cell types within the TME to enable us to develop therapies with the potential to benefit patients with tumors across the spectrum from hot to cold. This includes focusing on adaptive immune cells, such as B cells and T regulatory cells, as well as innate immune cells including immunosuppressive macrophages that may create a pro-tumor environment. Therapies targeting these cell types and cell subsets may have the potential to complement existing approaches that focus on T effector cells and thereby benefit many patients who do not respond to the currently approved T effector cell-focused immunotherapies. In addition, we are discovering and developing multiple potential approaches, including targeting stromal cells, with the potential to convert cold tumors to hot tumors, thereby making the tumors more amenable to immunotherapy, perhaps in combination approaches. 


• | Indication Selection and Patient Enrichment. Using our Translational Science Platform, we prioritize indications based on the levels of specific biomarkers that we have identified as relevant within the applicable tumor. For example, in our JTX-2011 program, we used both IHC and RNA profiling to evaluate the levels of ICOS and related biomarkers in over a thousand tumor samples. Indications that demonstrated higher percentages of ICOS-expressing immune cells and related biomarkers were prioritized. Furthermore, individual patient tumors will be evaluated during clinical trial enrollment for ICOS and related biomarkers to build a clinical population of patients who may be more likely to respond to JTX-2011. We are also using characteristics defined from our biomarker efforts to identify niche indications and/or niche subsets of 

11

indications that may be more amenable to treatment with JTX-2011 and these data are being used to inform our clinical development strategy.
Although immuno-oncology is leading the frontier in new cancer therapies, most of the focus to date has been on T effector cells. We believe there are significant opportunities to develop immunotherapies that target other cell types within the TME to address the spectrum of hot to cold tumors, which could result in groundbreaking advances in cancer treatment. As new technologies arise, we plan to continually enhance our Translational Science Platform by looking for additional opportunities to expand our capabilities and deepen our understanding of the TME. Our ultimate goal is to use our Translational Science Platform to comprehensively interrogate the TME to enable us to bring the right therapies to the right patients.
Strategic Alliance with Celgene
Overview
In July 2016, we entered into a Master Research and Collaboration Agreement with Celgene. The primary goal of the collaboration is to co-develop and co-commercialize innovative biologic immunotherapies that either activate or suppress the immune system by binding to targets identified by leveraging our Translational Science Platform. Under the agreement, we granted Celgene exclusive options to develop and commercialize our lead product candidate, JTX-2011, and up to four early-stage programs consisting of targets to be selected from a pool of certain B cell, T regulatory cell and tumor-associated macrophage targets. Additionally, Celgene has an exclusive option to develop and commercialize our product candidate JTX-4014, which, upon exercise of such option, will be a shared program that may be used by both parties in and outside of the collaboration. Prior to Celgene exercising an option for a program, we are responsible for all research and development activities for that program under the agreement during the collaboration, and subject to all costs and potential liabilities.
Advancement of biologics:    For programs that have biologics that meet mutually agreed criteria for suitability for further development, Celgene may elect that program's target (solely with respect to immune activation or immune suppression, as applicable) to be added to the pool of targets for which we may conduct further research subject to the terms of the collaboration. If we continue to conduct research and development for such programs, then such activity will be part of the collaboration. If Celgene does not elect a program that achieves such criteria, then we will retain the rights to such program's targets and biologics and Celgene will not have an option to such program.
Exercise of options and further development of programs:    Celgene may extend the initial four-year research term of the collaboration for up to three additional one-year periods upon payment of an extension fee for each additional year. Celgene may exercise its option for a program at any time until the expiration of an option term for that program. For each program, the option term ends 45 to 60 days following Celgene's receipt of a data package that includes certain information relating to the program's research and development activities. The data package for a program may be delivered to Celgene after the applicable development milestone for such program has been achieved. Depending on the program, the applicable development milestone is (1) IND acceptance, (2) availability of certain Phase Ia data, or (3) availability of certain Phase I/II data. If Celgene fails to exercise its option during the option term for a program, we will retain the rights to such program. If Celgene exercises its option for a program other than JTX-4014, then we will enter into a co-development and co-commercialization agreement with Celgene for such program in substantially the form attached to the agreement as an exhibit. Under the co-development and co-commercialization agreement for JTX-2011 and one additional program for which Celgene opts in that is not JTX-4014, we will be responsible for leading development and commercialization activities in the United States and Celgene will be responsible for development and commercialization activities outside the United States. For all other additional programs for which Celgene opts in, other than JTX-4014, Celgene will lead development and commercialization activities worldwide. If Celgene exercises its option for JTX-4014, we will enter into a license agreement, in substantially the form attached to the agreement as an exhibit, pursuant to which we will both be able to equally access JTX-4014 for combinations within our portfolios and with other molecules that are subject to the agreement, subject to joint governance. Once Celgene opts in with respect to a given program, Celgene and we must each use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and commercialize the corresponding product in the United States.
Governance:    The collaboration is governed by a joint steering committee, or JSC, and a joint patent committee. The JSC may establish additional subcommittees to oversee particular projects or activities. Subject to limitations specified in the agreement, if the applicable governance committee is unable to make a decision by consensus and the parties are unable to resolve the issue through escalation to specified senior executive officers of the parties, then we generally have final decision-making authority over research and development matters for programs prior

to Celgene's exercise of its option to such program. If Celgene exercises its option for a program, final decision-making authority for that program is specified in the applicable co-development and co-commercialization agreement or license agreement.
Exclusivity:    During the collaboration's research term (i.e., for four years plus up to three one-year extensions that Celgene may elect), we may not alone, or with a third party, research, develop, manufacture or commercialize a biologic that binds to a defined pool of B cell, T regulatory cell or tumor-associated macrophage targets that meet certain criteria, termed an exclusive target, and inhibit, activate or otherwise modulate the activity of such exclusive target. In addition, if Celgene exercises its option for a program within the collaboration other than JTX-4014, then until termination or expiration of the applicable co-development and co-commercialization agreement for such program, we may not directly or indirectly research, develop, manufacture or commercialize, outside of the collaboration, any biologic with specified activity against that program's collaboration target.
Financial terms:    Under the terms of the agreements, we received a $225.0 million upfront cash payment and $36.1 million from the sale of 10,448,100 shares of our Series B-1 convertible preferred stock. If Celgene exercises any of its options, then Celgene will pay us an option-exercise fee, the parties will enter into a co-development and co-commercialization agreement or a license agreement that governs the development and commercialization of the applicable program, and we will then split future development and commercialization costs with Celgene in accordance with such agreement. Additionally, under the terms of the agreement, if Celgene exercises all of its options, all programs meet all milestones, including regulatory approvals in the United States and outside the United States, and Celgene extends the initial four year research term for three additional years, we are eligible to earn up to approximately $2.6 billion in clinical, regulatory, and/or commercialization milestone payments, option-exercise fees and research term extension fees.
The development milestones are payable on initiation of certain clinical trials and range from $32.5 million to $105.0 million, per program, with an aggregate total of $290.0 million. The regulatory approval milestones are payable upon regulatory approval in the United States and outside the United States and range from $7.5 million to $50.0 million per milestone, with an aggregate total of $700.0 million. The commercial milestones are payable upon achievement of specified aggregate product sales outside the United States for each program and range from $40.0 million to $200.0 million per milestone, with an aggregate total of $1.270 billion. We are also eligible to receive royalties on product sales outside the United States ranging from high single digit to mid-teen royalties.
Profit sharing, cost sharing and commercialization rights for products:    If Celgene exercises its option for a program, then we will share with Celgene the U.S. profits or losses on such collaboration program as follows:

• | We will retain 60 percent of the U.S. operating profits or losses arising from commercialization of JTX-2011, with 40 percent allocated to Celgene.


• | We will retain 25 percent of the U.S. operating profits or losses arising from commercialization of the first program, other than JTX-2011 or JTX-4014, for which an IND application is filed under the collaboration, with 75 percent allocated to Celgene. Celgene has a one-time right to substitute and swap the economics and governance of this program with that of another program for which it exercises an option (other than JTX-2011 and JTX-4014).


• | We and Celgene will equally share U.S. operating profits or losses arising from commercialization of up to three additional programs (other than JTX-2011 or JTX-4014).

If Celgene exercises its option for a program other than JTX-4014, we will enter into a co-development and co-commercialization agreement, pursuant to which Celgene will have the exclusive right to develop and commercialize the products arising out of such collaboration program outside of the United States, and we will be eligible to receive tiered royalties ranging from a high single digit to mid-teen percentage rate on net product sales outside of the United States. Under each co-development and co-commercialization agreement, we will also have the right to opt out of profit sharing and instead receive milestones and royalties.
Furthermore, if Celgene exercises its option for JTX-4014, we will enter into a license agreement, pursuant to which Celgene and we will each have equal rights to develop and commercialize JTX-4014 in combination with other proprietary molecules in their or our respective pipelines or in combination with products arising out of collaboration programs. Subject to terms specified in the license agreement for JTX-4014, the party owning the proprietary molecule that is combined with JTX-4014, if such molecule does not arise from a collaboration program with 
13

Celgene, will be solely responsible for all development and commercialization costs related to such combination. If JTX-4014 is combined with a product arising from a collaboration program, then the parties will share costs and, if co-packaged or co-formulated, profits or losses in accordance with the co-development and co-commercialization agreement for such other product.
Intellectual Property:    We and Celgene will jointly own any intellectual property that is generated or invented by both parties pursuant to the activities conducted under the collaboration agreement. If Celgene exercises its option for a program, each party will also grant the other party exclusive or co-exclusive licenses, with rights to grant sublicenses, under certain of each party's intellectual property rights, determined by the nature of the program and the licensed territory.

Our Product Pipeline
We are developing a pipeline of immunotherapies that we believe will provide a meaningful and long-lasting benefit to cancer patients. We plan to develop each of these as a single agent and in combination with other therapies, as applicable. The following table depicts our current pipeline: 
Lead Program JTX-2011: an Anti-ICOS Monoclonal Antibody Immunotherapy
Overview
Our lead product candidate, JTX-2011 is in clinical development. The IND was submitted to the FDA in July 2016, and the multi-arm Phase I/II clinical trial was initiated in August 2016.
JTX-2011 is a monoclonal antibody that binds to and activates ICOS, a protein on the surface of certain T cells. We believe our JTX-2011 antibody has a dual mechanism of action that serves to amplify an immune response in T effector cells, or "good" T cells, while preferentially reducing the number of T regulatory cells, or "bad" T cells, within 
14

a tumor. JTX-2011 was designed with a human IgG1 Fc portion which is able to recruit mononuclear cells such as natural killer (NK) cells that can mediate antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC).  We believe ADCC is one of the mechanisms that leads to the preferential reduction of the T regulatory cells within the tumor, which are the cells that express the highest levels of ICOS. JTX-2011 has shown preclinical anti-tumor effects both as a single agent and in combination with existing immunotherapies such as anti-PD-1 antibodies. Informed by our preclinical studies, we are developing JTX-2011 to treat solid tumors as a single agent and in combination with other therapies. Based on our biomarker-driven efforts our initial monotherapy efforts will focus on certain indications that appear to have greater numbers of ICOS-expressing T cells within the tumor; therefore patients with NSCLC and HNSCC, as well as additional indications identified through our Translational Science Platform, are expected to be enrolled in the single agent therapy expansion arms of the trial.
Because existing immunotherapies such as anti-PD-1/anti-PD-L1 antibodies may induce ICOS upregulation on T cells, we believe that in a combination setting, JTX-2011 may exert anti-tumor activity in a broader group of indications and thus provide benefit to a greater number of patients; therefore patients with NSCLC, HNSCC, TNBC, melanoma, and stomach cancer, as well as additional indications identified through our Translational Science Platform, are expected to be enrolled in the expansion arms of the combination therapy with the anti-PD-1 antibody, nivolumab.
Clinical Study Design
The first-in-human JTX-2011 Phase I/II study, which we refer to as ICONIC, is an open label, dose escalation and expansion clinical study of JTX-2011 alone or in combination with a fixed dose of nivolumab in subjects with advanced solid tumors. It is designed to assess safety and tolerability and determine the maximum tolerated dose, or MTD, and recommended Phase II dose as well as to evaluate preliminary efficacy. The four-part adaptive design is posted on ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02904226) and includes Parts A, B, C and D and is expected to enroll greater than 200 patients if all cohorts are advanced. Parts A and B comprise the Phase I portion of the study and are designed to provide safety, pharmacokinetic, or PK, and pharmacodynamics, or PD, data in both the monotherapy (Part A) and combination therapy (Part B) settings with data expected to be submitted for presentation at medical meetings in the first half of 2017. If the Phase I study achieves its objectives of safety, and dose selection based on PK and PD, JTX-2011 will then advance to Phase II, where expansion cohorts, monotherapy (Part C) and combination therapy (Part D), are anticipated to provide preliminary proof of concept efficacy data which is expected to be submitted for presentation at medical meetings in the second half of 2017.
Monotherapy setting (Parts A and C):
Part A is comprised of escalating doses of JTX-2011 administered intravenously, or IV, once every twenty-one days in consecutive cohorts. Additional safety, PK and PD, Part A patient, or AP, expansion cohorts are expected to be enrolled at each of two or more dose levels. Archival tumor tissue will be collected on all dose escalation subjects for retrospective assessment of ICOS and PD-L1 expression and fresh tumor biopsies will be collected on all subjects in the AP cohorts.
Part C will include at least three dose expansion cohorts in the indications listed below at a dose level determined from safety and PK/PD data in Part A:

• | C1: HNSCC that has progressed on or after a prior PD-1 checkpoint inhibitor


• | C2: NSCLC that has progressed on or after a prior PD-1 checkpoint inhibitor


• | C3: any solid tumor type other than NSCLC and HNSCC


• | new cohorts based on emerging science

We intend to stratify subjects in Part C expansion cohorts based on ICOS expression in archival tumor, with ICOS levels confirmed on a fresh pre-treatment biopsy. At least ten subjects with high (2+ or 3+) ICOS expression will be enrolled in each twenty subject cohort to explore the potential correlation between pre-treatment ICOS expression and efficacy. Additional potential predictive biomarkers, including an ICOS gene signature, will also be evaluated.
Combination setting (Parts B and D):
Part B is comprised of escalating doses of JTX-2011 in combination with the anti-PD-1 antibody nivolumab with both agents administered IV once every twenty-one days, in consecutive cohorts. Additional safety/PK/PD Part B patient, or BP, cohorts are expected to be enrolled at each of two or more dose levels. Archival tumor tissue will be 
15

collected on all dose escalation subjects for retrospective assessment of ICOS and PD-L1 expression and fresh tumor biopsies will be collected on all subjects in the BP cohorts.
Part D will include at least five dose expansion cohorts in the indications listed below of JTX-2011 in combination with nivolumab at a JTX-2011 dose level determined from safety and PK/PD data in Part B:

• | D1: HNSCC that has progressed on or after a prior PD-1 checkpoint inhibitor


• | D2: NSCLC that has progressed on or after a prior PD-1 checkpoint inhibitor


• | D3: TNBC


• | D4: melanoma that has progressed on or after a prior PD-1 checkpoint inhibitor


• | D5: gastric cancer


• | new cohorts based on emerging science

We intend to stratify subjects in Part D expansion cohorts based on ICOS expression in archival tumor, with ICOS levels confirmed on a fresh pre-treatment biopsy. At least ten subjects with high (2+ or 3+) ICOS expression will be enrolled in each fifteen subject cohort to explore the potential correlation between pre-treatment ICOS expression and efficacy. Additional potential predictive biomarkers, including an ICOS gene signature, will also be evaluated.
Additional cohorts may be added to Parts C and D based on the outcome of ongoing investigations. A signal in any cohort will lead to further expansion for more robust assessment of efficacy and for planning for pivotal trials.
Although our initial study focuses on the combination of JTX-2011 with an anti-PD-1 antibody, the ability of agents, including anti-PD-1/anti-PD-L1 and anti-CTLA-4 antibodies, and cancer vaccines such as GVAX, PROSTVAC, and Mammaglobin-A, to induce ICOS upregulation on T cells highlights the potential combinability of JTX-2011 with these immune therapies. We envision this inducible nature of ICOS to be a cornerstone of our strategy in combination trials.
Timing of clinical results
Safety data from both the single agent (Part A) and the combination therapy (Part B) is expected in the first half of 2017. Preliminary efficacy proof of concept data in both the single agent (Part C) and the combination therapy (Part D) is expected in the second half of 2017.
Scientific Background and Supporting Preclinical Data
ICOS, the Inducible T cell CO-Stimulator, is the target of JTX-2011. ICOS is a member of the CD28 family of cell surface proteins, a family that includes PD-1, the target of Keytruda and Opdivo, and CTLA-4, the target of Yervoy. ICOS is upregulated on T effector cells when they become activated, such as following recognition of a tumor antigen, and the resulting signaling through ICOS works to amplify an immune response. ICOS is therefore viewed as an activating receptor on T cells and, as such, agents that can stimulate ICOS would be anticipated to show anti-tumor activity.
The potential importance of ICOS in the tumor setting is supported by key clinical observations. In human studies aimed at understanding changes in the immune system following exposure to an immunotherapy drug, ICOS was the protein showing the most significant change. In melanoma patients, the observed upregulation of ICOS and its prolonged expression on the surface of CD4+ T cells was associated with response to the dosed drug. These data led to the concept that ICOS stimulatory activity on T cells was beneficial in treating solid tumors. We believe this type of clinically derived information serves as an important factor in distinguishing and prioritizing targets suitable for immunotherapy development.
We believe our JTX-2011 antibody has a dual mechanism of action that serves to amplify an immune response in T effector cells, or "good" T cells, while preferentially reducing the number of T regulatory cells, or "bad" T cells, within a tumor. Our preclinical data demonstrates that JTX-2011 acts as an agonist to stimulate primed ICOS-expressing CD4+ T effector cells to provide an amplification of the desired anti-tumor immune response. In addition, our preclinical data also suggest that JTX-2011 can reduce the number of T regulatory cells to further enhance an anti-tumor immune response by removing cells that naturally act to dampen and control immune responses. This preferential reduction of T regulatory cells has been observed in both in vitro assays using human T cells as well as in mouse tumor models. In the in vitro assays, JTX-2011 depletes human T regulatory cells but not T effector cells. Similarly, in the mouse models, there is a reduction in the number of T regulatory cells, specifically within the tumor, but no reduction in the number of T effector cells or other cells are observed. Additional data from preclinical studies 
16

using mouse tumor models support the use of JTX-2011 both as a single agent and in combination with other therapies.
Biomarker-driven indication prioritization and patient enrichment strategy for JTX-2011
Preclinical evidence supports the view that tumors with a greater percentage of ICOS-expressing T cells are the best tumor candidates for JTX-2011. Based on this information, we believe that it is important to use our biomarkers to enroll patients in our clinical trials who are potentially more likely to respond to JTX-2011. This may allow for a more focused program with the potential to more rapidly and more efficiently develop JTX-2011. Implementation of our Translational Science Platform early in the ICOS program enabled the identification and development of ICOS-related biomarker assays, including an ICOS gene signature assay that is designed to determine RNA levels of related biomarkers, an IHC assay that is designed to detect ICOS protein, and a potential pharmacodynamic biomarker assay. 
For example, in our IHC assay, over a thousand tumor samples were evaluated (approximately one hundred tumors were analyzed per indication with the exception of melanoma, for which approximately fifty tumors were analyzed). Using the IHC assay, the level of ICOS protein expression can be classified by a 0, 1+, 2+, 3+ scoring system that indicates increasing percentages of ICOS-expressing cells within the tumor sample. A spectrum of ICOS expression could be seen across individual samples within a given indication. This has allowed us to prioritize certain indications with higher percentages of ICOS-expressing immune cells, including NSCLC and HNSCC, as illustrated in Figures 2A and 2B below. These two indications were also prioritized based on RNA profiling of several thousand additional tumor samples. Our biomarker assay used for patient enrichment will be performed at central laboratories certified by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments to allow us to efficiently focus our clinical trials on patients who may be more likely to respond to JTX-2011, which would correspond to patients with tumors with higher ICOS levels, as exemplified by the boxed samples in Figure 2B. Building on our biomarker-driven strategy, we aim to establish complementary diagnostics and/or companion diagnostics for each of our product candidates to identify the right patients for treatment with our products. Our ability to prioritize indications by determining ICOS protein expression levels is shown in Figures 2A and 2B below.

First-in-human dose selection for JTX-2011
JTX-2011 is fully reactive to human, cynomolgus monkey, rat and mouse ICOS. Notably, the potency of JTX-2011 in pharmacologically relevant cellular assays is comparable across all four species, and the relative expression of ICOS on immune cell subsets is comparable across species. This degree of comparability provides a high level of confidence that modeling across species can be used to accurately predict human dose projections. A sophisticated PK model was developed to enable human dose projections using data from cynomolgus monkey and rat PK studies. Based on the preponderance of data, we believe that the starting dose used in our Phase I/II study is close to the minimally anticipated biological effect level based on our human T cell in vitro assays.
The use of our Translational Science Platform and biomarker-driven strategy to identify and prioritize indications and enrich for patients more likely to respond to treatment with JTX-2011, coupled with our preclinical modeling to support a biologically active initial dose in humans enables an adaptive first-in-human clinical trial that progresses through Phase I dose escalation to Phase II-like efficacy assessment in the intended registration patient population. Our approach has the potential to eliminate a significant portion of the traditional path to pivotal registration trials, and may therefore lead to shortened development timelines and lower associated costs. We are also using our Translational Science Platform and biomarker-driven strategy to identify and prioritize additional niche indications and/or niche subsets within indications that may be particularly amenable to JTX-2011 therapy and may provide additional patient populations for evaluation in our clinical studies.
Preclinical safety studies
JTX-2011 recognizes and activates ICOS across multiple species, including rats and monkeys, which therefore are considered appropriate species to test the safety of JTX-2011. The potential toxicity and toxicokinetics of JTX-2011 were evaluated in non-GLP and GLP toxicology studies conducted in rats and cynomolgus monkeys. Based on the results from the toxicology studies, the nonclinical safety assessment program supported the administration of JTX-2011 as an IV infusion in our clinical trial.

Evaluation of JTX-2011 in Preclinical Tumor Models
ICOS-targeted monotherapy activity
In addition to binding to human ICOS in vitro, JTX-2011 also demonstrated binding to and co-stimulation of mouse, rat, and monkey ICOS allowing us to assess our antibody broadly in preclinical settings, including mouse tumor models. The mouse studies used a version of JTX-2011, or mouse JTX-2011, that has exactly the same binding regions as JTX-2011 but with a mouse constant region rather than a human constant region. This antibody was used in order to minimize any immunogenicity caused by administering an antibody with a human constant region to fully immune competent mice. Mouse JTX-2011 showed significant anti-tumor activity as a single agent in multiple mouse tumor models as illustrated in Figure 3 below. Seven of the ten mice implanted with Sa1/N tumors, and six of the ten mice implanted with B16-SIY tumors, were cured by treatment with mouse JTX-2011. The single agent activity of mouse JTX-2011 in preclinical tumor models correlates with the percentage of ICOS-expressing T cells within the tumor, thus providing supporting data for our biomarker-driven patient enrichment strategy.

Long-term immunity effect
In addition, mouse JTX-2011 showed a long-lasting anti-tumor activity in a tumor re-challenge model. In this model, mice were implanted with Sa1/N tumors and when the tumors had reached a tumor size of 150mm3, mouse JTX-2011 was administered at a low (0.25mg/kg) single or double dose. The seven mice that showed complete tumor regression, and thus were cured for purposes of the study, were rested for 10 weeks and then re-challenged with the same tumor without additional mouse JTX-2011 treatment. In contrast to control animals, no tumor growth was observed in the mice that had previously shown complete tumor regression with JTX-2011 (as shown in Figure 4 below). This data demonstrates that mice previously cured of tumors through treatment with mouse JTX-2011 rejected subsequent assault by the same tumor cells.
Figure 4: Anti-ICOS Tumor Reduction and Long-term Immunity in Mice

Enhanced activity in combination
For combination approaches, data from preclinical mouse models support the proposed initial clinical combination of JTX-2011 with an anti-PD-1/anti-PD-L1 antibody. As demonstrated in Figure 5 below, an anti-ICOS antibody, the parental antibody of JTX-2011, was combined with anti-PD-1 antibody. In this model, mice bearing CT26 tumors were treated with either an anti-ICOS or an anti-PD-1 antibody as a single agent or in combination with antibodies being dosed on days 3, 6, 9, and 12 after tumor inoculation. The greatest anti-tumor activity was observed when these antibodies were used in combination, and this activity was significantly enhanced compared to either antibody alone. The average tumor volume of the 10 animals in each group, as well as the tumor growth curves for each animal, demonstrates that eighty percent of the animals treated with the combination of anti-PD-1 and anti-ICOS antibodies showed complete tumor regression.
Figure 5: Greater Anti-tumor Activity with the Combination of Anti-ICOS Plus Anti-PD-1 Antibody
JTX-4014: An Anti-PD-1 Antibody for Combination Therapy
Combination therapy aimed at multiple targets has now become an important element of immunotherapy development efforts with the goal of creating even better, long-lasting responses. PD-1 checkpoint inhibitors are anticipated to play a key role in combination therapies. For this reason we are developing our own anti-PD-1 antibody, JTX-4014.
JTX-4014 is a fully human, hinge-stabilized IgG4 monoclonal antibody that is specifically designed to bind to PD-1, but not to closely-related family members, and block the interaction of PD-1 with its ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2. Through blockade of this pathway, JTX-4014 blocks an inhibitory signal on PD-1-expressing T effector cells thereby "releasing the brakes" on the immune system, providing potential anti-tumor benefit. JTX-4014 is currently in IND-enabling studies and, assuming continued successful development, JTX-4014 will be evaluated initially in a safety study as a monotherapy prior to moving into the combination setting as we intend to use it in combination with our JTX-2011 development program as well as for use in combination with potential future product candidates.
Beyond T Effector Cell Discovery Programs
We believe that the ability to target different cell types within the TME beyond the T effector cells that are the focus of currently approved immunotherapies, including T regulatory cells, B cells, as well as innate immune cells and non-immune cells including stromal cells, may allow us to 1) pursue tumor types not currently served by therapies which target the T effector arm of the adaptive immune system, as well as 2) potentially convert the TME from an immunosuppressive environment to an immune activating environment and 3) potentially convert cold tumors to hot. We believe our differentiated approach to understanding and comprehensively interrogating cell types of the 
21

TME positions us to fully exploit the promise of immunotherapy in cancer. Our current discovery efforts are focused on interrogating multiple cell types including macrophages, an innate immune cell, where there is evidence of the relationship of immunosuppressive macrophages to poor patient prognosis as described below.
Targeting the adaptive immune system: A proven approach benefiting a subset of patients
Most first generation immunotherapy treatments have focused on components of the adaptive arm of the immune system, targeting T effector cells either to "release the brakes" on the immune system through the blocking of inhibitory receptors on T cell checkpoints (such as PD-1 and CTLA-4) or to "step on the gas" activating receptors on T cells, such as our anti-ICOS program JTX-2011. This approach has successfully led to the approved medicines Yervoy, Keytruda, Opdivo and Tecentriq. However, only a minority of patients respond to these treatments as single agents. We believe there are multiple factors that contribute to the lack of response, such as insufficient numbers of T cells in the tumors. Other cell types, particularly those associated with the innate arm of the immune system such as macrophages, may also contribute to a diminished immune response.
Our assessment of the immune cell profile of many tumors through our Translational Science Platform suggests that tumors can be broadly categorized into the four categories described below:

1. | Highly infiltrated by adaptive immune cells: T effector cell high and immunosuppressive macrophage low. T cell-directed immunotherapies such as anti-PD-1/anti-PD-L1 antibodies appear to induce responses in this type of TME.


2. | Highly infiltrated by both adaptive and innate immune cells: T effector cell high and immunosuppressive macrophage cell high. T cell-directed immunotherapies such as PD-1 checkpoint inhibitors appear to induce responses in this type of TME and may derive additional benefit from suppressive macrophage-directed therapies.


3. | Highly infiltrated by innate immune cells: T effector cell low and immunosuppressive macrophage high. Therapeutic responses of T cell-directed therapies are less prevalent, therefore an agent that targets macrophages, and is capable of converting the immunosuppressive TME, to an immune active TME could enable T cell-directed immunotherapies to work.


4. | Poorly infiltrated: T effector cell low and immunosuppressive macrophage low. These cold tumor types may require additional approaches targeting other cell types within the TME such as stromal cells or other approaches that enable the infiltration of immune cells into the TME.

We believe that there is an increasing unmet medical need moving from category 1 to 4.
Figure 6: Characterization of Human Tumors by Immune Profile
22

Recently approved anti-PD-1 immunotherapies tend to be most effective in targeting highly T cell infiltrated tumors. As demonstrated through our Translational Science Platform, we used RNA profiling to assess the immune composition of approximately 300 melanoma patient samples to correlate patient outcome with key aspects of immune cell infiltrate of the TME. As shown in Figure 7 below, patients with tumors high in T effector cells and low in macrophages (tumor category 1 above) had the best outcome and, in contrast, those patients with tumors high in macrophages and low in T effector cells (tumor category 3 above) had the worst outcome. We believe that targeting immune cells beyond T cells presents a compelling opportunity to engage key immune cell targets to elicit anti-tumor effects and may have a meaningful impact on patients' lives. With evidence of the relationship of immunosuppressive macrophages to poor patient prognosis, we have prioritized our initial discovery efforts on developing novel immunotherapy agents targeting this innate immune cell type. However we are also using our unbiased bioinformatics approach to identify and prioritize targets on additional cellular components of the adaptive immune system, T regulatory cells and B cells, both cell types that have been implicated in influencing anti-tumor immune responses.

Targeting the cells of the TME: a potential to expand the utility of cancer immunotherapies
Our Translational Science Platform enables us to take an unbiased, bioinformatics-based approach to focus on a particular cell type within human tumor samples. In so doing, we can use our Translational Science Platform to identify potential targets on specific cell subsets within a tumor. Using this approach, we have identified targets on the immunosuppressive M2 macrophages that, when treated with specific monoclonal antibodies, may be able to influence the composition of macrophages within the TME, converting them from immune-suppressing M2 to immune-enhancing M1 macrophages. We believe that by targeting these innate immune cells we may be able to 1) pursue tumor types not currently served by therapies which target adaptive immune cells, as well as 2) potentially convert the TME from an immunosuppressive environment to an immune-enhancing environment. To explore these cell types and identify targets, a proprietary gene signature specific for macrophages within human tumors was generated. We then used the macrophage RNA signature to identify other expressed sequences from tumors that correlated highly with the signature (i.e., indistinguishable from the signature based on a correlation value). We then evaluated those sequences for predicted protein structures that would be on the cell surface, and therefore amenable to monoclonal antibody targeting, and that also contained protein motifs suggestive of potential involvement in inhibitory/immunosuppressive signaling to the macrophage. This discovery paradigm, illustrated in Figure 8 below, resulted in the prioritization of ten molecules to pursue as potential macrophage immunotherapy targets.
Figure 8: Use of Translational Science Platform to Identify Potential Targets Capable of Converting Immunosuppressive Macrophages to Immune-enhancing Macrophages
We have analyzed these targets and have identified a novel, previously unrecognized protein-to-protein binding interaction between two of the targets, TIM3 and LILRB2. Based on initial data using monoclonal antibodies that we created to both targets, the LILRB2 target is the focus of our drug discovery efforts related to this novel interacting pair. The antibody candidates to LILRB2 were assessed in preclinical studies using human monocytes isolated from 
24

peripheral blood which were placed under specific conditions that resulted in an M2-like immunosuppressive state. We then treated these M2-like macrophages with our antibodies to LILRB2 and the levels of cytokines were measured in order to evaluate if pro-inflammatory cytokines which are not present in the immunosuppressive state are produced after the binding of our antibodies. We observed that, in contrast to control antibodies, Jounce anti-LILRB2 antibodies reproducibly promoted the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-a and IL-1b, and reduced the production of anti-inflammatory cytokines such as CCL2 and IL-10, illustrating the intended effect of conversion to an immune-enhancing macrophage. This panel of LILRB2 antibodies is currently undergoing our selection and optimization process prior to selection of a final development candidate.
In addition to using the immunosuppressive macrophage signature to identify potential targets of interest, we have also used it to identify particular patient populations that are enriched for tumors high in immunosuppressive macrophages and low in T cell content, a characteristic of tumors with poor outcomes. We believe that these tumor types may provide an opportunity for our anti-LILRB2 antibody in a tumor that would be expected to be less responsive to PD-1 checkpoint inhibitors.
Antibodies to additional targets, identified using our macrophage-specific approach, are also being generated and screened for their potential as cancer immunotherapies. We are also leveraging our Translational Science Platform to systematically and comprehensively interrogate cell types within the TME to enable us to develop therapies with the potential to benefit patients with tumors across the spectrum of tumors from hot to cold. This includes focusing on adaptive immune cells in addition to the immunosuppressive macrophages that may create a pro-tumor environment, such as B cells and T regulatory cells. We believe therapies targeting these cell types and cell subsets could complement existing approaches that focus on T effector cells and thereby benefit many patients who do not respond to the currently approved T effector cell-focused immunotherapies. We are also discovering and developing multiple approaches, including targeting stromal cells, with the aim of converting cold tumors to hot tumors, thereby making the tumors more amenable to immunotherapy, perhaps in combination approaches.
Manufacturing
We rely on and will continue to rely on our contract manufacturing organizations, or CMOs, for both drug substance and drug product. While we do not plan to develop our own full-scale manufacturing capabilities, we may consider establishing a small, flexible approach for supporting preclinical IND enabling studies and early clinical studies. As of now, all of our manufacturing is outsourced to well-established third-party manufacturers. We have entered into a long-term contract with a CMO for our JTX-2011 clinical trials and plan to enter into additional contracts with this or other manufacturers for additional supply.
For our outsourcing approach and during the course of preclinical development, we transfer the production process to CMOs. The technology transfer agreement generally obligates the CMO to, among other things, develop a production cell line, establish master and working cell banks, develop and qualify upstream and downstream processes, develop drug product process, and develop suitable analytical methods for test and release as well as stability testing. We receive material from our CMOs for preclinical testing. We receive clinical supply material manufactured in compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practice, or cGMP, and we conduct audits before and during the cooperation with a CMO, to ensure compliance with the mutually agreed process descriptions and to cGMP regulations.
Competition
The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries, and the immuno-oncology subsector, are characterized by rapid evolution of technologies, fierce competition and strong defense of intellectual property. While we believe that our product candidate, discovery programs, technology, knowledge, experience, and scientific resources provide us with competitive advantages, we face competition from major pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions, governmental agencies and public and private research institutions, among others.
Any product candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize will compete with currently approved therapies and new therapies that may become available in the future. Key product features that would affect our ability to effectively compete with other therapeutics include the efficacy, safety and convenience of our products and the ease of use and effectiveness of any complementary diagnostics and/or companion diagnostics. Our competitors fall primarily into the following groups of treatment:

• | traditional cancer therapies, including chemotherapy;

25


• | approved immunotherapy antibodies, anti-CTLA 4 (Yervoy, marketed by Bristol Myers Squibb Company) and anti-PD-1/anti-PD-L1 antibodies (Opdivo, Keytruda and Tecentriq, marketed by Bristol Myers Squibb Company, Merck & Co., and Genentech, Inc., respectively);


• | anti-PD-L1/anti-PD-L1 immunotherapy antibodies in clinical trials, including those being developed by Merck KGaA and Pfizer, Inc. (avelumab, BLA submitted), MedImmune, Inc. (durvalumab, BLA submitted), MedImmune, Inc. (MEDI0680 in Phase I/II), Incyte (SHR-1210 in Phase II/III), Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (BMS-936559 in Phase I), Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc./Sanofi (REGN2810 in Phase II), Tesaro, Inc. (TSR-042 in Phase I), and Novartis AG (PDR-001 in Phase II);


• | an anti-ICOS program (GSK 3359609) in Phase I clinical trials, being developed by GlaxoSmithKline plc, for which patient enrollment began in the second quarter of 2016;


• | other agonist immunotherapy antibodies in clinical development, including: anti-GITR antibodies being developed by Merck & Co., Inc. (MK-1248 and MK-4166 in Phase I), Leap Therapeutics, Inc. (TRX518 in Phase I), Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (BMS-986156 in Phase I/II), MedImmune, Inc. (MEDI1873 in Phase I), Novartis AG (GWN323 in Phase I) and Agenus, Inc./Incyte Corporation (INCAGN01876 in Phase I/II); anti-CD137 antibodies being developed by Pfizer, Inc. (utomilumab in Phase III) and Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (urelumab in Phase II); anti-OX40 antibodies being developed by MedImmune, Inc. (MEDI0562 in Phase I), Pfizer (PF-04518600 in Phase I), Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (BMS-986178 in Phase I/II), Genentech, Inc. (MOXR0916 in Phase II) and GlaxoSmithKline plc (GSK 3174998 in Phase I); and an anti-CD27 antibody being developed by Celldex Therapeutics, Inc. (varlilumab in Phase II); and


• | therapies targeting macrophages, including: antagonists of CSF1R being developed by Plexxikon Inc. (PLX3397 in Phase III) and anti-CSF1R antibody being developed by Five Prime Therapeutics, Inc. and Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (FPA008 in Phase I/II), Roche Holding AG (RO5509554 in Phase I), and Eli Lily & Co. (IMC-CS4 in Phase I); and an anti-M-CSF antibody being developed by Pfizer, Inc. (PD-0360324 in Phase II); antagonists of CD47 being developed by Forty Seven, Inc. (CAMELLIA in Phase I), Celgene (CC-90002 in Phase I), and Trillium Therapeutics, Inc. (TTI-621 in Phase I).

The availability of reimbursement from government and other third-party payors will also significantly affect the pricing and competitiveness of our products. Our competitors also may obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market.
Many of the companies against which we may compete have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing approved products than we do. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel and establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs.
Intellectual property
Our intellectual property is critical to our business and we strive to protect it, including by obtaining and maintaining patent protection in the United States and internationally for our product candidates, novel biological discoveries, including new targets and applications, and other inventions that are important to our business. For our product candidates, generally we intend to first pursue patent protection covering both compositions of matter and methods of use. As we continue the development of our product candidates, we intend to identify additional means of obtaining patent protection that would potentially enhance commercial success, including through additional methods of use and biomarker and complementary diagnostic and/or companion diagnostic related claims.
The patent positions of biotechnology companies like ours are generally uncertain and involve complex legal, scientific and factual questions. In addition, the coverage claimed in a patent application can be significantly reduced before the patent is issued, and its scope can be reinterpreted after issuance. Consequently, we may not obtain or maintain adequate patent protection for any of our product candidates. As of March 1, 2017, with respect to JTX-2011, we own three pending U.S. provisional patent applications, one pending United States non-provisional application, five pending foreign patent applications, and two pending PCT patent applications within two patent families that cover compositions of matter and methods of use and ICOS-related biomarkers, and we do not own any issued patents. As of March 1, 2017 with respect to JTX-4014, we own one pending U.S. provisional patent 
26

application that covers compositions of matter and methods of use, and we do not own any non-provisional applications or issued patents. We cannot predict whether the patent applications we pursue will issue as patents in any particular jurisdiction or whether the claims of any issued patents will provide any proprietary protection from competitors. Even if our pending patent applications are granted as issued patents, those patents, as well as any patents we license from third parties, may be challenged, circumvented or invalidated by third parties.
In addition, we exclusively in-licensed a patent portfolio from Sloan Kettering Institute for Cancer Research, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center and Memorial Hospital for Cancer, or MSK, and University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, or MD Anderson, consisting of two issued U.S. patents, one issued Japanese patent, one issued Chinese patent, one issued Australian patent, one pending U.S. patent application, and five pending foreign patent applications. This licensed patent portfolio covers methods related to the use of an ICOS agonist in combination with blocking agents of certain T cell inhibitory receptors. The issued patents and the pending patent applications (if issued) licensed from MSK and MD Anderson, if the appropriate maintenance, renewal, annuity or other governmental fees are paid, are expected to expire in 2030, excluding any additional term for patent term adjustments or patent term extensions.
The term of individual patents depends upon the legal term of the patents in the countries in which they are obtained. In most countries in which we file, the patent term is 20 years from the earliest date of filing a non-provisional patent application. In the United States, the patent term of a patent that covers an FDA-approved drug may also be eligible for patent term extension, which permits patent term restoration as compensation for the patent term lost during the FDA regulatory review process. The Hatch-Waxman Act permits a patent term extension of up to five years beyond the expiration of the patent. The length of the patent term extension is related to the length of time the drug is under regulatory review. Patent term extension cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the date of product approval and only one patent applicable to an approved drug may be extended. Similar provisions are available in Europe and other foreign jurisdictions to extend the term of a patent that covers an approved drug. In the future, if and when our products receive FDA approval, we expect to apply for patent term extensions on patents covering those products. We plan to seek patent term extensions to any of our issued patents in any jurisdiction where these are available, however there is no guarantee that the applicable authorities, including the FDA in the United States, will agree with our assessment of whether such extensions should be granted, and if granted, the length of such extensions.
We also rely on unpatented know-how, inventions and other proprietary information relating to JTX-2011, JTX-4014 and our other future product candidates. We seek to protect and maintain the confidentiality of proprietary information to protect aspects of our business that are not amenable to, or that we do not consider appropriate for, patent protection. Although we take steps to protect our proprietary information and trade secrets, including through contractual means with our employees and consultants, third parties may independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information and techniques or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or disclose our technology. Thus, we may not be able to meaningfully protect our trade secrets. It is our policy to require our employees, consultants, outside scientific collaborators, sponsored researchers and other advisors to execute confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of employment or consulting relationships with us. These agreements provide that all confidential information concerning our business or financial affairs developed or made known to the individual during the course of the individual's relationship with us is to be kept confidential and not disclosed to third parties except in specific circumstances. Our agreements with employees also provide that all inventions conceived by the employee in the course of employment with us or from the employee's use of our confidential information are our exclusive property. However, such confidentiality agreements and invention assignment agreements can be breached and we may not have adequate remedies for any such breach. For a more comprehensive discussion of the risks related to our intellectual property, please see "Risk factors—Risks Related to Intellectual Property."
Exclusive License Agreement with Sloan Kettering Institute for Cancer Research, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, and Memorial Hospital for Cancer and Allied Diseases
In September 2015, we amended and restated an exclusive license agreement from December 2013 with Sloan Kettering Institute for Cancer Research, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center and Memorial Hospital for Cancer and Allied Diseases, or MSK. Pursuant to this amended and restated license agreement, MSK and The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, or MD Anderson, granted to us a worldwide exclusive license under certain patents to manufacture, develop and commercialize certain products and services, including those products for which the use in combination with another product for the treatment of any disease is covered by such patents (including, potentially, JTX-2011), and to practice certain methods covered by the patents.
27

Under the license agreement, we are obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to commercialize at least one licensed product or licensed service as defined in the license agreement. We also are required to achieve the following developmental milestones by the end of 2019: achievement of initial efficacy of proof of concept, identification of a development candidate, and filing of an IND application with the FDA. As of September 30, 2016, we have achieved all of these milestones.
In connection with the license agreement, we issued to MSK and MD Anderson an aggregate of 60,974 shares of our common stock. We also paid an upfront license fee of $30,000 to MSK and MD Anderson. Commencing on the third anniversary of the effective date of the amended and restated license agreement, we must pay an annual maintenance fee ranging in the mid-four figures to the mid-five figures. The annual maintenance fee is fully credited against the royalty payments for the same year or any subsequent year or any other amount due under the license agreement. We are obligated to pay the MSK milestone payments of up to $3,475,000 for the first and second licensed products to achieve certain development and marketing approval milestones, including up to $2,725,000 for the first licensed product to achieve such developmental and marketing approval milestones. On a country-by-country basis and licensed product-by-licensed product or licensed service-by-licensed service basis, we are also obligated to pay the MSK a low single-digit percentage royalty on net sales of licensed products or licensed services, to the extent used in combination with another product for the treatment of any disease covered by the applicable patents, until the earlier of the expiration of the last valid patent claim covering such licensed product or licensed service in such country or twelve years after the first commercial sale of such licensed product or licensed service in such country. If we sublicense our rights under our license agreement with MSK, we would be obligated to pay the MSK a low double-digit percentage royalty of the total gross proceeds we receive in consideration of the grant of the sublicense, excluding royalties, research and development funding, payments for equity or debt securities and certain other expenses we have incurred that are reimbursed by the sublicensee.
Unless terminated earlier, the license agreement expires on the date that we no longer have any royalty payment obligations under the license agreement. We may terminate the license agreement for convenience in its entirety upon 30 days' prior written notice to MSK and MD Anderson. Either party may terminate the license agreement in its entirety in the event of an uncured material breach or the bankruptcy, insolvency, dissolution or winding up of the other party which is not dismissed or cured within a set period of time. If we terminate the license agreement because of MSK's and MD Anderson's uncured breach or insolvency, we will retain a non-exclusive, perpetual, irrevocable, fully paid-up, royalty-free worldwide license to the licensed patents. Upon expiration of our obligation to pay royalties for a licensed product or service in a country, our license to the licensed patents for such licensed product or service will become exclusive, perpetual, irrevocable, fully paid-up and royalty-free in such country.
Government Regulation
Government authorities in the United States at the federal, state and local level and in other countries regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, approval, labeling, packaging, storage, record-keeping, promotion, advertising, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, marketing and export and import of drug and biological products, such as JTX-2011, JTX-4014 and any future product candidates. Generally, before a new drug or biologic can be marketed, considerable data demonstrating its quality, safety and efficacy must be obtained, organized into a format specific for each regulatory authority, submitted for review and approved by the regulatory authority.
U.S. Drug Development
In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and its implementation regulations and biologics under the FDCA, the Public Health Service Act, or PHSA, and their implementing regulations. Both drugs and biologics also are subject to other federal, state and local statutes and regulations. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or post-market may subject an applicant to administrative or judicial sanctions. These sanctions could include, among other actions, the FDA's refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, a clinical hold, untitled or warning letters, product recalls or market withdrawals, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement and civil or criminal penalties. Any agency or judicial enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us.
28

JTX-2011, JTX-4014 and any future product candidates must be approved by the FDA through either a New Drug Application, or NDA, or BLA, process before they may be legally marketed in the United States. The process generally involves the following:

• | completion of extensive preclinical studies in accordance with applicable regulations, including studies conducted in accordance with good laboratory practice, or GLP, requirements;


• | submission to the FDA of an IND application, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;


• | approval by an independent institutional review board, or IRB, or ethics committee at each clinical trial site before each trial may be initiated;


• | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with applicable IND regulations, good clinical practice, or GCP, requirements and other clinical trial-related regulations to establish the safety and efficacy of the investigational product for each proposed indication;


• | submission to the FDA of an NDA or BLA;


• | determination by the FDA within 60 days of its receipt of an NDA or BLA to accept the filing for review;


• | satisfactory completion of a FDA pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities where the drug or biologic will be produced to assess compliance with cGMP requirements to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the drug or biologic's identity, strength, quality and purity;


• | potential FDA audit of the preclinical and/or clinical trial sites that generated the data in support of the NDA or BLA; and


• | FDA review and approval of the NDA or BLA, including consideration of the views of any FDA advisory committee, prior to any commercial marketing or sale of the drug or biologic in the United States.

The preclinical and clinical testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort and financial resources, and we cannot be certain that any approvals for JTX-2011, JTX-4014 and any future product candidates will be granted on a timely basis, or at all. The data required to support an NDA or BLA are generated in two distinct developmental stages: preclinical and clinical. The preclinical developmental stage generally involves laboratory evaluations of drug chemistry, formulation and stability, as well as studies to evaluate toxicity in animals, which support subsequent clinical testing. The sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical studies, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and a proposed clinical protocol, to the FDA as part of the IND. An IND is a request for authorization from the FDA to administer an investigational product to humans, and must become effective before human clinical trials may begin.
The clinical stage of development involves the administration of the investigational product to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of qualified investigators, generally physicians not employed by or under the trial sponsor's control, in accordance with GCP requirements, which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent for their participation in any clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria and the parameters to be used to monitor subject safety and assess efficacy. Each protocol, and any subsequent amendments to the protocol, must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Furthermore, each clinical trial must be reviewed and approved by an IRB for each institution at which the clinical trial will be conducted to ensure that the risks to individuals participating in the clinical trials are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits. The IRB also approves the informed consent form that must be provided to each clinical trial subject or his or her legal representative, and must monitor the clinical trial until completed. There also are requirements governing the reporting of ongoing clinical trials and completed clinical trial results to public registries.
A sponsor who wishes to conduct a clinical trial outside of the United States may, but need not, obtain FDA authorization to conduct the clinical trial under an IND. If a foreign clinical trial is not conducted under an IND, the sponsor may submit data from the clinical trial to the FDA in support of an NDA or BLA. The FDA will accept a well-designed and well-conducted foreign clinical study not conducted under an IND if the study was conducted in accordance with GCP requirements, and the FDA is able to validate the data through an onsite inspection if deemed necessary.
Preclinical Studies and IND
Preclinical studies include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry and formulation, as well as in vitro and animal studies to assess the potential for adverse events and in some cases to establish a rationale for therapeutic use. 
29

The conduct of preclinical studies is subject to federal regulations and requirements, including GLP regulations for safety/toxicology studies. An IND sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and plans for clinical studies, among other things, to the FDA as part of an IND. Some long-term preclinical testing, such as animal tests of reproductive adverse events and carcinogenicity, may continue after the IND is submitted. An IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless before that time, the FDA raises concerns or questions related to one or more proposed clinical trials and places the trial on clinical hold. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. As a result, submission of an IND may not result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to commence.
Clinical Trials
Clinical trials generally are conducted in three sequential phases, known as Phase I, Phase II and Phase III, and may overlap.

• | Phase I clinical trials generally involve a small number of healthy volunteers or disease-affected patients who are initially exposed to a single dose and then multiple doses of the product candidate. The primary purpose of these clinical trials is to assess the metabolism, pharmacologic action, side effect tolerability and safety of the drug.


• | Phase II clinical trials involve studies in disease-affected patients to determine the dose required to produce the desired benefits. At the same time, safety and further pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic information is collected, possible adverse effects and safety risks are identified and a preliminary evaluation of efficacy is conducted.


• | Phase III clinical trials generally involve a large number of patients at multiple sites and are designed to provide the data necessary to demonstrate the effectiveness of the product for its intended use, its safety in use and to establish the overall benefit/risk relationship of the product and provide an adequate basis for product approval. These trials may include comparisons with placebo and/or other comparator treatments. The duration of treatment is often extended to mimic the actual use of a product during marketing.

Post-approval trials, sometimes referred to as Phase IV clinical trials, may be conducted after initial marketing approval. These trials are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication. In certain instances, the FDA may mandate the performance of Phase IV clinical trials as a condition of approval of an NDA or BLA.
Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials, among other information, must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and written IND safety reports must be submitted to the FDA and the investigators for serious and unexpected suspected adverse events, findings from animal or in vitro testing or other studies that suggest a significant risk for human subjects and any clinically important increase in the rate of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure.
Phase I, Phase II and Phase III clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, if at all. The FDA or the sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB's requirements or if the drug or biologic has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients. Additionally, some clinical trials are overseen by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical trial sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board or committee. This group provides authorization for whether a trial may move forward at designated check points based on access to certain data from the trial. Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal studies and also must develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the drug or biologic as well as finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product and, among other things, companies must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that JTX-2011, JTX-4014 and any future product candidates do not undergo unacceptable deterioration over their shelf life.
30

NDA/BLA and FDA Review Process
Following completion of the clinical trials, data are analyzed to assess whether the investigational product is safe and effective for the proposed indicated use or uses. The results of preclinical studies and clinical trials are then submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA or BLA, along with proposed labeling, chemistry and manufacturing information to ensure product quality and other relevant data. In short, the NDA or BLA is a request for approval to market the drug or biologic for one or more specified indications and must contain proof of safety and efficacy for a drug or safety, purity and potency for a biologic. The application may include both negative and ambiguous results of preclinical studies and clinical trials, as well as positive findings. Data may come from company-sponsored clinical trials intended to test the safety and efficacy of a product's use or from a number of alternative sources, including studies initiated by investigators. To support marketing approval, the data submitted must be sufficient in quality and quantity to establish the safety and efficacy of the investigational product to the satisfaction of FDA. FDA approval of an NDA or BLA must be obtained before a drug or biologic may be marketed in the United States.
Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, as amended, each NDA or BLA must be accompanied by a user fee. FDA adjusts the PDUFA user fees on an annual basis. According to the FDA's fee schedule, effective through September 30, 2017, the user fee for an application requiring clinical data, such as an NDA or BLA, is $2,038,100. PDUFA also imposes an annual product fee for human drugs and biologics (approximately $97,750) and an annual establishment fee of $512,000 on facilities used to manufacture prescription drugs and biologics. Fee waivers or reductions are available in certain circumstances, including a waiver of the application fee for the first application filed by a small business. Additionally, no user fees are assessed on NDAs or BLAs for products designated as orphan drugs, unless the product also includes a non-orphan indication.
The FDA reviews all submitted NDAs and BLAs before it accepts them for filing, and may request additional information rather than accepting the NDA or BLA for filing. The FDA must make a decision on accepting an NDA or BLA for filing within 60 days of receipt. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review of the NDA or BLA. Under the goals and policies agreed to by the FDA under PDUFA, the FDA has ten months, from the filing date, in which to complete its initial review of a new molecular-entity NDA or original BLA and respond to the applicant, and six months from the filing date of a new molecular-entity NDA or original BLA designated for priority review. The FDA does not always meet its PDUFA goal dates for standard and priority NDAs or BLAs, and the review process is often extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification.
Before approving an NDA or BLA, the FDA will conduct a pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facilities for the new product to determine whether they comply with cGMP requirements. The FDA will not approve the product unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. The FDA also may audit data from clinical trials to ensure compliance with GCP requirements. Additionally, the FDA may refer applications for novel drug products or drug products which present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions, if any. The FDA is not bound by recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations when making decisions on approval. The FDA likely will reanalyze the clinical trial data, which could result in extensive discussions between the FDA and the applicant during the review process. After the FDA evaluates an NDA or BLA, it will issue an approval letter or a Complete Response Letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A Complete Response Letter indicates that the review cycle of the application is complete and the application will not be approved in its present form. A Complete Response Letter usually describes all of the specific deficiencies in the NDA or BLA identified by the FDA. The Complete Response Letter may require additional clinical data, additional pivotal Phase III clinical trial(s) and/or other significant and time-consuming requirements related to clinical trials, preclinical studies or manufacturing. If a Complete Response Letter is issued, the applicant may either resubmit the NDA or BLA, addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter, or withdraw the application. Even if such data and information are submitted, the FDA may decide that the NDA or BLA does not satisfy the criteria for approval. Data obtained from clinical trials are not always conclusive and the FDA may interpret data differently than we interpret the same data.
Orphan Drug Designation
Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan designation to a drug or biological product intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more than 200,000 individuals in the United States and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making the product available in the United States for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product.
31

Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an NDA or BLA. After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process.
If a product that has orphan designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease or condition for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan drug exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug for the same indication for seven years from the date of such approval, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan exclusivity by means of greater effectiveness, greater safety or providing a major contribution to patient care or in instances of drug supply issues. Competitors, however, may receive approval of either a different product for the same indication or the same product for a different indication but that could be used off-label in the orphan indication. Orphan drug exclusivity also could block the approval of one of our products for seven years if a competitor obtains approval before we do for the same product, as defined by the FDA, for the same indication we are seeking approval, or if one of our products is determined to be contained within the scope of the competitor's product for the same indication or disease. If one of our products designated as an orphan drug receives marketing approval for an indication broader than that which is designated, it may not be entitled to orphan drug exclusivity. Orphan drug status in the European Union has similar, but not identical, requirements and benefits.
Expedited Development and Review Programs
The FDA has a fast track program that is intended to expedite or facilitate the process for reviewing new drugs and biologics that meet certain criteria. Specifically, new drugs and biologics are eligible for fast track designation if they are intended to treat a serious or life threatening condition and preclinical or clinical data demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the condition. Fast track designation applies to both the product and the specific indication for which it is being studied. The sponsor can request the FDA to designate the product for fast track status any time before receiving NDA or BLA approval, but ideally no later than the pre-NDA or pre-BLA meeting.
Any product submitted to the FDA for marketing, including under a fast track program, may be eligible for other types of FDA programs intended to expedite development and review, such as priority review and accelerated approval. Any product is eligible for priority review if it treats a serious or life-threatening condition and, if approved, would provide a significant improvement in safety and effectiveness compared to available therapies.
The FDA will attempt to direct additional resources to the evaluation of an application for a new drug or biologic designated for priority review in an effort to facilitate the review. A product may also be eligible for accelerated approval, if it treats a serious or life-threatening condition and generally provides a meaningful advantage over available therapies. In addition, it must demonstrate an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, or IMM, which is reasonably likely to predict an effect on IMM or other clinical benefit. As a condition of approval, the FDA may require that a sponsor of a drug or biologic receiving accelerated approval perform adequate and well-controlled post-marketing clinical trials. If the FDA concludes that a drug or biologic shown to be effective can be safely used only if distribution or use is restricted, it will require such post-marketing restrictions, as it deems necessary to assure safe use of the product.
Additionally, a drug or biologic may be eligible for designation as a breakthrough therapy if the product is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs or biologics, to treat a serious or life-threatening condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product may demonstrate substantial improvement over currently approved therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints. The benefits of breakthrough therapy designation include the same benefits as fast track designation, plus intensive guidance from the FDA to ensure an efficient drug development program. Fast track designation, priority review, accelerated approval and breakthrough therapy designation do not change the standards for approval, but may expedite the development or approval process.
Pediatric Information
Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act, or PREA, an NDA or BLA or supplement to a NDA or BLA must contain data to assess the safety and efficacy of the drug for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The FDA may grant deferrals for submission of pediatric data or full or partial waivers. The Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act, or FDASIA, amended the FDCA to require that a sponsor who is planning

to submit a marketing application for a drug that includes a new active ingredient, new indication, new dosage form, new dosing regimen or new route of administration submit an initial Pediatric Study Plan, or PSP, within 60 days of an end-of-Phase II meeting or, if there is no such meeting, as early as practicable before the initiation of the Phase III or Phase II/III study. The initial PSP must include an outline of the pediatric study or studies that the sponsor plans to conduct, including study objectives and design, age groups, relevant endpoints and statistical approach, or a justification for not including such detailed information, and any request for a deferral of pediatric assessments or a full or partial waiver of the requirement to provide data from pediatric studies along with supporting information. The FDA and the sponsor must reach an agreement on the PSP. A sponsor can submit amendments to an agreed-upon initial PSP at any time if changes to the pediatric plan need to be considered based on data collected from preclinical studies, early phase clinical trials and/or other clinical development programs.
Post-marketing Requirements
Following approval of a new product, the manufacturer and the approved product are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, monitoring and record-keeping activities, reporting of adverse experiences, complying with promotion and advertising requirements, which include restrictions on promoting drugs for unapproved uses or patient populations (known as "off-label use") and limitations on industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities. Although physicians may prescribe legally available drugs for off-label uses, manufacturers may not market or promote such uses. Prescription drug promotional materials must be submitted to the FDA in conjunction with their first use. Further, if there are any modifications to the drug or biologic, including changes in indications, labeling or manufacturing processes or facilities, the applicant may be required to submit and obtain FDA approval of a new NDA/BLA or NDA/BLA supplement, which may require the development of additional data or preclinical studies and clinical trials.
The FDA may also place other conditions on approvals including the requirement for a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, to assure the safe use of the product. If the FDA concludes a REMS is needed, the sponsor of the NDA or BLA must submit a proposed REMS. The FDA will not approve the NDA or BLA without an approved REMS, if required. A REMS could include medication guides, physician communication plans or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries and other risk minimization tools. Any of these limitations on approval or marketing could restrict the commercial promotion, distribution, prescription or dispensing of products. Product approvals may be withdrawn for non-compliance with regulatory requirements or if problems occur following initial marketing.
FDA regulations require that products be manufactured in specific approved facilities and in accordance with cGMP regulations. We rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the production of clinical and commercial quantities of our products in accordance with cGMP regulations. These manufacturers must comply with cGMP regulations that require, among other things, quality control and quality assurance, the maintenance of records and documentation and the obligation to investigate and correct any deviations from cGMP. Manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs or biologics are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP requirements and other laws. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance. The discovery of violative conditions, including failure to conform to cGMP regulations, could result in enforcement actions, and the discovery of problems with a product after approval may result in restrictions on a product, manufacturer or holder of an approved NDA or BLA, including recall.
Companion Diagnostics and Complementary Diagnostics
We believe that the success of our product candidates may depend, in part, on the development and commercialization of either a companion diagnostic or complementary diagnostic. Companion diagnostics and complementary diagnostics can identify patients who are most likely to benefit from a particular therapeutic product, identify patients likely to be at increased risk for serious side effects as a result of treatment with a particular therapeutic product, or monitor response to treatment with a particular therapeutic product for the purpose of adjusting treatment to achieve improved safety or effectiveness. Companion diagnostics and complementary diagnostics are regulated as medical devices by the FDA and, as such, require either clearance or approval prior to commercialization. The level of risk combined with available controls to mitigate risk determines whether a companion diagnostic device requires Premarket Approval Application, or PMA, approval or is cleared through the 510(k) premarket notification process. For a novel therapeutic product for which a companion diagnostic device is essential for the safe and effective use of the product, the companion diagnostic device should be developed and approved or 510(k)-cleared contemporaneously with the therapeutic. The use of the companion diagnostic device 
33

will be stipulated in the labeling of the therapeutic product. This is also true for a complementary diagnostic, although it is not a prerequisite for receiving the therapeutic.
Other Regulatory Matters
Manufacturing, sales, promotion and other activities following product approval are also subject to regulation by numerous regulatory authorities in the United States in addition to the FDA, including the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, other divisions of the Department of Health and Human Services, the Department of Justice, the Drug Enforcement Administration, the Consumer Product Safety Commission, the Federal Trade Commission, the Occupational Safety & Health Administration, the Environmental Protection Agency and state and local governments.
For example, in the United States, sales, marketing and scientific and educational programs also must comply with state and federal fraud and abuse laws. These laws include the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which makes it illegal for any person, including a prescription drug manufacturer (or a party acting on its behalf), to knowingly and willfully solicit, receive, offer or pay any remuneration that is intended to induce or reward referrals, including the purchase, recommendation, order or prescription of a particular drug, for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program, such as Medicare or Medicaid. Violations of this law are punishable by up to five years in prison, criminal fines, administrative civil money penalties and exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs. In addition, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, or collectively the Affordable Care Act, among other things, amends the intent requirement of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and criminal healthcare fraud statutes created by the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA. A person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it. Moreover, the Affordable Care Act provides that the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the False Claims Act.
Although we would not submit claims directly to payors, manufacturers also can be held liable under the federal False Claims Act, which prohibits anyone from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, for payment to federal programs (including Medicare and Medicaid) claims for items or services, including drugs or biologics, that are false or fraudulent, claims for items or services not provided as claimed or claims for medically unnecessary items or services. The government may deem manufacturers to have "caused" the submission of false or fraudulent claims by, for example, providing inaccurate billing or coding information to customers or promoting a product off-label. In addition, our future activities relating to the reporting of wholesaler or estimated retail prices for our products, the reporting of prices used to calculate Medicaid rebate information and other information affecting federal, state and third-party reimbursement for our products, and the sale and marketing of our products, are subject to scrutiny under this law. Penalties for a False Claims Act violation include three times the actual damages sustained by the government, plus mandatory civil penalties of between $10,781 and $21,563 for each separate false claim, the potential for exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs and the potential implication of various federal criminal statutes.
Pricing and rebate programs must comply with the Medicaid rebate requirements of the U.S. Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 and more recent requirements in the Affordable Care Act. If products are made available to authorized users of the Federal Supply Schedule of the General Services Administration, additional laws and requirements apply. Products must meet applicable child-resistant packaging requirements under the U.S. Poison Prevention Packaging Act. Manufacturing, sales, promotion and other activities also are potentially subject to federal and state consumer protection and unfair competition laws.
The distribution of pharmaceutical products is subject to additional requirements and regulations, including extensive record-keeping, licensing, storage and security requirements intended to prevent the unauthorized sale of pharmaceutical products.
The failure to comply with any of these laws or regulatory requirements subjects firms to possible legal or regulatory action. Depending on the circumstances, failure to meet applicable regulatory requirements can result in criminal prosecution, fines or other penalties, injunctions, requests for recall, seizure of products, total or partial suspension of production, denial or withdrawal of product approvals or refusal to allow a firm to enter into supply contracts, including government contracts. Any action against us for violation of these laws, even if we successfully defend against it, could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and divert our management's attention from the operation of our business. Prohibitions or restrictions on sales or withdrawal of future products marketed by us could materially affect our business in an adverse way.
34

Changes in regulations, statutes or the interpretation of existing regulations could impact our business in the future by requiring, for example: (i) changes to our manufacturing arrangements; (ii) additions or modifications to product labeling; (iii) the recall or discontinuation of our products; or (iv) additional record-keeping requirements. If any such changes were to be imposed, they could adversely affect the operation of our business.
U.S. Patent Term Restoration and Marketing Exclusivity
Depending upon the timing, duration and specifics of FDA approval of JTX-2011, JTX-4014 and any future product candidates, some of our U.S. patents may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, commonly referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Amendments. The Hatch-Waxman Amendments permit restoration of the patent term of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during product development and FDA regulatory review process. Patent term restoration, however, cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the product's approval date. The patent term restoration period is generally one-half the time between the effective date of an IND and the submission date of an NDA or BLA plus the time between the submission date of an NDA or BLA and the approval of that application, except that the review period is reduced by any time during which the applicant failed to exercise due diligence. Only one patent applicable to an approved drug is eligible for the extension and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent. The USPTO, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration. In the future, we may apply for restoration of patent term for our currently owned or licensed patents to add patent life beyond its current expiration date, depending on the expected length of the clinical trials and other factors involved in the filing of the relevant NDA or BLA.
Market exclusivity provisions under the FDCA also can delay the submission or the approval of certain applications. The FDCA provides a five-year period of non-patent marketing exclusivity within the United States to the first applicant to gain approval of a NDA for a new chemical entity. A drug is a new chemical entity if the FDA has not previously approved any other new drug containing the same active moiety, which is the molecule or ion responsible for the action of the drug substance. During the exclusivity period, the FDA may not accept for review an abbreviated new drug application, or ANDA, or a 505(b)(2) NDA submitted by another company for another version of such drug where the applicant does not own or have a legal right of reference to all the data required for approval. However, an application may be submitted after four years if it contains a certification of patent invalidity or non-infringement. The FDCA also provides three years of marketing exclusivity for a NDA, 505(b)(2) NDA or supplement to an existing NDA if new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability studies, that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant are deemed by the FDA to be essential to the approval of the application, for example, new indications, dosages or strengths of an existing drug. This three-year exclusivity covers only the conditions of use associated with the new clinical investigations and does not prohibit the FDA from approving ANDAs for drugs containing the original active agent. Five-year and three-year exclusivity will not delay the submission or approval of a full NDA. However, an applicant submitting a full NDA would be required to conduct or obtain a right of reference to all of the preclinical studies and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials necessary to demonstrate safety and effectiveness.
An abbreviated approval pathway for biological products shown to be biosimilar to, or interchangeable with, an FDA-licensed reference biological product was created by the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009, or BPCI Act, as part of the Affordable Care Act. This amendment to the PHSA, in part, attempts to minimize duplicative testing. Biosimilarity, which requires that the biological product be highly similar to the reference product notwithstanding minor differences in clinically inactive components and that there be no clinically meaningful differences between the product and the reference product in terms of safety, purity and potency, can be shown through analytical studies, animal studies and a clinical trial or trials. Interchangeability requires that a biological product be biosimilar to the reference product and that the product can be expected to produce the same clinical results as the reference product in any given patient and, for products administered multiple times to an individual, that the product and the reference product may be alternated or switched after one has been previously administered without increasing safety risks or risks of diminished efficacy relative to exclusive use of the reference biological product without such alternation or switch. Complexities associated with the larger, and often more complex, structure of biological products as compared to small molecule drugs, as well as the processes by which such products are manufactured, pose significant hurdles to implementation that are still being worked out by the FDA.
A reference biological product is granted twelve years of data exclusivity from the time of first licensure of the product, and the FDA will not accept an application for a biosimilar or interchangeable product based on the reference biological product until four years after the date of first licensure of the reference product. "First licensure" 
35

typically means the initial date the particular product at issue was licensed in the United States. Date of first licensure does not include the date of licensure of (and a new period of exclusivity is not available for) a biological product if the licensure is for a supplement for the biological product or for a subsequent application by the same sponsor or manufacturer of the biological product (or licensor, predecessor in interest, or other related entity) for a change (not including a modification to the structure of the biological product) that results in a new indication, route of administration, dosing schedule, dosage form, delivery system, delivery device or strength, or for a modification to the structure of the biological product that does not result in a change in safety, purity, or potency. Therefore, one must determine whether a new product includes a modification to the structure of a previously licensed product that results in a change in safety, purity, or potency to assess whether the licensure of the new product is a first licensure that triggers its own period of exclusivity. Whether a subsequent application, if approved, warrants exclusivity as the "first licensure" of a biological product is determined on a case-by-case basis with data submitted by the sponsor.
Pediatric exclusivity is another type of regulatory market exclusivity in the United States. Pediatric exclusivity, if granted, adds six months to existing regulatory exclusivity periods. This six-month exclusivity may be granted based on the voluntary completion of a pediatric trial in accordance with an FDA-issued "Written Request" for such a trial. Furthermore, a biological product seeking licensure as biosimilar to or interchangeable with a reference product indicated for a rare disease or condition and granted seven years of orphan drug exclusivity may not be licensed by the FDA for the protected orphan indication until after the expiration of the seven-year orphan drug exclusivity period or the 12-year reference product exclusivity, whichever is later.
In April 2014, the EU adopted a new Clinical Trials Regulation (EU) No 536/2014, which is set to replace the current Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC. It is expected that the new Clinical Trials Regulation will apply by October 2018. It will overhaul the current system of approvals for clinical trials in the EU. Specifically, the new legislation, which will be directly applicable in all member states, aims at simplifying and streamlining the approval of clinical trials in the EU. For instance, the new Clinical Trials Regulation provides for a streamlined application procedure via a single entry point and strictly defined deadlines for the assessment of clinical trial applications.
European Union Drug Development
In the European Union, our future products also may be subject to extensive regulatory requirements. As in the United States, medicinal products can be marketed only if a marketing authorization from the competent regulatory agencies has been obtained.
Similar to the United States, the various phases of preclinical and clinical research in the European Union are subject to significant regulatory controls. Although the EU Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC has sought to harmonize the EU clinical trials regulatory framework, setting out common rules for the control and authorization of clinical trials in the EU, the EU Member States have transposed and applied the provisions of the Directive differently. This has led to significant variations in the member state regimes. Under the current regime, before a clinical trial can be initiated it must be approved in each of the EU countries where the trial is to be conducted by two distinct bodies: the National Competent Authority, or NCA, and one or more Ethics Committees, or ECs. Under the current regime all suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions to the investigated drug that occur during the clinical trial have to be reported to the NCA and ECs of the Member State where they occurred.
European Union Drug Review and Approval
In the European Economic Area, or EEA, which is comprised of the 28 Member States of the European Union (plus Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein), medicinal products can only be commercialized after obtaining a Marketing Authorization, or MA. There are two types of marketing authorizations.

• | The Community MA is issued by the European Commission through the Centralized Procedure, based on the opinion of the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, or CHMP, of the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, and is valid throughout the entire territory of the EEA. The Centralized Procedure is mandatory for certain types of products, such as biotechnology medicinal products, orphan medicinal products, advanced-therapy medicines such as gene-therapy, somatic cell-therapy or tissue-engineered medicines and medicinal products containing a new active substance indicated for the treatment of HIV, AIDS, cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, diabetes, auto-immune and other immune dysfunctions and viral diseases. The Centralized Procedure is optional for products containing a new active substance not yet authorized in the EEA, or for products that constitute a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation or which are in the interest of public health in the EU.

36


• | National MAs, which are issued by the competent authorities of the Member States of the EEA and only cover their respective territory, are available for products not falling within the mandatory scope of the Centralized Procedure. Where a product has already been authorized for marketing in a Member State of the EEA, this National MA can be recognized in another Member States through the Mutual Recognition Procedure. If the product has not received a National MA in any Member State at the time of application, it can be approved simultaneously in various Member States through the Decentralized Procedure. Under the Decentralized Procedure an identical dossier is submitted to the competent authorities of each of the Member States in which the MA is sought, one of which is selected by the applicant as the Reference Member State, or RMS. The competent authority of the RMS prepares a draft assessment report, a draft summary of the product characteristics, or SPC, and a draft of the labeling and package leaflet, which are sent to the other Member States (referred to as the Member States Concerned) for their approval. If the Member States Concerned raise no objections, based on a potential serious risk to public health, to the assessment, SPC, labeling, or packaging proposed by the RMS, the product is subsequently granted a national MA in all the Member States (i.e., in the RMS and the Member States Concerned).

Under the above described procedures, before granting the MA, the EMA or the competent authorities of the Member States of the EEA make an assessment of the risk-benefit balance of the product on the basis of scientific criteria concerning its quality, safety and efficacy.
European Union New Chemical Entity Exclusivity
In the European Union, new chemical entities, sometimes referred to as new active substances, qualify for eight years of data exclusivity upon marketing authorization and an additional two years of market exclusivity. The data exclusivity, if granted, prevents regulatory authorities in the European Union from referencing the innovator's data to assess a generic application for eight years, after which generic marketing authorization can be submitted, and the innovator's data may be referenced, but not approved for two years. The overall ten-year period will be extended to a maximum of 11 years if, during the first eight years of those ten years, the marketing authorization holder obtains an authorization for one or more new therapeutic indications which, during the scientific evaluation prior to their authorization, are determined to bring a significant clinical benefit in comparison with currently approved therapies.
European Union Orphan Designation and Exclusivity
In the European Union, the European Commission, upon recommendation of the EMA's Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products grants orphan drug designation to promote the development of products that are intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of life-threatening or chronically debilitating conditions affecting not more than 5 in 10,000 persons in the European Union community (or where it is unlikely that the development of the medicine would generate sufficient return to justify the investment) and for which no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention or treatment has been authorized (or, if a method exists, the product would be a significant benefit to those affected).
In the European Union, orphan drug designation entitles a party to financial incentives such as reduction of fees or fee waivers and ten years of market exclusivity is granted following medicinal product approval. This period may be reduced to six years if the orphan drug designation criteria are no longer met, including where it is shown that the product is sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of market exclusivity. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an application for marketing approval. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process.
Rest of the World Regulation
For other countries outside of the European Union and the United States, such as countries in Eastern Europe, Latin America or Asia, the requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. Additionally, the clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with GCP requirements and the applicable regulatory requirements and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki.
If we fail to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements, we may be subject to, among other things, fines, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecution.
37

Reimbursement
Sales of our products will depend, in part, on the extent to which our products will be covered by third-party payors, such as government health programs, commercial insurance and managed healthcare organizations. In the United States no uniform policy of coverage and reimbursement for drug or biological products exists. Accordingly, decisions regarding the extent of coverage and amount of reimbursement to be provided for any of our products will be made on a payor-by-payor basis. As a result, the coverage determination process is often a time-consuming and costly process that will require us to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of our products to each payor separately, with no assurance that coverage and adequate reimbursement will be obtained.
The United States government, state legislatures and foreign governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost containment programs to limit the growth of government-paid health care costs, including price-controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products for branded prescription drugs. For example, the Affordable Care Act contains provisions that may reduce the profitability of drug products through increased rebates for drugs reimbursed by Medicaid programs, extension of Medicaid rebates to Medicaid managed care plans, mandatory discounts for certain Medicare Part D beneficiaries and annual fees based on pharmaceutical companies' share of sales to federal health care programs. Adoption of general controls and measures, coupled with the tightening of restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could limit payments for pharmaceutical drugs.
The Medicaid Drug Rebate Program requires pharmaceutical manufacturers to enter into and have in effect a national rebate agreement with the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services as a condition for states to receive federal matching funds for the manufacturer's outpatient drugs furnished to Medicaid patients. The Affordable Care Act made several changes to the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, including increasing pharmaceutical manufacturers' rebate liability by raising the minimum basic Medicaid rebate on most branded prescription drugs from 15.1% of average manufacturer price, or AMP, to 23.1% of AMP and adding a new rebate calculation for "line extensions" (i.e., new formulations, such as extended release formulations) of solid oral dosage forms of branded products, as well as potentially impacting their rebate liability by modifying the statutory definition of AMP. The Affordable Care Act also expanded the universe of Medicaid utilization subject to drug rebates by requiring pharmaceutical manufacturers to pay rebates on Medicaid managed care utilization and by enlarging the population potentially eligible for Medicaid drug benefits. 
The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003, or the MMA, established the Medicare Part D program to provide a voluntary prescription drug benefit to Medicare beneficiaries. Under Part D, Medicare beneficiaries may enroll in prescription drug plans offered by private entities that provide coverage of outpatient prescription drugs. Unlike Medicare Part A and B, Part D coverage is not standardized. While all Medicare drug plans must give at least a standard level of coverage set by Medicare, Part D prescription drug plan sponsors are not required to pay for all covered Part D drugs, and each drug plan can develop its own drug formulary that identifies which drugs it will cover and at what tier or level. However, Part D prescription drug formularies must include drugs within each therapeutic category and class of covered Part D drugs, though not necessarily all the drugs in each category or class. Any formulary used by a Part D prescription drug plan must be developed and reviewed by a pharmacy and therapeutic committee. Government payment for some of the costs of prescription drugs may increase demand for products for which we receive marketing approval. However, any negotiated prices for our products covered by a Part D prescription drug plan likely will be lower than the prices we might otherwise obtain. Moreover, while the MMA applies only to drug benefits for Medicare beneficiaries, private payors often follow Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own payment rates. Any reduction in payment that results from the MMA may result in a similar reduction in payments from non-governmental payors.
For a drug product to receive federal reimbursement under the Medicaid or Medicare Part B programs or to be sold directly to U.S. government agencies, the manufacturer must extend discounts to entities eligible to participate in the 340B drug pricing program. The required 340B discount on a given product is calculated based on the AMP and Medicaid rebate amounts reported by the manufacturer. The Affordable Care Act expanded the types of entities eligible to receive discounted 340B pricing, although, under the current state of the law, with the exception of children's hospitals, these newly eligible entities will not be eligible to receive discounted 340B pricing on orphan drugs. In addition, as 340B drug pricing is determined based on AMP and Medicaid rebate data, the revisions to the Medicaid rebate formula and AMP definition described above could cause the required 340B discount to increase.
As noted above, the marketability of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale may suffer if the government and third-party payors fail to provide adequate coverage and reimbursement. An increasing emphasis on cost containment measures in the United States has increased and we expect will continue to 
38

increase the pressure on pharmaceutical pricing. Coverage policies and third-party reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which we receive regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future.
In addition, in most foreign countries, the proposed pricing for a drug must be approved before it may be lawfully marketed. The requirements governing drug pricing and reimbursement vary widely from country to country. For example, the European Union provides options for its member states to restrict the range of medicinal products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. A member state may approve a specific price for the medicinal product or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the medicinal product on the market. There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for pharmaceutical products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any of our products. Historically, products launched in the European Union do not follow price structures of the United States and generally prices tend to be significantly lower.
Some of the provisions of the Affordable Care Act have yet to be fully implemented, while certain provisions have been subject to judicial and Congressional challenges. In January 2017, Congress voted to adopt a budget resolution for fiscal year 2017, that while not a law, is widely viewed as the first step toward the passage of legislation that would repeal certain aspects of the Affordable Care Act. Further, on January 20, 2017, President Trump signed an Executive Order directing federal agencies with authorities and responsibilities under the Affordable Care Act to waive, defer, grant exemptions from, or delay the implementation of any provision of the Affordable Care Act that would impose a fiscal burden on states or a cost, fee, tax, penalty or regulatory burden on individuals, healthcare providers, health insurers, or manufacturers of pharmaceuticals or medical devices. Congress also could consider subsequent legislation to replace elements of the Affordable Care Act that are repealed. Thus, the full impact of the Affordable Care Act, any law replacing elements of it, or the political uncertainty surrounding any repeal or replacement legislation on our business remains unclear.
