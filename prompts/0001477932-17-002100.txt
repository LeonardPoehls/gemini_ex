ITEM 1 – BUSINESS
Corporate History
 
We were incorporated on May 10, 2010 in the State of Nevada.
 
Overview
 
Pain Management
 
On September 13, 2016, we entered into an operating agreement to form a pain management joint venture company with Advanced Technologies Solutions (ATS), a company based in San Diego, California and owned by Ronald T. La Borde, a member of our Board of Directors. The joint venture company, Premier Biomedical Pain Management Solutions, LLC, a Nevada limited liability company (PBPMS), will develop and market natural and cannabis-based generalized, neuropathic, and localized pain relief treatment products. We own 50% of PBPMS and ATS owns the other 50%, with 89% of the profits allocated to us and the remaining 11% of profits allocated to ATS.
 
Through the use of technologies previously developed, PBPMS has developed two new products that we are in the process of marketing. The first is a CBD, or Cannabidiol, topical patch. The patent-pending reservoir patch design features a unique barrier between the foam adhesive and the pain relieving ingredients to ensure that the adhesive is not transmitted and absorbed through the skin, as with many competitive patches. The formulations for the products contain no psychoactive components and, therefore, are not expected to affect drug test results. 
 
The second product is a roll-on that consists of the same primary ingredients as contained in our reservoir patch, but in a convenient, pocket-size applicator. PBPMS is also seeking to develop additional pain relief products, including creams, sprays, gel pens and capsules. We plan to launch at least three new products into the market in 2017. As of December 31, 2016, except for administrative and formation matters, we had not yet commenced any activities under the joint venture.

These products are designed to provide natural relief from:
-----------------------------------------------------------
· | Knee pain, 
· | Shoulder pain, 
· | Joint pain, 
· | Arthritis pain, 
· | Muscle soreness and tenderness,
· | Headaches, and 
· | Migraines. 

 
Sales of our pain management products began on February 1, 2017. We sell our products via our website at www.painreliefmeds.com and various distributors. To date, three pharmacies and three chiropractic clinics have approved our products for sale and are distributing our products. We anticipate that our products will eventually be placed in several large pharmacy chains and sold in several states. 
 
Research and Development
 
We intend to continue to discover and develop medical treatments for humans, specifically targeting the pain management industry and the treatment of: 
 

- | Cancer | - | Fibromyalgia 
--+-------------------------------+---+-----------------------------
- | Multiple Sclerosis (MS) | - | Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI)
- | Neuropathic Pain | - | Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) 
- | Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis | - | Blood Sepsis and Viremia 
 | (ALS/Lou Gehrig’s Disease) | | 

 
We have a three-fold corporate focus:
 
One is to develop and market pain management products. Particularly, we are in the process of developing and marketing natural and cannabis-based generalized, neuropathic and localized pain relief treatment products with a joint venture partner. 
 
The second is to target Cancer, Alzheimer’s disease, ALS, Blood Sepsis, Leukemia, and other life-threatening cancers, and to do this we intend to develop our proprietary Sequential-Dialysis Technique. The methodology involved in this technique is largely unexplored and has been described by scientists as the “wild west” of modern medicine. Consequently, our first entry into the therapeutics market for medications that work against cancer, Multiple Sclerosis, infectious diseases, Alzheimer’s disease, strokes and traumatic brain injury carries significant obstacles before reaching the opportunities of a $700 billion industry.
 
The third is the development of our proprietary drug candidate Feldetrex™, a potential treatment for Multiple Sclerosis, Fibromyalgia, Neuropathic Pain and Traumatic Brain Injury. The formulation used in the current Feldetrex™will be individually tailored to the various illnesses we intend to target, with each formulation being given a unique proprietary brand name. The annual market size of MS treatment is $500 million and the annual market size for all proposed Feldetrex™ market segments is $16 billion.

To overcome the significant obstacles inherent to the development of our Sequential-Dialysis Technique and Feldetrex™ candidate drug, we are seeking to partner with prestigious institutions and pharmaceutical companies with the substantial infrastructure and resource capacity to perform experimentation and to engage in product development in an inexpensive and efficient manner.
 
Innovation by our research and development operations is very important to our success. Our goal is to discover, develop and bring to market innovative products and treatments that address major unmet medical needs, including initially, Multiple Sclerosis, Septicemia, and Cancer. We expect this goal to be supported by substantial research and development investments. 
 
We plan on conducting research internally and may also through contracts with third parties, through collaborations with universities and biotechnology companies and in cooperation with pharmaceutical firms. We may also seek out promising compounds and innovative technologies developed by third parties to incorporate into our discovery or development methods and procedures or projects, as well as our future product lines, through acquisition, licensing or other arrangements.
 
In addition to discovering and developing new products, methods and procedures of treatment and treatments, we expect our research operations to add value to our existing products and methods and procedures of treatment in development by improving their effectiveness and by discovering new uses for them. 
 
Sequential-Dialysis Technique
 
Our proprietary Sequential-Dialysis Technique is a methodology for the removal of those molecules which are harmful and responsible for causing diseases. A significant disappointment in the practice of modern medicine is that the capabilities do exist to eliminate the presence of most illnesses, including life-threatening diseases such as AIDS and cancer, but with a caveat that the process of treatment comes with catastrophic side effects that can and often do kill the patient.
 
Our development is that the innovative Sequential-Dialysis Methodology is done extracorporeally (outside the body). This is a truly unique and innovative method for alleviating disease.
 
We believe that this methodology can be used for the prevention of cancer metastasis, for directly attacking the causation of intractable seizures, for preventing the death of anterior motor neurons in ALS, for preventing the cause of the neuropathological changes in Alzheimer’s disease and Traumatic Brain Injury and for eradicating the causations of infectious diseases, and our intention is that the effectiveness of this technique will be demonstrated and supported in future clinical studies.
 
Through our Sequential-Dialysis Technique, we ultimately hope to provide a cure for cancer if not only to dramatically extend the lives of suffering patients. Our initial focus is on lab and animal tests. Clinical trials, as required, will be undertaken subsequently.
 
Feldetrex™
 
Although a combination of generic medications, we have a U.S. Patent (No. 8,865,733) on our Feldetrex™ candidate drug. In this way, Feldetrex™ is similar to Viagra®, which was a proprietary cardiac drug prior to its current use and ownership by Pfizer. Consequently, we have one pending patent application for our Feldetrex™ candidate drug—intending to increase our Feldetrex™ related patent applications to three in the near future.

Feldetrex™ may serve as an additional medication utilized by physicians for the treatment of Multiple Sclerosis, Fibromyalgia, or Traumatic Brain Injury, and is designed to decrease symptomatology in those conditions. Feldetrex™ will not compete against our proprietary Sequential-Dialysis Technique in the market to treat Traumatic Brain Injury, but rather the two will work conjunctively.
 
Feldetrex™ utilizes a low dosage of Naltrexone which has been shown in multiple medical articles, in the medical literature, to increase endogenous enkephalins[1] (endogenous enkephalins are pain-relieving pentapeptides produced in the body, located in the pituitary gland, brain, and GI tract. Axon terminals that release enkephalins are concentrated in the posterior horn of the gray matter of the spinal cord, in the central part of the thalamus, and in the amygdala of the limbic system of the cerebrum. Endogenous Enkephalins function as neurotransmitters that inhibit neurotransmitters in the pathway for pain perception, thereby reducing the emotional as well as the physical impact of pain). We have not independently conducted medical or laboratory tests to show the mechanism of action of this medication. While Naltrexone in high dosages acts as an opioid antagonist, it inhibits opiate receptors. Naltrexone in low dosages causes a compensatory upregulation (increase in the number of receptors) of native endorphins and enkephalins, which last beyond the effects of the Naltrexone itself. We believe that this means, paradoxically, that a daily dose of low dose Naltrexone can be used to chronically increase endorphin and enkephalin levels. We believe that by utilizing a low dosage, Naltrexone has a unique ability to increase enkephalins and other neurotransmitters in the brainstem of patients.

Marketing 
 
Currently, we manage our marketing responsibilities internally. We intend to seek a partnership with and/or sale of our product candidates/technologies to large pharmaceutical and/or medical devices firms. These firms have the ability to effectively promote our product candidates to healthcare providers and patients. Through their marketing organizations, they can explain the approved uses, benefits and risks of our product candidates to healthcare providers, such as doctors, nurse practitioners, physician assistants, pharmacists, hospitals, Pharmacy Benefit Managers (PBMs), Managed Care Organizations (MCOs), employers and government agencies. They also market directly to consumers in the U.S. through direct-to-consumer advertising that communicates the approved uses, benefits, and risks of our product candidates while continuing to motivate people to have meaningful conversations with their doctors. In addition, they sponsor general advertising to educate the public on disease awareness, important public health issues, and patient assistance programs. 
 
The large pharmaceutical/medical devices firms principally sell their products to wholesalers, but they also sell directly to retailers, hospitals, clinics, government agencies and pharmacies and also work with MCOs, PBMs, employers and other appropriate healthcare providers to assist them with disease management, patient education and other tools that help their medical treatment routines. 
 
Patents and Intellectual Property Rights 
 
We have licensed three U.S. patents: Sequential Extracorporeal Treatment of Bodily Fluids, U.S. Patent No. 9,216,386 and Utilization of Stents for the Treatment of Blood Borne Carcinomas, U.S. Patent No. 8,758,287 (both from Marv Enterprises, LLC), and Medication and Treatment for Disease, U.S. Patent No. 8,865,733 (from Altman Enterprises, LLC), in the areas of cancer, sepsis, and multiple sclerosis. We expect these patents to cover the medical treatments discussed above for Multiple Sclerosis, Blood Sepsis, and Cancer and be effective until 2029. Marv and Altman have licensed these technologies to us pursuant to the terms of the License Agreements. Because our license agreements cover the patents and “all applications of the United States and foreign countries that claim priority to the above PCT applications, including any non-provisionals, continuations, continuations-in-part, divisions, reissues, re-examinations or extensions thereof,” we anticipate that other technologies that derive from these patents will also belong to us and are covered by the license agreements.
 
Patents extend for twenty years from the date of patent filing. The actual protection afforded by a patent, which can vary from country to country, depends upon the type of patent, the scope of its coverage and the availability of legal remedies in the country. 
 
Dr. Felder is the owner of the Feldetrex mark, and has also licensed this to us pursuant to the terms of the License Agreements.
 
We expect our patent and related rights to be of material importance to our business.

Competition
 
Our business is conducted in an intensely competitive and often highly regulated market. Our treatments face competition in the form of branded drugs, generic drugs and the currently practiced treatments for Multiple Sclerosis, Blood Sepsis, and Cancer. The principal forms of competition include efficacy, safety, ease of use, and cost effectiveness. Where possible, companies compete on the basis of the unique features of their products, such as greater efficacy, better patient ease of use or fewer side effects. A lower overall cost of therapy is also an important factor. Products that demonstrate fewer therapeutic advantages must compete for inclusion based primarily on price. Though the means of competition vary among product categories, demonstrating the value of our medications and procedures will be a critical factor for our success.

 
Our competitors include large worldwide research-based drug companies, smaller research companies with more limited therapeutic focus, and generic drug manufacturers. We compete with other companies that manufacture and sell products that treat similar diseases as our major medications and procedures.

 
Environment
 
Our business may be subject to a variety of federal, state and local environmental protection measures. We intend to comply in all material respects with applicable environmental laws and regulations.
Regulation
 
We expect our business to be subject to varying degrees of governmental regulation in the United States and any other countries in which our operations are conducted. In the United States, regulation by various federal and state agencies has long been focused primarily on product safety, efficacy, manufacturing, advertising, labeling and safety reporting. The exercise of broad regulatory powers by the U.S. Federal Drug Administration (“FDA”) continues to result in increases in the amounts of testing and documentation required for FDA clearance of new drugs and devices and a corresponding increase in the expense of product introduction. Likewise, the approval process with the FDA is estimated to take approximately seven (7) years from the time it is started. Similar trends are also evident in major markets outside of the United States. 
 
Clinical trials are a set of procedures in medical research conducted to allow safety (or more specifically, information about adverse drug reactions and adverse effects of other treatments) and efficacy data to be collected for health interventions (e.g., drugs, diagnostics, devices, therapy protocols). These trials can take place only after satisfactory information has been gathered on the quality of the non-clinical safety, and Health Authority/Ethics Committee approval is granted in the country where the trial is taking place.
 
Depending on the type of product and the stage of its development, investigators enroll healthy volunteers and/or patients into small pilot studies initially, followed by larger scale studies in patients that often compare the new product with the currently prescribed treatment. As positive safety and efficacy data are gathered, the number of patients is typically increased. Clinical trials can vary in size from a single center in one country to multicenter trials in multiple countries.

Due to the sizable cost a full series of clinical trials may incur, the burden of paying for all the necessary people and services is usually borne by the sponsor who may be a governmental organization, a pharmaceutical, or biotechnology company. Since the diversity of roles may exceed resources of the sponsor, often a clinical trial is managed by an outsourced partner such as a contract research organization or a clinical trials unit in the academic sector.
 
The regulatory agencies under whose purview we intend to operate have administrative powers that may subject us to such actions as product withdrawals, recalls, seizure of products and other civil and criminal sanctions.
 
Because we intend to seek a partnership with and/or sale of our product candidates/technologies to large pharmaceutical and/or medical devices firms, we anticipate that a larger pharmaceutical company will undertake to navigate the regulatory pathway, including conducting clinical trials, for a product such as Feldetrex™.

 
Employees
 
As of the date hereof, we do not have any employees other than our officers and directors. Our officers and directors will continue to work for us for the foreseeable future. We anticipate hiring appropriate personnel on an as-needed basis, and utilizing the services of independent contractors as needed.
