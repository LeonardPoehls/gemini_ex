Item 1.  Business
Overview
 ActiveCare, Inc. ("we," "us," "our," the "Company" or "ActiveCare") was formed March 5, 1998 as a wholly owned subsidiary of Track Group, Inc. (OTCQX: TRCK), then a Utah corporation, formerly known as SecureAlert, Inc. ("Track Group").  We were spun off from Track Group in February 2009.  Effective July 15, 2009, we changed our name to ActiveCare, Inc.  Our state of incorporation is Delaware. Our fiscal year ends on September 30.
 We own or have rights to trademarks, service marks or trade names that we use in connection with the operation of our business, including, without limitation, "CareCenter," "4G," "ActiveOne," "ActiveOne+," "ActiveHome," "ActiveCare" and the stylized "ActiveCare" logo.  Solely for convenience, some of the trademarks, service marks and trade names referred to in this report are listed without the ©, ® and ™ symbols, but we will assert, to the fullest extent under applicable law, our rights to our copyrights, trademarks, service marks, trade names and domain names. The trademarks, service marks and trade names of other companies appearing in this report are, to our knowledge, the property of their respective owners.
 Our focus is on the monitoring of individuals with diabetes. Diabetes is a pandemic that, as of 2014, affected approximately 9% of the U.S. population or 29 million Americans. Studies have shown that the annual cost of treating an individual with diabetes and the comorbidities associated with the disease is approximately $13,700 per year. This combination costs the U.S. health system up to $245 billion annually. The lack of regular glucose monitoring by diabetics is a major driver of diabetic related claims. It is estimated that as much as 80% of diabetics are non-compliant with their treatment plans, despite physician recommendations.
 We believe we offer a unique approach to caring for individuals with diabetes by adding a "human touch" and monitoring component to traditional disease management. We have created a "CareCenter" where our "CareSpecialists" reach out to engage members while monitoring their condition on a regular and real-time basis. Our personalized and active monitoring approach allows for issues to be addressed promptly, avoiding major and costly future health complications.
 The Problem: Diabetes and its Effect on Healthcare
 Diabetes is a condition in which the body does not properly process food for use as energy. Most of the food we eat is turned into glucose, or sugar, for our bodies to use as energy. In order to do so, our pancreas produces a hormone called insulin to help glucose be absorbed by the cells of our bodies. Diabetes results from the body not producing sufficient levels of insulin needed to convert sugar, starches and other food into energy needed for daily life. In some instances, the body does not respond appropriately to insulin, a condition called "insulin resistance," resulting in elevated blood glucose levels. With heightened glucose levels, the blood thickens becoming concentrated, almost "gel-like," causing the heart and other organs to work harder in order to pump and circulate the blood throughout the body.
 Diabetes can cause serious health complications including heart disease, blindness, kidney failure and lower extremity amputations. The National Diabetes Statistics Report for 2014, published by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention, estimates that 29.1 million people or 9.3% of the U.S. population is suffering from diabetes, comprised of 21 million diagnosed cases and 8.1 million undiagnosed cases. Diabetes is the seventh leading cause of death in the United States.

There are two types of diabetes:
 Type I Diabetes — Accounting for between 5% – 10% of all diagnosed cases of diabetes as reported by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, type I diabetes is a chronic disease that usually appears during childhood or the teenage years in which the pancreas does not produce insulin. For unknown reasons, the immune system of people with type I diabetes attacks various cells in the body, including the insulin-producing ones of the pancreas. As a result, the body has a total depletion of the insulin hormone. The body's process of converting sugar into energy is disrupted when insulin is not present. This disruption causes the build-up of sugar in the blood, leading to complications such as dehydration, weight loss and ultimately serious damage to the body. There is no cure for type I diabetes and it is not preventable.
 Type II Diabetes — Type II diabetes accounts for between 90% – 95% of all diagnosed cases of diabetes and differs from type I diabetes in that the body cannot use insulin properly, a condition called insulin resistance. At first, a patient's pancreas makes extra insulin to make up for it. Over time the pancreas is not able to keep up and cannot make enough insulin to keep blood glucose at normal levels. Type II diabetes can develop at any age, most commonly becoming apparent during adulthood. However, type II diabetes in children is rising.
 Whereas type I diabetes cannot be prevented, type II diabetes can be prevented or delayed with proper management. Proper management and control begins with adherence to treatment plans prescribed by medical providers. These plans are a combination of lifestyle changes, medication and regular testing (the American Diabetes Association recommends 3-4 tests per day). By testing at least 3 times per day, an individual with type II diabetes can learn how to control their chronic illness through proper food intake, weight control and exercise.
  If diabetics do not properly manage their disease, their blood will thicken. This causes the heart and other organs to work harder in order to pump and circulate blood and leads to the following comorbidities:
 

• | Blindness — diabetes is a leading cause of blindness. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• | Stroke — diabetics are 1.5 times as likely to have a stroke as compared to non-diabetics. 
• | Heart attack — diabetics are 1.8 times as likely to have a heart attack as compared to non-diabetics.
• | Kidney disease — diabetes is the leading cause of kidney failure. 
• | Amputation — diabetes is the leading cause of non-traumatic lower limb amputations. 

  A problem with diabetics' management of their disease is clearly evident: between 50-80% of those with diabetes remain non-compliant with their treatment plans. Traditional programs remain ineffective because they provide no real-time visibility to medical professionals. Vital readings and information into a patient's daily health and behaviors remain on the meter or testing devices and are often never shared or seen by a qualified medical professional.
 
With actionable and reliable information unavailable, healthcare professionals rely mainly on patients' self-reporting and their A1C (90 day blood glucose average) test results. While these data points provide some historic insight, they are unable to show the daily high and low blood glucose events. We believe that something different is needed to effect and change behavior.
 
Healthcare professionals lack data on their diabetic patient's daily health, there is no way to effectively monitor an individual's condition. Without active monitoring, there is no way to know if an individual requires attention before their situation becomes critical and requires medical intervention either through the emergency room or a patient hospital stay. In our estimation, current diabetes management programs lack the ability to share and transfer information in "real-time." This results in a reactionary approach that focuses and supports individuals after they have had a high cost claim and are considered high risk.

The ActiveCare Solution
 The ActiveCare solution is focused on getting diabetic patients to test and manage their chronic illness on a regular and real-time basis. ActiveCare provides its solution to self-insured companies ("SICs") through third party administrators ("TPAs") and a network of health insurance brokers. In accordance with HIPAA regulations, an SIC cannot administer its own health plan due to privacy regulation and an SIC must have an unaffiliated third party administer the healthcare plan. The members that directly engage with our CareCenter specialists (or CareSpecialists) are diabetic patients employed by these SICs.
 An ActiveCare member's introduction to our program begins his/her receipt of a state-of-the-art cellular glucometer and testing supplies. Our CareSpecialist will then walk the new member through how to use the new device and direct the member to register on a private and secure website that records all of the member's readings. From that point forward, the CareSpecialist establishes a personal working relationship with the diabetic member — encouraging testing; helping the member better understand their test results and how to respond to high or low readings — all on a real-time basis. It is this relationship that facilitates better health for our members, while ultimately saving the healthcare provider significant amounts in reduced claims.
 As part of these efforts, we have staffed our CareCenter with highly trained "CareSpecialists" that maintain consistent contact with our members helping them through the ups and downs of managing their glucose levels. For example, when test results exceed certain thresholds (e.g., glucose readings being too high or too low) or a certain amount of time has passed without testing, members receive a prompt call from a CareSpecialist who will triage the member and, if necessary, contact emergency personnel. This "live" and timely intervention provides the platform of insight for members to modify their behavior while reinforcing goals to better manage their disease. Based on our internal data, we believe that each CareSpecialist can handle approximately 2,000 active diabetic members and make 300 outbound calls per week, as well as respond to emergency calls when readings are out of stated parameters. With real-time data, the CareSpecialists provide proactive support and encouragement to members before they become high risk. Our approach is designed to improve the health and wellness of members while also lowering the overall costs of medical care paid by their employers.
 Our CareCenter is centrally located at our headquarters in Orem, Utah and can monitor diabetics throughout the United States. Our CareCenter location is also an ideal location for locating and training our CareSpecialists as it is within a five mile radius of some of the top universities with access to over 70,000 graduating students to draw from as CareSpecialists. If we desire to expand our service offerings in other countries, we would set up additional CareCenters in such regions as needed, in order to meet the appropriate dialect, customs and regulations required to support the end member.
 Training of our CareSpecialists
 CareSpecialists receive extensive initial and on-going training comparable to the training received by 911 emergency dispatchers (National Academy of Emergency Dispatchers). Upon being hired, a CareSpecialist goes through a two week course, in which they have classroom training on the ActiveCare solution; what diabetes is; corporate culture, opportunities within the Company; meeting Company personnel; how to on-board members and how to handle compliance calls and alert calls. This classroom training takes place for the first week, with half of each day dedicated to the classroom, and the remaining half day shadowing a team lead. The second week trainees perform calls while a team leader is there to assist and intervene if needed. During the following 90 days, the new hire is on probation and their phone calls are heavily audited, a review of attendance, production and behavior is analyzed and 911 certification is obtained. Further training continues throughout the employment of a CareSpecialist which includes but is not limited to the following:



• | How to coach and handle diabetics. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------
 | - | Proper diet 
 | - | Proper testing 
 | - | Managing the disease, including various motivating techniques to change the patient's behavior
 | - | Communicating with doctors and nurses. 
• | Emergency Medical Dispatch training. 
 | - | Instructions in life-threatening situations. 
 | - | Certified through the National Academy of Emergency Dispatch. 
• | Software training in helping diabetics understand their charts and goals.

Strategy and Results
 The ActiveCare solution brings forth a strategy that utilizes real-time information to immediately improve a patient's outcome. With real-time data, the CareSpecialists provide proactive support and encouragement to members before they become high risk. To this end, we provide documentation of progress of individuals or populations over time. In the form of regular reports, members, employers, disease management providers and channel partners are provided relevant data detailing the progress of any group, sub-group, or individual in the ActiveCare program.
 The outcomes of the ActiveCare approach have been significant. Based on our internal data, testing trends for ActiveCare members show that the more frequently a member tests, the blood sugar can be better managed and kept within a normal range. Without testing, there is no way for a member with diabetes to monitor and control their condition. Regular testing allows members to better monitor and modify behaviors to improve their health. The American Diabetes Association has advocated for years that the best way to control diabetes is by testing at least three times per day.
 A peer-reviewed study funded by ActiveCare (the "ActiveCare Study") documented the efficacy of the ActiveCare program and was published in the January 2014 edition of US Endocrinology. The ActiveCare Study began with half of program participants actively engaged in the program as the study group, and those choosing not to participate as the control group. In a year-over-year comparison, the diabetics who did not actively engage in the ActiveCare diabetes management program saw an average increase in medical costs of $282 per person which we believe is directly correlated to costs associated with complications that may have been avoided through proper testing. The diabetics in the study group who regularly tested their blood sugar levels and actively participated in our diabetes program showed a year-over-year reduction of medical costs of $3,384. We believe that these results suggest that through ActiveCare's engagement programs, including but not limited to incentives and points systems (as described below) combined with comprehensive real time monitoring, result in healthier patients and lower overall costs of care.
 Competitive Advantages/Operational Strengths
 Unique Solution
 The challenge facing the healthcare system is not whether to implement proper glucose monitoring and control, but rather how to motivate people with diabetes to monitor their glucose levels to improve their lives. In order to address this challenge, information indicating who is actually testing or not testing and who has readings that are outside of acceptable parameters is needed. Outside of our approach, we are not aware of any companies providing a service utilizing real-time information to help patients manage diabetes, reduce future medical costs and ultimately provide the information needed to address the challenge of ensuring individuals continue to properly test themselves.
 Real-Time Visibility
 Without the availability of actionable and reliable information, healthcare professionals have typically relied on a diabetic's A1C (90-day blood glucose average) test results. While AIC test results provide some historic insight, these reports do not to show daily high and low blood glucose levels. We believe that our solution, with its emphasis on consistent communications with patients and real time monitoring is preferable to reliance on AIC test results. Our state-of-the-art cellular glucometer and testing supplies allow for test results to automatically be sent wirelessly to ActiveCare immediately following each test. The only thing a member of our service needs to do is test themselves and our CareSpecialists maintain regular contact to provide advice, answer questions and to engage emergency personnel if needed. ActiveCare provides caregivers, physicians, disease management, and wellness coordinators with real-time visibility into a member's health.

Proactive Approach of our CareCenter
 We believe that our 24/7 Care Center sets us apart from all other diabetes management programs. Historically, diabetics would be contacted by disease management personnel only after incurring high medical costs and being classified as high risk. This method is reactionary and does nothing to prevent diabetics from becoming high risk in the first place. With real-time data, the CareCenter provides proactive support and encouragement to our members before they become high risk. In addition, this "live" and timely intervention provides the platform of insight for members to modify their behavior while reinforcing goals to better manage their disease.
 Engagement Strategy and Reward Program
 The entire experience of how CareSpecialists interact with members has been retooled and refocused on increasing engagement. This engagement strategy is designed to foster increased testing through positive reinforcement involving an on-going testing rewards program, regular educational events and increased coordination with the group's clinical team. Our rewards program is designed to incentivize members to test more often through monetary reward. Similar to other rewards programs from credit cards or airlines, members will earn points for each test they take, which accumulates in the members' rewards account over the course of the year. Members can redeem the points through a rewards catalog within their account. This innovative program transforms testing into an exciting and fun activity and has the effect of significantly increasing the incidence of testing.
Management Team and Key Personnel Experience
 Our management team and key personnel have significant technical and entrepreneurial experience, with over 20 years of experience in the remote monitoring industry.
 We believe our unique approach of combining monitoring technology with a human service touch will create a paradigm shift to increase testing and improve the health of those living with diabetes.
Growth Strategy
 Increase Marketing and Sales Force
 We market our products and services through a channel partner approach by establishing relationships with insurance companies, disease management companies, third-party administrators ("TPAs") and self-insured companies ("SICs"). TPAs administer the claims, payments, co-pays, and medical coding for SICs and effectively act as the medical benefits administrators for their customers, who typically are not large enough to justify a fully operational in-house department. Disease management companies are hired by insurance companies and SICs to actively engage with members and employees with the goal that more interaction will reduce significant health care claims. Through TPAs and broker networks, we have serviced over 26,000 individuals with diabetes from over 800 SICs.
 As our Company continues to evolve, we will seek to expand our channel partner strategy with the goal of increasing revenues. The expansion of existing SICs secured through this model provides us with a high volume of members to accomplish these goals. In addition to this channel partner strategy, we also anticipate initiating in the near future a direct sales model. In this model, we anticipate that sales executives with existing relationships and a regional market presence will call directly on large SICs (with over 2,000 employees). This direct sales model will allow the ActiveCare value proposition to be promoted directly by the sales executive to SICs and will provide direct insight to the Company's executives on the progress of the sale.

Increase Testing and Membership
 The key to the ActiveCare strategy is member engagement. When ActiveCare brings on a new client, the number of members of that client with diabetes who are testing is usually around 18%. Currently with ActiveCare's engagement strategy, that figure typically more than doubles to 40%. Part of the ActiveCare strategy is to increase that percentage to 60% through various incentive programs that will also increase daily testing to three times per day.
  These programs are coordinated with our customers (SICs) and include the following:
 

• | Financial rewards to member for their initial adoption 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------
• | Financial rewards for testing multiple times per day 
• | Onsite events to help train and educate members 
• | Mailers, emails and videos that motivate and educate the member

  We expect this engagement to not only increase the health of the diabetic population that uses the testing and monitoring services provided by our CareCenters, but also to increase our revenues and gross profits in a significant manner. This increase is achieved by increasing members testing behavior and the sales of test strips. Members are resupplied test strips on an as-needed basis as they test. As ActiveCare facilitates members to test more frequently, its revenues should increase on the increased sales of test strips alone. More importantly, increased monitoring is expected to result in our diabetic customers statistically having lower claims. This aligns ActiveCare's increased sales goals with that of the healthcare provider who has a significant interest in improving the health of its members thereby reducing the attendant medical costs.
 Data Mining
 The CareCenter is the real-time recipient of all test results which are delivered using the cellular glucometers that we provide to members. In addition to the real-time monitoring performed by our CareSpecialists, we also have in-house statisticians who analyze the test results data and provide written reports to our clients. This information is gathered, sorted and analyzed by ActiveCare, which in turn produces reports to the given groups (SICs, TPAs or Disease Management personnel). With this information, disease management personnel are offered real time visibility into the daily health of the members they are treating. The ultimate objective is to increase the percentage of diabetics who are regularly testing, which has been proven to be a major factor in reducing the cost of claims based on statistical data derived from the ActiveCare Study.
Technological Innovation/Product Development
 Hardware
  ActiveCare currently purchases all of it glucometers from a third-party vendor and provides these glucometers to its members at no cost upon their enrollment in our program. However, ActiveCare is in the process of building its own proprietary glucometer with custom designed functions that we believe will increase member engagement and CareCenter interaction. To that end, we have engaged with a third-party manufacturer with specific expertise in manufacturing and applying for FDA approval of glucometers.
  6
 
 Our proprietary glucometer is contemplated to have the following new functionalities:
 

• | Voice communication through the glucometer. At the touch of a button the diabetic can be in instant contact with ActiveCare's CareCenter where he/she can be coached on how to manage his/her diabetic problems
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• | Touch screen technology which will simplify the diabetic's usage of the glucometer. 
• | Built-in reminders that alert the diabetic member that it is time to test. 

  In addition, since over 57% of all diabetics suffer from complications and other chronic conditions caused by diabetes such as heart disease, congestive heart failure and obesity, our growth strategy specifically contemplates that our glucometer will be equipped with technology allowing other chronic conditions to be monitored by us. This would include the monitoring of blood pressure, blood oxygen levels, weight and heart rate measurements. This will allow us to further improve the health of our members and has the potential to broaden ActiveCare's revenue base from our existing members.
 Software
 For the past four years, our R&D/IT expenditures were focused on developing a secured web based platform that allow our members, SICs, TPAs and disease management specialists the best experience possible in managing diabetes. In order to further develop these tools given the highly sensitive environment of cybersecurity surrounding HIPAA, we have continued to develop our own proprietary software solutions in which we are able to identify diabetics, produce statistical reports, and most importantly, continually improve the portal in which our members, SICs, TPAs, and others can set up their own alerting parameters to help the member succeed in their goals they have set with their doctor or disease management personnel. It is when a member is able to connect with others, and garner their support that life-changing actions can occur. We believe that our software and personnel facilitate these changes.
 Chronic Illness Monitoring of other diseases
 We plan to invest in research and development and patent filings, as we broaden the services we offer. We will continue to look for ways to provide solutions for other chronic illness and disease states markets. Our ultimate objective is to become a chronic illness monitoring company measuring not only blood sugar for diabetics, but also blood pressure, weight, and blood oxygen levels. Once we have proven our full turn-key solution within the diabetes disease market, we believe that our clients will want to engage our services to monitor other chronic diseases. We have found that the human touch factor, coupled with innovating technologies, allows us to connect with our members and provide them the support and coaching they need to understand the disease which they have, and how to live a healthy life. Roughly one in every four Americans suffers from a chronic illness like diabetes. Approximately 84 million people in this country suffer from some form of cardiovascular disease. One in every three adults suffers from high blood pressure. Nearly 3.7 million people per year are admitted to the hospital with heart disease. Since we already provide our diabetes monitoring services to over 800 SICs, expanding the Company's monitoring capabilities to other chronic illnesses is a logical extension of building out our business and increasing revenues.
 Material Customers
  ActiveCare has two significant clients that accounted for 64% of our total revenues for our 2016 fiscal year as follows:
 

• | Office of Group Benefits (OGB), State of Louisiana — OGB accounted for 42% of 2015 revenues and 39% of 2016 revenues. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• | Key Benefits — Key Benefits accounted for 15% of 2015 revenues. 
• | Rx Benefits — Rx Benefits accounted for 12% of 2015 revenues and 25% of 2016 revenues, however, over the past six months, Rx Benefits' percentage of revenues has declined to under 15% and we anticipate revenues from Rx Benefits will fall below 5% of revenues in the future.

Research and Development
 Technology to facilitate data-driven chronic illness monitoring consists of three components: (1) biometric monitoring products and supplies, (2) medical and claims data aggregation, and (3) algorithms for the analysis of the data.
 Biometric monitoring products and supplies are provided by numerous medical hardware providers and deliver a wide range of features and functionality. ActiveCare is agnostic to any specific device requirement, and has the ability to integrate and capture data from any 510(k) or HL7 compliant monitoring device. See "Regulatory Matters."
 We are currently in the process of building our own proprietary glucometer with custom designed functions that we believe will strengthen member engagement and CareCenter interaction. As mentioned above, our proprietary glucometer is expected to incorporate an easy to use touch screen interface, voice communication technology, testing notifications and reminders, as well the technology to sync with other future devices and analyze data related to other chronic conditions.
 During fiscal year 2016, we spent approximately $248,000, compared to $107,000 in fiscal year 2015, on research and development related to chronic illness monitoring. In addition to costs incurred in connection with our proposed and proprietary glucometer, the research and development program focused on ongoing improvements to methods and systems for the capture and analysis of data, as well as scalable architectures to migrate to production applications and deployments during fiscal year 2015 that were developed during fiscal years 2013 and 2012.
 Sales and Marketing
 We currently service over 800 SICs through relationships with TPAs, our health insurance broker network, disease management companies and others. We market directly to TPAs and healthcare brokers through participation in healthcare fairs and events as well as through direct contact with our staff and direct mailings of our marketing materials. We plan to continue to mine our existing network of SICs for members as we further prove out our business model and the efficacy of our programs.
 
Additionally, we are looking to deploy, upon consummation of a contemplated public offering of our securities in early 2017 (the "Offering"), a direct sales model to market directly to SICs. We anticipate that sales executives with existing relationships and a regional market presence will call directly on large SICs (with over 2,000 employees), which will effectively decrease our reliance on our relationship with TPAs and other third parties. Increasing our salesforce personnel will enable us to have a greater localized presence in the given geographic regions.

Competition
  Over the past decade, technology device manufacturers have rushed to provide peripheral devices to capture data related to chronic health conditions rather than provide any assessment or intelligence regarding the data being captured. In most cases the data captured remains static on the peripheral device or data capture system, providing little to no perspective on the current and recent condition of the patient. In cases in which the data is utilized, the application of that data is typically limited to the "point of care" or physician's office. The ActiveCare solution is a complex combination of components that provide an overall care system. ActiveCare's combination of state-of-the-art technology including a cellular glucometer that sends test results to ActiveCare in real-time, along with its 24/7 CareCenter and engagement programs, provides a comprehensive and unique solution in the market. This real-time information allows ActiveCare's 24/7 CareCenter to reach out to members moments after a dangerous reading. We believe that this real-time intervention along with ActiveCare's proactive approach to engagement sets ActiveCare apart in the industry.
  Our primary competitors are:
 

• | Livongo — Relatively new to the market, Livongo provides a cellular glucometer that reports to an online record. Generally, the focus of Livongo is with small pilot groups, in which it captures the members' data who were already previously managing their disease. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• | GenesisHealth Technologies — Focused solely on the technology, GenesisHealth Technologies ("Gensis") provides a cellular meter that sends results to an online record. Similar to traditional solutions focused solely on supplies, we do not believe that Genesis provides any solutions to increase engagement (i.e., get members testing) and therefore improve the health of members necessary to significantly reduce medical claims.
• | Telcare — Similar to GenesisHealth, Telcare is focused solely on the technology, in which they provide a cellular meter that sends results to an online record. Similar to traditional solutions focused solely on supplies, we do not believe that Telecare provides any solutions to increase engagement and therefore improve the health of members necessary to significantly reduce medical claims.

Regulatory Matters
 The testing, manufacture, distribution, advertising and marketing of medical devices in the United States is subject to extensive regulation by federal, state and local governmental authorities, including the Food & Drug Administration ("FDA"). Certain of our products may be subject to and required to receive regulatory clearances or approvals, as the case may be, before we may market them. Under United States law, a medical device is an article, which, among other things, is intended for use in the diagnosis of disease or other conditions, or in the cure, mitigation, treatment or prevention of disease, in man or other animals (see Food, Drug & Cosmetic Act (the "Act") § 201(h)).
 Devices are subject to varying levels of regulatory control, the most comprehensive of which requires that a clinical evaluation be conducted before a device receives clearance or approval for commercial distribution. The FDA classifies medical devices into one of three classes. Class I devices are relatively simple and can be manufactured and distributed with general controls. Class II devices are somewhat more complex and require greater scrutiny. Class III devices are new and frequently help sustain life. Examples of the varying levels of regulatory control are described in the following paragraphs.
 In the United States, a company generally can obtain permission to distribute a new device in two ways — through a Section 510(k) premarket notification application ("510(k) submission"), or through a Section 515 premarket approval ("PMA") application. The 510(k) submission applies to any device that is substantially equivalent to a "Predicate Device" (a device first marketed prior to May 28, 1976 or a device marketed after that date which was substantially equivalent to a pre-May 28, 1976 device). These devices are either Class I or Class II devices. Under the 510(k) submission process, the FDA will issue an order finding substantial equivalence to a Predicate Device and permitting commercial distribution of that device for its intended use. A 510(k) submission must provide information supporting its claim of substantial equivalence to the Predicate Device. The FDA permits certain low risk medical devices to be marketed without requiring the manufacturer to submit a premarket notification. In other instances, the FDA may not only require that a premarket notification be submitted, but also that such notification be accompanied by clinical data. If clinical data from human experiences are required to support the 510(k) submission, these data must be gathered in compliance with Integral Device Exemption ("IDE") regulations for clinical trials performed in the United States. The FDA review process for premarket notifications submitted pursuant to section 510(k) should take about 90 days on average, but it can take substantially longer if the FDA has concerns. Furthermore, there is no guarantee that the FDA will "clear" the device for marketing, in which case the device cannot be distributed in the United States. There is no guarantee that the FDA will deem the device subject to the 510(k) process, as opposed to the more time-consuming, resource intensive and problematic process described below.

We do not currently manufacture our own chronic disease monitoring devices. We are currently working with a third party to manufacture our own proprietary cellular glucometer and strips. Manufacturers of medical devices are required to register with the FDA before they begin to manufacture devices for commercial distribution. As a result, any entity that manufactures products on our behalf will be subject to periodic inspection by the FDA for compliance with the FDA's Quality System Regulation ("QSR") requirements and other regulations. These regulations require us and our manufacturers to manufacture products and maintain documents in a prescribed manner with respect to design, manufacturing, testing and control activities. Further, we are required to comply with various FDA and other agency requirements for labeling and promotion. The Medical Device Reporting regulations require that we provide information to the FDA whenever there is evidence to reasonably suggest that a device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or, if a malfunction were to occur, could cause or contribute to a death or serious injury. In addition, the FDA prohibits us from promoting a medical device for unapproved indications.
 In the United States, Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act ("HIPAA") regulations require national standards for some types of electronic health information transactions and the data elements used in those transactions, security standards to ensure the integrity and confidentiality of health information and standards to protect the privacy of individually identifiable health information. Covered entities under HIPAA, which include health care organizations such as our clients, our employer clinic business model and our claims processing, transmission and submission services, are required to comply with the privacy standards, the transaction regulations and the security regulations. As a business associate of our clients who are covered entities, we are generally required by contract to comply with the HIPAA regulations as they pertain to handling of covered client data. However, the extension of these HIPAA obligations to business associates by law has created additional liability risks related to the privacy and security of individually identifiable health information.
 In the United States, the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, Public Law 104-191 (the "HIPAA Statute"), and its related "Privacy Rules" (45 C.F.R. Part 164 Subparts A and E) and "Security Rules" (45 C.F.R. Part 164 Subpart C) and "Breach Notification Rules" (45 C.F.R. Part 164 Subpart D) as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (the "HITECH Statute") and any regulations promulgated thereunder (collectively, "HIPAA"), impose minimum requirements for the confidentiality, integrity and availability of individuals' health information under certain conditions. Briefly, HIPAA requires "Covered Entities" as defined under HIPAA to comply with all applicable HIPAA requirements.
 HIPAA also requires "Business Associates" to comply with the Security Rules as well as any additional specific obligations under HIPAA depending upon the services provided to "Covered Entities". As a "Business Associate" of our clients who are "Covered Entities", we are required to comply with the Security Rules in connection with our clients' "Protected Health Information" or "PHI" as such terms are defined under HIPAA. Our obligations under the Security Rules and other applicable provisions of HIPAA are also imposed pursuant to contract with our "Covered Entity" clients. Such obligations under the Security Rules, other applicable requirements under HIPAA as well as contracts with "Covered Entity" clients (or with clients who are "Business Associates" where we would be deemed to be a "Subcontractor" under HIPAA) create liability risks for failure to abide by maintaining the confidentiality, integrity and availability of "PHI" in accordance with HIPAA and the contracts with "Covered Entity" (and "Business Associate") clients.
 Employees
