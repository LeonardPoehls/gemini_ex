Business Overview 
 We are a biotechnology company focused on precision medicine in oncology. Our goal is not just to shrink tumors, but to eradicate residual disease  the source of cancer relapse and recurrence  in precisely defined patient populations. We are pursuing an integrated therapeutic, or Rx, and companion diagnostic, or Dx, strategy for treating cancer patients. Our Rx efforts are focused on in-licensing or acquiring, then developing and commercializing molecularly targeted therapies that, sequentially or in combination, are foundational for eradicating residual disease. Our Dx efforts aim to pair these product candidates with biomarker-based companion diagnostics that are designed to precisely identify, at the molecular level, the patients who are most likely to benefit from the therapies we develop. 
 Our current pipeline includes the following compounds: 
 

 | entrectinib, formerly called RXDX-101, an orally bioavailable, CNS-active, small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor directed to the TRK (tropomyosin receptor kinase) family tyrosine kinase receptors (TRKA, TRKB and TRKC), ROS1 and ALK (anaplastic lymphoma kinase) proteins, which is in a Phase 2 clinical study, two Phase 1 clinical studies in molecularly defined adult patient populations for the treatment of solid tumors, and a Phase 1/1b clinical study in pediatric patients with advanced solid tumor malignancies;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | RXDX-105, an orally bioavailable, vascular endothelial growth factor receptor, or VEGFR, -sparing, small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor of RET, that has achieved clinical proof-of-concept and is in an ongoing Phase 1b clinical trial;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | taladegib, an orally bioavailable, small molecule hedgehog/smoothened antagonist that has achieved clinical proof-of-concept and a recommended Phase 2 dose in a Phase 1 dose escalation trial; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | RXDX-106, a pseudo-irreversible, small molecule inhibitor of TYRO3, AXL and MER, or collectively TAM, and c-MET that is in late preclinical development.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 A kinase is an enzyme that catalyzes the transfer of phosphate groups from high-energy, phosphate-donating molecules to specific other molecules, called substrates. Tyrosine kinases transfer phosphate groups from adenosine triphosphate to cellular proteins and can function as an on/off switch for cellular functions, including cancer signaling. Cell division is partly driven by protein kinases that regulate progression through the various phases of the cell division cycle. 
 We acquired exclusive global development and commercialization rights to entrectinib under a license agreement with Nerviano Medical Sciences S.r.l., or NMS, that became effective in November 2013; we acquired our RXDX-105 and RXDX-106 development programs in an asset purchase transaction with Cephalon, Inc., an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd., or Teva, in March 2015; and we acquired exclusive, global development and commercialization rights to taladegib under a license agreement with Eli Lilly and Company, or Lilly, in November 2015. 
 In May 2016, we determined to prioritize our resources and development efforts on our lead product candidate, entrectinib. In connection with this, we determined to discontinue our Spark discovery-stage program and are in discussions with Lilly regarding the optimal path forward for taladegib in the context of our pipeline priorities. In connection with these discussions Lilly has indicated that it believes that we may not have satisfied certain of our obligations to Lilly under the license agreement, but Lilly has also indicated an interest in achieving an amicable resolution with respect to this issue and the parties are continuing discussions consistent with this desire. We also have rights to RXDX-107, a new chemical entity comprising an alkyl ester of bendamustine encapsulated in human serum albumin, or HSA, to form nanoparticles; and topical taladegib, a development program for the potential treatment of patients with superficial and nodular basal cell carcinoma. In February 2016, we announced that we had ceased all development activities relating to this program. 
 Our ability to identify innovative cancer targets and develop drugs against them is enabled by, and dependent on, a set of essential capabilities and the experience of our management team. The members of our team have significant experience in medicinal chemistry, lead optimization, ADME & PK (the study of absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and pharmacokinetics), preclinical development and clinical development, and have collectively led or contributed to the development of multiple drugs approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or the FDA, including several cancer therapeutics. In addition, we have a laboratory accredited by the College of American Pathologists, or CAP, and certified under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988, or CLIA, and our Trailblaze Pharos assay has been granted an investigational device exemption (IDE) by the FDA. Our personnel use their expertise and our laboratory facilities with the goal of developing biomarker-based molecular assays to precisely define the patient populations in which we would test our product candidates, screen patients for enrollment in our clinical trials and potentially perform commercial companion diagnostic testing should any of our product candidates and the associated companion diagnostic obtain marketing approval.

Cancer Background 
 Cancer is a heterogeneous group of diseases characterized by uncontrolled cell division and growth. Cancerous cells that arise in the lymphatic system and bone marrow are referred to as hematological tumors. Cancer cells that arise in other tissues or organs are referred to as solid tumors. Researchers believe that exposure to chemical agents, viruses and various forms of radiation can cause genetic alterations that lead to cancer. Genetic predisposition also can increase the risk of cancer in some people. Epigenetic factors are also increasingly believed to contribute to development of cancer. 
 Cancer is the second leading cause of death in the United States, exceeded only by heart disease. The American Cancer Society, or ACS, estimates that, in 2017, there will be approximately 1.69 million new cases of cancer and approximately 601,000 deaths from cancer in the United States. The World Health Organization estimated that 8.8 million people worldwide died of cancer in 2015. According to ACS data, breast, lung, prostate and colorectal cancer are the most prevalent cancers in the United States. 
 The most common methods of treating patients with cancer are surgery, radiation and drug therapy. A cancer patient often receives treatment with a combination of these methods. Surgery and radiation therapy are particularly effective when the disease is localized. Physicians generally use drug therapy when the cancer has spread beyond the primary site or cannot otherwise be treated through surgery. The goal of drug therapy is to damage and kill cancer cells or to interfere with the molecular and cellular processes that control the development, growth and survival of cancer cells. In many cases, drug therapy entails the administration of several different drugs in combination. Over the past several decades, drug therapy has been evolving from non-specific drugs that kill both healthy and cancerous cells, to drugs that target specific molecular pathways or activating alterations involved in cancer and drugs that activate the bodys immune system to destroy cancer cells. 
 Cytotoxic Chemotherapies. The earliest approach to pharmacological cancer treatment was to develop drugs referred to as cytotoxic drugs that kill rapidly proliferating cancer cells through non-specific mechanisms, such as deterring cell metabolism or causing damage to cellular components required for survival and rapid growth. While these drugs have been effective in the treatment of some cancers, many unmet medical needs for the treatment of cancer remain. Also, cytotoxic drug therapies act in an indiscriminate manner, killing healthy, as well as cancerous, cells. Due to their mechanism of action, many cytotoxic drugs have a narrow dose range above which the toxicity causes unacceptable or even fatal levels of damage to healthy cells and below which the drugs are not effective in eradicating cancer cells. 
 Targeted Therapies. The next approach to pharmacological cancer treatment was to develop drugs, referred to as targeted therapeutics, that target specific biological molecules in the human body that play a role in rapid cell growth and the spread of cancer. Targeted therapeutics are designed to preferentially kill cancer cells and spare normal cells, to improve efficacy and minimize side effects. The drugs are designed to attack either a target that causes uncontrolled growth of cancer cells or a target on which cancer cells are more dependent for their growth than normal cells. These drugs focus on eradicating processes that help the cancer cell survive. These drugs also affect oncogenes, which are the drivers or cause of the cancer itself. 
 Immunotherapies. Cancer cells contain mutated proteins and may overexpress other proteins normally found in the body at low levels. The immune system typically recognizes expression of these proteins, or antigens, and eliminates these cells in a highly efficient process known as immune surveillance. Cancer cells ability to evade immune surveillance is a key factor in their growth, spread, and persistence. There has been substantial scientific progress in countering these evasion mechanisms using therapies that activate the immune system to destroy tumor cells. 
Strategy 
 We are a biotechnology company focused on precision medicine in oncology. Our goal is not just to shrink tumors, but to eradicate residual disease  the source of cancer relapse and recurrence  in precisely defined patient populations through the application of our integrated Rx/Dx approach. Our Rx efforts are focused on in-licensing or acquiring, then developing and commercializing molecularly targeted therapies that, sequentially or in combination, are foundational for eradicating residual disease. Our Dx efforts aim to pair these product candidates with biomarker-based companion diagnostics that are designed to precisely identify, at the molecular level, the patients who are most likely to benefit from the therapies we develop. Key elements of our strategy are to: 

 | Employ efficient and flexible approaches to accelerate clinical development. The members of our development leadership team have diverse experience working in resource-constrained environments and have a successful history of identification, translation, development and regulatory approval of oncology products. These experiences provide our team with the knowledge to develop novel product candidates, and the ability to do so in a flexible and capital-efficient fashion. We plan to pursue indications and select specific patient populations in which activity of our product candidates can be assessed in small proof-of-concept clinical trials that may lead to accelerated clinical development. When designing clinical trials, we seek to test multiple clinical hypotheses in a single trial that can be accelerated once a signal of clinical benefit is observed. This approach may increase the likelihood of seeing results early in clinical trials with fewer patients, reducing our clinical development risk and development costs, and allowing us to potentially accelerate the development of our product pipeline.

 | Test our product candidates in the patients who we believe are most likely to derive benefit. We plan to use biomarkers both to identify the drug targets that we wish to pursue, and to precisely define the patient populations in which we would test those product candidates. If our product candidates demonstrate a therapeutic benefit in those specific molecularly defined patients, then, provided that we are able to complete appropriate clinical trials and obtain regulatory approvals for those product candidates, we intend to use biomarkers to inform physicians which patients are strong candidates to be prescribed the applicable drugs.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | In-license development candidates that meet our strict criteria. In seeking to expand our pipeline from time to time, we intend to impose strict criteria in order to focus on product candidates that we believe are differentiated from existing cancer therapeutics and that have well-defined, and potentially expeditious, clinical and regulatory pathways. Our criteria for selecting therapeutic product candidates for in-license or acquisition include consideration of the potential for the therapeutic to have first-in-class or best-in-class potential, and for diagnostics or specific clinical criteria that we believe would allow us to enrich our clinical study population with cancer patients who are more likely to respond to the compound.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Develop, or pursue relationships with third parties to develop, companion diagnostics to assist in identifying appropriate patients for any product candidates that we successfully commercialize. We believe that the availability of high quality companion diagnostics to help administer therapeutics to the most appropriate patients is essential. It is also important to incorporate biomarkers that we discover and utilize into a platform that can be used by regulators, physicians, payors and, most importantly, patients themselves. A companion diagnostic is a test or measurement that evaluates the presence of biomarkers in a patient, which provides information that can then assist physicians in selecting the specific drugs or treatments that may be most effective for that patient. We believe that any companion diagnostics that we develop through our laboratory facilities and related personnel, or that third parties develop through relationships with us, could be used to select patients for late stage clinical testing, to inform regulators precisely which patients should be indicated for access to the therapeutics, to advise physicians and patients which individuals are good candidates for treatment with the therapeutics, and to guide payors as to the value the therapeutics provide to well-defined patients and the circumstances under which the therapeutics should be reimbursed.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Potentially leverage partnerships to develop our product candidates. We may collaborate with third parties and partner certain rights to our product candidates as a means to accelerate their broader clinical development and maximize their therapeutic and market potential. In any such collaboration, we would likely seek to retain certain key development and commercialization rights to our product candidates as a means of retaining strategic flexibility to enable us to maximize shareholder value.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Pipeline 
 Consistent with our strategy, we are seeking to develop our product candidates for precise biomarker-defined patient groups. Our product candidates are at various stages of development, and we anticipate that it will be several years before any of our product candidates could be commercialized. 
Entrectinib 
 Entrectinib is a new chemical entity that we in-licensed from NMS. Entrectinib is an orally available, CNS-active, selective tyrosine kinase inhibitor of the TRK family tyrosine kinase receptors (TRKA, TRKB and TRKC), ROS1 and ALK proteins. Entrectinib is designed as a targeted therapeutic candidate to treat patients with cancers that harbor activating alterations to NTRK1 (encoding TRKA), NTRK2 (encoding TRKB), NTRK3 (encoding TRKC), ROS1 (encoding ROS1) or ALK (encoding ALK). NTRK1, NTRK2, and NTRK3 may be collectively referred to as NTRK. TRKA, TRKB, and TRKC may be collectively referred to as TRK. 
 Rationale for Targeting TRKA, TRKB, TRKC, ROS1 and ALK 
 About TRK. The TRK family of tyrosine kinase receptors, which includes TRKA, TRKB and TRKC, are activated by neurotrophins, a family of nerve growth factors. The TRK family members play a key role in normal embryonic central neuronal cell development and differentiation and normal adult peripheral neuronal cell development and differentiation. Deregulated kinase activities of TRK family members occur due to gene rearrangements and translocations, mutations, overexpression and alternative splicing and are associated with a number of human neuronal and non-neuronal cancers. 
 About ROS1. ROS1 belongs to the insulin-receptor superfamily. Like other tyrosine kinase receptor molecules, it plays a role in relaying growth signals from the environment outside the cell into the cells nucleus. ROS1 is one of two orphan receptor tyrosine kinase family members with no known binding ligand. Molecular rearrangements of ROS1 create fusion proteins with constitutively active kinase domains that activate downstream signaling pathways, which lead to oncogenic properties in cells, including uncontrolled proliferation and resistance to cell death with increased tumor cell survival. 
 
5 
 
About ALK. ALK also belongs to the insulin-receptor superfamily and is related to ROS1. Aberrant ALK fusion proteins spontaneously form molecular structures that lead to self-activation and constitutive activity within cancer cells, via activation of signal transduction pathways and intracellular kinases that drive uncontrolled tumor cell growth, metabolism and survival. 
 Incidence of NTRK1, NTRK2, NTRK3, ROS1 and ALK Alterations; Opportunity for Entrectinib 
 Research to date indicates that NTRK, ROS1 and ALK gene rearrangements and fusion proteins are most prevalent in solid tumors. Each of these genes also appears to be overexpressed in a portion of certain tumor types, though the importance of overexpression of these genes in cancer biology is not currently well understood. 
 

 | NTRK1, NTRK2 and NTRK3 appear to be rearranged across a range of tumor types, including non-small cell lung cancer, colorectal adenocarcinoma, salivary gland cancer, sarcoma, glioblastoma, astrocytoma, melanoma, papillary thyroid carcinoma cancer, breast cancer and cholangiocarcinoma, among other tumor types.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | ROS1 appears to be rearranged across a range of tumor types, including non-small cell lung adenocarcinoma, colorectal adenocarcinoma, cholangiocarcinoma, sarcoma, glioblastoma, and melanoma, among other tumor types.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | ALK appears to be rearranged across a range of tumor types, including non-small cell lung adenocarcinoma, colorectal adenocarcinoma, cholangiocarcinoma, sarcoma, and papillary thyroid carcinoma, among other tumor types.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The potential ability of entrectinib to act as a potent inhibitor of the TRKA, TRKB, TRKC, ROS1 and ALK proteins, as well as its observed ability to be administered orally and reach systemic circulation, known as oral bioavailability, attracted us to the profile of this product candidate and support the market opportunity for the product. 
 Phase 1 Clinical Trials 
 NMS initiated a Phase 1 clinical trial in patients with solid tumors that are positive for alterations in TRKA, ROS1 or ALK. We assumed control of this trial, called the ALKA-372-001 trial, from NMS in early 2014. This open label trial is currently ongoing at two clinical sites in Italy. 
 In the initial two dosing schedules, patients received entrectinib for four consecutive days followed by three days without dosing. In the first such intermittent dosing schedule, patients received entrectinib in the fasted state for the first three weeks of each 28-day dosing cycle, with no dosing during the fourth week. In the second intermittent dosing schedule, patients received entrectinib in the fed state four days-on/three days-off without interruption. We are no longer enrolling patients using either intermittent dosing schedule. We are instead enrolling patients in a continuous dosing schedule, in which subjects are dosed once-daily in a fed state for each day of every 28-day dosing cycle. 
 In July 2014, we initiated a global Phase 1 clinical trial of entrectinib called STARTRK-1, which is the first of the Studies of Tumor Alterations Responsive to Targeting Receptor Kinases. This trial is a multicenter, single-arm, open-label clinical trial of oral entrectinib in adult patients with locally advanced or metastatic cancer confirmed to be positive for alterations to NTRK, ROS1 or ALK. In this trial subjects are dosed once-daily in the fed state on each day of every 28-day dosing cycle. 
 Both trials were designed to determine the maximum tolerated dose, or MTD, and/or recommended Phase 2 dose, or RP2D, as well as preliminary anti-cancer activity, of single agent entrectinib in patients with solid tumors with the relevant molecular alterations. 
 Updated results from the ALKA-372-001 and STARTRK-1 Phase 1 clinical trials were published in the journal Cancer Discovery in February 2017. As of the September 20, 2016, data cutoff for the publication, the findings showed: 
 

 | A total of 119 patients with a range of solid tumors had been dosed across both clinical trials, with 45 patients treated at the RP2D of 600 mg, taken orally once per day (QD). The publication represented the largest published patient safety experience of any TRK inhibitor in clinical development.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Entrectinib was well tolerated, with no responding patients discontinuing the study due to adverse events, or AEs, and no evidence of cumulative toxicity, renal or hepatic toxicity, or QTc prolongation.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | The majority of treatments-related AEs were Grade 1 or 2 in severity; Grade 3 events were reversible with dose modifications.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Only one Grade 4 and no treatment related Grade 5 AEs were reported across the two studies.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | The most common treatment-related AEs of any grade were fatigue/asthenia, dysgeusia, parasthesias, nausea and myalgias.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | 25 patients across both clinical trials met the expected Phase 2 eligibility criteria, which include the presence of NTRK1, NTRK2, NTRK3, ROS1 or ALK fusions, as opposed to other types of molecular alterations; the patient not having been previously treated with an ALK inhibitor or a ROS1 inhibitor; and treatment at or above the RP2D.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
6 
 

 | In three patients with NTRK1/2/3-rearranged solid tumors (non-small cell lung cancer, or NSCLC, mammary analog secretory carcinoma, or MASC, and colorectal cancer) and with Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, or RECIST, -measurable disease, the objective response rate, or ORR, was 100%, including complete resolution of brain metastases in the patient with NSCLC. The durations of response were 2.6 months (colorectal cancer), 4.6 months (MASC), and 15.1 months (NSCLC; patient treatment ongoing as of data cutoff date). An additional patient with an NTRK1-rearranged glioneuronal tumor experienced 60% reduction in tumor burden by 3-dimensional volumetric assessment (stable disease by RECIST, which is not validated for primary brain tumors).
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | An ORR of 86% was observed in 14 patients with ROS1-rearranged solid tumors (13 NSCLC patients, one melanoma patient), including two complete responses; an ORR of 85% was observed in the 13 patients with ROS1-rearranged NSCLC. A median duration of response of 17.4 months was seen for all ROS1-rearranged cancers, and among 13 patients with ROS1-rearranged NSCLC, the median duration of response was 17.3 months.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | In seven patients with ALK-rearranged solid tumors, the ORR was 57%, and responses were observed in ALK-rearranged NSCLC, renal cell carcinoma and colorectal cancer. A median duration of response of 7.4 months was seen for ALK-rearranged cancers.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Phase 2 Clinical Trial 
 In September 2015, we initiated the STARTRK-2 clinical trial of entrectinib. It is a global, multicenter, open label, potentially registration-enabling Phase 2 clinical trial of entrectinib in multiple solid tumors that utilizes a basket design with screening of patient tumor samples for gene rearrangements of the relevant targets. 
Diagnostic Technologies for Patient Identification 
 Multiple diagnostic technologies are available for measuring alterations in NTRK1/2/3, ROS1 and ALK. There is an FDA-approved fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) test for measuring ALK translocations (Vysis, manufactured by Abbott Molecular). There is also a commercially available FISH test for measuring ROS1 translocations. In addition, ALK and ROS1 protein expression levels can also be measured by immunohistochemistry (IHC) using commercially available antibodies, including the FDA-approved companion diagnostic assay for ALK from Ventana Medical Systems, Inc. Finally, several commercial, as well as academic, groups offer next generation sequencing-based methods for the detection of sequence mutations and gene translocations of NTRK1, NTRK2, NTRK3, ROS1 and ALK. 
 We have evaluated each of these candidate diagnostic approaches, and we have developed a proprietary, RNA-based companion diagnostic next-generation screening, or NGS, assay, called Trailblaze Pharos, to be performed in our CAP-accredited and CLIA-certified diagnostic laboratory. In August 2016, the FDA approved an investigational device exemption, or IDE, for our Trailblaze Pharos assay which is intended for use in identifying patients, including those who are treatment-naïve, who have solid tumors with NTRK1/2/3, ROS1, or ALK gene rearrangements leading to fusion proteins, to determine eligibility for enrollment into the global STARTRK-2 clinical trial. In November 2016, the FDA also granted our request to review our Trailblaze Pharos companion diagnostic test service under the Expedited Access Pathway, or EAP, program. Our diagnostic development team is also building upon our Trailblaze platform to detect molecular alterations of interest for our other targeted programs. 
 RXDX-105
RXDX-105 is a new chemical entity that we acquired in 2015 from Teva. RXDX-105 is an orally bioavailable, small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor with potent activity against RET that spares vascular endothelial growth factor, or VEGFR. We believe this program enables us the potential for a first-in-class and best-in-class opportunity in RET-driven solid tumors. 
 Rationale for Targeting RET 
 About RET. The RET proto-oncogene is a receptor tyrosine kinase that sits at the cell surface. When activated, it initiates downstream cellular proliferation and survival pathways such as MAP kinase, PI3 kinase and PLC gamma. RET can be prone to gene rearrangements and other activating mutations that can cause autophosphorylation and become oncogenic drivers by constitutively activating these downstream signaling pathways. 
 Phase 1/1b Clinical Trial 
 Teva initiated a Phase 1/1b dose escalation clinical trial which was designed to determine the MTD and/or RP2D, as well as preliminary anti-cancer activity, of single agent RXDX-105 in patients with advanced or metastatic solid tumors that were not selected based on any molecular alteration. We assumed control of this trial in mid-2015.

7 
 
We announced data from this ongoing clinical trial in December 2016 at the 2016 EORTC-NCI-AACR Molecular Targets and Cancer Therapeutics Symposium. As of the November 2016 data cut-off for the presentation, the findings showed: 
 

 | A total of 91 patients with a range of solid tumors were dosed in the clinical trial, with 55 patients treated in the Phase 1 study and 36 patient treated in the Phase 1b study.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | RXDX-105 continues to demonstrate a safety profile similar to what has been previously reported.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | The most frequent (>10% incidence) treatment-related AEs were rash, fatigue, diarrhea, nausea, hypophosphatemia, vomiting, muscle spasms and decreased appetite. The majority of treatment-related AEs were Grade 1 or 2, and were reversible with dose modification. The most common Grade 3 treatment-related AEs were rash, hypophosphatemia, and an increase in alanine aminotransferase, or ALT.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | One patient experienced a Grade 3 drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms, in which the patient recovered with drug discontinuation. One patient experienced Grade 3 rash complicated by fatal alveolar hemorrhage.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Toxicities commonly associated with VEGFR inhibition, such as hypertension, hypothryroidism, proteinuria, and neutrotoxicity, were rarely observed.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Of the 36 patient treated in the Phase 1b study, 35 had RET or BRAF molecular alterations.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Nine RET inhibitor-naïve patients with RET fusion-positive tumors were treated at a daily dose of 275 mg or 350 mg in the fed state, and were evaluable for response.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | A preliminary ORR of 56% was observed in patients with RET fusion-positive solid tumors who were RET inhibitor-naïve (five out of nine treated patients had a RECIST response). Of the five patients demonstrating a RECIST response, one patient with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) achieved a complete response; three patients, all with NSCLC, achieved a partial response; and one patient with NSCLC had an unconfirmed partial response.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Among the seven patients with RET fusion-positive NSCLC who were RET inhibitor- naïve, three achieved a partial response and one achieved an unconfirmed response (a second scan had not been obtained at the date of the data cutoff), for a preliminary ORR of 57%.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Duration of response to RXDX-105 ranged from 2+ to 7+ months, with all responder patients currently continuing on treatment in active response; median duration of response, therefore, has not yet been determined.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Additionally, a previously disclosed Phase 1 patient with RET-mutated M918T medullary thyroid cancer had a confirmed partial response and continues on treatment after 10 cycles.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Among the remaining patients treated in Phase 1b who were either RET fusion-positive and received prior RET inhibitor treatments, or had BRAF molecular alterations, durable disease control but no objective responses have been observed to date.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | These data demonstrated that RXDX-105 was active across a range of different histologies, with confirmed RECIST responses observed in medullary thyroid cancer, NSCLC, and mCRC, and across a range of RET molecular alterations, including the M918T point mutation, and CCDC6-, EML4-, and PARD3-RET fusions.

Taladegib 
 Taladegib is a new chemical entity to which we acquired rights from Lilly in 2015. Taladegib is an orally available, small molecule hedgehog/smoothened antagonist that has achieved clinical proof-of-concept and a recommended Phase 2 dose in a Phase 1 dose escalation trial. 
 Rationale for Targeting Hedgehog 
 The hedgehog pathway is a cell signaling pathway that transmits information to embryonic cells required for proper development. Dysregulated signaling can arise from molecular alterations at multiple nodes in the pathway, which can lead to uncontrolled cell growth in multiple solid tumor types. Regulation of the pathway can be affected through modulation of multiple receptors, including the G protein-coupled receptor smoothened. 
Phase 1 Clinical Trial 
 Lilly initiated a Phase 1 clinical trial of oral taladegib in patients with solid tumors. This multicenter, dose escalation clinical trial was designed to determine the MTD and RP2D, as well as preliminary anti-cancer activity, of single agent oral taladegib in patients with advanced or metastatic solid tumors. Patients were dosed once daily for 28 days. There were three phases to the study: a dose escalation phase in patients with advanced cancer, a dose confirmation phase in patients with advanced cancer, and a disease expansion cohort in patients with locally advanced or metastatic basal cell carcinoma.

Lilly presented interim results from this clinical trial in November 2015 at the 2015 EORTC-NCI-AACR Symposium on Molecular Targets and Cancer Therapeutics. As of the data cut-off for the presentation, the findings showed: 
 

 | A total of 84 patients with a range of solid tumors had been dosed, 47 of whom had advanced or metastatic basal cell carcinoma.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | The most frequent (>10% incidence) treatment-related AEs were dysgeusia, fatigue, nausea, muscle spasms and decreased appetite. Most toxicities were Grade 1 or 2, with 18 reported Grade 3 AEs. There were no Grade 4 or Grade 5 AEs reported. Dose limiting toxicity was seen at 600 mg, and the maximum tolerated dose was determined to be 400 mg, once daily.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Among patients with advanced or metastatic basal cell carcinoma, the overall response rate in patients who were hedgehog inhibitor naïve was 69%, based on 11 responses out of 16 patients. The overall response rate in patients who had previously received hedgehog inhibitor therapy was 38%, based on 11 responses out of 29 evaluable patients. Taking into account patients with stable disease, the percentage of patients who received clinical benefit from taladegib treatment was 100% in the hedgehog inhibitor naïve patient subset and approximately 90% in the previously hedgehog inhibitor treated patient subset.

 In May 2016, we determined to prioritize our resources and development efforts on our lead product candidate, entrectinib, and are in discussions with Lilly regarding the optimal path forward for taladegib in the context of our pipeline priorities. In connection with these discussions Lilly has indicated that it believes that we may not have satisfied certain of our obligations to Lilly under the license agreement, but Lilly has also indicated an interest in achieving an amicable resolution with respect to this issue and the parties are continuing discussions consistent with this desire. 
 RXDX-106
RXDX-106 is a small molecule, pseudo-irreversible inhibitor of TYRO3, AXL and MER, or collectively TAM, and c-MET that is in late preclinical development. 
 Rationale for Targeting TAM and c-MET
About TAM. Numerous studies have shown that the TAM receptors play a critical, dual regulatory role in cancer. Aberrantly elevated TAM signaling is associated with cancer progression, metastasis and drug resistance. At the same time, TAM receptors in diverse immune cells, such as macrophages, T cells, NK cells and dendritic cells, are key negative regulators of both innate and acquired immunity. Thus, targeted inhibition of TAM receptors has emerged as a potential novel strategy for cancer treatment by not only impeding the tumorigenic, metastatic, and chemo-resistant capabilities of the tumor cells, but also by activating innate and adaptive anti-tumor immune responses. 
 About c-MET. The c-MET pathway plays an important role in cancer development, progression and resistance to anti-EGFR and other targeted therapies. Particularly, molecular alterations that result in MET exon 14 skipping are found in lung cancer and other cancer types and shown to confer sensitivity to MET inhibition. 
 License Agreements 
 November 2013 Agreement with NMS 
 We entered into a license agreement with NMS on October 10, 2013, which was amended on October 25, 2013, became effective on November 6, 2013, and was amended December 12, 2014. The agreement grants us exclusive global rights to develop and commercialize entrectinib, as well as a second product candidate, RXDX-102. As a result of the clinical results relating to entrectinib that we have seen to date, we designated RXDX-102 as a back-up compound to entrectinib. Accordingly, we will not devote further development resources to RXDX-102.
Our development rights under the license agreement are exclusive for the term of the agreement with respect to entrectinib and RXDX-102 and also, as to NMS, are exclusive for a five-year period with respect to any product candidate with activity against the target proteins of entrectinib and RXDX-102, and include the right to grant sublicenses. We are obligated under the license agreement to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and commercialize a product based on either or both of entrectinib and RXDX-102, at our expense. 
 Under the terms of the license agreement, on November 6, 2013, we issued to NMS a warrant to acquire up to 16,667 shares of our common stock, which has an exercise price of $6.00 per share and is exercisable at any time at the option of the holder until November 6, 2018. The terms of the license agreement also provided for an up-front payment to NMS of $7.0 million. When and if commercial sales of a product based on either or both of entrectinib or RXDX-102 begin, we will be obligated to pay NMS tiered royalties ranging from a mid-single digit percentage to a low double digit percentage (between 10% and 15%) of our net sales, depending on the amount of our net sales, with standard provisions for royalty offsets to the extent we obtain any rights from third 
 
9 
 
 parties to commercialize the product. The license agreement also requires that we make development and regulatory milestone payments to NMS of up to $105.0 million in the aggregate if specified clinical study initiations and regulatory approvals are achieved across multiple products or indications. Pursuant to the December 2014 amendment to the agreement, we paid the initial milestone payment of $10.0 million to NMS in December 2014. 
 The license agreement with NMS will remain in effect until the expiration of all of our royalty and sublicense revenue payment obligations to NMS. Those payment obligations commence after the first commercial sale of a product covered by the claims of any patent subject to the license agreement, and continue, on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis, through the longer of (i) the expiration of the last-to-expire valid patent in such country with claims covering such product or (ii) 10 years after the first commercial sale of such product in such country. The license agreement may be terminated under the following circumstances: (a) prior to the first commercial sale of a product covered by the agreement, if we provide NMS with 60 days prior written notice of our termination of the agreement, (b) after the first commercial sale of any product covered by the agreement, if we provide NMS with three months prior written notice of our termination of the agreement (in which case NMS may then accelerate the effective date of the termination to not less than 30 days after our notice), or (c) upon a material breach by either party under the agreement, which breach is not cured within 30 days with respect to payment defaults or within 60 days with respect to any other breach (which cure period may be extended to up to 120 days for breaches other than payment defaults). As a result, if we fail to meet our payment or other obligations under the license agreement and are unable to cure any such failure within the specified cure periods, NMS could terminate the license agreement and we would lose our rights to entrectinib and RXDX-102.
Agreement with Daiichi Sankyo 
 In connection with our March 2015 asset acquisition from Teva, we assumed all rights and obligations under the collaboration agreement dated November 3, 2006, as amended April 17, 2009, between Cephalon, Inc. and Daiichi Sankyo Company, Limited, or Daiichi Sankyo, as successor-in-interest to Ambit Biosciences Corporation. The collaboration was for the purpose of identifying and developing clinical candidates that demonstrate activity towards the two designated target kinases of the collaboration: the BRAF kinase and the AXL kinase. Under the agreement, both parties contributed certain intellectual property to the collaboration and agreed to a period of exclusivity during which neither party would engage in any research related to a collaboration target compound with any third-party. The collaboration portion of the agreement ended in November 2009, but the agreement remains in effect on a product-by-product, country-by-country basis until all royalty obligations expire. Both parties have a right to terminate the agreement if the other party enters bankruptcy or upon an uncured breach by the other party. We may also terminate the agreement in our discretion upon 90 days written notice to Daiichi Sankyo. 
 We are solely responsible for worldwide clinical development and commercialization of collaboration compounds, which include RXDX-105 and RXDX-106, subject to the option of Daiichi Sankyo, exercisable during certain periods following completion of the first proof-of-concept study in humans and only with our consent, to co-develop and co-promote RXDX-105. If we decide to discontinue development of the RXDX-105 program, we must give written notice to Daiichi Sankyo, which will have the right to assume control of that program, subject to diligence obligations and payment of the milestones and royalties to us that would otherwise have been paid to Daiichi Sankyo had we maintained responsibility for the program. 
 The agreement requires us to make development, regulatory and sales milestone payments to Daiichi Sankyo of up to $44.5 million in the aggregate for RXDX-105, and up to $47.5 million in the aggregate for RXDX-106. When and if commercial sales of a product based on either of RXDX-105 or RXDX-106 begin, we will be obligated to pay Daiichi Sankyo tiered royalties ranging from a mid-single digit percentage to a low double digit percentage of net sales, depending on annual amounts of net sales, with standard provisions for royalty offsets to the extent we are required to obtain any rights from third parties to commercialize either RXDX-105 or RXDX-106. Royalties are payable to Daiichi Sankyo on a product-by-product, country-by-country basis beginning on the date of the first commercial sale in a country and ending on the later of 10 years after the date of such sale in that country or the expiration date of the last to expire patent subject to the agreement covering the product in that country. 
Agreement with Lilly 
 On November 6, 2015, we entered into a license, development and commercialization agreement with Lilly, pursuant to which we received exclusive, global rights to develop and commercialize pharmaceutical products under certain licensed technology, including the oral and topical forms of the product candidate taladegib. We granted back to Lilly an exclusive license to develop and commercialize pharmaceutical products comprising taladegib in combination with certain other molecules. 
 We are obligated under the agreement to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and commercialize pharmaceutical products utilizing the licensed technology, at our expense. 
 The agreement provided for an up-front payment by us to Lilly of $2.0 million and the issuance by us to Lilly in a private placement of 1,213,000 unregistered shares of our common stock. When and if commercial sales of products we develop under the license begin, we will be obligated to pay Lilly a mid-single digit royalty based on net sales. When and if commercial sales of combination products developed by Lilly under the grant-back license begin, Lilly will be obligated to pay us a royalty of net sales. Both parties royalty obligations are subject to standard provisions for royalty offsets to the extent a party is required to obtain any rights from third 
 
10 
 
 parties to commercialize the applicable products, or in the event of loss of exclusivity or generic competition. The agreement also requires that we make development and sales milestone payments to Lilly of up to $38.0 million. We may elect to pay a portion of such amounts by issuing to Lilly shares of our common stock in a private placement, subject to certain conditions. 
 Unless terminated earlier, the agreement will remain in effect, on a country-by-country and product-by-product basis, until the parties royalty obligations end. Each party has a right to terminate the agreement if the other party enters bankruptcy, upon an uncured breach by the other party or if the other party challenges its patents relating to the licensed technology. 
 Competition 
 The pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries are characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition and a strong emphasis on proprietary products. While we believe that our technology, development experience, scientific knowledge and strategies provide us with competitive advantages, we face competition from many different sources, including major pharmaceutical, specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions and governmental agencies and public and private research institutions. Any product candidates that we are able to successfully develop and commercialize will compete with existing therapies and new therapies that may become available in the future. Our competitors may develop or market products or other novel technologies that are more effective, safer, more convenient or less costly than any that may be commercialized by us, or may obtain regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours. 
 The acquisition or licensing of pharmaceutical products is also very competitive, and a number of more established companies, some of which have acknowledged strategies to license or acquire products and many of which are bigger than us and have more institutional experience and greater cash flows than we have, may have competitive advantages over us, as may other emerging companies taking similar or different approaches to product licenses and/or acquisitions. In addition, a number of established research-based pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies may acquire products in late stages of development to augment their internal product lines, which may provide those companies with an even greater competitive advantage. 
 Many of our competitors will have substantially greater financial, technical and human resources than we have. Mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical industry may result in even more resources being concentrated in some of our competitors. Competition may increase further as a result of advances made in the commercial applicability of technologies and greater availability of capital for investment in these fields. Our success will be based in part on our ability to build, obtain regulatory approval for and market acceptance of, and actively manage, a portfolio of drugs that addresses unmet medical needs and creates value in patient therapy. 
 We compete in the segments of the pharmaceutical, biotechnology and other related markets that pursue precision medicine approaches to combatting activating molecular alterations in cancer. There are a number of other companies presently working to develop therapies for cancer in the field of precision medicines, including divisions of large pharmaceutical companies, and pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies of various sizes. 
 The most common methods of treating patients with cancer are surgery, radiation and drug therapy, or a combination of such methods. There are a variety of available drug therapies marketed for cancer. In many cases, these drugs are administered in combination to enhance efficacy. While our product candidates, if any are approved, may compete with these existing drug and other therapies, to the extent they are ultimately used in combination with or as an adjunct to these therapies, our product candidates may not be competitive with them. Some of the currently approved drug therapies are branded and subject to patent protection, and others are available on a generic basis. Many of these approved drugs are well established therapies and are widely accepted by physicians, patients and third-party payers. As a result, obtaining market acceptance of, and a gaining significant share of the market for, any of our product candidates that we successfully introduce to the market will pose challenges. 
 In addition to currently marketed therapies, there are also a number of medicines in late stage clinical development to treat cancer. These medicines in development may provide efficacy, safety, convenience and other benefits that are not provided by currently marketed therapies and may not be provided by any of our current or future product candidates. As a result, they may provide significant competition for any of our product candidates. 
 With respect to entrectinib, we are aware that Loxo Oncology is developing larotrectnib (LOXO-101) for patients with TRK-positive solid tumors, and has initiated a Phase 2 basket trial in adult cancer patients whose tumors harbor TRK fusions and a Phase 1/1b trial in pediatric cancer patients. We are also aware of three agents that have been approved by the FDA for ALK-positive NSCLC  Pfizers Xalkori®/crizotinib, Novartis Zykadia®/ceritinib and Roches Alecensa®/alectinib. Alectinib is also approved for this indication in Japan. In addition, we are aware that Pfizers Xalkori®/crizotinib has also been approved by the FDA for ROS1-positive NSCLC. 
 With respect to taladegib, we are aware of two agents that have been approved by the FDA to treat basal cell carcinoma and are designed to selectively inhibit the hedgehog pathway by binding the smoothened protein: Genentechs Erivedge®/vismodegib and Novartis Odomzo®/sonidegib. 
 
11 
 
We are also aware of several other products in development targeting TRKA, TRKB, TRKC, ROS1, ALK, Hedgehog/Smoothened, RET, TYRO3, AXL, MER and/or c-MET for the treatment of cancer, some of which may be in a more advanced stage of development than our product candidates. There are also many other compounds directed to other molecular targets that are in clinical development by a variety of companies to treat cancer types that we may choose to pursue with our programs. 
 Commercialization 
 We have not yet established significant sales, marketing or product distribution infrastructure. For any of our product candidates for which we may in the future receive marketing approvals, we may seek to commercialize the product ourselves or to avail ourselves of commercial capabilities through one or more collaborations. In any such collaboration, we would likely seek to retain certain commercialization rights to our product candidates as a means of retaining strategic flexibility to enable us to maximize shareholder value. 
 To the extent that we internally develop and obtain regulatory approval for commercial companion diagnostics for use with our therapeutic products, we may market and sell those diagnostics through our own sales and marketing teams or we may seek a commercialization partner. To the extent we collaborate in the future with any third parties on the development of any commercial companion diagnostics for use with our therapeutic products, such third parties will most likely hold the commercial rights to those diagnostic products. We expect that we would coordinate closely with any future diagnostic collaborators in connection with the marketing and sale of such diagnostic products and our related therapeutic products. 
 Manufacturing 
 We do not own or operate, and currently have no plans to establish, any manufacturing facilities. We currently rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the manufacture of our product candidates for preclinical and clinical testing, as well as for commercial manufacture of any products that we may commercialize. We have a limited number of supply arrangements for entrectinib, and we are currently reliant on a single contract manufacturer for the clinical supply of RXDX-105. In addition, we have only a limited clinical supply of taladegib, and we must seek to establish clinical supply agreements with third parties for future supplies. We do not currently have arrangements in place for commercial supply of bulk drug substance or drug products. For all of our product candidates, we plan to identify and qualify manufacturers to provide the active pharmaceutical ingredient and fill-and-finish services prior to submission of a new drug application, or NDA, to the FDA. 
 We believe that all of our product candidates can be manufactured in reliable and reproducible synthetic processes from readily available materials. We believe that the chemistry is amenable to scale-up and does not require unusual or expensive equipment in the manufacturing process. We expect to continue to develop product candidates that can be produced cost-effectively at contract manufacturing facilities. 
 We generally expect to rely on third parties for the manufacture of any companion diagnostics we or our collaborators may develop. 
 Intellectual Property 
 Our commercial success depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain proprietary or intellectual property protection for our product candidates and our core technologies, to operate without infringing any intellectual property rights of others and to prevent others from infringing our proprietary or intellectual property rights. We expect that we will seek to protect our proprietary and intellectual property position by, among other methods, licensing or filing our own U.S. and foreign patent applications related to our proprietary technology, inventions and improvements that are important to the development and implementation of our business. We also rely on trade secrets, know-how and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our proprietary and intellectual property position, which we generally seek to protect through trade secret law and contractual obligations with third parties. 
 We currently, and expect that we will continue to, file or license patent applications directed to our key product candidates in an effort to establish intellectual property positions regarding the new chemical entities utilized in these product candidates, as well as uses of these chemical entities in the treatment of various cancers. We also may seek patent protection, if available, with respect to biomarkers and diagnostic methods that may be useful in selecting the right patient population for use of any of our product candidates. 
 Our license agreements relating to our entrectinib, RXDX-105, and taladegib development programs grant us exclusive, worldwide licenses under a portfolio of patents and patent applications directed to the licensed development programs. We own the rights to composition of matter patents and patent applications directed to our RXDX-106 and RXDX-107 programs. The composition of matter patents in the United States expire in 2029 for the issued patent relating to entrectinib, in 2030 for the issued patent relating to RXDX-105, in 2032 for the issued patent relating to RXDX-106, in 2033 for the issued patent relating to RXDX-107, and in 2031 for the issued patent relating to taladegib. 
 We plan to continue to expand our intellectual property portfolio by filing patent applications in the United States and internationally for novel compositions of matter that we may develop covering our compounds, the chemistries and processes for manufacturing these compounds, the use of these compounds in a variety of therapies and potentially for the use of biomarkers for patient selection for 
 
12 
 
 these compounds. Of course, these or other patent applications that we may file or license from third parties may not issue as patents, and any issued patents may have claims that are substantially more limited than the patents disclosure. Any issued claims may be of a scope that may reduce their value and/or may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented. See Risk FactorsRights Related to Our Intellectual Property. 
 In addition to patents, we have registered trademarks in the United States for Ignyta®, the Ignyta word mark and design, the Ignyta design, Methylome®, and Trailblaze®, and have pending trademark applications in the United States for Ignyta, the Ignyta word mark and design, the Ignyta design, Oncolome, Pharos, Trailblaze, Trailblaze Pharos and Trailblaze Pharos and design. We have registered trademarks in the European Union, or EU, for Ignyta®, the Ignyta design, Methylome®, Oncolome®, Pharos®, Trailblaze®, Trailblaze Pharos® and Trailblaze Pharos and design. We also rely upon unpatented trade secrets and know-how and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position. We seek to protect our proprietary information, in part, using confidentiality agreements with our collaborators, scientific advisors, employees and consultants, and invention assignment agreements with our employees and selected consultants, scientific advisors and collaborators. The confidentiality agreements are designed to protect our proprietary information and, in the case of agreements or clauses requiring invention assignment, to grant us ownership of technologies that are developed through a relationship with a third party. 
 Government Regulation 
 Government authorities in the United States, at the federal, state and local level, and in other countries, extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, including any manufacturing changes, packaging, storage, recordkeeping, labeling, advertising, promotion, distribution, marketing, post-approval monitoring and reporting, import and export of pharmaceutical products, such as those we are developing. 
United States Drug Approval Process 
 In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or the FDCA, and implementing regulations. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable United States requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval, may subject an applying company to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions. 
 The process required by the FDA before a drug may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following: 
 

 | completion of preclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies in compliance with good laboratory practice, or GLP, regulations;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | submission to the FDA of an IND, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | approval of each phase of the proposed clinical trials and related informed consents by an institutional review board, or IRB, at each clinical site where such trial will be performed;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with good clinical practice, or GCP, standards and regulations to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug for each indication;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | submission to the FDA of an NDA;
--+---------------------------------


 | satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the product is produced to assess compliance with current good manufacturing practice, or cGMP, requirements and to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the drugs identity, strength, quality and purity; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | FDA review and approval of the NDA.
--+------------------------------------

 Preclinical Studies and IND 
 Preclinical studies include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry and formulation, as well as in vitro and animal studies to assess the potential for AEs and, in some cases, to establish a rationale for therapeutic use. The conduct of preclinical studies is subject to federal regulations and requirements, including GLP regulations for safety/toxicology studies. An IND sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and plans for clinical trials, among other things, to the FDA as part of an IND. Some long-term preclinical testing, such as animal tests of reproductive AEs and carcinogenicity, may continue after the IND is submitted. An IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless before that time the FDA raises concerns or questions related to one or more proposed clinical trials and places the trial on clinical hold. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. As a result, submission of an IND may not result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to commence. 
 
13 
 
Clinical Trials 
 Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational new drug to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with GCP requirements, which include, among other things, the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent in writing before their participation in any clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under written protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety, and the safety and effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. A protocol for each clinical trial and any subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. In addition, an IRB at each institution participating in the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial before it commences at that institution, and the IRB must conduct continuing review. The IRB must review and approve, among other things, the study protocol and informed consent information to be provided to study subjects. An IRB must operate in compliance with FDA regulations. In addition, a sponsor must provide information regarding most clinical trials to be disclosed on http://clinicaltrials.gov, a website maintained by the National Institutes of Health. 
 Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined: 
 

 | Phase 1: The drug is initially introduced into healthy human subjects or patients with the target disease or condition and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution, excretion and, if possible, to gain an early indication of its effectiveness.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Phase 2: The drug is administered to a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Phase 3: The drug is administered to an expanded patient population in adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to generate sufficient data to statistically confirm the efficacy and safety of the product for approval for specified indications, to establish the overall risk-benefit profile of the product and to provide adequate information for the labeling of the product.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted at least annually to the FDA, and more frequently if serious AEs occur. The FDA or the sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRBs requirements or if the drug has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients. 
 Pursuant to the 21st Century Cures Act, which was enacted on December 13, 2016, the manufacturer of an investigational drug for a serious or life-threatening disease is required to make available, such as by posting on its website, its policy on evaluating and responding to requests for expanded access. This requirement applies on the later of 60 days after the date of enactment or the first initiation of a Phase 2 or Phase 3 trial of the investigational drug. 
 Marketing Approval 
 Assuming successful completion of the required clinical testing, the results of the preclinical studies and clinical trials, together with detailed information relating to the products chemistry, manufacture, controls and proposed labeling, among other things, are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. Under federal law, the submission of most NDAs is subject to a substantial application user fee. 
 The FDA generally conducts a preliminary review of all NDAs to determine if they are sufficiently complete to permit substantive review within the first 60 days after submission before accepting them for filing. The FDA may request additional information in connection with this preliminary review rather than accept an NDA for filing. In this event, the application must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application is subject to further review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review. The FDA has agreed to specified performance goals in the review of NDAs. Under these goals, the FDA has committed to review most such applications for non-priority products within 10 months, and most applications for priority review products, that is, drugs that the FDA determines represent a significant improvement over existing therapy, within six months. The FDA may also refer applications for novel drugs or products that present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions. The FDA is not required to adhere its review time goals, and its review could experience delays that cause those goals to not be met. 
 Before approving an NDA, the FDA typically will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and are adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. In addition, before approving an NDA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP and integrity of the clinical data submitted. 
 
14 
 
The testing and approval process for each product candidate requires substantial time, effort and financial resources, and each may take many years to complete. Data obtained from preclinical and clinical activities are not always conclusive and may be susceptible to varying interpretations, which could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval. The FDA may not grant approval of an application for a product candidate on a timely basis, or at all. Further, applicants often encounter difficulties or unanticipated costs in their efforts to develop product candidates and secure necessary governmental approvals, which could delay or preclude the marketing of those products. 
 After the FDAs evaluation of the NDA and inspection of the manufacturing facilities, the FDA may issue an approval letter or a complete response letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A complete response letter generally outlines the deficiencies in the submission and may require substantial additional testing or information in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. If and when those deficiencies have been addressed to the FDAs satisfaction in a resubmission of the NDA, the FDA may then issue an approval letter. The FDA has committed to reviewing such resubmissions in two or six months depending on the type of information included. Even with submission of this additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval and refuse to approve the NDA. 
 Programs for Expedited Review and Approval 
 The FDA has developed certain programs and designations that enable NDAs for product candidates meeting specified criteria to be eligible for certain expedited review and approval processes such as fast track designation, priority review, accelerated approval, and breakthrough therapy designation. Even if a product qualifies for one or more of these programs, the FDA may later decide that the product no longer meets the conditions for qualification or decide that the time period for FDA review or approval will not be shortened. 
 Fast Track Designation. The FDA is required to facilitate the development and expedite the review of drugs that are intended for the treatment of a serious or life-threatening condition for which there is no effective treatment and that demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the condition. Under the fast track program, the sponsor of a new product candidate may request the FDA to designate the product for a specific indication as a fast track product concurrent with or after the submission of the IND for the product candidate. The FDA must determine if the product candidate qualifies for fast track designation within 60 days after receipt of the sponsors request. 
 In addition to other benefits, such as the ability to use surrogate endpoints (see the description of surrogate endpoints under Accelerated Approval below) and have greater interactions with the FDA, the FDA may initiate review of sections of a fast track products NDA before the application is complete. This rolling review is available if the applicant provides and the FDA approves a schedule for the submission of the remaining information and the applicant pays applicable user fees. However, the FDAs review time goal for a fast track application does not begin until the last section of the NDA is submitted. In addition, the fast track designation may be withdrawn by the FDA if the FDA believes that the designation is no longer supported by data emerging in the clinical trial process. 
 Priority Review. Under FDA policies, a product candidate may be eligible for priority review, or review generally within a six-month timeframe from the time a complete application is accepted for filing. Products regulated by the FDAs Center for Drug Evaluation and Research are eligible for priority review if they provide a significant improvement compared to marketed products in the treatment, diagnosis or prevention of a disease. A fast track designated product candidate would ordinarily meet the FDAs criteria for priority review. 
 Under the FDAs Rare Pediatric Disease Priority Review Voucher program, upon the approval of a qualifying NDA or biologics license application, or BLA, for the treatment of a rare pediatric disease, the sponsor of such application would be eligible for a Pediatric Disease Priority Review Voucher that can be used to obtain priority review for a subsequent NDA or BLA. The FDA defines a rare pediatric disease as a disease that (1) is a serious or life-threatening disease in which the serious or life-threatening manifestations primarily affect individuals aged from birth to 18 years, including age groups often called neonates, infants, children, and adolescents and (2) is a rare disease or condition within the meaning of the Orphan Drug Act (i.e., it affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the U.S.). The FDA has granted us rare pediatric disease designation for entrectinib for the treatment of neuroblastoma. 
 Accelerated Approval. Under the FDAs accelerated approval regulations, the FDA may approve a drug for a serious or life-threatening illness that provides meaningful therapeutic benefit to patients over existing treatments based upon a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. In clinical trials, a surrogate endpoint is a marker, such as a laboratory measurement, radiographic image, physical sign, or other measure that is thought to predict clinical benefit, but is not itself a measure of clinical benefit. Surrogate endpoints can often be measured more easily or sooner than clinical endpoints. A product candidate approved on this basis is subject to rigorous post-marketing compliance requirements, including the completion of Phase 4 or post-approval clinical trials to validate the surrogate endpoint or otherwise 
 
15 
 
 confirm the effect on the clinical endpoint. Failure to conduct required post-approval studies, or to confirm a clinical benefit during post-marketing studies, would allow the FDA to withdraw the drug from the market on an expedited basis. All promotional materials for product candidates approved under accelerated regulations are subject to prior review by the FDA. 
 Breakthrough Therapy Designation. A sponsor can request designation of a product candidate as a breakthrough therapy. A breakthrough therapy is defined as a drug that is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. Drugs designated as breakthrough therapies are also eligible for accelerated approval. The FDA must take certain actions, such as holding timely meetings and providing advice, intended to expedite the development and review of an application for approval of a breakthrough therapy. 
Additional Regulatory Designations and Alternative Approval Pathways 
 In addition to the expedited review and approval programs and designations, the FDA also recognizes certain other designations and alternative approval pathways that afford certain benefits, such as the orphan drug designation and alternative types of NDAs under the Hatch-Waxman Act. 
 Orphan Drugs. Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan drug designation to drugs intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally defined as a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an NDA. The FDA has granted us orphan drug designation for entrectinib for the treatment of neuroblastoma and for the treatment of TRKA-positive, TRKB-positive, TRKC-positive, ROS1-positive or ALK-positive non-small cell lung cancer and colorectal cancer. After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the generic identity of the drug and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process. 
 The first NDA applicant to receive FDA approval for a particular active moiety to treat a particular disease with FDA orphan drug designation is entitled to a seven-year exclusive marketing period in the United States for that product and for that indication. During the seven-year exclusivity period, the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug for the same orphan indication, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan drug exclusivity, such that it is shown to be safer, more effective or makes a major contribution to patient care. Orphan drug exclusivity does not prevent the FDA from approving a different drug for the same disease or condition, or the same drug for a different disease or condition. Among the other benefits of orphan drug designation are tax credits for certain research and a waiver of the NDA application user fee. 
 The Hatch-Waxman Act: Abbreviated New Drug Applications. In seeking approval for a drug through an NDA, applicants are required to list with the FDA each patent with claims that cover the applicants product or a method of using the product. Upon approval of a drug, each of the patents listed in the application for the drug is then published in the FDAs Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations, commonly known as the Orange Book. A drug listed in the Orange Book may, in turn, function as a reference listed drug, or RLD, and be cited by potential competitors in support of approval of an abbreviated new drug application, or ANDA. Generally, an ANDA provides for marketing of a drug product that has the same active ingredients in the same strengths, dosage form and route of administration as the RLD and has been shown to be bioequivalent through in vitro or in vivo testing or otherwise to the RLD. ANDA applicants are not required to conduct or submit results of preclinical or clinical tests to prove the safety or effectiveness of their proposed ANDA drug product, other than the requirement for bioequivalence testing. Drugs approved in this way are commonly referred to as generic equivalents to the RLD, and can be and are often substituted by pharmacists under prescriptions written for the RLD. 
 The ANDA applicant is required to certify to the FDA concerning any patents listed for the RLD in the Orange Book, except for patents covering methods of use of the RLD for which the ANDA applicant is not seeking FDA approval. Specifically, the applicant must certify with respect to each Orange Book-listed patent that: 
 

 | the required patent information has not been filed;
--+----------------------------------------------------


 | the listed patent has expired;
--+-------------------------------


 | the listed patent has not expired, but will expire on a particular date and approval is sought after patent expiration; or
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | the listed patent is invalid, unenforceable or will not be infringed by the proposed ANDA product.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 A certification that the proposed ANDA product will not infringe the patents listed for the RLD or that such patents are invalid or unenforceable is called a Paragraph IV certification. If the ANDA applicant does not challenge the Orange Book-listed patents or indicate that it is not seeking FDA approval of a method of use covered by a patent listed in the Orange Book for the RLD, the ANDA application will not be approved until all the Orange Book-listed patents for the RLD have expired. 
 If the ANDA applicant has provided a Paragraph IV certification to the FDA with respect to one or more patents listed in the Orange Book for the RLD, the ANDA applicant must also send notice of the Paragraph IV certification to the NDA holder for the RLD and 
 
16 
 
 the owner(s) of the Orange Book-listed patents for the RLD after the ANDA has been accepted for filing by the FDA. The NDA and patent owners may then initiate a patent infringement lawsuit against the ANDA applicant in response to the notice of the Paragraph IV certification. The filing of such a patent infringement lawsuit within 45 days after the receipt of a Paragraph IV notice automatically prevents the FDA from approving the ANDA until the earlier of 30 months, expiration of the patent, settlement of the lawsuit or a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the ANDA applicant. 
 The ANDA also will not be approved until any applicable non-patent exclusivity periods, such as exclusivity for obtaining approval of a new chemical entity, applicable to the RLD have expired. Federal law provides a period of five years following FDA approval of a RLD containing a new active moiety, during which time an ANDA for a generic version of the RLD cannot be filed with the FDA, unless the ANDA contains a Paragraph IV certification to an Orange Book-listed patent for the RLD, in which case the ANDA may be filed with the FDA four years following approval of the RLD. Federal law provides for a period of three years of exclusivity during which the FDA cannot grant effective approval of an ANDA if the RLD contains a previously approved active moiety and the application contained data from new clinical studies (other than bioavailability studies) conducted or sponsored by the sponsor that were essential to the approval of the application. This three-year exclusivity period often protects new drug products that contain a previously approved active moiety, such as a new dosage form, route of administration, combination or indication. Under the Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act, federal law also provides that periods of patent and non-patent marketing exclusivities listed in the Orange Book for a RLD may be extended by six months if the NDA sponsor conducts pediatric studies identified by the FDA in a written request. If such a written request is issued by the FDA, the FDA must grant pediatric exclusivity no later than six months prior to the date of expiration of patent or non-patent exclusivities in order for the six-month pediatric extension to apply to those exclusivity periods. 
 The Hatch-Waxman Act: Section 505(b)(2) New Drug Applications. Most drug products obtain FDA marketing approval pursuant to an NDA or an ANDA. A third alternative is a special type of NDA, commonly referred to as a Section 505(b)(2) NDA, which enables the applicant to rely, in part, on the FDAs prior findings of safety and efficacy for an approved product that is a RLD, or published literature, in support of its application. 
 Section 505(b)(2) NDAs often provide an alternate path to FDA approval for new or improved formulations or new uses of drugs containing previously approved active moieties. Section 505(b)(2) permits the filing of an NDA where at least some of the information required for approval comes from studies not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference. If the Section 505(b)(2) applicant can establish that reliance on the FDAs previous approval is scientifically appropriate, it may eliminate the need to conduct certain preclinical or clinical studies of the new product. The FDA may also require companies to perform additional studies or measurements to support the change from the approved product. The FDA may then approve the new product candidate for all or some of the label indications for which the RLD has been approved, as well as for any new indication sought by the Section 505(b)(2) applicant. 
 To the extent that the Section 505(b)(2) applicant is relying on studies conducted for an RLD, the applicant is required to certify to the FDA concerning any patents listed in the Orange Book for the RLD to the same extent that an ANDA applicant would. As a result, approval of a Section 505(b)(2) NDA may be delayed until all the Orange Book-listed patents relating the RLD have expired, until any non-patent exclusivities, such as exclusivity for obtaining approval of a new active moiety, listed in the Orange Book for the RLD have expired, and, in the case of a Paragraph IV certification and subsequent patent infringement suit, until the earlier of 30 months, settlement of the lawsuit or a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the Section 505(b)(2) applicant. 
 Combination Products 
 The FDA regulates combinations of products that cross FDA centers, such as drug, biologic or medical device components that are physically, chemically or otherwise combined into a single entity, as a combination product. The FDA center with primary jurisdiction for the combination product will take the lead in the premarket review of the product, with the other center consulting or collaborating with the lead center. The 21st Century Cures Act, or Cures Act, amended the provisions of the FDCA relating to the regulation of combination products to, among other things, require the FDA to conduct the premarket review of any combination product under a single application whenever appropriate. 
 In practice, the FDAs Office of Combination Products, or OCP, determines which center will have primary jurisdiction for the combination product based on the combination products primary mode of action. A mode of action is the means by which a product achieves an intended therapeutic effect or action. The primary mode of action is the mode of action that provides the most important therapeutic action of the combination product, or the mode of action expected to make the greatest contribution to the overall intended therapeutic effects of the combination product. 
 Often it is difficult for the OCP to determine with reasonable certainty the most important therapeutic action of the combination product. In those difficult cases, the OCP will consider consistency with other combination products raising similar types of safety and effectiveness questions, or which center has the most expertise to evaluate the most significant safety and effectiveness questions raised by the combination product. 
 
17 
 
If a combination product sponsor disagrees with OCPs primary mode of action determination, the Cures Act permits the sponsor to request that FDA provide a substantive rationale for its determination. The sponsor can then propose one or more studies to establish the relevance of the chemical action in achieving the products primary mode of action and FDA and the sponsor will collaborate to reach agreement on the design of such studies within 90 calendar days. If the sponsor conducts the agreed-upon studies, FDA must consider the resulting data when reevaluating the products primary mode of action. 
 Post-Market Drug Regulation 
 If the FDA approves a drug product for commercial marketing, it may limit the approved indications for use of the product, require that contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling, require that post-approval studies, including Phase 4 clinical trials, be conducted to further assess a drugs safety and/or other factors after approval, require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the product after commercialization and/or patients using the product for observation of the products long-term effects, or impose other conditions, including distribution restrictions or other risk management mechanisms, including Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies, or REMS, which can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the product. Any approved product is also subject to requirements relating to recordkeeping, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, advertising and promotion, labeling, and reporting of adverse experiences with the product. The FDA may prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of post-market studies or surveillance programs. After approval, some types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes and additional labeling claims, are subject to further testing requirements and FDA review and re-approval.
In addition, drug manufacturers with which we partner and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are required to register their establishments with the FDA and state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and these state agencies for compliance with cGMP requirements. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated and often require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon drug developers and their manufacturers. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the areas of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance. 
 Once an approval is granted, the FDA may withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including AEs of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information, imposition of post-market studies or clinical trials to assess new safety risks or imposition of distribution or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences of a failure to comply with regulatory requirements during or after the FDA approval process include, among other things: 
 

 | restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, product recalls or complete withdrawal of the product from the market;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | fines, warning or untitled letters or holds on post-approval clinical trials;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | refusal of the FDA to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications, or suspension or revocation of product license approvals;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; or
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | consent decrees, injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The FDA strictly regulates marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of products that are placed on the market. Drugs may be promoted only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off label uses may be subject to significant liability. 
 FDA Regulation of Companion Diagnostics 
 We may seek to develop or seek to partner with third parties to develop in vitro companion diagnostics for use in selecting the patients that we believe will respond to our drug therapeutics. Companion diagnostics are regulated by the FDA as medical devices. 
 In August 2014 the FDA issued guidance that addresses issues critical to developing in vitro companion diagnostics. The guidance states that if safe and effective use of a therapeutic product depends on an in vitro diagnostic, then the FDA generally will require approval or clearance of the diagnostic at the same time that the FDA approves the therapeutic product. In July 2016, the FDA issued a draft guidance intended to assist sponsors of the drug therapeutic and in vitro companion diagnostic device on issues related to co-development of the products. 
 
18 
 
The FDA generally requires in vitro companion diagnostics intended to select the patients intended to receive a cancer treatment to obtain approval of a pre-market application, or PMA approval, for that diagnostic simultaneously with approval of the drug. 
 Medical Device Approval Pathways 
 To be commercially distributed in the United States, a medical device, including an in vitro diagnostic, or IVD, must receive either 510(k) clearance, de novo authorization, or PMA approval from the FDA prior to marketing. There are three classes of medical devices recognized by the FDA, Class I (low risk), Class II (moderate risk), and Class III (high risk). Class III devices are those deemed by the FDA to pose the greatest risk, such as life-sustaining, life supporting or implantable devices, or devices deemed not substantially equivalent to a previously 510(k) cleared device or a pre-amendment Class III device for which PMAs have not been called. Class III devices generally require PMA approval prior to marketing. The PMA approval pathway requires that the subject device demonstrates a reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness of the device. 
 A PMA for an IVD typically includes data from preclinical studies and well-controlled clinical trials. Preclinical data for an IVD includes many different tests, including how reproducible the results are when the same sample is tested multiple times by multiple users at multiple laboratories. The clinical data need to establish that the test is safe and effective for the proposed intended use in the indicated population. In addition, the PMA must include information regarding the tests clinical utility, meaning that an IVD provides information that is clinically meaningful. Such information must be provided even if the clinical significance of the biomarker is obvious. The applicant may also rely upon published literature or submit data to the FDA to show clinical utility. 
 A PMA also must provide information about the device and its components regarding, among other things, device design, manufacturing and labeling. The sponsor must pay an application fee to the FDA upon submission of a PMA, which is just under $250,000 for Fiscal Year 2017. 
 As part of the PMA review, the FDA will typically inspect the manufacturers facilities for compliance with Quality System Regulation, or QSR, requirements, which impose elaborate testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures. 
 Upon submission, the FDA determines if the PMA is sufficiently complete to permit a substantive review, and, if so, the FDA accepts the application for filing. The FDA then commences an in-depth review of the PMA. The entire process typically takes multiple years from submission of the PMA, but may take longer. The review time is often significantly extended as a result of the FDA asking for more information or clarification of information already provided. The FDA also may respond with a not approvable determination based on deficiencies in the application and require additional clinical trial or other data that are often expensive and time-consuming to generate and can substantially delay approval. 
 During the review period, an FDA advisory committee, typically a panel of clinicians, may be convened to review the PMA application and recommend to the FDA whether, or upon what conditions, the device should be approved. Although the FDA is not bound by the advisory panel decision, the panels recommendation is important to the FDAs overall decision-making process. 
 If the FDAs evaluation of the PMA is favorable, the FDA typically issues an approvable letter requiring the applicants agreement to specific conditions, such as changes in labeling, or specific additional information, such as submission of final labeling, in order to secure final approval of the PMA. If the FDA concludes that the applicable criteria have been met, the FDA will issue a PMA approval for the approved indications, which can be more limited than those originally sought by the applicant. The PMA approval can include post-approval conditions that the FDA believes necessary to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the device, including, among other things, restrictions on labeling, promotion, sale and distribution. Failure to comply with the conditions of approval can result in an enforcement action, including the loss or withdrawal of the approval. 
 Even after approval of a PMA, a new PMA or PMA supplement may be required in the event of a modification to the device, its labeling or its manufacturing process. Supplements to a PMA often require the submission of the same type of information required for an original PMA, except that the supplement is generally limited to the information needed to support the proposed change from the product covered by the original PMA. 
 Clinical Trials and IDEs 
 A clinical trial is almost always required to support a PMA. For significant risk devices, the FDA regulations require that human clinical investigations conducted in the U.S. be approved via an Investigational Device Exemption, or IDE, which must be approved before clinical testing may commence. In some cases, one or more smaller IDE studies may precede a pivotal clinical trial intended to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of the investigational device. A 30-day waiting period after the submission of each IDE is required prior to the commencement of clinical testing in humans. FDA may disapprove, or approve with conditions, the IDE within the 30-day period. If disapproved, the clinical trial may not begin until the deficiencies noted by FDA are addressed, and another IDE is submitted to the FDA for approval. If approved with conditions, the sponsor must address the conditions prior to commencement of the trial. If FDA does not respond to the sponsor within the 30-day period, the IDE is deemed approved and the clinical study may commence. 
 
19 
 
IVD trials usually do not require an IDE approval, so long as, among other things, the results of the IVD test are not used diagnostically without confirmation of the test results by another, medically established diagnostic product or procedure. For a trial where the IVD result directs the therapeutic care of patients with cancer, we believe that the FDA would likely consider the investigation to require an IDE application. 
 An IDE application must be supported by appropriate data, such as laboratory test results, showing that it is safe to test the device in humans and that the testing protocol is scientifically sound. The IDE application must also include a description of product manufacturing and controls, and a proposed clinical trial protocol. The FDA typically grants IDE approval for a specified number of patients. All clinical studies of investigational devices, regardless of whether IDE approval is required, require approval from IRBs. 
 During the clinical trial, the sponsor must comply with the FDAs IDE requirements for investigator selection, trial monitoring, reporting and record keeping. The investigators must obtain patient informed consent, rigorously follow the investigational plan and study protocol, control the disposition of investigational devices and comply with all reporting and record keeping requirements. These IDE requirements apply to all investigational devices, whether considered significant or nonsignificant risk. Prior to granting PMA approval, the FDA typically inspects the records relating to the conduct of the study and the clinical data supporting the PMA for compliance with applicable requirements. 
 Clinical trials must be conducted: (i) in compliance with federal regulations; (ii) in compliance with good clinical practice, or GCP, an international standard intended to protect the rights and health of patients and to define the roles of clinical trial sponsors, investigators, and monitors; and (iii) under protocols detailing the objectives of the trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety, and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. 
 The FDA may order the temporary, or permanent, discontinuation of a clinical trial at any time, or impose other sanctions, if it believes that the clinical trial either is not being conducted in accordance with FDA requirements or presents an unacceptable risk to the clinical trial patients. An IRB may also require the clinical trial at a study site to be halted, either temporarily or permanently, for failure to comply with the IRBs requirements, or may impose other conditions. 
 Although the QSR does not fully apply to investigational devices, the requirement for controls on design and development does apply. The sponsor also must manufacture the investigational device in conformity with the quality controls described in the IDE application and any conditions of IDE approval that the FDA may impose with respect to manufacturing. 
 Investigational IVDs may only be distributed for use in an investigation, and the labeling must prominently contain the statement For Investigational Use Only. The performance characteristics of this product have not been established.
 Expedited Access Pathway Program 
 In April 2015, the FDA issued a final guidance document establishing the EAP program. The EAP program is intended to speed patient access to devices (including companion diagnostics) that demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for life threatening or irreversibly debilitating diseases or conditions and are subject to PMA approval or de novo authorization. In order to be accepted into the EAP program, a sponsor must demonstrate to the FDAs satisfaction that the device is intended to treat or diagnose a life-threatening or irreversibly debilitating disease or condition and that it addresses an unmet need. The sponsor must also submit an acceptable draft Data Development Plan. Once accepted into the program, the FDA intends to engage with sponsors of EAP Devices earlier and more interactively during the devices development, assessment, and review. The FDA will also work with the device sponsor to try to reduce the time and cost from development to an approval decision. Elements of the EAP program may include priority review, interactive review, senior management involvement, and assignment of a case manager. 
Post-Market Device Regulation 
 After a device obtains FDA approval and is on the market, numerous regulatory requirements apply. These requirements include the QSR, labeling regulations, the FDAs general prohibition against promoting products for unapproved or off-label uses, the Medical Device Reporting regulation, which requires that manufacturers report to the FDA if their device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if it were to recur, and the Reports of Corrections and Removals regulation, which requires manufacturers to report recalls and field actions to the FDA if initiated to reduce a risk to health posed by the device or to remedy a violation of the FDCA. 
 The FDA enforces these requirements by inspection and market surveillance. If the FDA finds a violation, it can institute a wide variety of enforcement actions, ranging from a public warning letter to more severe sanctions such as fines, injunctions and civil penalties; recall or seizure of products; operating restrictions, partial suspension or total shutdown of production; refusing requests for PMA approval of new products; withdrawing PMA approvals already granted; and criminal prosecution. 
 
20 
 
Foreign Regulation 
 To obtain marketing approval of a drug under European Union regulatory systems, we may submit marketing authorization applications, or MAAs, either under a centralized or decentralized procedure. The centralized procedure provides for the grant of a single marketing authorization that is valid for all European Union member states. The centralized procedure is compulsory for medicines produced by specified biotechnological processes, products designated as orphan medicinal products, and products with a new active substance indicated for the treatment of specified diseases, and optional for those products that are highly innovative or for which a centralized process is in the interest of patients. Under the centralized procedure in the European Union, the maximum timeframe for the evaluation of an MAA is 210 days, excluding clock stops, when additional written or oral information is to be provided by the applicant in response to questions asked by the Scientific Advice Working Party of the Committee of Medicinal Products for Human Use, or the CHMP. Accelerated evaluation might be granted by the CHMP in exceptional cases, when a medicinal product is expected to be of a major public health interest, defined by three cumulative criteria comprising the seriousness of the disease, such as heavy disabling or life-threatening diseases, to be treated; the absence or insufficiency of an appropriate alternative therapeutic approach; and anticipation of high therapeutic benefit. In this circumstance, the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, ensures that the opinion of the CHMP is given within 150 days. 
 The EMA grants orphan drug designation to promote the development of products that may offer therapeutic benefits for life-threatening or chronically debilitating conditions affecting not more than five in 10,000 people in the European Union. In addition, orphan drug designation can be granted if the drug is intended for a life threatening, seriously debilitating or serious and chronic condition in the European Union and without incentives it is unlikely that sales of the drug in the European Union would be sufficient to justify developing the drug. Orphan drug designation is only available if there is no other satisfactory method approved in the European Union of diagnosing, preventing or treating the condition, or if such a method exists, the proposed orphan drug will be of significant benefit to patients. Orphan drug designation provides opportunities for free protocol assistance, fee reductions for access to the centralized regulatory procedures before and during the first year after marketing authorization and between 6 and 10 years of market exclusivity following drug approval. The EMA has us granted orphan drug designation for entrectinib for the treatment of neuroblastoma. 
 The decentralized procedure for submitting an MAA provides an assessment of an application performed by one member state, known as the reference member state, and the approval of that assessment by one or more other member states, known as concerned member states. Under this procedure, an applicant submits an application, or dossier, and related materials, including a draft summary of product characteristics, and draft labeling and package leaflet, to the reference member state and concerned member states. The reference member state prepares a draft assessment and drafts of the related materials within 120 days after receipt of a valid application. Within 90 days of receiving the reference member states assessment report, each concerned member state must decide whether to approve the assessment report and related materials. If a member state cannot approve the assessment report and related materials on the grounds of potential serious risk to public health, the disputed points may eventually be referred to the European Commission, whose decision is binding on all member states. Prior to submitting an MAA for use of drugs in pediatric populations, the EMA requires submission of, or a request for waiver or deferral of, a Pediatric Investigation Plan. 
 In the European Union, new chemical entities qualify for eight years of data exclusivity upon marketing authorization and an additional two years of market exclusivity. This data exclusivity, if granted, prevents regulatory authorities in the European Union from assessing a generic (abbreviated) application for eight years, after which generic marketing authorization can be submitted but not approved for two years. Even if a compound is considered to be a new chemical entity and the sponsor is able to gain the prescribed period of data exclusivity, another company nevertheless could also market another version of the drug if such company can complete a full MAA with a complete human clinical trial database and obtain marketing approval of its product. 
 Additional Regulations and Environmental Matters 
 In addition to FDA restrictions on marketing of pharmaceutical products, several other types of state and federal laws restrict certain marketing practices in the pharmaceutical industry. These laws, which generally will not be applicable to us or our product candidates unless and until we obtain FDA marketing approval for any of our product candidates, include state and federal anti-kickback, fraud and abuse, false claims, physician payment sunshine and privacy and security laws and regulations regarding providing drug samples. 
 The federal healthcare program anti-kickback statute prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving remuneration to induce or in return for purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for the purchase, lease or order of any healthcare item or service reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid or other federally financed healthcare programs. Violations of the federal anti-kickback statute are punishable by imprisonment, criminal fines, civil monetary penalties and exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs. A person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. In addition, the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal False Claims Act. 
 
21 
 
Federal false claims laws prohibit any person from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false claim for payment to the federal government, or knowingly making, or causing to be made, a false statement to have a false claim paid. Recently, several pharmaceutical companies have been prosecuted under these laws for allegedly inflating drug prices they report to pricing services, which in turn were used by the government to set Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement rates, and for allegedly providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product. In addition, certain marketing practices, including off-label promotion, may also violate false claims laws. 
 The majority of states also have statutes or regulations similar to the federal anti-kickback law and false claims laws, which apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in several states, apply regardless of the payer. 
 The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, or HIPAA, also created federal criminal statutes that prohibit among other actions, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors, knowingly and willfully embezzling or stealing from a healthcare benefit program, willfully obstructing a criminal investigation of a healthcare offense, and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. Similar to the federal anti-kickback statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. 
 HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, and its implementing regulations, also imposes certain requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information. Among other things, HITECH makes HIPAAs security standards directly applicable to business associates, independent contractors or agents of covered entities that receive or obtain protected health information in connection with providing a service on behalf of a covered entity. HITECH also created four new tiers of civil monetary penalties, amended HIPAA to make civil and criminal penalties directly applicable to business associates, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorneys fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. 
 There has also been a recent trend of increased federal and state regulation of payments made to physicians and other healthcare providers. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, or collectively, the Affordable Care Act, among other things, imposes reporting requirements on certain drug manufacturers for payments made by them to physicians and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. Failure to submit required information may result in civil monetary penalties of up to an aggregate of $150,000 per year (or up to an aggregate of $1 million per year for knowing failures), for all payments, transfers of value or ownership or investment interests that are not timely, accurately and completely reported in an annual submission. Drug manufacturers are required to submit reports to the government by the 90th day of each calendar year. Certain states also mandate implementation of compliance programs, impose restrictions on drug manufacturer marketing practices and/or require the tracking and reporting of marketing expenditures and pricing information as well as gifts, compensation and other remuneration to physicians. 
 Additionally, the Prescription Drug Marketing Act, or the PDMA, imposes requirements and limitations upon the provision of drug samples to physicians, as well as prohibits states from licensing distributors of prescription drugs unless the state licensing program meets certain federal guidelines that include minimum standards for storage, handling and record keeping. In addition, the PDMA sets forth civil and criminal penalties for violations. If we obtain approval from the FDA to market any of our drug product candidates, these product sampling restrictions may impact and curtail our marketing efforts to physicians. 
 Further, sales of any of our product candidates that may be approved will depend, in part, on the extent to which the cost of the product will be covered by third party payers. Third party payers may limit coverage to an approved list of products, or formulary, which might not include all drug products approved by the FDA for an indication. Any product candidates for which we obtain marketing approval may not be considered medically necessary or cost-effective by third party payers, and we may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in the future to demonstrate the medical necessity and/or cost effectiveness of any such product. The U.S. government, state legislatures and foreign governments have shown increased interest in implementing cost containment programs to limit government-paid health care costs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products. Continued interest in and adoption of such controls and measures, and tightening of restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could limit payments for pharmaceuticals such as the product candidates we are developing.

 Healthcare Reform 
 A primary trend in the U.S. healthcare industry and elsewhere is cost containment. Government authorities and other third-party payors have attempted to control costs by limiting coverage and the amount of reimbursement for particular medical products, implementing reductions in Medicare and other healthcare funding, and applying new payment methodologies. For example, in March 2010, the Affordable Care Act was enacted, which, among other things, subjected drug manufacturers to new annual fees based on pharmaceutical companies share of sales to federal healthcare programs; created a new Patient Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research; creation of the Independent Payment Advisory Board, which has authority to recommend certain changes to the Medicare program that could result in reduced payments for prescription drugs; and establishment of a Center for Medicare Innovation at the CMS to test innovative payment and service delivery models to lower Medicare and Medicaid spending. 
 We expect that the new presidential administration and U.S. Congress will seek to modify, repeal, or otherwise invalidate all, or certain provisions of, the Affordable Care Act. Since taking office, President Trump has continued to support the repeal of all or portions of the Affordable Care Act. In January 2017, the House and Senate passed a budget resolution that authorizes congressional committees to draft legislation to repeal all or portions of the Affordable Care Act and permits such legislation to pass with a majority vote in the Senate. President Trump has also recently issued an executive order in which he stated that it is his administrations policy to seek the prompt repeal of the Affordable Care Act and directed executive departments and federal agencies to waive, defer, grant exemptions from, or delay the implementation of the provisions of the Affordable Care Act to the maximum extent permitted by law. There is still uncertainty with respect to the impact President Trumps administration and the U.S. Congress may have, if any, and any changes will likely take time to unfold, and could have an impact on coverage and reimbursement for healthcare items and services covered by plans that were authorized by the Affordable Care Act. However, we cannot predict the ultimate content, timing or effect of any healthcare reform legislation or the impact of potential legislation on us. 
 In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the United States since the Affordable Care Act to reduce healthcare expenditures. These changes include aggregate reductions of Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year that, due to subsequent legislative amendments, will remain in effect through 2025 unless additional action is taken by Congress. On January 2, 2013, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 was signed into law, which, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several types of providers, including hospitals, imaging centers and cancer treatment centers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. Recently there has been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed products, which has resulted in several Congressional inquiries and proposed bills designed to, among other things, reform government program reimbursement methodologies. 
 Corporate Overview 
 Infinity Oil & Gas Company, or Parent, was incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on August 21, 2012. Ignyta was incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware on August 29, 2011, with the name NexDx, Inc. On October 31, 2013, IGAS Acquisition Corp, a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent, merged with and into Ignyta, and Ignyta survived the merger and became the wholly owned subsidiary of Parent. Upon the closing of the merger, Parent ceased to be a shell company under applicable rules of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC. In connection with the merger, Parent changed its name to Ignyta, Inc. and Ignyta changed its name to Ignyta Operating, Inc. 
 On October 31, 2013, Parent effected a 100-to-one reverse stock split of its issued and outstanding shares of common stock, and all share information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K with respect to Parent gives retroactive effect to that reverse stock split. 
 On October 31, 2013, in connection with the closing of the merger, (i) all then-outstanding shares of each series of Ignytas preferred stock were voluntarily converted into shares of Ignytas common stock in accordance with Ignytas certificate of incorporation, and (ii) Ignyta effected a three-to-one reverse stock split of its issued and outstanding shares of capital stock. All share information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K with respect to Ignytas capital stock gives retroactive effect to that reverse stock split. 
 Concurrent with the closing of the merger, Parent abandoned its pre-merger business plan in the oil and gas industry, and we now solely pursue the business of Ignyta in the oncology drug development industry. 
 On June 12, 2014, Parent merged with and into Ignyta, with Ignyta surviving the merger and changing its name to Ignyta, Inc. The following discussion describes our current business.
