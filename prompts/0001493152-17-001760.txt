History
 
We were incorporated in the State of Nevada on January 5, 2005 under the name Premier Platform Holding Company, Inc. The Company changed its name to Paolo Nevada Enterprises, Inc. on February 4, 2005. On August 18, 2006, the Company completed a merger with Premier Platform Holding Company, Inc., a Colorado corporation, where Paolo Nevada Enterprises, Inc. was the surviving entity. On November 1, 2006, the Company changed its name to the David Loren Corporation. On July 5, 2013, More Superannuation Fund, an Australian entity (“More”), obtained control of the Company from Beachwood Capital, LLC, a Nevada limited liability company. On August 23, 2013, the Company changed its name to Kibush Capital Corporation.
 
On May 26, 2014, we became an initial subscriber to Aqua Mining Limited, a Papua New Guinea limited company (“Aqua Mining”) resulting in a 49% interest. On March 23, 2015, the Company increased its ownership in Aqua Mining from 49% to 90% in exchange for assignment of the Company’s entire interest in the Koranga Joint Venture to Aqua Mining. Due to the increase in ownership and due to the fact that the additional interest in Aqua Mining was acquired from a related party we changed the ament accounting treatment for this asset and are now consolidating its financials with our own. For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016, Aqua Mining had revenues of $138256, $118,889 in assets and $605,243 in liabilities, of which $493,443 are loans from Kibush Corp.
 
The Company acquired control of Angel Jade Pty Ltd., an Australian limited company (“Angel Jade”) through a series of transactions as follows: In October 2014, the Company negotiated the acquisition of a 50% interest in Angel Jade (which was 90,000,000 shares of common stock) from Five Arrows Limited in exchange for 14,000,000 shares of our common stock. However, this agreement was not formalized until December 10, 2014. On October 9, 2014, the Company acquired 3,673,470 shares of newly issued common stock of Angel Jade in exchange for $17,170 ($19,584 AUD). These two transactions combined were intended to provided Kibush Capital with exactly 51% of the common stock of Angel Jade and control of the that company. On November 6, 2014, the Company further increased its ownership of Angel Jade by purchasing an additional 45,918,300 shares of common stock directly from Angel Jade for $215,994 ($250,000 AUD) and by purchasing 18,367,350 share of common stock from Laima Trust for $86,398 ($100,000 AUD). However, in May of 2016, Angel Jade director and minority owner Alexander King was able to gain control of the company terminate all of Kibush Capital’s ownership interest in Angel Jade. As a result, the Company has not consolidated any financial information of Angel Jade and has written off Angel Jade for the purposes of this report. However, that does not mean the Company will forfeit its available remedies regarding Angel Jade, as the Company believes that the changes Mr. King made to Angel Jade were in violation of Australian law. In fact, on or about September 12, 2016, the Company commenced legal proceedings against Mr. King and others in Australia as described further in Item 3, Legal Proceedings below.
 
The Company is an “emerging growth company” as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act (“JOBS Act”).
 
Our auditors have issued a going concern opinion. This means that our auditors believe there is substantial doubt that we can continue as an on-going business for the next twelve months unless we obtain additional capital to pay our bills. This is because we have not generated any significant revenues from our current business. In addition, we have sustained losses for the past two years and have a negative working capital at September 30, 2016. We must raise cash from sources other than operations. Our only other source for cash at this time is investments by others in our company. We must raise cash to continue our mining exploration activities and business development.
 
Our Business
 
Our business is comprised of timber logging and mining exploration through our subsidiary Aqua Mining. Our primary office is located at 7 Sarah Crescent, Templestowe, Victoria 3106, Australia. The Company is an exploration stage company and there is no assurance that a commercially viable mineral deposit exists on any of our properties. Further exploration will be required before a final evaluation as to the economic and legal feasibility is determined.
 
On February 14, 2014, we entered into an Assignment and Bill of Sale with Five Arrows Limited (“Five Arrows”) pursuant to which Five Arrows agreed to assign to the Company all of its right, title and interest in two 50 ton per hour trammels, one 35 ton excavator, a warehouse/office, a concrete processing apron and four 35 ton per hour particle concentrators which may be utilized for alluvial mining, the assignment also conveyed Five Arrow’s interest in a joint venture with the holders of mining leases (“Leaseholders”) for gold exploration in Papua New Guinea, specifically Mining Leases ML296-301 and ML278 covering approximately 26 hectares located at Koranga in Wau, Morobe Province, Papua, New Guinea (the “Koranga Property”). In consideration therefore, the Company issued 40,000,000 shares of its common stock to Five Arrows. On February 28, 2014, we entered into a joint venture agreement with the Leaseholders (the “Joint Venture Agreement”) for the exploration of minerals on the Koranga Property. The Joint Venture Agreement entitles the leaseholders to 30% and the Company to 70% of net profits from the joint venture. On May 23rd 2015 this Joint Venture was sold to our subsidiary Aqua Mining (PNG) Ltd. Aqua Mining will manage and carry out the exploration at the site, including entering into contracts with third parties and subcontractors (giving priority to the Leaseholders and their relatives and the local community for employment opportunities and spin-off business) at its cost, and all assets, including equipment and structures built on the site, will be the property of the Company. The Leaseholders and Aqua Mining will each contribute 1% from their share of net profits to a trust account for landowner and government requirements. For the period ending September 30, 2014 we have incurred expenditure of $208,512 primarily spent on exploration. From October through to December there has been an expenditure of $56,526 on capital equipment and further exploration costs.

The joint venture involves a lease that, between 2008 and 2011, has produced a total of 55,300 cubic meters of mined material which was processed to extract 51,000 grams of gold – raw weight (approximately 31kg pure gold) over the three years of mining activities. Gold production in 2010 averaged 1.97kg per month and in 2011 averaged 2.26kg per month. The overall raw gold grade is 0.92g per cubic meter. Pure gold grade is 0.55g per cubic meter. The Company is currently in the exploration stage for this lease. If and when successful, the Company may endeavor to undertake additional joint ventures on neighboring leaseholds (8 leaseholds border the area) to capitalize on the infrastructure and equipment we may install at Koranga.
 
We entered into a memorandum of understanding, dated May 1, 2014 with New Guinea Gold Corporation, for the purchase of New Guinea Gold Ltd., which was terminated by us on May 24, 2014 prior to commencing any transactions contemplated in connection therewith. The Company has no continuing obligations as a result of such termination.
 
Aqua Mining
 
Mining:
 
Aqua Mining is currently in the exploration stage. Aqua Mining was created to undertake certain opportunities that exist within the mining sector of the economy of Papua New Guinea. The Director Mr. Vincent Appo, has extensive experience and knowledge in this sector and has over the years assembled a vast network of contacts and contractors that will assist the company in their managerial and operational endeavors. From the outset the company is negotiating over 2 mine sites for further exploration.
 
Aqua Mining in the past six months has negotiated and finalized with landowners in the WAU area of PNG, Joint Ventures to conduct mineral exploration activities. These Joint Venture Agreements will form the basis of applications to the Mining Resource Authority in PNG for Mining Licenses. In addition, Aqua Mining has been accepted as a developer of AML 694-695.
 
On or about April 8, 2015, the Company commenced exploration of the Alluvial Mining Lease 694/695 via its Subsidiary Aqua Mining PNG Limited. Mr. Vincent Appo, PNG Operations Manager, is overseeing the construction of the required infrastructure which is required for the Company’s exploration activities.
 
On or about April 16, 2015, the Company announced commencement of a Jorc/43-101 report on the Mining Lease 694/695 and pending Mining Lease 296/301 held by its subsidiary, Aqua Mining PNG Limited.
 
Ken Unamba, a member of the Advisory Committee has been nominated to oversee this report. Vincent Appo, PNG Operations Manager, has undertaken substantial testing over the past 12 months on both areas and has enough data as a basis for assessment and review. Mr. Unamba will undertake additional surveys and sampling where necessary to provide further data to finalize the report to Kibush Capital.
 
Logging:
 
The Company, through its subsidiary Aqua Mining, was successful in obtaining Government approval for the commercialization of timber resources at Kubuna and Rigo, Papua New Guinea. The area that we have agreements with the landowners cover at Kubuna 40,000 hectares and Rigo 25,000 hectares. We have commenced logging during the December quarter at Rigo and expect to commence at Kubuna during the March quarter. Both sites are excellent resources covering many species of wood, mainly hardwoods kwila and rosewood, there are a number of exotic wood types. It has taken us some time to establish the infrastructure at Rigo, but we have now completed the access road works and established a base camp for 38 on-site workers.

Paradise Gardens Development 
 
Kibush Capital Corporation had entered into a management agreement with Paradise Gardens Development (PNG) Ltd, a Timber Logging and Processing Company with operations in Papua New Guinea (“Paradise Gardens”). The Company has the right to Paradise Gardens operates a Timber Authority registered with the PNG Forest Authority which permits an annual timber harvest of 5000 cubic meters, the total area under the Timber Authority is 3300 hectares. Predominant species include Terminalia, Aglaia, White Cheesewood, Pink Satinwood, Erima, Taun, Rosewood, Kwila and other hardwoods. Paradise Gardens primarily sells its timber locally to retailers and wholesalers in Papua New Guinea. The Company concluded the acquisition of Paradise Gardens on October 7th 2016. During the negotiation period, (June 2015 to October 7th 2016) the Company’s management fee includes the profit earned by Paradise Gardens during such period. 
Market
 
Mining:
 
The primary product is Gold and our market price based on the London Metals Exchange Daily Rate. This rate determines a market price for all material sold within the Refinery Market. Outside of that market competition dictates the price available, and that competition has effectively no difference in the quality of the material as it based on a gold percentage. A higher price can be obtained by selling to the spot traders who can distribute the material at lower volumes to industry consumers.
Timber:
 
Initially, we are focusing on the domestic market in Papua New Guinea, where there are a number of major suppliers to the retail market place. As our capacity increases, we will look to export timber to the nearby Australian and Asian markets where demand is greater than supply.
Marketing and Distribution:
 
As the principal material is gold, the options are to sell either to a refinery and be paid the daily spot rate, or to sell to the jewelry wholesale market. Both of these options exist internally within PNG however the wholesale market is quite small. There are several options when the material is exported from PNG, again it could be to any refinery within the region and that rate again would be the daily spot rate. The wholesale market outside the country would be significant and there are many opportunities within Australia to sell at a higher than spot rate to that market. There may also be parties that would take up the material on a contractual basis.
 
The timber products will be marketed and distributed from our Timber Yard at Laloki (30 minutes North East from Port Moresby PNG). This facility is within easy reach of trade customers and gives quick access to our wholesale customers. In addition, it provides an opportunity for retail sales to be made direct to end consumers. We have developed marketing and distribution strategies based upon our experience working with the Paradise Gardens customer base over the last 12 months.
 
Competition
 
The mining industry is acutely competitive in all of its phases. We face strong competition from other mining companies in connection with the acquisition of exploration stage properties or properties containing gold, jade and other mineral reserves. Many of these companies have greater financial resources, operational experience and technical capabilities than us. It is our goal to find undervalued properties and team up with local joint venture partners to streamline our time to market and costs. In PNG in particular we are finding a number of such properties, as the enforcement of the Mining Act has forced traditional landowners to comply with the relevant requirements of the act. Their ability to do so is limited as they do not have the financial, or management resources to comply.
 
The logging industry is very competitive in Papua New Guinea. We believe that our policy of working with the landowners and providing direct employment to the local villagers appears to provide us with a competitive advantage of greater acceptance of our activities by government officials, local businesses and local Papua New Guineans.
 
Raw Materials, Principal Suppliers and Customers
 
We are not dependent on any principal suppliers and our raw materials are produced principally through our own mining activities. Our principal customers for our mining activities are refineries based in PNG. A wholesale customer base is yet to be established but that will occur over the next 12 months, after the company received the appropriate export licenses from the PNG government.

We are not dependent on any principal suppliers and our timber materials are produced principally through our logging activities. There are number of principal customers that we are focused on with the domestic market in PNG. We have established that customer base over the last 12 months and the company is now concentrating on formalizing supply agreements to those customers.
 
Intellectual Property 
 
Intellectual property is not a large part of our current business model as we are selling non-unique materials through primarily conventional channels. One or more brands may yet be developed if we determine branding will benefit the Company.
Government Regulations 
 
Our products and services are subject to foreign, federal, state, provincial and local laws and regulations concerning business activities in general, including the laws of Papua New Guinea and Australia. Our operations will be affected from time to time in varying degrees by domestic and foreign political developments, foreign, federal and state laws.
Aqua Mining
 
As the 90% owner of Aqua Mining [PNG] Limited, a Papua, New Guinea company, we are required to obtain approval from the Investment Promotion Authority of Papua New Guinea to be recognized as a foreign investor for our mineral exploration joint venture with the Leaseholders of approximately 26 hectares located at Koranga in Wau, Morobe Province, Papua, New Guinea.
 
On July 24, 2015, we received final approval from the Papua New Guinea Department of Environment and Conservation, the Papua New Guinea Mining Resources Authority and the Mining Advisory Committee. This approval allows for mechanized processing on land controlled by the Koranga Joint Venture for a period of 20 years and Aqua Mining is the licensed contract miner for a period of 5 years. This AML license is limited to 50,000 tones of processing per year and to a maximum of 5-hectares of mining at any one time. We must report our exploration activities and sales monthly to the Mining Resource Authority and comply with the terms of the agreements with the landowners. The tribute agreement for this land requires contribution of 2% of gross sales over 3 grams of ton and 2% of gross sales when under 5 grams per ton.
 
Environmental Regulations:
 
Under our Alluvial Mining Lease, we must comply with the provisions of the Mining Act pertaining to Environmental requirements. We are subject to applicable environmental legislation including specific site conditions attached to the mining tenements imposed by the PNG Government Department of Environment and Conservation (“DEC”), the terms and conditions of operating licenses issued by the PNG Mineral Resources Authority (“MRA”) and DEC, and the environment permits for water extraction and waste discharge issued by DEC. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014, the PNG Parliament approved a name change for the Department of Environment and Conservation to the Conservation Environment Protection Authority and that change has become effective.
 
Under our Logging TA, we must comply with the provisions of the Forestry Act 1991 pertaining to Environmental requirements. We are subject to applicable environmental legislation including specific site conditions attached to the Logging TA imposed by the PNG Government Department of Environment and Conservation (“DEC”), the terms and conditions of operating licenses issued by the PNG Forest Authority (“FA”) and DEC, and the environment permits for water extraction and waste discharge issued by DEC. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014, the PNG Parliament approved a name change for the Department of Environment and Conservation to the Conservation Environment Protection Authority and that change has become effective.
