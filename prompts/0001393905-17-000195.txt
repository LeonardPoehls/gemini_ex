Overview

The Company was incorporated on February 23, 2005 under the laws of the state of Nevada. We have had several changes in our officers and directors since inception up to March 9, 2010 when Mr. Kam Shah became our chairman of the board of directors, president, secretary, treasurer and chief executive officer. Effective September 30, 2014, Mr. Terence Robinson was appointed as the Chairman of the Board of directors and Chief Executive Officer of the Company. Mr. Shah continued as a director and a Chief Financial Officer and Secretary of the Company until July 15, 2015 when he resigned all his positions and Mr. Robinson was appointed to fill the roles of Chief Financial Officer, Secretary and Treasurer of the Company. Mr. Shah continues to provide accounting services as consultant.

On March 31, 2017, the Company changed its name from ZD Ventures Corporation to Plyzer Technologies Inc. (PLYZER, the Company).

The Company has two subsidiaries, Plyzer Corporation, incorporated in the State of Delaware on December 9, 2016 and Plyzer Technologies (Canada) Inc., incorporated in the Province of Ontario, Canada on April 11, 2017.

Our principal office is located at 47 Avenue Road, Suite 200, Toronto, Ontario, Canada M5R 2G3. Our telephone number is (416) 860-0211. Our fiscal year end is March 31. Our Canadian subsidiary signed an assignment of lease on May 6, 2017 for premises at 67 Portland St., Toronto, Ontario M5V 2M9, Canada which will expire on December 30, 2017.

PLYZERs business strategy until March 2015 involved developing a social website, B Wished, acquired in July 2012 aimed at driving traffic for various sellers of products and services which can generate revenue through commissions from the associated sellers and advertisements, as well as other related sources for the Company. However, at the end of March 31, 2015, the Management concluded that this was not a commercially viable business and decided to expense all the costs related to this project. During the fiscal year 2016, the Company also wrote off small investments it had in couple of emerging technology companies in Spain due to unavailability of adequate information from these entities to support any valuation of these investments.

On November 21, 2016, The Company signed a consulting agreement with an independent Spanish Corporation, Lupama Producciones, S.L. (Lupama). Lupamas key owner, Luis Pallares became the CEO of Plyzer Technologies (Canada) Inc.

Luis Pallares, is a serial entrepreneur with a computer science background from MIT, also founder of Nennisiwok, Digital Agency NYC, Visual Underground Media & Prod TC, and co-founder of Babypod, Addhoc, Lupama Producciones, among others.

Lupama and Luis are creating an artificial intelligence driven engine for price comparison for the Company, known as Plyzer. The focus is on the development of the backend and frontend for customer use to release a beta site in the third quarter of 2017. While the company has so far produced a fairly stable and polished site, it lacks a lot of testing work. In addition to the testing, we also need to finish the composition of some back and front end details and the configuration of some events. After this soft launch, we will review and update any issues that may arise at this stage and build new features to integrate during the public launch expected to be later in the year or early next year. We are currently using development environments and testing production environments.

When Plyzer becomes commercially viable, the Company expects revenue streams from several sources like user fee, advertisements, data mining and licencing the technologies for different products and geographical regions.

The Company has however, not yet generated or realized any revenues from business operations.

The Company's auditors have issued a going concern opinion on our audited financial statements for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2017. This means that our auditors believe there is a substantial doubt that the Company can continue as an on-going business for the next twelve months unless it obtains additional capital to pay its bills. PLYZER has recently secured funds through issuance of convertible loans and is pursuing with potential investors to raise equity funding through private placement. However, the Company has not yet generated significant revenues and its current business activities are at a very early stage of development and will need some time before they can generate revenue, if any. It is not possible to project the time when revenue, if any may begin or if the Company will be successful in raising alternative funding to support its current development plans.

The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the financial statements of the Company and the accompanying notes appearing subsequently under the caption "Financial Statements.

Employees

As of March 31, 2017, the Company employed no full- time and no- part time employees. Hiring employees over the next twelve months will depend on the continued implementation of the current business strategy and if the required funds are raised. It is likely that for now, the Company will resort to hiring consultants as and when needed rather than employ people on a full time basis to keep its operational costs at a minimum.
Patents and Trademarks

We do not own, either legally or beneficially, any patents or trademarks.
