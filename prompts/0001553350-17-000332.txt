ITEM 1.
BUSINESS.
 The Company
 We design, manufacture, market and distribute worldwide the Puradyn® bypass oil filtration system (the "Puradyn" or system) for use with substantially all internal combustion engines and hydraulic equipment that use lubricating oil. Working in conjunction with the equipments full-flow oil filter, the Puradyn system cleans oil by providing a second circuit of oil filtration and treatment to continually remove solid, liquid and gaseous contaminants from the oil through a sophisticated and unique filtration and evaporation or absorption process. The Puradyn system consists of a base filtration unit or housing that is connected via hoses to the engine or hydraulic system, along with filter elements that reside inside the filtration unit and are replaced periodically to maintain top performance. Our filter is unique in that it incorporates an additive package to replenish depleted base additive levels in engine lubricating oil. Because Puradyn-filtered lubricating oil is kept in a continually clean state, our system has been used effectively to safely and significantly extend oil-drain intervals and to extend the time between engine overhauls. We are the exclusive manufacturer of our unique disposable replacement filter elements ("Element") for the Puradyn system.
 Products
 The core product, the patented Puradyn bypass oil filtration system, is offered in two models, MTS and a custom-engineered hydraulic system, which can be attached to almost any engine or hydraulic application. The Puradyn bypass filtration system is similar to a kidney dialysis machine that provides an additional filtration circuit outside the body/engine to filter blood/oil and rid it of impurities, keeping the blood/oil continually clean. Whenever the engine or machinery is operating, the Puradyn is extracting from the oil solid particles down to less than one micron (1/39 millionth of an inch), as well as gaseous and liquid contaminants, protecting the engine or hydraulic equipment from harmful wear and less efficient operation caused by these contaminants. Puradyn replacement filter elements may contain an additive package that serves to replenish base additives (in engine lube oil only) in the oil during the filtration process, helping to maintain the oils proper chemical balance and viscosity.
 Oil condition is monitored through periodic analysis of small oil samples. If the sample results show that the condition of the oil is considered good for continued use, the Puradyn filter element is changed in lieu of performing a scheduled oil change. 
 Consequently, the Puradyn system significantly reduces maintenance costs by decreasing oil consumption, engine wear and certain other types of general maintenance as well as reducing environmental impact and concerns and costs associated with the storage and disposal of waste oil. Depending on the application, potential savings from utilizing the Puradyn system generally provide a relatively short average payback period of 3 to 12 months, during which time the customers oil and labor savings more than recoup the cost of the filtration unit and expended filter elements. 
 The MTS System is offered in seven different-sized systems that can be used in single or multiple configurations to effectively filter sizes from small (4 qt. / 3.8 L) to large (510 gal. / 1930.50 L) sump capacity engines, allowing the product to be used virtually on most engines in every industry. The MTS model offers water contaminant removal through the Companys patented Polydry® polymer technology embedded in each filter element. 
 The hydraulic filtration system provides the same filtration efficiency and ability to remove water and solid particles as our engine filtration systems and is capable of handling hydraulic fluids with capacities up to 1,500 gallons (5,678 liters). Certain hydraulic filtration systems being developed now will easily adapt to other industries where our systems are already operating in engine lube applications.
 All Puradyn systems are compatible with virtually all standard and synthetic oils on the market, and they work with engines using gasoline, diesel, propane or natural gas. The Puradyn system, ordinarily, cannot be used on engines that do not have a pressurized lubricating system.

We are also the sole manufacturer and provider of replacement filter elements for the Puradyn system. Depending upon the application, we generally recommend that the element be replaced at the engine manufacturer's recommended/approved periodic oil change interval or current service interval. The type of element used also depends upon the specific type of engine or hydraulic application. A customer can change the filter element and take the required oil sample in approximately five to 10 minutes.
 The Puradyn system has no moving parts and consequently requires no significant ongoing maintenance. As long as filter elements are changed at the recommended intervals and other standard preventive maintenance procedures are completed, such as changing factory full-flow oil filters and air filters and completing regular oil analyses, the Company believes the Puradyn system will perform as designed; such belief is established and supported by historical field performance over more than two decades.
 Warranties
 The Puradyn system carries a six-month money-back performance guarantee and is currently warrantied to the original user to be free of defects in material and workmanship for five years from date of purchase, with a one-year limited warranty on the heating element contained in the legacy PFT models. The Company will accept returns of products that are defective at the time of sale or prove to be defective during the limited warranty period. Returns are subject to specific conditions.
 For the Companys performance guarantee and warranty to remain in effect, users must, among other things, maintain a record of the laboratory oil analysis results and use Puradyn filter elements and replacement parts. The Company has received letters from numerous OEMs which have all stated that the installation and use of the Puradyn system does not void their manufacturer warranties if there is no oil related engine failure or malfunction attributed to the Puradyn system. To date, there have been no significant warranty claims, although there can be no assurances that such a trend will continue.
 Marketing
 The Company has an in-house marketing department comprised of two employees, with various projects outsourced on an as-needed basis.
 The Companys products are marketed to numerous industries that include hydraulic applications, and other users of engines or equipment that utilize up to 50 weight oil for lubrication. Additionally, we offer marketing assistance in material development to distributors. 
Distribution 
 We currently have a network of over 55 domestic and international distributors and dealers; however, the majority of our products are sold through a limited number of distributors. One of our distributors has approximately 300 outlets worldwide that have the potential to sell and/or service the Puradyn system. Currently, international sales are administered by Puradyn from the United States. The international distributors are located primarily in South America, Europe, Africa, India, the Middle East and Asia. Our international distributors purchase product directly from the Company and sell to their existing or new customers. All distributor agreements can be terminated by either party with a 30 to 60 day written notice. 
Sales

Direct Sales 
 The Company directly and/or with the assistance of its manufacturer's representatives, distributors, or other agents, markets its products directly to OEMs, other distributors and national accounts. We are dependent upon sales from a limited number of customers. During 2016, three customers together accounted for 57% of the Companys net sales and during 2015 two customers together accounted for 56% of the Companys net sales. There were three customers at December 31, 2016, whose trade receivable balances equaled or exceeded 10% of total receivables, representing approximately 50%, 18% and 13%, respectively of total receivables, none of which are past due. There were two customers at December 31, 2015, whose trade receivable balances equaled or exceeded 10% of total receivables, representing approximately 47%, and 32%, respectively of total receivables. 
 The loss of business from one or a combination of the Companys significant customers could adversely affect its operations.

International Sales
 The Company, directly and/or with the assistance of commission-based manufacturer's representatives, has established primarily non-exclusive distributors and sales representation in various countries, including the Middle East, Germany, South Africa, Turkey, United Kingdom, Thailand, Colombia, and others. The ultimate success of these and other distributors primarily depends upon their ability to successfully introduce and sell the product in their respective territories, including obtaining local evaluations, establishing distribution, and other factors similar to those faced by the Company in the United States. Unlike domestic sales, the Company has a policy that international sales be paid in advance or secured by a letter of credit before shipping. The Companys credit risk is minimal with international sales as a result of this policy. Total international sales amounted to approximately 34.7% and 13% of net sales in 2016 and 2015, respectively. 
Manufacturing and Production
 The Company purchases component parts for unit housings and filter elements. The component parts are assembled, packed and shipped from our facility in Boynton Beach, Florida.
 We currently source substantially all of our raw materials and component parts from various vendors in the United States. Substantially all the tools and dies used by certain of our vendors are owned by the Company. We have researched alternative sources of supply and do not anticipate that the loss of any single supplier would have a material long-term adverse effect on our business, operations or financial condition. However, there can be no assurance that our current or future suppliers will be able to meet our requirements on commercially reasonable terms or within scheduled delivery times. An interruption of our arrangements with suppliers could cause a delay in the production of our products for timely delivery to distributors and customers which could result in a loss of sales revenue in future periods.
 The Company has achieved ISO 9001:2008 registration from the International Organization for Standardization, validating its Quality Management Standards process for design, manufacture, sales and distribution of bypass oil filtration systems and replacement filters for various industries. 
 Engineering and development costs are expensed as incurred. During the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, we incurred engineering and development costs, excluding payroll and benefit expenses for engineering, in the amount of $9,068 and $9,210, respectively, which are included in selling and administrative expenses in the accompanying statements of operations.
 Competition
 Bypass oil filtration systems produced by other companies in varying degrees address the issues of solid or liquid contaminant filtration through centrifugal design, media filtration or evaporation. However, Puradyn believes that its solution is the only bypass oil filtration system that simultaneously incorporates all of the following features, which provide us with a competitive advantage: 
 ·
 Filtering solid contaminants to below one micron, including enhanced soot retention through the use of a patent-pending process for chemical grafting; 
 ·
 Effectively removing harmful gaseous and liquid contaminants through a heated evaporation chamber or patented polymer formulation; and
 ·
 Replenishing the base additives in engine oil so as to maintain proper oil viscosity and total base number (TBN) rating.
 The proper use of our products reduces the need for oil-related maintenance services, replacement parts, original oil sales and consumption and waste oil disposal. 
 Some of our competitors may have more capital, greater brand recognition, larger customer bases and significantly greater financial, technical and marketing resources than we do. Our competitors' products may achieve greater acceptance in the marketplace than our own, limiting our ability to gain market share and customer loyalty and to generate sufficient revenues to achieve a profitable level of operations.

Intellectual Property
 Our ability to compete effectively depends in part on our ability to maintain the proprietary nature of our technology, products and manufacturing processes. We principally rely upon patent, trademark, trade secrets and contract law to establish and protect our proprietary rights. 

We rely on a combination of trade secrets, patents and trademarks to establish and protect our intellectual property rights. As of December 31, 2016, we had issued seven U.S. patents and 21 issued international patents that directly relate to our technology that expire between 2017 and 2033, as well as one pending patent application in the U.S. and 48 pending patent applications internationally. 

Subject to the availability of sufficient working capital, we expect to pursue additional patent protection to the extent that we believe it would be beneficial and cost effective.

In 2016 and 2015 we spent $9,068 and $9,210, respectively, on research and development.

We have registered the product trademark Puradyn® in the United States and other countries where the "Purifiner®" trademark was registered, and have also registered the trademarks Polydry®, CGP® ,Keep It Clean!® , We Fight Dirty®, Lets Talk Dirty®, and the Puradyn logo in the United States and targeted countries. 
 We have also obtained the rights to the domain name www.puradyn.com as well as the domain names puradyn.asia, puradyn.ro, puradyn.com.tr, puradyn.org, puradyn.us, puradyn.info and puradyn.biz. As with telephone numbers, we do not have and cannot acquire any property rights in an Internet address. We do not expect to lose the ability to use these Internet addresses; however, there can be no assurance in this regard.
 Employees
 At March 26, 2017, the Company had 20 full-time employees, including our executive officers.
 Our employees are not covered by collective bargaining agreements, and we believe our relationship with our employees to be good.
 History of our Company
 The Company has been incorporated in the State of Delaware since February 1988. On February 4, 1998, the Company filed a Certificate of Amendment to its Certificate of Incorporation, changing its name to Puradyn Filter Technologies Incorporated.
