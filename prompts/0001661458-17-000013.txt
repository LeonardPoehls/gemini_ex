Item 1. Business
Overview
We are a self-advised and self-administered real estate investment trust ("REIT") created to own and manage substantially all of the “non-core” assets previously owned and managed by our former parent, InvenTrust Properties Corp., a Maryland corporation (“InvenTrust”). On April 28, 2016, we were spun-off from InvenTrust through a pro rata distribution (the "Distribution") by InvenTrust of 100% of the outstanding shares of our common stock to holders of InvenTrust’s common stock. Prior to or concurrent with the separation, we and InvenTrust engaged in certain reorganization transactions which were designed to consolidate in us the ownership of substantially all of InvenTrust’s remaining “non-core” assets. 
The majority of these “non-core” assets were acquired by Inventrust between 2005 and 2008 as part of its historical focus on acquiring, owning and operating a diversified portfolio of commercial real estate, including retail, multi-family, student housing, industrial, correctional, lodging and office assets located in the United States. In addition, certain of the "non-core" assets, including the undeveloped land in Florida, were acquired when borrowers defaulted on loans issued by Inventrust during this time period. Beginning in 2012, InvenTrust began to implement its strategy of focusing its diverse portfolio of real estate into three platforms - retail, lodging and student housing - with the goal of enhancing long-term stockholder value and positioning InvenTrust to explore various strategic transactions. As part of this strategy, InvenTrust executed a series of transactions, including the sale of its conventional apartment assets in 2013, the sale of certain of its net lease assets consummated through multiple closings through 2013 and 2014, and the disposition of other “non-core” assets in individual and portfolio transactions. Also in furtherance of this strategy, in 2014 and 2015, InvenTrust disposed of its lodging platform through the sale of its suburban select service lodging portfolio and the spin-off of Xenia Hotels & Resorts, Inc., respectively. In June 2016, InvenTrust completed the sale of its student housing portfolio. As part of InvenTrust’s stated strategy to become a pure-play retail REIT, and in order to maximize the value of InvenTrust’s retail platform, InvenTrust disposed of its remaining “non-core” assets by forming and spinning off Highlands to own and manage these assets.
This portfolio of “non-core” assets, which were substantially acquired between 2005 and 2008, includes assets that are special-use, single-tenant or build to suit; face unresolved legal issues; are in undesirable locations or in weak markets or submarkets; are aging or functionally obsolete; and/or have sub-optimal leasing metrics. Assets with such characteristics are relatively illiquid compared to other types of real estate assets and may require additional investments to improve our disposition options. In addition, certain of these assets are in hyper-amortization under their loan agreements (resulting in rental payments less certain expenses being used to pay down the principal amount of the loan); have rental payments, less certain expenses, being “swept” and held by the lender pursuant to the loan agreement; and are in or likely to enter foreclosure proceedings. These factors may also limit our disposition options with respect to these properties and has had, and is expected to continue to have, an adverse impact on the cash flow generated by such assets. For example, three of our assets, contributing $47.93 million (or 54.1%) in annualized base rent for the year ended December 31, 2015, prior to the Distribution, are now either in foreclosure or are likely to enter into foreclosure proceedings in 2017. The debt associated with the assets is non-recourse, and is not cross-collateralized with our other obligations.
As of December 31, 2016, our portfolio consisted of six office assets, two industrial assets, six retail assets, two correctional facilities, four parcels of unimproved land and one bank branch. All of our assets are located in the United States, in fourteen states with no geographic concentration. We currently have three business segments, consisting of (i) net lease, (ii) retail and (iii) multi-tenant office. Our unimproved land is presented in “other”. We may have additional or fewer segments in the future to the extent we enter into additional real property sectors, dispose of property sectors, or change the character of assets. Highlands was incorporated in December 2016 as a Maryland corporation and intends to be taxed as and operate in a manner that will allow us to qualify as a REIT for federal tax purposes.
References to the “Company,” “we” or “us” are to Highlands and its predecessors, as well as all of Highlands’ wholly owned subsidiaries. For the complete presentation of our reportable segments, see Note 10 to our Combined Consolidated Financial Statements for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014.

Business Strategy
Our investment objectives are to preserve, protect and maximize the total value of our portfolio with the long term objective of providing stockholders with a return of their investment. Given the nature of the assets in our portfolio, we expect that this strategy will take multiple years to develop and execute. We engage in rigorous asset management, and will seek to sustain and enhance our portfolio, and improve the quality and income-producing ability of our portfolio, by engaging in selective dispositions, acquisitions, capital expenditures, financing, refinancing and enhanced leasing. We are also focused on cost containment efforts across our portfolio, and improving its overall capital structure. We intend to hold our assets until such time as we determine that a sale or other disposition achieves our investment objectives or until it appears such objectives will not be met. Assets may be sold individually or as one or more portfolios. There can be no assurances that future dispositions will occur as planned, or if they occur, that they will help us to meet our liquidity demands. 
Disposition Policy 
 We evaluate each of our assets on a rigorous and ongoing basis in an effort to optimize and enhance the total value of our assets. In furtherance of this strategy, for the foreseeable future, we anticipate disposing of select assets that are not generating income or have unfavorable risk-adjusted returns and using the proceeds from such sales (in each case if the asset can be disposed of for greater than the debt associated with it) to improve the quality and income-producing ability of our portfolio by engaging in selective acquisitions or reinvesting in our existing assets through capital expenditures and improvements to our capital structure. 
The determination of when a particular asset should be sold or otherwise disposed of will be made after consideration of all of the relevant factors, including whether our portfolio as a whole is attractive to a potential acquirer of the entire company, prevailing and projected economic and market conditions, the cash flow being generated by a particular asset, tax implications of a disposition, debt characteristics of the asset, and whether the value of the asset is anticipated to decline or increase. The timing of any disposition will depend upon then prevailing economic and market conditions, which could result in differing holding periods among the assets.
Foreclosure Proceedings
With respect to certain of our properties, once the leases for such properties expire, we may be unable to make mortgage payments and may default under the applicable loan agreement. This may force us to dispose of those assets on disadvantageous terms, or the lender under such mortgages may foreclose. Our Dulles Executive Plaza and AT&T-Hoffman Estates assets are currently in foreclosure, or in danger of entering foreclosure proceedings, that may take time to complete. With respect to our AT&T-St. Louis asset, we have informed our lenders that we do not expect AT&T to renew their lease when it expires in September 2017 and on March 15, 2017 we received notice that the loan was transferred to special servicing. We believe it is likely that our AT&T-St. Louis property will also be transferred to our lenders through foreclosure proceedings. Generally, a borrower in foreclosure proceedings has limited or no control over the timing and speed of such proceedings, and the ultimate resolution of such proceedings may take years. See also “Risk Factors-Risks Related to Debt Financing-If we are unable to repay or refinance our existing debt as it comes due, we may need to sell the underlying asset sooner than anticipated or the lender may foreclose, in which case our financial condition, cash flows and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.”
Financing Strategy
Certain of our existing assets are currently encumbered by debt, and debt financing may be used from time to time for property improvements, tenant improvements, acquisition financing, leasing commissions, general corporate purposes and other working capital needs. The form of our indebtedness may vary and could be long-term or short-term, secured or unsecured, or fixed-rate or floating rate. We will not enter into interest rate swaps or caps, or similar hedging transactions or derivative arrangements for speculative purposes, but may do so in order to manage or mitigate our interest rate risks on variable rate debt. For additional information regarding our existing debt, please refer to “Management Discussion and Analysis - Borrowings.”
As of December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, no debt is recourse to the Company, although the Company or its subsidiaries may act as guarantor under customary, non-recourse carveout clauses in our wholly owned property owning subsidiaries' mortgage loans.

Customers
A significant portion of our revenue has historically been generated by AT&T, Inc. (“AT&T”). For the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, approximately 41% and 42% of our total annualized rental income was generated by three single-tenant assets leased to affiliates of AT&T. One of those leases expired in 2016, and the underlying asset is currently subject to foreclosure proceedings. Another lease with AT&T expires in 2017, and the underlying asset went into “cash trap” in October 2016, and all income from the asset is being “swept” by the lender, used to pay debt service and other charges, and to the extent income exceeds such charges, the Company receives a lender-approved reimbursement for operating expenses associated with the property. The property underlying the third lease was recently sold. The loss of revenue historically generated by these properties leased to AT&T will have an adverse impact on our future revenues.
Conflict of Interest Policy
We maintain policies designed to reduce or eliminate potential conflicts of interest. Any transaction between us and any director, officer or 5% stockholder must be approved pursuant to our related party transaction policy. In addition, we have adopted a code of business conduct and ethics that seeks to identify and mitigate conflicts of interest between our employees, directors and officers and our company. However, we cannot assure you that these policies or provisions of law will always be successful in eliminating or minimizing the influence of such conflicts, and if they are not successful, decisions could be made that might fail to reflect fully the interests of stockholders.
Certain Other Policies
We intend to engage in future investment activities in a manner that is consistent with the requirements applicable to REITs for federal income tax purposes, unless the board of directors determines that it is no longer in our best interest to so qualify as a REIT.
We may issue senior securities, purchase and sell investments, offer securities in exchange for property and repurchase or reacquire shares or other securities in the future. To the extent we engage in these activities, we will comply with applicable law.
We do not currently have policies in place with respect to making loans to other persons (other than our conflict of interest policies described above) or investing in securities.
Competition
We are subject to significant competition in seeking tenants for the leasing of our assets and buyers for the sale of our assets. We compete with many third parties engaged in real estate investment activities, including other REITs, specialty finance companies, savings and loan associations, banks, mortgage bankers, insurance companies, mutual funds, institutional investors, investing banking firms, lenders, hedge funds, governmental bodies and other entities. Many of our competitors have substantially greater financial and other resources than we have and may have substantially more operating experience than us. We also face competition from other real estate investment programs for buyers and tenants that may be suitable for us. We perceive there to be a lower level of competition for certain assets in our portfolio based on, among other things, the characteristics of such assets, the number of willing buyers and the volume of transactions in their respective markets, which may make it challenging for us to sell these assets or attract tenants.
Regulations
Our assets are subject to various federal, state and local laws, ordinances and regulations, including, among other things, zoning regulations, land use controls, environmental controls relating to air and water quality, noise pollution and indirect environmental impacts such as increased motor vehicle activity. We believe that we have all permits and approvals necessary under current law to operate our assets.
Environmental
As an owner of real estate, we are subject to various environmental laws of federal, state and local governments. Compliance with existing laws has not had a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations, and management does not believe it will have such an impact in the future. However, we cannot predict the impact of unforeseen environmental contingencies or new or changed laws or regulations on assets in which we hold an interest, or on assets that may be acquired directly or indirectly in the future.

Employees
At December 31, 2016, we had nine full-time employees, not including consultants and part time workers. Due to the nature of our portfolio and our business strategy, we rely on consultants and third parties, under our supervision, to perform many routine operations for us.
Insurance
We have insurance coverage for our properties which includes the type of coverage and limits we believe to be appropriate for each property and our business operations. Such coverage typically includes commercial general liability and property insurance which includes property damage and loss of rental income resulting from such perils as fire, windstorm, flood and extended coverage. Our management believes our insurance coverage contains policy terms and conditions and insured limits that are customary for similar properties and operations.
