ITEM 1.    BUSINESS
Company Overview
We are a leading manufacturer, marketer and distributor of high-quality, branded food products in North America, with annual net sales of approximately $3.1 billion in fiscal 2016. Our brand portfolio enjoys strong household penetration in the United States, where our products can be found in over 85% of U.S. households. Our products are sold through supermarkets, grocery wholesalers and distributors, mass merchandisers, super centers, convenience stores, dollar stores, natural and organic food stores, drug stores and warehouse clubs in the United States and Canada, as well as in military channels and foodservice locations. Given our diverse portfolio of brands with attractive market positions, our business generates significant and stable cash flows that have enabled us to pay regular quarterly dividends to our shareholders, reduce our debt and drive value creation through both reinvestment in our existing brands and periodic strategic acquisitions. 
Pinnacle Foods Inc. was incorporated under the name "Crunch Holding Corp. in Delaware on July 28, 2003. Pinnacle Foods Inc. is a holding company whose sole asset is 100% ownership of Peak Finance Holdings LLC (“PFH”). PFH is a holding company whose sole asset is 100% ownership of Pinnacle Foods Finance LLC.
In the fourth quarter of 2016, following the completion of the integration of the Company’s Boulder Brands acquisition (see below), the Company reorganized its reporting structure into four reportable segments. As a result, the Company’s operations are reported in the Frozen segment, the Grocery segment, the Boulder segment and the Specialty segment. The Boulder Brands acquisition is discussed in greater detail in Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, “Acquisitions.”
Frozen Segment 
Birds Eye is the largest brand in the $3.2 billion frozen vegetables category. Collectively, our steamed and non-steamed product offerings hold the #1 position among branded products, with a 30.4% market share. Government programs, such as the USDA’s My Plate program, and nutrition and health professionals continue to identify increased vegetable consumption as a key to better health. We believe that enhancing the taste of vegetables and making them exceptionally convenient are keys to driving more vegetable consumption. Birds Eye has taken a leadership role in increasing vegetable consumption, including encouraging children to eat more vegetables. We are supporters of the USDA’s My Plate program and have engaged in breakthrough marketing efforts with major multi-media family entertainment partners to encourage children to eat more vegetables. We also compete in the frozen complete bagged meals category with our Birds Eye Voila! brand. We are the largest competitor in the frozen complete bagged meal category with a 41.0% market share. Birds Eye Voila! frozen bagged meals provide consumers with a high quality complete meal, including protein, starch, and vegetables, that can be prepared in a skillet in just minutes.
Our Frozen segment also includes Hungry-Man frozen entrées, Van de Kamp’s and Mrs. Paul's frozen prepared seafood, Aunt Jemima frozen breakfast products, Lender's frozen and refrigerated bagels and Celeste frozen pizza. The Frozen segment also includes all of the Company’s business in Canada, including those of the Garden Protein International and Boulder Brands acquisitions.
Grocery Segment
The Grocery segment consists of a diversified portfolio of shelf-stable and refrigerated products including a complete line of shelf-stable pickle products, primarily under the nationally-distributed Vlasic brand, and the regional brands under the Milwaukee’s and Wiejske Wyroby brands. Our Vlasic brand, represented by its trademark Vlasic stork, has the highest consumer awareness and quality ratings in the pickle category.  Vlasic is the #1 brand in the $782 million shelf-stable pickle category and Pinnacle brands collectively hold a 34.9% market share.  
Our Duncan Hines portfolio includes cake mixes, ready-to-serve frostings, brownie mixes, and cookie mixes.  In addition to our traditional cake mix offerings, our cake mix portfolio also includes premium offerings under the Duncan Hines Decadent and Duncan Hines Perfect Size brands.  Duncan Hines is the #2 brand with a 25.7% market share in the $1.1 billion cake/brownie mix and frostings category.  We compete in the shelf-stable salad dressings category with our Wish-Bone and Western brands, including our new Wish-Bone E.V.O.O., Wish-Bone Ristorante Italiano and Wish-Bone Avocado Oil lines.  We hold the #3 position in the $2.1 billion salad dressings category, with a combined share of 11.6%, and Wish-Bone holds the #1 position in the branded Italian segment of the category.  Our Grocery segment also includes Armour, Nalley and Brooks canned meat, Mrs. Butterworth’s and Log Cabin table syrups, Smart Balance premium margarine/spread, Comstock and Wilderness pie and pastry fruit fillings and Open Pit barbecue sauce.
5

Boulder Segment
We offer a portfolio of gluten-free products under the Udi’s and Glutino brands and natural frozen meals under our EVOL brand. Udi’s is the #1 brand in the $355.0 million gluten-free frozen bakery and pizza category with a 38.3% market share.  The Boulder segment also includes all of the products under the Earth Balance brand, a plant-based premium refrigerated and shelf-stable portfolio, as well as the rapidly-growing gardein plant-based protein brand.
Specialty Segment
The Specialty segment is comprised of our direct store delivery snacks portfolio, including Tim’s Cascade, Hawaiian kettle style chips, Snyder of Berlin and Husman’s, each of which has strong regional presence.  We also manufacture and distribute certain products, mainly in the frozen breakfast, gluten-free, frozen meat substitutes, canned meat, and pie and pastry fruit filling categories, through foodservice channels.  The Specialty segment also includes our private label business, which manufactures and distributes products in the canned meat, shelf-stable pickles and frozen prepared seafood categories.
Financial information about our business segments is discussed in greater detail in Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-K.

Although we believe that this information is reliable, we cannot guarantee its accuracy and completeness, nor have we independently verified it.

Competitive Strengths
We believe the following competitive strengths differentiate us from our competitors and contribute to our ongoing success:
Actively Managed Portfolio of Iconic Food Brands with Leading Market Positions
We actively manage our diverse portfolio of food brands that participate in attractive product categories. Our well-recognized brand portfolio enjoys strong household penetration in the United States, where our products can be found in over 85% of U.S. households. 
We have prioritized our investment spending and brand-building activities behind brands that have higher growth and margins, greater potential for value-added innovation and enhanced responsiveness to consumer marketing. We manage some of our other brands for stability in sales, market share and cash flow, with a focus on ongoing quality upgrades, competitive pricing and strong merchandising and trade programs. Our brand prioritization strategy is focused on ensuring that the strong, stable cash flows from certain brands are deployed for reinvestment in marketing and on-trend innovation for our higher-margin brands, as well as for debt reduction and other corporate priorities.
Strong Innovation and Marketing Capabilities
Over the past few years, we have continually enhanced our organizational capabilities in the areas of new product innovation and consumer marketing. We have improved our in-house innovation capabilities by augmenting and upgrading our innovation team, with the construction of a state-of-the-art Research and Development (“R&D”) facility in our Parsippany, New Jersey headquarters. This facility co-locates our sales, marketing and operations teams with our entire company-wide R&D team, other than gardein, which is located in British Columbia, and better enables us to leverage the innovation experience of our senior management As a result of the Boulder Brands acquisition, we also have sales, marketing, R&D and operations teams in Boulder, Colorado to further enhance our organizational capabilities in the health and wellness arena. Our state-of-the-art manufacturing facility in Denver, Colorado also enables the Company to produce its gluten-free products and improve process capability and product quality. 
Additionally, we have increased investment in consumer insights and employee innovation training. Recent examples of successfully launched innovations include new varieties of our Duncan Hines Perfect Size and Birds Eye Steamfresh Flavor Full, Protein Blends and Disney-themed side dishes for kids. We intend to continue to invest in innovation that enables us to further differentiate our brands in the marketplace. Our research and development expenditures totaled $18.1 million, $13.0 million, and $11.3 million for fiscal years 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Our level of research and development expenditures reflects our focus on product development in comparison to basic research.
To complement our accelerated innovation efforts, we have also focused and enhanced our marketing investments. We have partnered with best-in-class branded consumer advertising, digital and media agencies to develop high impact marketing programs 
8

implemented across television, print, social and digital media. We intend to increase marketing investments over time, as the volume trends and promotional environment in the broader food industry normalize.
Operational Excellence Driving Continued Gross Margin Improvement
Our operational excellence program is a holistic, Company-wide productivity initiative designed to generate annual productivity savings across our supply chain, in the range of 3.5% to 4.0% of our annual Cost of products sold, which has been achieved over the last five years. In fiscal 2016, our operational excellence initiative drove productivity savings of 4.0%. These productivity savings, combined with selective retail price increases have been instrumental in mitigating input cost inflation in periods of significant inflationary pressure, and driving gross margin expansion in periods of more modest inflation. We also pursue other initiatives to drive incremental improvement in our gross margin, including improving our product mix through new product innovation and low-margin SKU rationalization, increasing the effectiveness of our trade promotional spending and realizing synergies from acquisitions. Furthermore, our gross margin benefits from our diversified input cost basket in which no single commodity accounted for more than 5% of our total Cost of products sold in fiscal 2016.
Strong Free Cash Flow Conversion
Our business generates an attractive Adjusted EBITDA (see non GAAP disclosures later) margin and also benefits from modest capital expenditure and working capital requirements and approximately $425.5 million in net operating loss carryovers (“NOLs”) ($188.3 million after IRC Section 382 limitation, subject to an annual limitation of $17.1 million), which combined have resulted in strong and stable free cash flows. Our Adjusted EBITDA margin benefits from the quality of our brand portfolio and our lean and nimble organization structure, with selling, general and administrative expenses, excluding consumer advertising and promotions and one-time items, slightly above 9% of net sales in fiscal 2016. Our NOLs and other tax attributes will generate modest annual cash tax savings in 2016 and thereafter.
We believe our strong free cash flows will enable us to continue to maximize shareholder value through paying a regular quarterly dividend, financing value-enhancing acquisitions, reducing our indebtedness and strategically deploying our capital to fund innovation and organic growth opportunities.
Proven M&A Expertise with Significant Opportunity
We have substantial experience in sourcing, executing and integrating value-enhancing acquisitions. We maintain a highly-disciplined approach to M&A, focusing on opportunities that add new iconic brands to our portfolio and/or allow for strong synergy realization. On January 15, 2016, the Company acquired Boulder Brands Inc. ("Boulder Brands acquisition") which manufactures, markets and distributes a portfolio of health and wellness brands. The acquisition expanded the Company’s presence in growing and complementary health and wellness categories and in the natural and organic retail channels. In November 2016, we hired a dedicated corporate development resource to enhance the Company’s M&A expertise.
Our strong existing platforms in the Frozen, Grocery, and Boulder segments facilitate a large addressable market and provide us with a broad set of potential acquisition targets. We believe our scale, management depth, integration expertise and access to capital will allow us to consider both small and large acquisitions in the future and to seamlessly integrate them to drive maximum value creation.
Experienced, Hands-On Management Team and Board of Directors
Our management team has a demonstrated history of delivering strong operating results, has extensive food industry experience and includes several executives who have managed significantly larger businesses and have led numerous acquisition integrations. Our management team is complimented by an experienced Board of Directors, which includes several individuals with a proven track record of successfully managing and acquiring consumer businesses. 
Customers
We have several large customers that account for a significant portion of our sales. Wal-Mart is our largest customer and represented approximately 28%, 27%, and 27% of net sales in each of fiscal years 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively. Cumulatively, including Wal-Mart, our top ten customers accounted for approximately 63%, 60%, and 62% of net sales in each of fiscal years 2016, 2015, and 2014.

Marketing
Our marketing programs consist of consumer advertising, consumer promotions, trade promotions, direct marketing and public relations. Our advertising consists of television, newspaper, magazine, digital, mobile and social advertising aimed at increasing consumer preference and usage of our brands. Consumer promotions include free trial offers, targeted coupons and on-package offers to generate trial usage and increase purchase frequency. Our trade promotions focus on obtaining retail feature and display support, achieving optimum retail product prices and securing retail shelf space. Over the long term, we continue to focus on shifting our marketing efforts toward building long-term brand equity through increased consumer marketing.
Intellectual Property 
Our intellectual property and other proprietary assets include copyrights, registered and common law trademarks and trademark applications, patents and patent applications, domain names, trade secrets, other proprietary rights and licenses of intellectual property rights of various kinds. We consider these assets and rights, both in the United States and in Canada, among our most valuable assets. We rely on a combination of copyright, trademark, patent, trade secret and unfair competition laws as well as contractual provisions to protect these assets. The duration and scope of the protection afforded to our intellectual property and other assets depends on the type of property in question and the laws and regulations of the relevant jurisdiction. In the case of licenses, they also depend on contractual provisions.
We manufacture and market certain of our frozen food products under the Swanson, Aunt Jemima and Voila! brands pursuant to royalty-free, exclusive and perpetual trademark licenses. The licenses give us the right to use certain Swanson, Aunt Jemima and Voila! trademarks both inside and outside of the United States in connection with the manufacture, distribution, marketing, advertising, and promotion and sale of these products. The licenses contain standard provisions, including those dealing with quality control and termination as well as assignment and consent. If we were to breach any material term of the licenses and not timely cure such breach, Campbell Soup Company, The Quaker Oats Company or Voila! Bakeries, Inc. could terminate the licenses. 
We also have a license agreement granting us an exclusive, royalty bearing, perpetual license to use certain Armour trademarks in the United States. Under the license agreement, Smithfield Foods, Inc., as successor to ConAgra, Inc., the licensor, grants us a license for the use of various Armour trademarks in conjunction with shelf-stable products within the United States. We are required to make annual royalty payments to the licensor based upon our annual net sales of the approved shelf-stable products. If we were to materially breach the license agreement, Smithfield Foods, Inc. could terminate the license. We own and maintain Armour registrations in many other countries. 
Sales and Distribution
We sell and distribute a majority of our products in the United States and Canada through a combined network of internal sales and broker teams. We employ other brokers for the foodservice and club channels. Through this combination network, our products reach all traditional classes of trade, including supermarkets, grocery wholesalers and distributors, mass merchandisers, super centers, convenience stores, drug stores, warehouse clubs, foodservice and other alternative channels. 
Due to the different demands of distribution for frozen, shelf-stable and refrigerated products, we maintain separate distribution systems for these products. In addition to these distribution systems, our snack products are primarily distributed through a direct store delivery network in the Midwest, Mid-Atlantic, and Pacific Northwest, a portion of which we own and operate and a portion of which utilizes third-party providers. We believe that our sales and distribution network is scalable and has the capacity to support substantial increases in volume.
Ingredients and Packaging 
We believe that the ingredients and packaging used to produce our products are readily available through multiple sources. Ingredients and packaging typically account for approximately two thirds of our annual Cost of products sold. We use a broad array of ingredients including vegetables and fruits, proteins, grains and oils, sugars, seafood and other agricultural products. Certain vegetables and fruits are purchased under dedicated acreage supply contracts from a number of growers prior to each growing season, while the balance is sourced directly from third parties. Our packaging consists primarily of steel, aluminum, glass jars, plastic bottles, corrugated fiberboard, and various poly-films.
10

Manufacturing
Owned and Operated Manufacturing Facilities.    We own and operate twelve and lease six manufacturing facilities for our products. See "Item 2, - Properties" for a listing of our manufacturing facilities. 
Co-Packing Arrangements. In addition to our own manufacturing facilities, we source a portion of our products under “co-packing” agreements, a common industry practice in which manufacturing is outsourced to other companies. We regularly evaluate our co-packing arrangements to ensure the most cost-effective manufacturing of our products and to utilize company-owned manufacturing facilities most effectively.
Seasonality
Our sales and cash flows are affected by seasonal cyclicality. In general, our sales are highest in the fourth quarter. In addition, since many of our raw materials are agricultural crops, production of these products is predominantly seasonal. As a result our inventory levels tend to be higher in the third quarter, requiring more working capital at that time.
Competition
We face competition in each of our respective product lines. Although we operate in a highly competitive industry, we believe that the strength of our brands has resulted in strong respective competitive positions. We compete with producers of similar products on the basis of, among other things, product quality, brand recognition and loyalty, price, customer service, effective consumer marketing and promotional activities, and the ability to identify and satisfy emerging consumer preferences.
Employees
We employed approximately 5,100 people as of December 25, 2016, with approximately 56% of our hourly employees unionized. Due to the seasonality of our agricultural businesses, our employment fluctuates throughout the year, and thus our average number of employees was approximately 5,500 throughout fiscal 2016. In September, 2016, we completed negotiations and entered into a new collective bargaining agreement with the union representing approximately 420 employees at our Fort Madison, Iowa plant. In January 2017, we entered into a new collective bargaining agreement with approximately 117 of our union employees at our Fennville, Michigan plant. Our other unionized employees are covered under collective bargaining agreements expiring between April 2018 and October 2022. In general, we consider our relationship with employees to be good. See “Item 1A- Risk Factors- Our financial well-being could be jeopardized by unforeseen changes in our employees’ collective bargaining agreements or shifts in union policy.”
Financial Information About Geographical Areas 
For information about our geographic segments, see Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-K.
Governmental, Legal and Regulatory Matters
Food Safety and Labeling
We are subject to extensive regulation, including, among other things, the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, as amended by the Food Safety Modernization Act, the Public Health Security and Bioterrorism Preparedness and Response Act of 2002, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. This comprehensive and evolving regulatory program governs, among other things, the manufacturing, composition and ingredients, labeling, packaging, and safety of food, including compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practices. In addition, the Nutrition Labeling and Education Act of 1990 prescribes the format and content of certain information required to appear on the labels of food products. We are also subject to regulation by certain other governmental agencies, including the U.S. Department of Agriculture.
Our operations and products are also subject to state and local regulation, including the registration and licensing of plants, enforcement by state health agencies of various state standards, and the registration and inspection of facilities. Compliance with federal, state and local regulation is costly and time-consuming. Enforcement actions for violations of federal, state, and local regulations may include seizure and condemnation of products, cease and desist orders, injunctions or monetary penalties. We believe that our practices are sufficient to maintain compliance with applicable government regulations.
Federal Trade Commission
We are subject to certain regulations by the Federal Trade Commission. Advertising of our products is subject to such regulation pursuant to the Federal Trade Commission Act and the regulations promulgated thereunder.
11

Employee Safety Regulations
We are subject to certain health and safety regulations, including regulations issued pursuant to the Occupational Safety and Health Act. These regulations require us to comply with certain manufacturing, health, and safety standards to protect our employees from accidents.
Environmental Regulation
We are subject to a number of federal, state, and local laws and other requirements relating to the protection of the environment and the safety and health of personnel and the public. These requirements relate to a broad range of our activities, including: the discharge of pollutants into the air and water; the identification, generation, storage, handling, transportation, disposal, recordkeeping, labeling, and reporting of, and emergency response in connection with, hazardous materials (including asbestos) associated with our operations; noise emissions from our facilities; and safety and health standards, practices, and procedures that apply to the workplace and the operation of our facilities.
In order to comply with these requirements, we may need to spend substantial amounts of money and other resources from time to time to (i) construct or acquire new equipment, (ii) acquire or amend permits to authorize facility operations, (iii) modify, upgrade, or replace existing and proposed equipment and (iv) clean up or decommission our facilities or other locations to which our wastes have been sent. For example, some of our baking facilities are required to obtain air emissions permits and to install bag filters. Many of our facilities discharge wastewater into municipal treatment works, and may be required to pre-treat the wastewater and/or to pay surcharges. Some of our facilities use and store in tanks large quantities of materials, such as sodium chloride and ammonia, that could cause environmental damage if accidentally released. We use some hazardous materials in our operations, and we generate and dispose of hazardous wastes as a conditionally exempt small quantity generator. Our capital and operating budgets include costs and expenses associated with complying with these laws. If we do not comply with environmental requirements that apply to our operations, regulatory agencies could seek to impose civil, administrative, and/or criminal liabilities, as well as seek to curtail our operations. Under some circumstances, private parties could also seek to impose civil fines or penalties for violations of environmental laws or recover monetary damages, including those relating to property damage or personal injury.
Many of our plants were in operation before current environmental laws and regulations were enacted. Our predecessors have in the past had to remediate soil and/or groundwater contamination at a number of locations, including petroleum contamination caused by leaking underground storage tanks which they removed, and we may be required to do so again in the future. We have sold a number of plants where we have ceased operations, and it is possible that future renovations or redevelopment at these facilities might reveal additional contamination that may need to be addressed. Although remediation costs in the past have not been material, future remediation costs may be. The presence of hazardous materials at our facilities or at other locations to which we have sent hazardous wastes for treatment or disposal, may expose us to potential liabilities associated with the cleanup of contaminated soil and groundwater under federal or state “Superfund” statutes. Under the federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980, as amended (“CERCLA”), owners and operators of facilities from which there has been a release or threatened release of hazardous materials, together with those who have transported or arranged for the transportation or disposal of those materials, are liable for (i) the costs of responding to and remediating that release and (ii) the restoration of natural resources damaged by any such release. Under CERCLA and similar state statutes, liability for the entire cost of cleaning up the contaminated site can, subject to certain exceptions, be imposed upon any such party regardless of the lawfulness of the activities that led to the contamination.
See “Item 1A— Risk Factors— We and our third-party co-packers and suppliers are subject to laws and regulations relating to protection of the environment, worker health, and workplace safety. Costs to comply with these laws and regulations, or claims with respect to environmental, health and safety matters, could have a significant negative impact on our business.”
Insurance
We maintain general liability and product liability, property, worker’s compensation, business interruption, director and officer and other insurance in amounts and on terms that we believe are customary for companies similarly situated. In addition, we maintain excess insurance where we believe it is reasonably cost effective.
