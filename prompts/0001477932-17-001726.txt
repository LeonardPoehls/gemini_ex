Our Current Business
 
Our current focus and operations is the production of Internet movies in China, for distribution in China. Specifically, we seek to produce dramatic, feature length films for the internet that appeal to teens and young adults and which incorporate inspirational themes. In addition, we will seek to sell distribution rights for these films, and to develop and sell promotional and other products related to these films throughout the world.

Currently, our management is seeking and evaluating opportunities for our company to produce an internet movie, or participate in the production of an internet movie as a financial partner, development partner, or production partner. In that regard we are seeking and evaluating film concepts, screenplays, financing opportunities, branding opportunities, and prospective creative and financial partners. We anticipate an operational budget of between $300,000 to $1,000,000 depending on the nature of our involvement, production costs, and available funding. As at the date of this report we have not entered into any definitive agreement with any third parties and have not commenced pre-production or production of any film.
 Competition
 
The film production industry in China is intensely competitive. We intend to compete with numerous individuals and companies of varying size, including many major production companies and multi-media conglomerates, which have substantially greater creative, technical, financial and operational resources and staffs. Accordingly, we will face a high degree of competition for access to skilled personnel, distribution channels, financing and market share. 
Compliance with Government Regulation
 
The following summary discusses all regulations that materially affect the business of our Company.
 
Regulation Affecting the Production of Films in China
 
The principal regulation governing foreign ownership of our business in the PRC is the Foreign Investment Industrial Guidance Catalogue, effective as of April 10, 2015 (the “Catalogue”). Investment activities in the PRC by foreign investors are principally governed by the Catalogue, which was promulgated and is amended from time to time by the Ministry of Commerce and the National Development and Reform Commission (“NDRC”). The Catalogue divides industries into three categories: encouraged, restricted and prohibited. Industries not listed in the Catalogue are generally deemed as constituting a fourth “permitted” category and open to foreign investment unless specifically restricted by other PRC regulations. Currently, the production of “broadcasting and TV programs and film-making” falls into the restricted category, and is limited to contractual joint ventures. Accordingly, we are required to enter into a joint-venture with a Chinese partner in order to produce film and video content in China. 
Regulations Affecting Distribution of Digital Media Content in China
 
Restrictions on the Publication of Content on Servers located in China.
 
In February, 2016, China’s State Administration of Press, Publication, Radio, Film and Television (SARFT) and the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT), announced new regulations which serve to aggregate several existing policies to ease the enforcement of rules governing online publishing. Entitled, Administrative Regulations for Online Publishing Services (“Online Publishing Regulations”), the regulations prohibit companies with foreign ownership of any kind, including foreign joint ventures, from engaging in online publishing from servers located in China, though they allow foreign-invested firms to cooperate with Chinese companies on individual projects, as long as they obtain prior permission from authorities. The rules took effect on March 10, 2016 and require all involved in online publishing to receive a permit to do so.
Publication of Content on Servers Located Outside of China
 
The Online Publishing Regulations apply broadly to any “online publishing services provided within the borders of the PRC.” (Art. 2.) This presumably continues the approach to jurisdictional nexus of existing internet regulation in China: if active content resides on or is provided through servers located within the PRC, the jurisdictional nexus is satisfied and the law applies. If the provider maintains its servers outside of China, the law does not apply. However, as a practical matter, SAPPRFT and MIIT oversee online content published into China from offshore, and may use other means to interrupt what they deem as unsuitable content., as Chinese authorities frequently impose censorship policies through the use of firewalls by degrading or interrupting access to content served from offshore servers into China.

Censorship of Content in China
 
China has no motion picture rating system, and films must therefore be deemed suitable by Chinese censors for all audiences in order to be shown in the country. Officially, the censorship system is designed to promote Confucian morality, political stability and social harmony. Films must be submitted to the State Administration of Press, Publication, Radio, Film and Television (SARFT) for censorship prior to being cleared for import into China. This entails a three-step process: 
 


1. | The filmmakers submit their screenplay or finished film to the Censorship Board for review. The board has 30 days to offer a response, but often takes longer to do so; 
---+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. | SARFT then offers comments, and often suggestions, for altering the film to meet censorship requirements. The filmmakers are given the opportunity to make modifications to comply with any requested changes;
3. | The script or film is re-submitted to SARFT for review of the changes and an approval decision. 

 
If the filmmakers object to the results of the review process, they can apply for an additional review within 30 days;
 
 
· | Films are prohibited from containing the following contents, as stipulated in Article 25 of the Film Regulations:
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | Opposing the fundamental principles laid down in the Constitution of the P.R.C.; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
o | Jeopardizing the unification, sovereignty and territorial integrity of the State; 
o | Divulging State secrets, jeopardizing the security of the State, or impairing the prestige and interests of the State;
o | Inciting hatred and discrimination among ethnic groups, harming their unity, or violating their customs and habits; 
o | Propagating cults and superstition; 
o | Disrupting public order and undermining social stability; 
o | Propagating obscenity, gambling or violence, or abetting to commit crimes; 
o | Insulting or slandering others, or infringing upon the legitimate rights and interests of others; 
o | Jeopardizing social ethics or fine national cultural traditions. 

Research and Development
 
We did not incur any research or development expenditures over the last two fiscal years.
 
Intellectual Property
 
We do not currently have any intellectual property.
 
Employees
 
Our management consists of Mr. Steve Chen, our Chairman of the Board of Directors, Mr. Chris (Chi Jui) Hung, our Chief Executive Officer, and Mr. Brian Kistler, our President. They currently provide their services as independent contractors to our company, on a non-exclusive basis and without compensation. We currently have no full time or part-time employees. We anticipate that our personnel requirements will increase as we increase our film development activities and commence production of our first film. Because of the cyclical and intermittent nature of film development and production, we intend to engage the services of independent contractors on an as needed basis.
