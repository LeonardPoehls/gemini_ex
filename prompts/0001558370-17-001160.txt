     ITEM 1. BUSINESS  
     Overview
     We are an oncology-focused biopharmaceutical company dedicated to improving the lives of cancer patients.  We were founded in March 2010 and have in-licensed and are developing oncology-related product candidates, including rolapitant, niraparib, and the product candidates under our immuno-oncology platform.

     On September 1, 2015, our first commercial product, VARUBI®, which is the oral formulation of rolapitant, was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, for use in combination with other antiemetic agents in adults for the prevention of delayed nausea and vomiting associated with initial and repeat courses of emetogenic cancer chemotherapy, including, but not limited to, highly emetogenic chemotherapy.  We commenced shipments of VARUBI to distributors during the fourth quarter of 2015.
     A summary description of our current products and product candidates is as follows:
    
· | Rolapitant is a potent and long-acting neurokinin-1, or NK-1, receptor antagonist for the prevention of chemotherapy induced nausea and vomiting, or CINV. The oral form of rolapitant, VARUBI, is approved for commercialization in the United States, and we are developing an IV formulation of rolapitant. We submitted a new drug application, or NDA, for rolapitant IV to the FDA in March 2016. In January 2017, the FDA issued a Complete Response Letter requesting additional information regarding the in vitro release method utilized to characterize the drug product and demonstrate comparability of drug product produced by our two proposed commercial manufacturers of rolapitant IV that were included in the NDA. We will need to provide the additional requested information to the FDA in the form of a resubmission of the NDA, which the FDA will need to deem acceptable, in order for the NDA to be approved and for us to be allowed to market and sell rolapitant IV in the U.S. We also submitted a Marketing Authorization Application, or MAA, for oral rolapitant to the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, in March 2016. In February 2017, the EMA’s Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, or CHMP, rendered a positive opinion for our MAA for oral rolapitant, for the prevention of delayed nausea and vomiting associated with highly and moderately emetogenic chemotherapy in adults.

· | Niraparib is an orally active and potent poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase, or PARP, inhibitor. We have several ongoing clinical trials evaluating niraparib for the treatment of ovarian or breast cancers, and we expect to initiate dosing in further clinical trials of niraparib during 2017. We are also collaborating with various other organizations to evaluate niraparib in combination with other therapeutics for the treatment of various cancers. Based on research related to PARP inhibitors generally, we believe niraparib may also be active in the treatment of several other tumor types. In June 2016, we announced that the Phase 3 NOVA trial of niraparib successfully achieved its primary endpoint, demonstrating that niraparib significantly prolonged progression-free survival, or PFS, compared to control among patients with recurrent ovarian cancer. We submitted an MAA for niraparib in October 2016, which the EMA has accepted for review. We also submitted an NDA for niraparib in October 2016, for which the FDA has granted a priority review designation with a target Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, action date of June 30, 2017.

· | Immuno-Oncology Platform: In March 2014, we added immuno-oncology programs to our portfolio of product candidates by entering into a collaboration and exclusive license agreement with AnaptysBio, Inc., or AnaptysBio, for the discovery and development of antibodies for several immuno-oncology targets. We initiated a Phase 1, dose escalation study in March 2016 for our first immuno-oncology antibody, TSR-042, which targets PD-1. In July 2016, we commenced the dosing of the first patient in a Phase 1, dose escalation study for our second immuno-oncology antibody, TSR-022, which targets TIM-3. We have commenced pre-clinical research for our antibody candidate targeting LAG-3, TSR-033, and expect to initiate a Phase 1 study in 2017. As part of our collaboration with AnaptysBio, we received exclusive rights to monospecific antibody product candidates targeting PD-1, TIM-3, and LAG-3, and certain bi-specific antibody product candidates. In addition, we are evaluating our immuno-oncology anti-tumor agents, including TSR-042, in preclinical combination studies with niraparib and other anti-tumor agents.

      In February 2016, we entered into an exclusive collaboration with the Institute for Applied Cancer Science at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, or MDACC, to discover and develop small molecule product candidates against undisclosed immuno-oncology targets.  Under the terms of the agreement, we will receive exclusive worldwide rights to develop and commercialize any small molecule product candidates that result from this collaboration.  MDACC will be responsible for conducting research activities aimed at identifying clinical candidates with defined characteristics targeting certain immuno-oncology targets.  We will fund research, development, and commercialization expenses for this collaboration.

 In addition to potential candidates arising from our agreements with AnaptysBio and MDACC, we intend to continue to leverage the experience and competencies of our senior management team to identify, acquire, develop and commercialize cancer therapeutics, including those that are potentially safer and more effective than existing treatments.
     Upon successful development and regulatory approval of any of our product candidates, we intend to pursue commercialization of them in key product markets.  At this time, we intend to focus on commercializing our products directly in North America and Europe, and in partnership with established companies in other key markets.  In addition to developing commercial capabilities within these geographic areas, we intend to establish a network of licensees and distributors for our products in other geographic areas.
     Since our founding, we have relied on private and public financing sources to fund our operations.  As of December 31, 2016, our principal source of liquidity was cash and cash equivalents, which totaled $785.9 million.  During the year ended December 31, 2016, we raised a total of $838.1 million in net cash proceeds from private placements of common stock and follow-on public offerings of common stock.
     Our common stock trades on the NASDAQ Global Select Market, or NASDAQ, under the trading symbol “TSRO.”
     Our Strategy
     Our strategy is to leverage the experience and competencies of our management team to identify, acquire and develop promising drug candidates and to commercialize cancer therapeutics that are potentially safer and more effective than existing treatments.
     The key components of our strategy are:
           Continue the Clinical Development of and Successfully Commercialize Niraparib for the Treatment of Cancers that are Susceptible to PARP Inhibition. We have submitted an NDA and an MAA for niraparib for the treatment of patients with recurrent ovarian cancer, based on the results of the NOVA Phase 3 clinical study.  The PDUFA action date is June 30, 2017.  We have initiated commercial preparations in support of the potential launch of niraparib, pending regulatory approvals that we anticipate in the U.S. in the first half of 2017 and in Europe in the second half of 2017.  In April 2015, we commenced the QUADRA Phase 2 clinical trial evaluating niraparib as a therapy for patients with ovarian cancer who have received three or four regimens of therapy.  We also commenced the PRIMA Phase 3 clinical trial of niraparib as a maintenance treatment in ovarian cancer patients following response to first-line platinum-based chemotherapy, in August 2016.  We are also evaluating niraparib in breast cancer patients with germline BRCA mutations in the BRAVO Phase 3 clinical trial, which we commenced in April 2014.  In May 2015, we entered into a research agreement with Merck Sharp & Dohme B.V., a subsidiary of Merck & Co., Inc., or Merck, to perform a trial to evaluate the preliminary safety and efficacy of niraparib plus KEYTRUDA® in patients with triple negative breast cancer and patients with ovarian cancer.  This trial, referred to as TOPACIO, initiated dosing in April 2016.  We also are collaborating with the Nordic Society of Gynecologic Oncology, or NSGO (in collaboration with the European Network for Gynaecological Oncological Trial groups, or ENGOT) in their trial evaluating niraparib plus bevacizumab in ovarian cancer patients in a Phase 1/2 trial referred to as the AVANOVA trial.  Based on research related to PARP inhibitors generally, we believe niraparib also may be active in the treatment of several other tumor types and we intend to initiate dosing in further clinical trials during 2017.  As further described below, we are also evaluating niraparib in preclinical pharmacology studies in combination with our immuno-oncology anti-tumor agents.
           Successfully Commercialize Rolapitant for the Prevention of CINV. On September 1, 2015, our first commercial product, VARUBI, was approved by the FDA, for use in combination with other antiemetic agents in adults for the prevention of delayed nausea and vomiting associated with initial and repeat courses of emetogenic cancer chemotherapy.  We launched VARUBI in November 2015.  Our rolapitant program also includes the development of an IV formulation, for which we submitted an NDA to the FDA in March 2016.  We also submitted an MAA for oral rolapitant to the EMA in March 2016.  Pending regulatory approvals, we intend to launch rolapitant IV in the U.S., and oral rolapitant in Europe, in the second half of 2017.  We intend to establish rolapitant as part of the standard of care for the prevention of CINV in patients who, consistent with established treatment guidelines, could benefit from an NK-1 receptor antagonist, in addition to treatment with a 5-HT3 receptor antagonist plus a corticosteroid.

           Identify and Advance Potential Antibody Product Candidates Under Our Collaboration and Exclusive License Agreement with AnaptysBio. Under our collaboration and exclusive license agreement with AnaptysBio, we received exclusive rights to products based on AnaptysBio’s proprietary technology for the discovery, generation and optimization of antibodies targeting certain immune checkpoint proteins.  Specifically, we received exclusive rights to monospecific antibody product candidates targeting PD-1, TIM-3 and LAG-3, and certain bi-specific antibody product candidates.  We initiated dosing in a Phase 1 clinical trial for TSR-042, our lead anti-PD-1 compound, in March 2016.  We initiated dosing in a Phase 1 clinical trial for TSR-022, our lead anti-TIM-3 compound, in July 2016.  We commenced pre-clinical research for TSR-033, our lead anti-LAG-3 compound, in September 2016.  We have also selected a bi-specific antibody to PD-1 and LAG-3 as a potential lead clinical candidate.  In addition, we are evaluating our immuno-oncology anti-tumor agents, including TSR-042, in preclinical combination studies with niraparib and other anti-tumor agents.  We believe that these therapeutic antibodies could form the basis of a strategic platform that will potentially enable us to develop novel monotherapy and combination-based approaches with immuno-oncology, including combinations of immuno-oncology agents and other anti-cancer agents in a variety of indications.  Specifically, we believe this platform will enable us to initiate clinical development in new tumor indications not addressed with our current product candidates, and to study combination approaches in the clinic, potentially both with our existing product candidates and new candidates that we either in-license or access through collaborative transactions with others.
           In-license or Acquire Additional Product Candidates to Create a Balanced Product Portfolio. We intend to in-license or acquire additional product candidates across various stages of development.  We do not have, nor do we intend to build, our own drug discovery capabilities.  We intend to focus on product candidates that we believe are differentiated from existing cancer therapeutics and that have well-defined, and potentially expeditious, clinical and regulatory pathways.  We believe that our ability to execute on this strategy is due in part to our founding senior management team’s experience with in-licensing and acquiring cancer therapeutics and oncology supportive care products on advantageous terms, and their prior success in developing and obtaining regulatory approval for these compounds and developing markets for and commercializing these products.  Our objective is to build a portfolio of cancer therapeutics that is balanced by stage of development, resource requirements and development risk.  
           Build Global Capabilities to Maximize the Value of Our Product Candidates. We have obtained exclusive worldwide rights to all of our current product candidates (rolapitant, niraparib, and any future product candidates that may result from our collaborations with AnaptysBio and MDACC).  We intend to develop and commercialize our product candidates globally, and potentially in collaboration with other companies.  We will also seek to acquire global rights for product candidates we acquire or in-license in the future.
     Although our strategy focuses on in-licensing, developing and commercializing cancer therapeutics, we also may collaborate with other companies with regard to selected indications for our in-licensed product candidates.  For example, we have entered into a collaboration and license agreement with Janssen Biotech, Inc., or Janssen, under which we granted Janssen licenses under certain patent rights and know-how relating to niraparib, for prostate cancer worldwide (except Japan).  We may also collaborate with other companies regarding the rights to certain product candidates for specific geographies, such as with Jiangsu Hengrui Medicine Co., Ltd., or Hengrui, and Zai Lab (Shanghai) Co., Ltd., or Zai Lab.
     Overview of the Market for Cancer Therapeutics and Oncology Supportive Care Products
     Cancer is a group of diseases characterized by uncontrolled growth and spread of abnormal cells.  In January 2017, the American Cancer Society projected that there will be an estimated 1,688,780 new cancer cases diagnosed and 600,920 cancer deaths in the United States in 2017.  Current treatments for cancer include surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, hormone therapy, targeted therapy and immunotherapy.  The IMS Institute for Healthcare Informatics reported in 2016 that total global spending on oncology medicines, including therapeutic treatments and supportive care, reached the $107 billion threshold in 2015.
     Many marketed products and product candidates for treating cancer patients that are currently being developed by biopharmaceutical companies are cytotoxic chemotherapies that exert their anti-tumor effect on cancer generally through nonspecific damage to cellular components with the goal of causing cancer cell malfunction and cell death.  Other products and product candidates alter cell metabolism or internal repair mechanisms leading to the demise of the cancer cell.  More recently, targeted anti-cancer agents have been designed by scientists to inhibit the action of specific molecules within cancer cells that 

 
  7

 
are driving the aberrant growth responsible for tumor development.  Some of these targeted agents are developed in conjunction with companion diagnostic tests that are used by clinicians to determine if a patient’s cancerous tumor contains these specific molecules and is, therefore, more likely to respond to a particular targeted therapy.  Recent advances in cancer immunology have led to the development and availability of effective immunotherapies for the treatment of certain cancers.  For our current cancer therapeutics, we believe we have acquired product candidates where diagnostics or specific clinical criteria will allow us to identify cancer patients who will be more likely to respond to the therapeutic.  In the future, our preference will be to in-license or acquire cancer therapeutics that can be developed in a targeted patient population enriched for those who may respond to the drug candidate.  We expect that the characteristics of these compounds will permit us to design clinical trials that, if successful, may allow us to achieve clinical outcomes that will support regulatory approval for targeted patient groups and reimbursement by healthcare payors due to attractive risk/benefit metrics in the targeted population.
     All of these approaches may be associated with various side effects experienced by cancer patients that result from the treatments having an adverse impact on normal functioning cells and organ systems.  Some of the more common side effects of cancer therapy include nausea, vomiting or emesis, infections, fatigue and diarrhea.  Supportive care products are frequently prescribed or administered to cancer patients to prevent or treat these side effects thereby allowing the patients to continue to receive potentially life prolonging cancer therapies.
     Treatment centers (such as hospitals and community cancer centers) and the healthcare professionals who treat cancer patients (physicians, nurse practitioners, physician assistants, nurses and pharmacists) utilize various combinations of cancer therapeutics and oncology supportive care products to extend and improve the quality of life of these patients.  Our strategy is aligned with these trends in cancer care; that is, to acquire, in-license and develop product candidates and to commercialize products that selectively treat cancers and those that address the side effects from such treatments.
     Our Current Marketed Product
     VARUBI is a substance P/NK-1 receptor antagonist marketed in oral formulation in the United States for use in combination with other antiemetic agents in adults for the prevention of delayed (24 to 120 hours after chemotherapy administration) nausea and vomiting associated with initial and repeat courses of emetogenic cancer chemotherapy, including, but not limited to, highly emetogenic chemotherapy.  VARUBI received FDA approval on September 1, 2015, and we commenced shipments of VARUBI in November 2015.  The National Comprehensive Cancer Network, or NCCN®, has added VARUBI to the NCCN Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology, or NCCN Guidelines®, Antiemesis Version 2.2015 as a recommended option, in combination with other antiemetic agents, for patients receiving both high emetic risk intravenous chemotherapy, or HEC, and moderate emetic risk intravenous chemotherapy, or MEC.  Category 1, the highest level category of evidence and consensus, was granted to VARUBI for both HEC and MEC.  VARUBI is available to patients receiving emetogenic chemotherapy in hospitals and community cancer centers.
     We obtained the exclusive worldwide rights to research, develop, manufacture, market and sell rolapitant from OPKO Health, Inc., or OPKO, in December 2010.  OPKO had acquired certain NK-1 receptor related assets, including rolapitant, in 2010 from Schering-Plough Corporation, or Schering-Plough, as part of a U.S. Federal Trade Commission, or FTC, requirement to divest certain assets in connection with Schering-Plough’s combination with Merck.  We are also developing an IV formulation of rolapitant, for which we submitted an NDA to the FDA in March 2016.  In January 2017, the FDA issued us a Complete Response Letter with respect to the NDA.  In the Complete Response Letter, the FDA requested additional information regarding the in vitro release method utilized to characterize the drug product and demonstrate comparability of drug product produced at our two proposed commercial manufacturers for rolapitant IV that were included in the NDA.  We will need to provide the additional requested information to the FDA in the form of a resubmission of the NDA, which the FDA will need to deem acceptable, in order for the NDA to be approved and for us to be allowed to market and sell rolapitant IV in the U.S.  
     Market research suggests physicians are not currently utilizing NK-1 receptor antagonists in many situations where practice guidelines recommend their use.  We believe the U.S. market could expand based upon our sales and marketing activities intended to heighten awareness of the underutilization of NK-1 receptor antagonists for accepted uses, as well as the commercial activities of other companies marketing NK-1 receptor antagonists.  Overall trends in the market, growing awareness of supportive care issues and the implementation of guidelines for patient care, including the prevention of CINV, that are developed and published by oncology organizations, may also lead to greater use of NK-1 receptor antagonists.

 Our Product Candidates
     Our in-licensed product candidates and our immuno-oncology platform are consistent with our strategy to develop and commercialize cancer therapeutics and oncology supportive care products.  The following table summarizes the status of these product candidates.
    
         Rolapitant—Intravenous Formulation
     We are developing a single dose IV formulation of rolapitant to address what we believe is the market need for this dosage form.  We believe this formulation will provide physicians with an additional route of administering rolapitant, while also alleviating certain concerns associated with payor pre-approval, logistics and pharmacy availability that are sometimes associated with oral formulations of drugs utilized by cancer patients.  We selected a single intravenous dose of 185mg for development and successfully completed a study comparing the exposure of rolapitant IV and oral rolapitant, as well as a clinical study evaluating the safety of rolapitant IV to support an NDA submission.  We submitted an NDA to the FDA in March 2016 for the IV formulation of rolapitant, which relies heavily on, and references data in, our NDA submission for oral rolapitant.  As described elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we received a Complete Response Letter in January 2017.
     Niraparib—Poly (ADP-ribose) Polymerase (PARP) Inhibitor
     Overview
     Niraparib is an orally active and potent poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase, or PARP, inhibitor.  Niraparib has demonstrated promising results in clinical trials in advanced cancer patients.  In a Phase 1 trial, a maximum tolerated dose of 300mg of niraparib was determined, and anti-tumor activity in BRCA-deficient cancers was observed.  BRCA1 and BRCA2 belong to a class of human genes, the mutation of which has been linked to certain types of cancers, including breast, ovarian and lung.  PARP is a family of proteins involved in many functions in a cell, including DNA repair, gene expression, cell cycle control, intracellular trafficking and energy metabolism.  Results to date for clinical trials of PARP inhibitors indicate anti-cancer activity, which is particularly noteworthy in patients with germline BRCA mutations.  In addition, published scientific literature indicates that patients with platinum sensitive high-grade serous ovarian cancer who do not have germline BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations may also experience clinical benefit from treatment with a PARP inhibitor.

     Background on PARP Inhibitors
     One well-studied area of PARP activity relates to DNA repair.  DNA contains genetic instructions used in the development and functioning of most known living organisms.  DNA can be damaged by many types of mutagens, including oxidizing agents, alkylating agents, ultraviolet light and X-rays.  An important property of DNA is that it can replicate, or make copies of itself.  This is critical when cells divide because each new cell needs to have an exact copy of the DNA present in the old cell.  It is also critical to the integrity and survival of cells that DNA damage can be repaired.  Cells have evolved multiple mechanisms to enable such DNA repair, and these mechanisms are complementary to each other, each driving repair of specific types of DNA damage.  If a cell’s DNA damage repair system is overpowered, then the cell is programmed to die.
     Radiation and certain chemotherapies such as alkylating agents and topoisomerase inhibitors induce significant damage to tumor cells, which results in programmed cell death.  DNA repair mechanisms may reduce the activity of these anti-cancer therapies but, conversely, inhibition of DNA repair processes may enhance the effects of DNA-damaging anti-cancer therapy.  PARP is essential for some DNA repair processes and therefore may be an important target in cancer therapy.  Clinical trial results to date suggest that PARP inhibitors may be effective as a monotherapy in cancer patients with mutations in genes such as BRCA1 and BRCA2.  PARP inhibitors have also been explored in numerous clinical trials as potentiators of chemotherapy, including in combination with temozolomide, cisplatin, carboplatin, gemcitabine and topotecan.
     Key Characteristics of Niraparib
     Niraparib is an investigational, orally active and potent PARP inhibitor that we believe has certain desirable characteristics.  Nonclinical and clinical data suggest that niraparib may have advantages as a treatment for certain cancers, including:
     niraparib concentrates in the tumor to deliver potent inhibition of PARP and demonstrated tumor growth inhibition in tumor models;
     favorable pharmacokinetic properties in humans;
     reduction of PARP activity in human subjects;
     amenable dosage formulation for further clinical and commercial development;
     clinical activity with once daily oral administration as a monotherapy; and
     tolerability in a Phase 1 combination trial with full doses of another chemotherapy agent, temozolomide, and a biologically active dose of niraparib.
     Based upon these key characteristics, as well as the data discussed below, we believe that niraparib has the potential to be effective in patients with several tumor types.
     Niraparib Clinical Development
     In October 2016, we presented Phase 3 data from our NOVA trial at the annual congress of the European Society for Medical Oncology.  We have commenced the following clinical trials of niraparib:
· | NOVA: The NOVA trial was an international, randomized, double-blind, multi-center trial that assessed the effectiveness of niraparib compared with placebo to delay progression following a platinum containing chemotherapy regimen. Patients enrolled into one of two independent cohorts based on germline BRCA mutation, or gBRCAmut, status. Within each cohort, patients were randomized 2:1 to receive niraparib or placebo, and were continuously treated with placebo or 300mg of niraparib until progression. The primary endpoint of this study was progression free survival, or PFS. Secondary endpoints included patient-reported outcomes, chemotherapy free interval length, and overall survival. This trial successfully achieved its primary endpoint in both cohorts, showing that niraparib treatment significantly prolonged PFS compared to control in patients who were gBRCAmut carriers and in patients who were non-gBRCAmut carriers. In addition, within the non-gBRCAmut cohort, niraparib treatment significantly prolonged PFS compared to control for the

prospectively defined patient population with tumors deficient in homologous recombination as determined by the Myriad Genetics, Inc., or Myriad, myChoice® HRD test. A high proportion of patients in both treatment groups in both cohorts had received three or four prior lines of chemotherapy. The most common treatment-emergent grade 3/4 adverse events in the niraparib arm of the NOVA study were thrombocytopenia, anemia, and neutropenia.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | BRAVO: The first patient was dosed in this trial in April 2014. The BRAVO trial is an international, randomized, multi-center trial that assesses the effectiveness of niraparib compared with physician’s choice of either eribulin, capecitabine, vinorelbine or gemcitabine to delay progression in metastatic breast cancer patients who have germline BRCA mutations. The primary endpoint of this trial is progression free survival and the key secondary endpoint of this trial is overall survival. We expect to report data from this trial in the second half of 2017. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | QUADRA: In March 2015, we commenced a potential registration trial of niraparib for the treatment of patients with ovarian cancer who have received three or four regimens of therapy. The first patient was dosed in this trial in April 2015. QUADRA is a single arm, open label study. Endpoints include objective response rate and duration of response in patients with gBRCA mutations or homologous recombination deficiency, or HRD, tumors. We expect to report data from this trial in the second half of 2017. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | PRIMA: We initiated dosing in a Phase 3 clinical trial of niraparib in the first-line maintenance setting in ovarian cancer patients in August 2016. This study includes patients who have responded to first-line platinum chemotherapy. Patients will be randomized 2:1 to receive niraparib or placebo. The endpoints for this study include progression free survival, progression free survival in subsequent therapy and overall survival and safety. We expect enrollment in this trial to continue during 2017. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

      We are also collaborating on the following niraparib studies:
    
· | AVANOVA: In November 2014, we began collaborating with NSGO (in collaboration with ENGOT) in their trial evaluating niraparib plus bevacizumab in ovarian cancer patients in a Phase 1/2 trial.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | TOPACIO: In May 2015, we entered into a research agreement with Merck to perform a Phase 2 trial to evaluate the preliminary safety and efficacy of niraparib plus KEYTRUDA in patients with triple negative breast cancer and patients with ovarian cancer. We initiated dosing in this trial in April 2016.

      Immuno-Oncology Platform
     Background on Immuno-Oncology Platform
     Antibodies to immune checkpoint receptors have demonstrated promise in the treatment of tumors, including metastatic melanoma, renal cell carcinoma and non-small cell lung cancer, or NSCLC.  Although the normal function of immune checkpoint receptors is to maintain immune homeostasis, they are co-opted by certain tumors to evade immune surveillance.  PD-1, TIM-3 and LAG-3 are each checkpoint regulators that modulate the function of the immune system via different mechanisms and, when activated and interacting with their respective ligands, may limit the ability of the immune system to respond effectively to tumors.  By blocking the interaction of PD-1, TIM-3 and LAG-3 with their respective ligands, antibodies targeting these checkpoint regulators aim to restore immune anti-cancer function in patients across a variety of tumor types.  We believe that therapeutic antibodies selected from our collaboration with AnaptysBio could form the basis of a strategic platform that will potentially enable us to develop novel monotherapy and combination-based approaches with immuno-oncology and other anti-cancer agents in a variety of new tumor indications, not addressed with our current product candidates, and to study combination approaches in the clinic, both with our existing product candidates and potentially with new candidates we either in-license or access through collaborative transactions with others.  As further discussed below, antibody candidates from these programs entered clinical trials in 2016.
     Anti-PD-1 Antibodies
     Programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1, CD279) is a well-validated target for tumor immunotherapy.  PD-1 operates as a negative regulator of T-cell function and interacts with two ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2.  Many tumor types up-regulate PD-L1 on the cell surface as a means of modulating the host immune system and avoiding anti-tumor responses.  Antibodies to 

 
  11

 
PD-1 have now been studied in a number of clinical trials in several tumor types.  Anti-tumor responses of long duration have been noted, which may be further promoted through combination therapy with additional immuno-regulatory therapeutics.  These agents are now approved in multiple tumor types including, but not limited to, melanoma, NSCLC, bladder and renal carcinoma.
     We have selected a lead monospecific antibody for the PD-1 program, TSR-042, to which we have exclusive rights.  We commenced a Phase 1 clinical trial of TSR-042 in March 2016.  In addition, we are evaluating our immuno-oncology anti-tumor agents, including TSR-042, in preclinical combination studies with niraparib and will potentially do so with other anti-tumor agents.
     Anti-TIM-3 Antibodies
     T-cell immunoglobulin domain and mucin domain-3 (TIM-3), initially identified on activated Th1 cells, has been shown to be a negative regulator of the immune response.  Blockade of TIM-3 promotes T-cell mediated anti-tumor immunity and has anti-tumor activity in a range of mouse tumor models.  Combinations of TIM-3 blockade with other immunotherapeutic agents such as TSR-042 (our lead anti-PD-1 antibody), anti-CD137 antibodies and others, can be additive or synergistic in increasing anti-tumor effects.  TIM-3 expression has been associated with a number of different tumor types, including melanoma, NSCLC and renal cancer, and additionally, expression of intratumoral TIM-3 has been shown to correlate with poor prognosis across a range of tumor types, including NSCLC, cervical, and gastric cancers.  Blockade of TIM-3 is also of interest in promoting increased immunity to a number of chronic viral diseases.  TIM-3 has also been shown to interact with a number of ligands including galectin-9, phosphatidylserine and HMGB1, although which of these, if any, are relevant in regulation of anti-tumor responses is not clear at present.
     The aim of the TIM-3 program was to generate human or humanized antibodies to TIM-3 that have functional antagonist activity.  Such activity would be expected to block the negative signaling of TIM-3, enhance T-cell responses, and promote anti-tumor immune responses.  We have exclusive rights to a number of fully-human anti-TIM-3 antibodies with demonstrated functional activity that have been generated by AnaptysBio.  We have selected TSR-022 as our lead anti-TIM-3 candidate for clinical development, and we commenced a Phase 1 clinical trial of TSR-022 in July 2016.
     Anti-LAG-3 and Bi-Specific Anti-PD-1/LAG-3 Antibodies
     Lymphocyte-activation gene-3 (LAG-3) is a CD4 related transmembrane protein expressed on activated T-cells and regulatory T-cells.  Following T-cell activation and up-regulation of LAG-3, LAG-3 binds MHC Class II and results in down-regulation of the immune response.  Affinity of LAG-3 for MHC class II is higher than that of CD4, allowing for potent dampening of T-cell activation via direct blocking of the interaction as well as direct signaling.  Blockade of LAG-3 promotes T-cell mediated anti-tumor immunity and has anti-tumor activity in a range of mouse tumor models.  Simultaneous blockade of LAG-3 with PD-1 appears to be synergistic with enhanced anti-tumor effects.
     The aim of the LAG-3 program was to generate human or humanized antibodies to LAG-3 that have functional antagonist activity.  Such activity would be expected to block the negative signaling of LAG-3 and promote anti-tumor immune responses.  Monospecific anti-LAG-3 antibodies were generated by AnaptysBio and from this effort, we have selected TSR-033 as our lead anti-LAG-3 candidate for clinical development.  We expect to submit an investigational new drug application, or IND, to the FDA for TSR-033 in the first half of 2017.  In addition, we have selected a bi-specific antibody to PD-1 and LAG-3 as a potential lead clinical candidate.
     Licensing Agreements
     License for Rolapitant
     In December 2010, we entered into a license agreement with OPKO to obtain an exclusive, royalty bearing, sublicensable worldwide license, to research, develop, manufacture, market and sell rolapitant.  The license agreement also extends to an additional, backup compound, SCH900978, to which we have the same rights and obligations as rolapitant, but which we are not currently advancing.  Under the OPKO license, we are obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to conduct all preclinical, clinical, regulatory and other activities necessary to develop and commercialize rolapitant.
     Under the terms of the OPKO license, upon signing of the agreement, we paid OPKO $6.0 million and issued convertible preferred stock then valued at $0.6 million, which has since been converted to common stock.  We are also required 

 
  12

 
to make development milestone payments to OPKO of up to an aggregate of $30.0 million, of which we have paid $20.0 million to date, if specified regulatory and initial commercial sales milestones are achieved.  In addition, we are required to make additional milestone payments to OPKO of up to an aggregate of $85.0 million if specified levels of annual net sales of rolapitant are achieved.  We are required to pay OPKO tiered royalties on the amount of annual net sales of rolapitant achieved in the United States and Europe at percentage rates that range from the low teens to the low twenties, which we expect will result in an effective royalty rate in the low teens.  The royalty rate on annual net sales outside of the United States and Europe is slightly above the single digits.  We will pay royalties on rolapitant until the later of the date that all of the patent rights licensed from OPKO and covering rolapitant expire, are invalidated or are not enforceable and 12 years from the first commercial sale of the product, in each case, on a country-by-country and product-by-product basis.  If we elect to develop and commercialize rolapitant in Japan through a third-party licensee, we will share equally with OPKO all amounts received by us in connection with such activities under our agreement with such third party, subject to certain exceptions and deductions.
     The license with OPKO will remain in force until the expiration of the royalty term in each country, unless OPKO has cause to terminate the license earlier for our material breach of the license or bankruptcy.  We have a right to terminate the license at any time during the term for any reason on three months’ written notice to OPKO.
     License for Niraparib
     In May 2012, we entered into a license agreement with Merck Sharp & Dohme Corp., a subsidiary of Merck, under which we obtained exclusive, worldwide rights to certain patents and non-exclusive rights to certain Merck know-how, to research, develop, manufacture, market and sell niraparib and a backup compound, MK-2512, for all therapeutic and prophylactic uses in humans.  We are not currently advancing MK-2512.  Under the Merck license, we are obligated to use diligent efforts to develop and commercialize a licensed product.  In April 2016, we entered into an amendment to the license agreement with Merck in connection with the entry into our collaboration agreement with Janssen to develop and commercialize niraparib in prostate cancer patients.  Under the terms of the amendment, Merck agreed to waive or modify certain rights, including co-promotion, exclusivity, commercialization and diligence, solely with respect to products in prostate cancer developed or commercialized by Janssen.
     Under the terms of the license agreement, we made an up-front payment to Merck of $7.0 million in June 2012.  We are required to make total milestone payments to Merck of up to $57.0 million in development and regulatory milestones for the first indication, up to $29.5 million in development and regulatory milestones for each successive indication, and up to $87.5 million in one-time sales milestones based on the achievement of annual sales objectives.  We have made milestone payments to Merck to date totaling $12.8 million.  If commercial sales of niraparib commence, we will pay Merck tiered royalties at percentage rates in the low teens based on worldwide annual net sales, until the later of the expiration of the last patent licensed from Merck covering or claiming niraparib, or the tenth anniversary of the first commercial sale of niraparib, in either case, on a country-by-country basis.
     The license with Merck will remain in effect until the expiration of the royalty term in such country, unless terminated earlier by the mutual agreement of the parties or due to the material breach or bankruptcy of a party.  In addition, beginning upon completion of the first Phase 2 clinical trial of a licensed product candidate, we may terminate the license without cause by giving 180 days written notice.
     In October 2012, we also entered into two license agreements with AstraZeneca UK Limited, having aggregate up-front payments of $0.4 million.  These agreements provide us with the exclusive right to certain methods of treating patients with PARP inhibitors solely with respect to niraparib.  Under certain circumstances, we may be required to make milestone and royalty payments to AstraZeneca UK Limited based on the achievement of certain development and regulatory milestone events with regard to niraparib, and on net sales of niraparib.
     License for Immuno-Oncology Platform
     In March 2014, we entered into a collaboration and exclusive license agreement with AnaptysBio, a therapeutic antibody company.  We executed an amendment in November 2014 to add an additional bi-specific antibody product candidate.  We entered into another amendment in February 2016 to extend the term of the initial discovery period and our and AnaptysBio’s associated activities under the agreement.  Under the terms of the amended agreement, we obtained an exclusive, royalty-bearing, sublicensable worldwide license to research, develop, manufacture, market and sell products based on AnaptysBio’s proprietary technology for the discovery, generation and optimization of certain specified immunotherapy antibodies.  Specifically, we received exclusive rights to monospecific antibody product candidates targeting PD-1 (TSR-042), 

 
  13

 
TIM-3 (TSR-022) and LAG-3 (TSR-033) and certain bi-specific antibody product candidates.  Under the amended agreement, AnaptysBio is responsible for performing initial discovery and development of therapeutic antibodies with the goal of generating immunotherapy antibodies for use in the treatment of cancer.  We are responsible for all subsequent preclinical, clinical, regulatory, manufacturing and other activities necessary to develop and commercialize antibodies selected under each of four development programs, and we are obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to research, develop or commercialize at least one product under each development program.
     Under the terms of this agreement, we made up-front, non-creditable and non-refundable cash payments of $19.0 million to AnaptysBio during 2014.  We are required to reimburse AnaptysBio on a quarterly basis for specified costs incurred by AnaptysBio in its initial discovery and development activities covered by the agreement.  For each of the four development programs, we will also be required to make milestone payments to AnaptysBio of up to $18.0 million if certain research and development milestone events are achieved, and up to an additional $90.0 million of milestone payments if certain U.S. and non-U.S. regulatory submissions and approvals occur in initial and subsequent indications.  We have made $11.0 million in development milestone payments to date.  We will also be required to pay AnaptysBio tiered single-digit royalties, on a product-by-product basis, on worldwide annual net sales, and additional commercial milestone payments if specified levels of annual net sales of a product are attained.
     This agreement expires on the earliest date after which no further payments are due to AnaptysBio, unless earlier terminated.  Either party may terminate the agreement in the event of an uncured material breach by the other party.  We may terminate the agreement at any time upon 90 days prior written notice to AnaptysBio.
     Competition
     Our industry is highly competitive and subject to rapid and significant technological change.  While we believe that our development experience and scientific knowledge provide us with competitive advantages, we may face competition from large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, smaller pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, including specialty pharmaceutical companies and generic drug companies, academic institutions, government agencies and research institutions, and others.
     The acquisition or licensing of pharmaceutical products is also very competitive, and several other companies, including more established companies, have acknowledged strategies to in-license or acquire products.  Other companies taking similar or different approaches to product acquisitions, including more established companies, may have competitive advantages.  The more established companies may have competitive advantages due to their size, cash flows and institutional experience.
     Compared to TESARO, many of our competitors may have significantly greater financial, technical and human resource capabilities.  Mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors.  Our commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop or market products or other novel technologies that are more effective, safer or less costly than any that will be commercialized by us, or obtain regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours.  Our success will be based in part on our ability to identify, develop, and manage a portfolio of drugs that are safer and more effective in the treatment and support of cancer patients.
     Rolapitant Competition
     In addition to VARUBI, there are currently two other commercially available branded NK-1 receptor antagonists and one commercially available generic NK-1 receptor antagonist.  Oral aprepitant and its IV pro-drug fosaprepitant, which are both known by the brand name EMEND®, are marketed by Merck. We believe the IV formulation of EMEND accounted for a significant majority of all EMEND usage in the U.S. in 2016.  A combination of netupitant and palonosetron, which is known by the brand name AKYNZEO®, is marketed by Helsinn Healthcare, or Helsinn, as a combination of NK-1 and 5-HT3 receptor antagonists.  Helsinn introduced AKYNZEO in capsule form in October 2014, and has an IV formulation in Phase 3 development.  We are also aware that Sandoz launched a generic version of aprepitant in late 2016, which competes with oral VARUBI.

 Niraparib Competition
     There are currently two commercially available PARP inhibitors.  AstraZeneca Plc’s LYNPARZATM (olaparib) was approved in December 2014 by the FDA for use in ovarian cancer patients with a germline BRCA mutation who have been treated with three or more prior lines of chemotherapy, and also by the European Commission following a positive opinion by the EMA for use as a monotherapy for the maintenance treatment of adult patients with platinum-sensitive relapsed BRCA-mutated (germline and/or somatic) high grade serous epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer who are in complete or partial response to platinum-based chemotherapy.  Clovis Oncology, Inc.’s RUBRACATM (rucaparib) was approved in December 2016 by the FDA for use as a monotherapy for the treatment of patients with deleterious BRCA mutation (germline and/or somatic) associated advanced ovarian cancer who have been treated with two or more chemotherapies.  We believe the additional products in clinical development targeting the PARP pathway consist of: Pfizer’s talazoparib (MDV3800) and AbbVie’s ABT-888 (veliparib), both currently in Phase 3 clinical trials; Eisai, Inc.’s E-7016 and E-7449, currently in Phase 2 and Phase 1/2 clinical trials, respectively; and AbbVie’s ABT-767, BeiGene/EMD Serono (Merck KGaA)’s BGB-290, Checkpoint Therapeutics’ CK-102 (formerly CEP-9722) and Hengrui’s fluzoparib, each currently in Phase 1 clinical trials.  Both LYNPARZA and rucaparib have received “orphan drug designation” from the EMA, which provides certain benefits including market exclusivity for up to ten years in the approved indication post-approval.
     Immuno-Oncology Competition
     We are aware of several companies that have antibody-based products on the market or in clinical development that are directed at the same biological targets as some of our immuno-oncology programs.  There are currently two anti-PD-1 antibody products being marketed.  In 2014, Bristol-Myers Squibb received approval for OPDIVO® (nivolumab) and Merck received approval for KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab) for injection, for use by patients with melanoma who have progressed on YERVOY® (ipilimumab).  KEYTRUDA and OPDIVO have also been approved for the treatment of non-small cell lung cancers.  KEYTRUDA is also indicated for patients with PD-L1 high expressing non-small cell lung cancer who have not been previously treated, and previously treated squamous cell head and neck cancer.  Additional approvals for OPDIVO include previously treated renal cancer, previously treated classical Hodgkin Lymphoma, and previously treated squamous cell head and neck cancer.  In 2016, the FDA approved Roche’s anti-PD-L1 antibody TECENTRIQ (atezolizumab) in both previously treated bladder cancer and non-small cell lung cancer.  We are aware of several companies that are developing or co-developing anti-PDL-1 and/or anti-PD-1 modulators for various indications, including Pfizer, Roche, Medimmune (AstraZeneca), EMD Serono (Merck KGaA), Novartis, Eli Lilly, Hengrui/Incyte, Boehringer Ingelheim, BeiGene and Regeneron/Sanofi.
     There are currently no anti-TIM-3 antibody products or anti-LAG-3 antibody products being marketed.  We are aware that one company, Novartis, has an anti-TIM-3 modulator antibody in Phase 1/2 clinical development for various indications.  We are also aware of several companies that have anti-LAG-3 modulators in development for various indications, including Bristol-Myers Squibb, which has an anti-LAG-3 antibody in Phase 2 clinical development, Novartis, which has an anti-LAG-3 antibody that is in Phase 1/2 clinical development, and Merck and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, each of which has an anti-LAG-3 antibody in Phase 1 clinical development.  We are also aware of several other companies with immuno-oncology antibodies or programs in the preclinical or research phase.
     For more information on the market for cancer therapeutics and oncology supportive care products, our competitors and the products that may compete with our product candidates, see “—Overview of the Market for Cancer Therapeutics and Oncology Supportive Care Products”, “—Our Current Marketed Product”, “—Our Product Candidates—Rolapitant—Intravenous Formulation”, “—Our Product Candidates—Niraparib—Poly (ADP-ribose) Polymerase (PARP) Inhibitor” and “—Our Product Candidates— Immuno-Oncology Platform.”
     Commercial Operations
     Our U.S.-based commercial operations team, hired primarily in 2015 and expanded during 2016, consists of approximately 120 employees.  Our European commercial operations, established in 2016, consists of approximately 20 employees in six countries including those at our international headquarters office in Zug, Switzerland.  The commercial infrastructure includes a targeted, oncology sales force to establish relationships with a focused group of oncologists, oncology nurses and pharmacists.  Personnel in sales management, internal sales training, sales operations, marketing, marketing operations and distribution support the sales force.  Additionally, the sales, marketing and market access teams manage relationships with key accounts such as managed care organizations, group purchasing organizations, hospital systems, oncology group networks, and government accounts.  To further develop our commercial infrastructure in the event that any 

 
  15

 
other product candidates receive regulatory approval, we expect to invest significant financial and management resources, much of which will be committed at the risk that any such product candidate may not be approved by any regulatory agency.
     Government Regulation
     As a biopharmaceutical company that operates in the United States, we are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA and other federal, state, and local regulatory agencies.  The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or the FDC Act, and the Public Health Service Act, or PHSA, and their implementing regulations set forth, among other things, requirements for the testing, development, manufacture, quality control, safety, effectiveness, approval, labeling, storage, record keeping, reporting, distribution, import, export, advertising and promotion of our products and product candidates.  Although the discussion below focuses on regulation in the United States, we are also beginning to seek approval for, and anticipate marketing, our products in other countries.  Generally, our activities in other countries will be subject to regulation that, although similar in nature and scope in some respects to that imposed in the United States, includes important differences.  Additionally, some significant aspects of regulation in the European Union, or the EU, are addressed in a centralized way through the EMA and the European Commission, but the specific regulation of EU Member States remains essential in many respects for certain types of authorization processes, pricing and reimbursement and promotional activities.     Development and Approval
     Under the FDC Act, FDA approval of an NDA is required before any new drug can be marketed in the United States.  Under the PHSA, FDA licensure of a biologics license application, or BLA, is required before a biologic can be marketed in the United States.  NDAs and BLAs require extensive studies and submission of a large amount of data by the applicant.
     Preclinical Testing. Before testing any compound in human subjects in the United States, a company must generate extensive preclinical data.  Preclinical testing generally includes laboratory evaluation of product chemistry and formulation, as well as toxicological and pharmacological studies in several animal species to assess the quality and safety of the product.  Animal studies must be performed in compliance with the FDA’s Good Laboratory Practice, or GLP, regulations and the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Animal Welfare Act.
     IND Application. Human clinical trials in the United States cannot commence until an IND application is submitted and becomes effective.  A company must submit preclinical testing results to the FDA as part of the IND, and the FDA must evaluate whether there is an adequate basis for testing the drug in initial clinical studies in human volunteers.  Unless the FDA raises concerns, the IND becomes effective 30 days following its receipt by the FDA.  Once human clinical trials have commenced, the FDA may stop the clinical trials by placing them on “clinical hold” because of concerns about the safety of the product being tested, or for other reasons.
     Clinical Trials. Clinical trials involve the administration of the drug to healthy human volunteers or to patients, under the supervision of a qualified investigator.  The conduct of clinical trials is subject to extensive regulation, including compliance with the FDA’s bioresearch monitoring regulations and Good Clinical Practice, or GCP, requirements, which establish standards for conducting, recording data from, and reporting the results of, clinical trials, and are intended to assure that the data and reported results are credible and accurate, and that the rights, safety, and well-being of study participants are protected.  Clinical trials must be conducted under protocols that detail the study objectives, parameters for monitoring safety, and the efficacy criteria, if any, to be evaluated.  Each protocol is reviewed by the FDA as part of the IND.  In addition, each clinical trial must be reviewed and approved by, and conducted under the auspices of, an institutional review board, or IRB.  Companies sponsoring the clinical trials, investigators, and IRBs also must comply with applicable regulations and guidelines for obtaining informed consent from the study subjects, following the protocol and investigational plan, adequately monitoring the clinical trial, and timely reporting of adverse events.  Foreign studies conducted under an IND must meet the same requirements that apply to studies being conducted in the United States.  Data from a foreign study not conducted under an IND may be submitted in support of an NDA or BLA if the study was conducted in accordance with GCP and the FDA is able to validate the data.
     A study sponsor is required to publicly post certain details about active clinical trials and clinical trial results on government or independent websites (e.g., http://clinicaltrials.gov). Human clinical trials typically are conducted in three sequential phases, although the phases may overlap with one another:
    
· | Phase 1 clinical trials include the initial administration of the investigational drug to humans, typically to a small group of healthy human subjects, but occasionally to a group of patients with the targeted disease or disorder.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
  16

 

Phase 1 clinical trials generally are intended to determine the metabolism and pharmacologic actions of the drug, the side effects associated with increasing doses, and, if possible, to gain early evidence of effectiveness.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Phase 2 clinical trials generally are controlled studies that involve a relatively small sample of the intended patient population, and are designed to develop data regarding the product’s effectiveness, to determine dose response and the optimal dose range, and to gather additional information relating to safety and potential adverse effects.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Phase 3 clinical trials are conducted after preliminary evidence of effectiveness has been obtained, and are intended to gather the additional information about safety and effectiveness necessary to evaluate the drug’s overall risk-benefit profile, and to provide a basis for physician labeling. Generally, Phase 3 clinical development programs consist of expanded, large-scale studies of patients with the target disease or disorder to obtain statistical evidence of the efficacy and safety of the drug at the proposed dosing regimen, or the safety, purity, and potency of a biological product. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

      The sponsoring company, the FDA, or the IRB may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk.  Further, success in early-stage clinical trials does not assure success in later-stage clinical trials.  Data obtained from clinical activities are not always conclusive and may be subject to alternative interpretations that could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval.
     NDA/BLA Submission and Review. After completing clinical testing of an investigational drug or biologic, a sponsor must prepare and submit an NDA or BLA for review and approval by the FDA.  The NDA is a comprehensive, multi-volume application that includes, among other things, the results of preclinical and clinical studies, information about the drug’s composition, and our plans for manufacturing, packaging, and labeling the drug.  For certain candidates, such as immunotherapeutic antibodies, this information is submitted in a BLA.  When an NDA or BLA is submitted, the FDA conducts a preliminary review to determine whether the application is sufficiently complete to be accepted for filing.  If it is not, the FDA may refuse to file the application and request additional information, in which case the application must be resubmitted with the supplemental information, and review of the application is delayed.
     FDA performance goals generally provide for action on an application within 12 months of submission, but that deadline is extended in certain circumstances.  Moreover, the review process is often significantly extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification.  The FDA also has programs intended to expedite the development and review of new drugs intended to address unmet medical needs for serious or life-threatening conditions.  Through priority review designation, for example, the FDA can expedite the target action date to eight months from application submission, if the agency finds that a drug is intended to treat a serious condition and, if approved, would provide a significant improvement in safety or effectiveness.  Another example is fast-track designation, which the FDA may grant to a drug that is intended to treat a serious condition and that demonstrates the potential to address an unmet medical need.  Under the fast track program, the FDA allows a sponsor to submit completed portions of an NDA on a rolling basis, rather than requiring the entire application to be submitted before review begins.  Product candidates with fast-track designation also may be eligible for more frequent meetings or correspondence with the agency during the development process.
     As part of its review, the FDA may refer an NDA or BLA to an advisory committee for evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved.  Although the FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, the agency usually has followed such recommendations.  The FDA may determine that a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, is necessary to ensure that the benefits of a new product outweigh its risks, and the product can therefore be approved.  A REMS may include various elements, ranging from a medication guide or patient package insert to limitations on who may prescribe or dispense the drug, depending on what the FDA considers necessary for the safe use of the drug.  Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act, certain applications for approval must include an assessment, generally based on clinical study data, of the safety and effectiveness of the subject drug or biological product in relevant pediatric populations.  We have an agreed-upon pediatric plan to assess the effectiveness of rolapitant in the pediatric population.
     After review of an NDA or BLA, the FDA may decide to not approve the application or issue a complete response letter outlining the deficiencies in the submission.  The complete response letter also may request additional information, including additional preclinical or clinical data.  Even if such additional information and data are submitted, the FDA may decide that the NDA still does not meet the standards for approval.  Data from clinical trials are not always conclusive and the FDA may interpret data differently than the sponsor.  Obtaining regulatory approval often takes a number of years, involves the 

 
  17

 
expenditure of substantial resources, and depends on a number of factors, including the severity of the disease in question, the availability of alternative treatments, and the risks and benefits demonstrated in clinical trials.  Additionally, as a condition of approval, the FDA may impose restrictions that could affect the commercial success of a drug or require post-approval commitments, including the completion within a specified time period of additional clinical studies, which often are referred to as “Phase 4” or “post-marketing” studies.
     Post-approval modifications to the drug or biologic product, such as changes in indications, labeling, or manufacturing processes or facilities, may require a sponsor to develop additional data or conduct additional preclinical or clinical trials, to be submitted in a new or supplemental NDA or BLA, which would require FDA approval.
     Post-Approval Regulation
     Once approved, products are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA.  If ongoing regulatory requirements are not met or if safety problems occur after the product reaches the market, the FDA may at any time withdraw product approval or take actions that would limit or suspend marketing. Additionally, the FDA may require post-marketing studies or clinical trials if new safety information develops.
     Good Manufacturing Practices. Companies engaged in manufacturing drug products or their components must comply with applicable current Good Manufacturing Practice, or cGMP, requirements and product-specific regulations enforced by the FDA and other regulatory agencies.  Compliance with cGMP includes adhering to requirements relating to organization and training of personnel, buildings and facilities, equipment, control of components and drug product containers and closures, production and process controls, quality control and quality assurance, packaging and labeling controls, holding and distribution, laboratory controls, and records and reports.  The FDA regulates and inspects equipment, facilities, and processes used in manufacturing pharmaceutical or biologic products, prior to approval.  If, after receiving approval, a company makes a material change in manufacturing equipment, location, or process (all of which are, to some degree, incorporated in the NDA or BLA), additional regulatory review and approval may be required.  The FDA also conducts regular, periodic visits to re-inspect equipment, facilities, and processes following the initial approval of a product.  Failure to comply with applicable cGMP requirements and conditions of product approval may lead the FDA to seek sanctions, including fines, civil penalties, injunctions, suspension of manufacturing operations, operating restrictions, withdrawal of FDA approval, seizure or recall of products, and criminal prosecution.  Although we periodically monitor the FDA compliance of our third-party manufacturers, we cannot be certain that our present or future third-party manufacturers will consistently comply with cGMP and other applicable FDA regulatory requirements.
     Advertising and Promotion. The FDA and other federal regulatory agencies closely regulate the marketing and promotion of drugs and biologics through, among other things, standards and regulations for direct-to-consumer advertising, advertising and promotion to healthcare professionals, communications regarding unapproved uses, industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities, and promotional activities involving the Internet.  A product cannot be commercially promoted before it is approved.  After approval, product promotion can include only those claims relating to safety and effectiveness that are consistent with the labeling approved by the FDA.  Healthcare providers are permitted to prescribe drugs and biologics for “off-label” uses—that is, uses not approved by the FDA and therefore not described in the product’s labeling—because the FDA does not regulate the practice of medicine.  However, FDA regulations impose stringent restrictions on manufacturers’ communications regarding off-label uses.  Broadly speaking, a manufacturer may not promote a drug or biologic for off-label use, but under certain conditions may engage in non-promotional, balanced, scientific communication regarding off-label use.  Failure to comply with applicable FDA requirements and restrictions in this area may subject a company to adverse publicity and enforcement action by the FDA, the Department of Justice, or the Office of Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services, as well as state authorities.  This could subject a company to a range of penalties that could have a significant commercial impact, including civil and criminal fines and agreements that materially restrict the manner in which a company promotes or distributes drug or biological products.
     Other Requirements. In addition, companies that manufacture or distribute drug or biological products or that hold approved NDAs or BLAs must comply with other regulatory requirements, including submitting annual reports, reporting information about adverse drug experiences, and maintaining certain records.

 Hatch-Waxman Act
     The Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, or the Hatch-Waxman Act, establishes two abbreviated approval pathways for pharmaceutical products that are in some way follow-on versions of already approved products.
     Generic Drugs. A generic version of an approved drug is approved by means of an abbreviated new drug application, or ANDA, by which the sponsor demonstrates that the proposed product is the same as the approved, brand-name drug, which is referred to as the “reference listed drug,” or RLD.  Generally, an ANDA must contain data and information showing that the proposed generic product and RLD (1) have the same active ingredient, in the same strength and dosage form, to be delivered via the same route of administration, (2) are intended for the same uses, and (3) are bioequivalent.  This is instead of independently demonstrating the proposed product’s safety and effectiveness, which are inferred from the fact that the product is the same as the RLD, which the FDA previously found to be safe and effective.
     505(b)(2) NDAs. If a product is similar, but not identical, to an already approved product, it may be submitted for approval via an NDA under FDC Act section 505(b)(2).  Unlike an ANDA, this does not excuse the sponsor from demonstrating the proposed product’s safety and effectiveness.  Rather, the sponsor is permitted to rely to some degree on the FDA’s finding that the RLD is safe and effective, and must submit its own product-specific data of safety and effectiveness to an extent necessary because of the differences between the products.
     RLD Patents. An NDA sponsor must identify to the FDA patents that claim the drug substance or drug product or a method of using the drug.  When the drug is approved, those patents are among the information about the product that is listed in the FDA publication, Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations, which is referred to as the Orange Book.  The sponsor of an ANDA or 505(b)(2) application seeking to rely on an approved product as the RLD must make one of several certifications regarding each listed patent.  A “Paragraph III” certification is the sponsor’s statement that it will wait for the patent to expire before obtaining approval for its product.  A “Paragraph IV” certification is an assertion that the patent does not block approval of the later product, either because the patent is invalid or unenforceable or because the patent, even if valid, is not infringed by the new product.
     Regulatory Exclusivities. The Hatch-Waxman Act provides periods of regulatory exclusivity for products that would serve as RLDs for an ANDA or 505(b)(2) application.  If a product is a “new chemical entity,” or NCE—generally meaning that the active moiety has never before been approved in any drug—there is a period of five years from the product’s approval during which the FDA may not accept for filing any ANDA or 505(b)(2) application for a drug with the same active moiety.  An ANDA or 505(b)(2) application may be submitted after four years, however, if its sponsor makes a Paragraph IV certification.
     A product that is not an NCE may qualify for a three-year period of exclusivity if the NDA contains new clinical data, derived from studies conducted by or for the sponsor, that were necessary for approval.  In that instance, the exclusivity period does not preclude filing or review of the ANDA or 505(b)(2) application; rather, the FDA is precluded from granting final approval to the ANDA or 505(b)(2) application until three years after approval of the RLD.  Additionally, the exclusivity applies only to the conditions of approval that required submission of the clinical data.  For example, if an NDA is submitted for a product that is not an NCE, but that seeks approval for a new indication, and clinical data were required to demonstrate the safety or effectiveness of the product for that use, the FDA could not approve an ANDA or 505(b)(2) application for another product with that active moiety for that use.
     Once the FDA accepts for filing an ANDA or 505(b)(2) application containing a Paragraph IV certification, the applicant must within 20 days provide notice to the RLD NDA holder and patent owner that the application has been submitted, and provide the factual and legal basis for the applicant’s assertion that the patent is invalid or not infringed.  If the NDA holder or patent owner files suit against the ANDA or 505(b)(2) applicant for patent infringement within 45 days of receiving the Paragraph IV notice, the FDA is prohibited from approving the ANDA or 505(b)(2) application for a period of 30 months or the resolution of the underlying suit, whichever is earlier.  If the RLD has NCE exclusivity and the notice is given and suit filed during the fifth year of exclusivity, the 30-month stay does not begin until five years after the RLD approval.  The FDA may approve the proposed product before the expiration of the 30-month stay if a court finds the patent invalid or not infringed or if the court shortens the period because the parties have failed to cooperate in expediting the litigation.  At present, rolapitant is an NCE with five-year NCE exclusivity and, if approved, niraparib will qualify for five-year NCE exclusivity.

 Patent Term Restoration. A portion of the patent term lost during product development and FDA review of an NDA or BLA is restored if approval of the application is the first permitted commercial marketing of a drug containing the active ingredient.  The patent term restoration period is generally one-half the time between the effective date of the IND or the date of patent grant (whichever is later) and the date of submission of the NDA or BLA, plus the time between the date of submission of the NDA or BLA and the date of FDA approval of the product.  The maximum period of restoration is five years, and the patent cannot be extended to more than 14 years from the date of FDA approval of the product.  Only one patent claiming each approved product is eligible for restoration and the patent holder must apply for restoration within 60 days of approval.  The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, or the USPTO, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for patent term restoration.  When any of our products is approved, we intend to seek patent term restoration for an applicable patent when it is appropriate.  At present, we anticipate that rolapitant and, if approved, niraparib will qualify for patent term restoration.  We have applied for patent term restoration for rolapitant.
     The Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act
     The Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act, or BPCI Act, authorizes the FDA to license a biological product that is biosimilar to an FDA-licensed biologic through an abbreviated pathway.  The BPCI Act establishes criteria for determining that a product is biosimilar to an already-licensed biologic, or reference product, and establishes a process by which an abbreviated BLA for a biosimilar product is submitted, reviewed and approved.  The BPCI Act provides periods of exclusivity that protect a reference product from biosimilars competition.  Under the BPCI Act, the FDA may not accept a biosimilar application for review until four years after the date of first licensure of the reference product, and the biosimilar may not be licensed until at least 12 years after the reference product’s approval.  Additionally, the BPCI Act establishes procedures by which the biosimilar applicant provides information about its application and product to the reference product sponsor, and by which information about potentially relevant patents may be shared and litigation over patents may proceed in advance of approval.  The BPCI Act also provides a period of exclusivity for the first biosimilar determined by the FDA to be interchangeable with the reference product.
     We anticipate that the contours of the BPCI Act will continue to be defined as the statute is implemented over a period of years.  This likely will be accomplished by a variety of means, including decisions related to the statute by the relevant federal courts, FDA issuance of guidance documents, and FDA decisions in the course of considering specific applications.  The FDA has to date issued various guidance documents and other materials indicating the agency’s thinking regarding a number of issues implicated by the BPCI Act.  Additionally, the FDA’s approval of several biosimilar applications in recent years has helped define the agency’s approach to certain issues.
     America Invents Act
     As part of the passage of the America Invents Act in 2011, new post-grant review proceedings were added to U.S. patent law. Among these procedures are post-grant reviews and inter partes reviews, which allow any member of the public to file a petition with the USPTO seeking to review the patentability of one or more claims in an issued U.S. patent.  Post-grant review proceedings are conducted before Administrative Patent Judges in the USPTO using a lower standard of proof than used in Federal District Court.  In addition, the challenged patents are not accorded a presumption of validity as they are in Federal District Court.     Other Exclusivities
     Pediatric Exclusivity. Section 505A of the FDC Act provides for six months of additional exclusivity and patent protection if an NDA sponsor submits pediatric data that fairly respond to a written request from the FDA for such data. The data does not need to show the product to be effective in the pediatric population studied; rather, if the clinical trial is deemed to fairly respond to the FDA’s request, the additional protection is granted.  If reports of requested pediatric studies are submitted to and accepted by the FDA within the statutory time limits, whatever statutory or regulatory periods of exclusivity or Orange Book listed patent protection that cover the drug are extended by six months.  This is not a patent term extension, but it effectively extends the regulatory period during which the FDA cannot approve an ANDA or 505(b)(2) application owing to regulatory exclusivity or listed patents.  The BPCI Act incorporates by reference many provisions of section 505A of the FDC Act, such that if pediatric studies for a biological product fairly respond to a written request from the FDA, are completed in a timely fashion, and otherwise comply with applicable requirements, the 12-year exclusivity period will be deemed to be 12 and a half years, and the four year period will be deemed to be four and a half years.  However, six-month pediatric exclusivity does not attach to patents for a biological product under the BPCI Act.  When any of our products is approved, we anticipate seeking pediatric exclusivity when it is appropriate.

     Orphan Drug Exclusivity. The Orphan Drug Act provides incentives for the development of drugs and biological products intended to treat rare diseases or conditions, which generally are diseases or conditions affecting less than 200,000 individuals in the United States.  If a sponsor demonstrates that a drug or biologic is intended to treat a rare disease or condition, the FDA grants orphan drug designation to the product for that use.  The benefits of orphan drug designation include research and development tax credits and exemption from user fees.  A drug or biologic that is approved for the orphan drug designated indication is granted seven years of orphan drug exclusivity.  During that period, the FDA generally may not approve any other application for the same product for the same indication, although there are exceptions, most notably when the later product is shown to be clinically superior to the product with exclusivity.  We intend to seek orphan drug designation and exclusivity for our products whenever it is available.
     21st Century Cures Act
     In December 2016, the United States Congress passed the 21st Century Cures Act, or the Cures Act, which includes a number of provisions designed to speed development of innovative therapies, provide funding authorization to the National Institutes of Health, or NIH, and provide funding for certain oncology-directed research.  Because the Cures Act was enacted recently, it is difficult to know whether or how it will directly affect our business.  However, it also includes a provision which requires us to post our policies on the availability of certain expanded access programs.  In addition, the Cures Act includes provisions that may be beneficial to us in the future, including a requirement that the FDA assess and publish guidance on the use of novel clinical trial designs, the use of real world evidence in applications, the availability of summary level review for supplemental applications for certain indications, and the qualification of drug development tools.  Because these provisions allow the FDA several years to develop these policies, their effects on us, if any, could be delayed.
     The Cures Act also authorizes $1.8 billion in funding for the “Cancer Moonshot” initiative.  The Cancer Moonshot initiative’s strategic goals encourage inter-agency cooperation and fund research and innovation to catalyze new scientific breakthroughs, bring new therapies to patients, and strengthen prevention and diagnosis.  This initiative aims to stimulate drug development through the creation of a public-private partnership with 20 to 30 pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies to expedite cancer researchers’ access to investigational agents and approved drugs.  This partnership is designed to permit researchers to obtain drugs and other technologies from a preapproved “formulary” list without having to negotiate with each company for individual research projects.  We will continue to monitor these developments to assess their potential impacts on our business.
     Foreign Regulation
     In addition to laws and regulations in the United States, we are subject to a variety of laws and regulations in other jurisdictions governing, among other things, clinical trials and any commercial sales and distribution of our products.
     Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we must obtain the requisite marketing authorizations from regulatory authorities in foreign countries prior to the commencement of clinical trials or marketing of a product in those countries.  Certain countries outside of the United States have a similar process that requires the submission of a clinical trial application, or CTA, much like an IND, prior to the commencement of clinical trials.  In the EU, for example, a CTA must be submitted to the national health authority of each EU Member State in which the clinical trial is to be conducted and to an independent ethics committee, much like the FDA and an IRB, respectively.  Once the CTA is approved in accordance with a country’s requirements, clinical trial development may proceed.
     The requirements and process governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country.  In all cases in EU Member States, for example, the clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with GCP, applicable regulatory requirements, and ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki.
     In the EU, a marketing authorization for a medicinal product can be obtained through a centralized, mutual recognition, decentralized procedure, or national procedure (single EU Member State).  In accordance with the centralized procedure, the applicant can submit a single application for marketing authorization to the EMA that will provide a positive opinion regarding the application if it meets certain quality, safety, and efficacy requirements.  Following the opinion of the EMA, the European Commission makes a final decision to grant a centralized marketing authorization that permits the marketing of a product in all 28 EU Member States and three of the four European Free Trade Association, or EFTA, States, Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway.  The centralized procedure is mandatory for certain medicinal products, including 

 
  21

 
orphan medicinal products, medicinal products derived from certain biotechnological processes, advanced therapy medicinal products and certain other medicinal products containing a new active substance for the treatment of certain diseases, and optional for certain other products, including medicinal products that are a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation, or whose authorization would be in the interest of public or animal health.  Under the centralized procedure in the EU, the maximum timeframe for the evaluation of a marketing authorization application is 210 days (excluding clock stops, when additional written or oral information is to be provided by the applicant in response to questions asked by the CHMP).  Accelerated evaluation may be granted by the CHMP in exceptional cases.  These are defined as circumstances in which a medicinal product is expected to be of a “major public health interest”.  Three cumulative criteria must be fulfilled in such circumstances: the seriousness of the disease, such as heavy disabling or life-threatening diseases, to be treated; the absence or insufficiency of an appropriate alternative therapeutic approach; and anticipation of high therapeutic benefit.  In these circumstances, the EMA ensures that the opinion of the CHMP is given within 150 days.
     Unlike the centralized authorization procedure, the decentralized marketing authorization procedure requires a separate application to, and leads to separate approval by, the competent authorities of each EU Member State in which the product is to be marketed.  This application is identical to the application that would be submitted to the EMA for authorization through the centralized procedure.  The reference EU Member State prepares a draft assessment and drafts of the related materials within 120 days after receipt of a valid application.  The resulting assessment report is submitted to the concerned EU Member States who, within 90 days of receipt, must decide whether to approve the assessment report and related materials.  If a concerned EU Member State cannot approve the assessment report and related materials due to concerns relating to a potential serious risk to public health, disputed elements may be referred to the European Commission, whose decision is binding on all EU Member States.
     The mutual recognition procedure similarly is based on the acceptance by the competent authorities of the EU Member States of the marketing authorization of a medicinal product by the competent authorities of other EU Member States.  The holder of a national marketing authorization may submit an application to the competent authority of an EU Member State requesting that this authority recognize the marketing authorization delivered by the competent authority of another EU Member State.
     A medicinal product may be granted an orphan designation in the EU if: (i) it would be used to treat or prevent a life-threatening or chronically debilitating condition and either affects no more than five in 10,000 people in the EU or for economic reasons would be unlikely to be developed without incentives; and (ii) no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention or treatment of the condition concerned exists, or, if such a method exists, the medicinal product would be of significant benefit to those affected by the condition.  The application for orphan designation must be submitted to the EMA and approved prior to market authorization.  Once authorized, orphan medicinal products are entitled to ten years of market exclusivity.  During this ten-year period, with limited exceptions, neither the competent authorities of the EU Member States, the EMA, nor the European Commission are permitted to accept applications or grant marketing authorization for other similar medicinal products with the same therapeutic indication.  However, marketing authorization may be granted to a similar medicinal product with the same orphan indication during that period with the consent of the holder of the marketing authorization or if the manufacturer of the product is unable to supply sufficient quantities.  Marketing authorization may also be granted to a similar medicinal product with the same orphan indication if the latter product is safer, more effective or otherwise clinically superior to the original product.  The period of market exclusivity may be reduced to six years if it can be demonstrated on the basis of available evidence that the original orphan medicinal product is sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of market exclusivity.
     Once an applicant receives marketing authorization in an EU Member State, through any application route, the applicant is then required to engage in pricing discussions and negotiations with a separate pricing authority in that country.  The legislators, policymakers and healthcare insurance funds in the EU Member States continue to propose and implement cost-containing measures to keep healthcare costs down, due in part to the attention being paid to health care cost containment and other austerity measures in the EU.  Certain of these changes could impose limitations on the prices pharmaceutical companies are able to charge for their products.  The amounts of reimbursement available from governmental agencies or third-party payors for these products may increase the tax obligations on pharmaceutical companies such as ours, or may facilitate the introduction of generic competition with respect to our products.  Furthermore, an increasing number of EU Member States and other foreign countries use prices for medicinal products established in other countries as “reference prices” to help determine the price of the product in their own territory.  Consequently, a downward trend in prices of medicinal products in some countries could contribute to similar downward trends elsewhere.  In addition, the ongoing budgetary difficulties faced by a number of EU Member States, including Greece and Spain, have led and may continue to lead to substantial delays in payment and payment partially with government bonds rather than cash for medicinal products, which could negatively impact

our revenues and profitability.  Moreover, in order to obtain reimbursement of our medicinal products in some countries, including some EU Member States, we may be required to conduct clinical trials that compare the cost-effectiveness of our products to other available therapies.  There can be no assurance that our medicinal products will obtain favorable reimbursement status in any country.
     The sole legal instrument at the EU level governing the pricing and reimbursement of medicinal products is Council Directive 89/105/EEC, or the Transparency Directive.  The aim of this directive is to ensure that pricing and reimbursement mechanisms established in the EU Member States are transparent and objective, do not hinder the free movement and trade of medicinal products in the EU and do not hinder, prevent or distort competition on the market.  The Transparency Directive does not provide any guidance concerning the specific criteria on the basis of which pricing and reimbursement decisions are to be made in individual EU Member States.  Neither does it have any direct consequence for pricing nor reimbursement levels in individual EU Member States.  The EU Member States are free to restrict the range of medicinal products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices and/or reimbursement levels of medicinal products for human use.  Certain individual EU Member States adopt policies according to which a specific price or level of reimbursement is approved for the medicinal product.  Others adopt a system of reference pricing, basing the price or reimbursement level in their territories either on the pricing and reimbursement levels in other countries or on the pricing and reimbursement levels of medicinal products intended for the same therapeutic indication.  Further, some EU Member States impose direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the medicinal product on the market.
     Health Technology Assessment, or HTA, of medicinal products is becoming an increasingly common part of the pricing and reimbursement procedures in some EU Member States.  These EU Member States include the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy and Sweden.  The HTA process in European Economic Area, or EEA, countries is governed by the national laws of these countries.  HTA is the procedure according to which the assessment of the public health impact, therapeutic impact and the economic and societal impact of use of a given medicinal product in the national healthcare systems of the individual country is conducted.  HTA generally focuses on the clinical efficacy and effectiveness, safety, cost, and cost-effectiveness of individual medicinal products as well as their potential implications for the healthcare system.  Those elements of medicinal products are compared with other treatment options available on the market.
     The outcome of HTA regarding specific medicinal products will often influence the pricing and reimbursement status granted to these medicinal products by the competent authorities of individual EU Member States.  The extent to which pricing and reimbursement decisions are influenced by the HTA of the specific medicinal product vary between EU Member States.
     In 2011, Directive 2011/24/EU was adopted at the EU level.  This directive concerns the application of patients’ rights in cross-border healthcare.  This directive is intended to establish rules for facilitating access to safe and high-quality cross-border healthcare in the EU.  Pursuant to this directive, a voluntary network of national authorities or bodies responsible for HTA in the individual EU Member States was established.  The purpose of the network is to facilitate and support the exchange of scientific information concerning HTAs. This may lead to harmonization of the criteria taken into account in the conduct of HTAs between EU Member States and in pricing and reimbursement decisions and may negatively affect price in at least some EU Member States.
     In the EU, the advertising and promotion of our products will also be subject to EU Member States’ laws concerning promotion of medicinal products, interactions with physicians, misleading and comparative advertising and unfair commercial practices, as well as other EU Member State legislation that may apply to the advertising and promotion of medicinal products.  These laws require that promotional materials and advertising in relation to medicinal products comply with the product’s Summary of Product Characteristics, or SmPC, as approved by the competent authorities.  The SmPC is the document that provides information to physicians concerning the safe and effective use of the medicinal product.  It forms an intrinsic and integral part of the marketing authorization granted for the medicinal product.  Promotion of a medicinal product that does not comply with the SmPC is considered to constitute off-label promotion.  The off-label promotion of medicinal products is prohibited in the EU.  The applicable laws at the EU level and in the individual EU Member States also prohibit the direct-to-consumer advertising of prescription-only medicinal products.  Violations of the rules governing the promotion of medicinal products in the EU could be penalized by administrative measures, fines and imprisonment.  These laws may further limit or restrict communications concerning the advertising and promotion of our products to the general public and may also impose limitations on our promotional activities with healthcare professionals.
     Failure to comply with the EU Member State laws implementing the Community Code on medicinal products, and EU rules governing the promotion of medicinal products, interactions with physicians, misleading and comparative advertising and unfair commercial practices, with the EU Member State laws that apply to the promotion of medicinal products, statutory 

 
  23

 
health insurance, bribery and anti-corruption or with other applicable regulatory requirements can result in enforcement action by the EU Member State authorities, which may include any of the following: fines, imprisonment, orders forfeiting products or prohibiting or suspending their supply to the market, or requiring the manufacturer to issue public warnings, or to conduct a product recall.
     Interactions between pharmaceutical companies and physicians are also governed by strict laws, regulations, industry self-regulation codes of conduct and physicians’ codes of professional conduct in the individual EU Member States.  The provision of benefits or advantages to physicians to induce or encourage the prescription, recommendation, endorsement, purchase, supply, order or use of medicinal products is prohibited in the EU.  The provision of benefits or advantages to physicians is also governed by the national anti-bribery laws of the EU Member States.  One example is the UK Bribery Act of 2010, or the UK Bribery Act.  This act applies to any company incorporated in or “carrying on business” in the UK, irrespective of where in the world the alleged bribery activity occurs.  This act could have implications for our interactions with physicians in and outside the UK.  Violation of these laws could result in substantial fines and imprisonment.
     The national laws of certain EU Member States require payments made to physicians to be publicly disclosed.  Moreover, the European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations, or EFPIA, Code on disclosure of transfers of value from pharmaceutical companies to healthcare professionals and healthcare organizations imposes a general obligation on members of the EFPIA or related national industry bodies to disclose transfers of value to healthcare professionals.  In addition, agreements with physicians must often be the subject of prior notification and approval by the physician’s employer, his/her competent professional organization, and/or the competent authorities of the individual EU Member States.  These requirements are provided in the national laws, industry codes, or professional codes of conduct, applicable in the EU Member States.
     For other countries outside of the EU, such as countries in Eastern Europe, Central and South America or Asia, the requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. In all cases, again, the clinical trials are conducted in accordance with GCP, applicable regulatory requirements, and ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki.
     If we fail to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements, we may be subject to, among other things, warning letters or untitled letters, injunctions, civil, administrative, or criminal penalties, monetary fines or imprisonment, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, suspension of ongoing clinical studies, refusal to approve pending applications or supplements to applications filed by us, suspension or the imposition of restrictions on operations, product recalls, the refusal to permit the import or export of our products or the seizure or detention of products.
     Coverage and Reimbursement
     Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any products for which we have or may obtain regulatory approval.  Sales of VARUBI and, if approved, rolapitant IV, niraparib, and any of our other product candidates, will depend, in part, on the extent to which the costs of the products will be covered by third-party payors, including government healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid, commercial health insurers and managed care organizations.  The process for determining whether a payor will provide coverage for a product may be separate from the process for setting the price or reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the product once coverage is approved.  Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific products on an approved list, or formulary, which might not include all FDA-approved products for a particular indication.
     In order to secure coverage and reimbursement for VARUBI, rolapitant IV, niraparib, or any other product that might be approved for sale, we may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of the product, in addition to the costs required to obtain FDA or other comparable regulatory approvals.  Our product candidates may not be considered medically necessary or cost-effective.  A payor’s decision to provide coverage for a product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved.  Third-party reimbursement may not be sufficient to enable us to maintain price levels high enough to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development.
     In the past, payors have implemented reimbursement metrics and periodically revised those metrics as well as the methodologies used as the basis for reimbursement rates, such as average sales price, or ASP, average manufacturer price, or AMP, and actual acquisition cost.  The existing data for reimbursement based on these metrics is relatively limited, although certain states have begun to survey acquisition cost data for the purpose of setting Medicaid reimbursement rates.  The Centers 

 
  24

 
for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, surveys and publishes retail pharmacy acquisition cost information in the form of National Average Drug Acquisition Cost, or NADAC, files to provide state Medicaid agencies with a basis of comparison for their own reimbursement and pricing methodologies and rates.  It may be difficult to project the impact of these evolving reimbursement mechanics on the willingness of payors to cover our products for which we receive regulatory approval.
     Our participation in the Medicaid rebate program established by the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 and under multiple subsequent amendments of that law, including the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, together the ACA, requires us to pay a rebate for each unit of drug reimbursed by Medicaid.  The amount of the “basic” portion of the rebate for each product is set by law as the larger of: (i) 23.1% of quarterly AMP, or (ii) the difference between quarterly AMP and the quarterly best price available from us to any commercial or non-governmental customer, or Best Price.  AMP must be reported on a monthly and quarterly basis and Best Price is reported on a quarterly basis only.  In addition, the rebate also includes the “additional” portion, which adjusts the overall rebate amount upward as an “inflation penalty” when the drug’s latest quarter’s AMP exceeds the drug’s AMP from the first full quarter of sales after launch, adjusted for increases in the Consumer Price Index—Urban.  The upward adjustment in the rebate amount per unit is equal to the excess amount of the current AMP over the inflation-adjusted AMP from the first full quarter of sales.  The rebate amount is required to be recomputed each quarter based on our report to CMS of current quarterly AMP and Best Price for our drug.  The terms of our participation in the program impose a requirement for us to report revisions to AMP or Best Price within a period not to exceed 12 quarters from the quarter in which the data was originally due.  Any such revisions could have the impact of increasing or decreasing our rebate liability for prior quarters, depending on the direction of the revision.  The ACA and subsequent legislation also changed the definition of AMP.  In February 2016, final guidance and regulations were issued by the federal government clarifying these and certain other ACA changes and which relate to the calculation of AMP and the related rebate liability for pharmaceutical products. 
     Federal law also requires that a company that participates in the Medicaid rebate program report ASP information each quarter to CMS for certain categories of drugs that are paid under Part B of the Medicare program.  Manufacturers calculate ASP based on a statutorily defined formula and interpretations of the statute by CMS.  CMS uses these submissions to determine payment rates for drugs under Medicare Part B and the resulting Medicare payment rate.
     Beginning April 1, 2013, Medicare payments for all items and services, including drugs and biologics, were reduced by 2% under the sequestration (i.e., automatic spending reductions) required by the Budget Control Act of 2011, as amended by the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012.  Subsequent legislation extended the 2% reduction, on average, to 2025.  This may cause Medicare Part D plans to seek lower prices from manufacturers.  Other legislative or regulatory cost containment provisions, as described below, could have a similar effect.
     The containment of healthcare costs has become a priority of federal, state and foreign governments, and the prices of drugs have been a focus in this effort.  Government healthcare programs and other third-party payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and services and examining the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of medical products and services, in addition to their safety and efficacy.  If these payors do not consider our products to be cost-effective compared to other available therapies, they may not cover our products after approval as a benefit under their plans or, if they do, the level of payment may not be sufficient to allow us to sell our products at a profit.  The U.S. government, state legislatures and foreign governments also have shown significant interest in implementing cost-containment programs to limit the growth of government-paid healthcare costs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products for branded prescription drugs.  Adoption of such controls and measures, and tightening of restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could limit payments for products such as VARUBI, rolapitant IV, niraparib, and any other product candidates that we are developing and could adversely affect our net revenues and operating results.
     The marketability of VARUBI, rolapitant IV, niraparib, and any other products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale may suffer if the government and third-party payors fail to provide adequate coverage and reimbursement.  In addition, emphasis on managed care in the United States has increased and we expect will continue to increase the pressure on drug pricing.  Coverage policies, third-party reimbursement rates and drug pricing regulation may change at any time.
     In the United States, most outpatient prescription drugs may be covered under Medicare Part D.  Medicare Part D is a voluntary prescription drug benefit, through which Medicare beneficiaries may enroll in prescription drug plans offered by private entities for coverage of outpatient prescription drugs.  Part D plans include both stand-alone prescription drug benefit plans and prescription drug coverage as a supplement to Medicare Advantage plans provided for under Medicare Part C.

 
  25

 

     Coverage and reimbursement for covered outpatient drugs under Part D are not standardized.  Part D prescription drug plan sponsors are not required to pay for all covered Part D drugs, and each drug plan can develop its own drug formulary that identifies which drugs it will cover and at what tier or level.  Any formulary used by a Part D prescription drug plan must be developed and reviewed by a pharmacy and therapeutic committee.  Although Part D prescription drug formularies must include drugs within each therapeutic category and class of covered Part D drugs, they have some flexibility to establish those categories and classes and are not required to cover all of the drugs in each category or class.  Medicare Part D prescription drug plans may use formularies to limit the number of drugs that will be covered in any therapeutic class and/or impose differential cost sharing or other utilization management techniques.
     The availability of coverage under Medicare Part D may increase demand for VARUBI and for products for which we receive marketing approval.  However, in order for the products that we market to be included on the formularies of Part D prescription drug plans, we likely will have to offer pricing that is lower than the prices we might otherwise obtain.  Changes to Medicare Part D that give plans more freedom to limit coverage or manage utilization, and/or other cost reduction initiatives in the program could decrease the coverage and price that we receive for any approved products and could seriously harm our business.
     In the physician office setting, Medicare Part B generally pays for covered drugs, which would include any eventual IV formulation of rolapitant and in limited circumstances could also include the oral formulation, at a rate of 106% of the drug’s ASP.  ASP is defined by statute based on sales and price concession data, including rebates and chargebacks, for a defined period of time and manufacturers submit the required information to CMS on a quarterly basis.  Prior to the quarter in which the payment rate will go into effect, CMS calculates and publishes the ASP-based payment rate.  Under this methodology, payment rates change on a quarterly basis, and significant downward fluctuations in ASP, and therefore reimbursement rates, could negatively impact sales of a product. Because the ASP-based payment rate is defined by statute, changes to Medicare payment methodologies generally require a legislative change.  While the statute requires Medicare Part B payments for most drugs furnished in the physician office setting to be at 106% of ASP, the statute does not have a similar requirement for hospital outpatient departments.  For that setting, the Medicare payment for many covered Part B drugs also is at 106% of ASP, provided that the product exceeds a per day cost threshold. For those products that do not meet the threshold, as is true for many oral anti-emetic products, there is no separate payment for the drug when furnished in a hospital outpatient department.  For those products that meet the threshold, the current 106% of ASP payment rate could be changed by CMS in future years through regulations, without any intervening legislation.  The 106% of ASP payment rates for the physician office and hospital outpatient settings are subject to the 2% sequestration cuts mandated by federal statute as described above.
     Further, the ACA substantially changes the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers, and contains provisions that may reduce the profitability of drug products.  The ACA is intended to broaden access to health insurance, reduce or constrain the growth of healthcare spending, enhance remedies against fraud and abuse, add new transparency requirements for healthcare and health insurance industries, impose new taxes and fees on pharmaceutical and medical device manufacturers, and impose additional health policy reforms.  The ACA expanded manufacturers’ rebate liability under the Medicaid program from fee-for-service Medicaid utilization to include the utilization of Medicaid managed care organizations as well, increased the minimum Medicaid rebate due for most innovator drugs in general from 15.1% of AMP to 23.1% of AMP, and capped the total rebate amount for innovator drugs at 100% of AMP.  The ACA and subsequent legislation also changed the definition of AMP.  CMS regulations to implement the changes to the Medicaid drug rebate program under the ACA became effective on April 1, 2016.
     The ACA requires pharmaceutical manufacturers of branded prescription drugs to pay a branded prescription drug fee to the federal government.  Each such manufacturer pays a prorated share of the branded prescription drug fee of $4.0 billion in 2017, based on the dollar value of its branded prescription drug sales to certain federal programs identified in the law.  The ACA also expanded the Public Health Service’s 340B drug pricing program, or the 340B program (described below), to include additional types of covered entities.  Substantial new provisions affecting compliance have also been enacted, which may affect our business practices with healthcare practitioners, and a number of provisions have only recently become effective.  It appears likely that the ACA will continue the pressure on pharmaceutical pricing, especially under the Medicare and Medicaid programs, and may also increase our regulatory burdens and operating costs.  Legislative changes to the ACA remain possible, and appear likely in the 115th United States Congress and under the Trump Administration.  Even if we obtain favorable coverage and reimbursement status for VARUBI, rolapitant IV, niraparib, or any other products for which we receive regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future.

 We participate in the 340B program.  Federal law requires that any company that participates in the Medicaid rebate program also participate in the 340B program in order for federal funds to be available for the manufacturer’s drugs under Medicaid and Medicare Part B.  The 340B program requires participating manufacturers to agree to charge statutorily-defined covered entities no more than the 340B “ceiling price” for the manufacturer’s covered outpatient drugs.  In addition, in order to be eligible to have its products paid for with federal funds under the Medicaid and Medicare Part B programs and purchased by certain federal grantees and agencies, a manufacturer also must participate in the Department of Veterans Affairs Federal Supply Schedule, or FSS, pricing program, established by Section 603 of the Veterans Health Care Act of 1992.  Under this program, the manufacturer is obligated to make products available for procurement on an FSS contract and charge a price to four federal agencies—the Department of Veterans Affairs, the Department of Defense, the Public Health Service and the Coast Guard—that is at least 24% less than the Non-Federal Average Manufacturing Price, or non-FAMP, for the prior fiscal year.  The requirements under the 340B and FSS programs could reduce the revenue we may generate from VARUBI, rolapitant IV, niraparib, and any other products that we commercialize in the future and could adversely affect our business and operating results.
     Fraud and Abuse Laws
     In addition to FDA restrictions on marketing of pharmaceutical products, several other types of state and federal laws have been applied to restrict certain marketing practices in the pharmaceutical industry in recent years.  These laws include anti-kickback and false claims statutes.
     The federal healthcare program anti-kickback statute prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce or in return for purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for or recommending the purchase, lease or order of any healthcare item or service reimbursable, in whole or in part, under Medicare, Medicaid or other federally financed healthcare programs.  This statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on one hand and prescribers, purchasers, and formulary managers on the other.  Although there are a number of statutory exemptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting certain common activities from prosecution, the exemptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly and practices that involve remuneration to those who prescribe, purchase, or recommend pharmaceutical and biological products, including certain discounts, or engaging consultants as speakers or consultants, may be subject to scrutiny if they do not fit squarely within the exemption or safe harbor.  Our practices may not in all cases meet all of the criteria for safe harbor protection from anti-kickback liability. Moreover, there are no safe harbors for many common practices, such as educational and research grants or patient assistance programs.
     The federal civil False Claims Act prohibits, among other things, any person from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment of government funds, or knowingly making, using, or causing to be made or used, a false record or statement material to an obligation to pay money to the government or knowingly concealing or knowingly and improperly avoiding, decreasing, or concealing an obligation to pay money to the federal government.  In recent years, several pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies have faced enforcement actions under the federal False Claims Act for, among other things, allegedly submitting false or misleading pricing information to government health care programs and providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product.  Other companies have faced enforcement actions for causing false claims to be submitted because of the company’s marketing the product for unapproved, and thus non-reimbursable, uses.  Federal enforcement agencies also have showed increased interest in pharmaceutical companies’ product and patient assistance programs, including reimbursement and co-pay support services, and a number of investigations into these programs have resulted in significant civil and criminal settlements.  In addition, the ACA amended federal law to provide that the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal anti-kickback statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal civil False Claims Act.  Criminal prosecution is possible for making or presenting a false or fictitious or fraudulent claim to the federal government.
     The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, also created several new federal crimes, including healthcare fraud and false statements relating to healthcare matters.  The healthcare fraud statute prohibits knowingly and willfully executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors.  The false statements statute prohibits knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services.
    
 
  27

 

 The majority of states also have statutes or regulations similar to the federal anti-kickback and false claims laws, which apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in several states, apply regardless of the payor. Several states now require pharmaceutical companies to report expenses relating to the marketing and promotion of pharmaceutical products in those states and to report gifts and payments to individual health care providers in those states.  Some of these states also prohibit certain marketing-related activities including the provision of gifts, meals, or other items to certain health care providers.  In addition, several states require pharmaceutical companies to implement compliance programs or marketing codes.
     The federal Physician Payment Sunshine Act, being implemented as the Open Payments Program, requires certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies to engage in extensive tracking of payments and other transfers of value to physicians and teaching hospitals, including physician ownership and investment interests, and public reporting of such data.  Pharmaceutical and biological manufacturers with products for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the State Children’s Health Insurance Program are required to track such payments, and must submit a report on or before the 90th day of each calendar year disclosing reportable payments made in the previous calendar year.
     In addition, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or the FCPA, prohibits corporations and individuals from engaging in certain activities to obtain or retain business or to influence a person working in an official capacity.  It is illegal to pay, offer to pay or authorize the payment of anything of value to any official of another country, government staff member, political party or political candidate in an attempt to obtain or retain business or to otherwise influence a person working in that capacity.  In many other countries, healthcare providers who prescribe pharmaceuticals are employed by government entities, and the purchasers of pharmaceuticals are government entities.  Our dealings with these prescribers and purchasers may be subject to the FCPA.
     Other countries, including a number of EU Member States, have laws of similar application, including anti-bribery or anti-corruption laws such as the UK Bribery Act.  The UK Bribery Act prohibits giving, offering, or promising bribes to any person, as well as requesting, agreeing to receive, or accepting bribes from any person.  Under the UK Bribery Act, a company that carries on a business or part of a business in the United Kingdom may be held liable for bribes given, offered or promised to any person in any country by employees or other persons associated with the company in order to obtain or retain business or a business advantage for the company.  Liability under the UK Bribery Act is strict, but a defense of having in place adequate procedures designed to prevent bribery is available.
     Because of the breadth of these various fraud and abuse laws, it is possible that some of our business activities could be subject to challenge under one or more of such laws.  Such a challenge could have material adverse effects on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In the event governmental authorities conclude that our business practices do not comply with current or future statutes, regulations or case law involving applicable fraud and abuse or other healthcare laws and regulations, they may impose sanctions under these laws, which are potentially significant and may include civil monetary penalties, damages, exclusion of an entity or individual from participation in government health care programs, criminal fines and imprisonment, as well as the potential curtailment or restructuring of our operations.  Even if we are not determined to have violated these laws, government investigations into these issues typically require the expenditure of significant resources and generate negative publicity, which could harm our financial condition and divert the attention of our management from operating our business.
     Patents and Proprietary Rights
     We have in-licensed three patent portfolios, one each for our rolapitant, niraparib, and immunotherapeutic antibodies programs.
     Our NK-1 receptor antagonist portfolio, which relates to rolapitant, consists of patent families currently being prosecuted or maintained, including applications and patents directed to compositions of matter, formulations (including oral and IV), solid forms, methods of treatment (including both delayed and acute onset nausea and/or vomiting and timing of administration in relation to chemotherapy) and methods of preparing rolapitant.  Rolapitant is a NK-1 receptor antagonist being developed for the prevention of chemotherapy induced nausea and/or vomiting.  The portfolio licensed for rolapitant consists of a number of issued U.S. patents and issued non-U.S. patents across the in-licensed families.
     Our PARP inhibitor portfolio includes patent families relating to niraparib and patent families relating to MK-2512.  The patent families in-licensed from Merck are being prosecuted or maintained by Merck in consultation with us.  The patent families relating to niraparib include applications and patents directed to compositions of matter, methods of treatment 

 
  28

 
(including treatment of cancer and other diseases), particular salts of niraparib and methods of preparing niraparib.  The portfolio for niraparib comprises of a number of issued United States and non-United States patents.
     Our immunotherapeutic antibodies portfolio presently consists of patent applications pending in multiple jurisdictions, which cover particular antibodies to identified targets of interest.  We have rights to all patents owned or controlled by our collaborator, AnaptysBio, to the extent that they claim the manufacture, composition, or use of an antagonist antibody developed under the program.
     Intellectual Property Protection Strategy
     We seek and intend to continue seeking patent protection whenever available for any patentable aspects of our existing products or product candidates and related technology or any new products or product candidates we acquire in the future.  Where our intellectual property is not protectable by patents, we seek to protect this through other means, including maintenance of trade secrets and careful protection of our proprietary information.  Our license from Merck for niraparib requires Merck to, subject to certain exceptions, prosecute and maintain, upon consultation with us, its patent rights as they relate to the licensed compounds.  If Merck decides to cease prosecution of the licensed patent rights, we have the right to take over such prosecution activities.  Our license from OPKO for rolapitant grants us the right to control all prosecution and maintenance activities for the licensed compounds, at our sole discretion.
     The patent positions of biopharmaceutical companies like us are generally uncertain and involve complex legal, scientific and factual questions.  In addition, the coverage claimed in a patent application can be significantly reduced before the patent is issued, and its scope can be reinterpreted after issuance.  Consequently, we do not know whether any of the product candidates we in-license or acquire will be protectable or remain protected by enforceable patents.  We cannot predict whether the patent applications we are pursuing will issue as patents in any particular jurisdiction, and furthermore, we cannot determine whether the claims of any issued patents will provide sufficient proprietary protection to protect us from competitors, or will be challenged, circumvented or invalidated by third parties.  Even where we succeed in obtaining patents covering our products, third parties may challenge or seek to invalidate or circumvent our patents.
     As part of the passage of the America Invents Act in 2011, new post-grant review proceedings were added to U.S. patent law.  Post-grant reviews and inter partes reviews allow any member of the public to file a petition with the USPTO seeking to review the patentability of one or more claims in an issued U.S. patent.  Post-grant review procedures are conducted before Administrative Patent Judges in the USPTO using a lower standard of proof than used in Federal District Court.  In addition, the challenged patents are not accorded a presumption of validity as they are in Federal District Court. The patents covering our products may become involved in such post-grant review proceedings in the U.S. and/or in other jurisdictions (such as oppositions in the European Patent Office) that challenge the patentability of our patents.  Such proceedings could result in a finding of unpatentability or invalidity of our patents. They could also result in substantial cost, even if the eventual outcome is favorable to us.
     Because patent applications in the United States and certain other jurisdictions are maintained in secrecy for at least 18 months from their earliest filing date, and since publication of discoveries in the scientific or patent literature often lags behind actual discoveries, we cannot be certain of the priority of inventions covered by pending patent applications.  In March 2013, the United States transitioned to a ‘first to file’ system in which the first inventor to file a patent application will be entitled to the patent.  Previously, in the United States, the first to make the claimed invention was entitled to the patent.  For patents or patent applications not subject to the ‘first to file’ system, we may have to participate in interference proceedings declared by the USPTO to determine priority of invention.
     Although we have issued patents covering a number of different attributes of our products, and pending applications on others, there can be no assurance that any issued patents would be held valid by a court of competent jurisdiction.  An adverse outcome could subject us to significant liabilities to third parties, require disputed rights to be licensed from third parties or require us to cease using specific compounds or technology.  To the extent prudent, we intend to bring litigation against third parties that we believe are infringing our patents.
     The term of individual patents depends upon the legal term of the patents in the countries in which they are obtained.  In most countries in which we file, the patent term is 20 years from the earliest date of filing a non-provisional patent application.  In the United States, a patent’s term may be lengthened by patent term adjustment, which compensates a patentee for administrative delays by the USPTO in granting a patent, or may be shortened if a patent is terminally disclaimed over another patent.

 
  29

 

     In the United States, the term of a patent that covers an FDA-approved drug or biological product may also be eligible for patent term extension, which permits patent term restoration as compensation for the patent term lost during drug development and the FDA regulatory review process.  The Hatch-Waxman Act permits a patent term extension of up to five years beyond the expiration of the patent.  The length of the patent term extension is related to the length of time the drug or biologic is under development and regulatory review.  A patent term cannot be extended beyond a total of 14 years from the date of product approval and only one patent applicable to an approved drug may be extended.  Patent term extension is available only if the approval of the product represents the first permitted commercial marketing of the active ingredient.  Similar provisions are available in the EU and other non-U.S. jurisdictions to extend the term of a patent that covers an approved drug.  In the future, if and when our products receive FDA approval, we expect to apply for patent term extensions on patents covering those products.  We intend to seek patent term adjustments and extensions to any of our issued patents in any jurisdiction where these are available; however, there is no guarantee that the applicable authorities, including the FDA and the USPTO in the United States, will agree with our assessment of whether such extensions should be granted, and even if granted, the length of such adjustments or extensions.  We have applied for patent term extension for rolapitant in the United States. 
     To protect our rights to any of our issued patents and proprietary information, we may need to litigate against infringing third parties, or avail ourselves of the courts or participate in hearings to determine the scope and validity of those patents or other proprietary rights.  These types of proceedings are often costly and could be time-consuming to us, and we cannot be certain that the deciding authorities will rule in our favor.  An unfavorable decision could result in the invalidation or a limitation in the scope of our patents or forfeiture of the rights associated with our patents or pending patent applications.  Any such decision could result in our key technologies not being protectable, allowing third parties to use our technology without being required to pay us licensing fees, or may compel us to license needed technologies from third parties to avoid infringing third-party patent and proprietary rights.  Such a decision could even result in the invalidation or a limitation in the scope of our patents or could cause us to lose our rights under existing issued patents or not to have rights granted under our pending patent applications.
     We also rely on trade secret protection for our confidential and proprietary information.  Although we take steps to protect our proprietary information and trade secrets, including through contractual means with our employees and consultants, no assurance can be given that others will not independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information and techniques or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or disclose such technology, or that we can meaningfully protect our trade secrets.  It is our policy to require our employees, consultants, outside scientific collaborators, sponsored researchers and other advisors to execute confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of employment or consulting relationships with us.  These agreements provide that all confidential information developed or made known to the individual during the course of the individual’s relationship with us is to be kept confidential and not disclosed to third parties except in specific circumstances.  In the case of employees, the agreements provide that all inventions conceived by the individual shall be our exclusive property.  There can be no assurance, however, that these agreements will provide meaningful protection or adequate remedies for our trade secrets in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of such information.
     While the expiration of a composition of matter patent may result in a loss of market exclusivity for the covered pharmaceutical product, that is not always the case.  Market exclusivity may continue to be derived from, among other things: (i) patents relating to the use of the product; (ii) patents on processes to make the product; (iii) patents on intermediates of the active ingredient of such product; and (iv) patents relating to novel compositions and formulations.  The effect of composition of matter patent expiration on market exclusivity also depends upon many other factors such as the nature of the market and the position of the product in it, the growth of the market, and the complexities and economics of the process for manufacture of the active ingredient of the product.
     NK-1 Receptor Antagonists
     We have an exclusive, worldwide license from OPKO to a portfolio of patents related to rolapitant, including issued claims covering the composition of matter and certain formulations and methods of use.
     A United States Patent claiming the composition of matter of rolapitant has been granted and, with the patent term adjustment, has a patent term until at least December 2023.  Corresponding applications and issued patents in multiple foreign jurisdictions have similar composition of matter claims.  In foreign jurisdictions, this family of patents and/or applications has a patent term until at least December 2022.  A United States patent claiming methods of treating nausea and/or emesis comprising administering an intravenous formulation of rolapitant has been granted and, with patent term adjustment, expires in July 2032.  Corresponding applications and issued patents in multiple foreign jurisdictions have similar claims directed to 

 
  30

 
methods of treating nausea and/or emesis comprising administering an intravenous formulation of rolapitant and have patent terms until at least 2030.
     Many jurisdictions also grant patent term extensions, typically up to five years, for post-issuance regulatory delay.  In the United States, only one patent may be extended per approved product.  We have applied for patent term extension for rolapitant in the United States, and we believe that patent term extension under the Hatch-Waxman Act could be available to extend our patent exclusivity for rolapitant up to August 2028 in the United States.  With respect to Europe, we believe that supplementary protection certificates (which are issued on a country-by-country basis) could be available to extend our patent exclusivity for rolapitant in each European country in which a patent is issued and in which supplementary protection certificates are available, with the period of extension depending on the timing of our first approval.  If granted, any available supplementary protection certificate extension will be capped at fifteen years from the first approval.  There is no guarantee that the maximum allowable extension will be granted in either the United States or Europe, and any extension granted may be shorter than this, or not granted at all.
     Our license also includes additional patent families related to rolapitant, comprising patent and patent applications claiming certain compounds, forms, formulations, methods of use, and processes to make rolapitant.  These patent families have patent terms until at least 2027 to 2030, including patent term adjustment in certain patents.
     PARP Inhibitor
     We have an exclusive, worldwide license from Merck to a portfolio of patents related to two inhibitors of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase: niraparib and MK-2512.  Our portfolio, including patent families in-licensed from Merck, includes patent families related to niraparib comprising patent and patent applications claiming compounds, certain salt forms, methods of use, and processes to make niraparib.
     A United States patent claiming the composition of matter of niraparib has been granted and, with patent term adjustment, has a patent term until at least March 2030.  Corresponding patent applications and issued patents in multiple foreign jurisdictions have similar claims and have a patent term until at least January 2028.  Additional patent families claiming certain compounds, salt forms, methods of use, and processes to make niraparib have been filed in the United States and multiple foreign jurisdictions and, if granted, will have patent terms until at least 2027 to 2037.
     We believe that patent term extension under the Hatch-Waxman Act could be available to extend our patent exclusivity for niraparib in the United States.  The period of extension would depend on the timing of our first approval.  Such an extension would be available, if at all, for only one United States patent.  If granted, any available patent term extension shall not exceed five years, and overall patent expiry with patent term extension will be capped at fourteen years from the first approval.  With respect to Europe, we believe that supplementary protection certificates (which are issued on a country-by-country basis) could be available to extend our patent exclusivity for niraparib in each European country in which a patent is issued and in which supplementary protection certificates are available, with the period of extension depending on the timing of our first approval.  If granted, any available supplementary protection certificate extension will be capped at fifteen years from the first approval.  There is no guarantee that any extension will be granted in either the United States or Europe, and even if granted, the extension may be less than the maximum allowable extension.
     Immuno-Oncology
     Pursuant to our Collaboration and Exclusive License Agreement with AnaptysBio, we have ownership and/or exclusive worldwide license rights in patent filings relating to certain antibodies that bind to PD-1, LAG-3, and/or TIM-3 developed by AnaptysBio.  Our immuno-oncology portfolio comprises patent filings covering composition of matter for the relevant antibodies and binding fragments thereof, as well as their use individually and in combination; additional filings are contemplated.
     No patents have yet issued from the relevant patent filings, but any such patents will be expected to have terms that extend into the late 2030s.  Ultimate expiration dates, which may differ by jurisdiction, may depend on, for example, patent term extensions available for patent office and/or regulatory delays, payment of annuities and/or maintenance fees, and/or terminal disclaimers of related cases.
    
 
  31

 

 Manufacturing
     We contract with third parties for the manufacture of VARUBI and for the manufacture of our product candidates for preclinical studies and clinical trials, and we intend to continue to do so in the future.  We currently work with one contract manufacturing organization, or CMO, Hovione Inter Limited, or Hovione, for the production of rolapitant drug substance used for oral rolapitant drug product and rolapitant IV, and one other CMO, Patheon, Inc., or Patheon, for commercial production of oral rolapitant drug product.  We currently work with one CMO for the production of rolapitant IV drug product for our commercial needs.  We currently work with two CMOs for the production of niraparib drug substance, and one other CMO for niraparib drug product supply, for our clinical and, if niraparib is approved, our expected commercial needs.  We contract with one CMO for the manufacture of TSR-042, TSR-022, TSR-033 and other antibody products, and may contract with additional CMOs that have biologics capabilities.  For each of our product candidates, we may elect to pursue relationships with other CMOs for manufacturing clinical supplies for later-stage trials and for commercialization.  We do not own or operate manufacturing facilities for the production of clinical quantities of our product candidates.  We currently have no plans to build our own clinical or commercial scale manufacturing capabilities.  To meet our projected needs for clinical supplies to support our activities through regulatory approval and commercial manufacturing, the CMOs with whom we currently work will need to increase scale of production or we will need to secure alternate suppliers.  We have not currently qualified alternate suppliers in the event the current CMOs we utilize are unable to scale production.  We have personnel with pharmaceutical development and manufacturing experience who are responsible for the relationships with our CMOs.
     In March 2012, we entered into a process development and manufacturing services agreement with Hovione, under which Hovione provides certain process development and manufacturing services in connection with the manufacture of rolapitant drug substance.  The agreement also provided that if Hovione was successful in implementing the manufacturing process and the agreement is not terminated by us, Hovione would also manufacture certain commercial quantities of rolapitant.  Hovione has implemented the manufacturing process successfully and is now manufacturing commercial quantities of rolapitant drug substance.  Under the agreement, we pay Hovione for services in accordance with the terms of work plans, which we enter into from time to time.  Each party to the agreement is subject to customary indemnification provisions.  Unless terminated earlier, the agreement will continue until the later of the fifth anniversary of (i) all development services under the last work plan executed in accordance with the terms of the agreement or (ii) the first launch date of the product to occur in any of the following jurisdictions: Europe; Japan; or the United States.  The agreement may be extended by agreement of the parties.  We are permitted to terminate the agreement at the end of each phase of the initial work plan and to terminate any work plan executed after the initial work plan upon at least 30 days’ prior written notice to Hovione.
     In October 2015, we entered into a Master Manufacturing Services Agreement, or the Master Agreement, and a related Product Agreement (together with the Master Agreement, the Patheon Agreements) with Patheon.  The Master Agreement governs the general terms under which Patheon or one of its affiliates will provide manufacturing services to us for drug products specified by us from time to time, and the Product Agreement relates specifically to the manufacture of VARUBI (rolapitant) tablets for sale in the United States.
     Under the terms of the Patheon Agreements, Patheon will manufacture VARUBI 90 mg tablets for sale in the United States and provide related quality control, packaging and raw materials inventory and storage services.  We will provide Patheon with the necessary active pharmaceutical ingredients for VARUBI.  We are not required to purchase any minimum quantity of VARUBI or any other drug product under the Patheon Agreements, but have agreed to purchase from Patheon a significant majority of our requirements in a specified territory of any drug manufactured under the Master Agreement.
     The term of each of the Patheon Agreements extends until December 31, 2019 and will automatically renew thereafter for successive two-year periods unless terminated by either party upon prior written notice.  Each of the Patheon Agreements may also be terminated by either party for material, uncured breaches, in the event of the other party’s bankruptcy, or upon prior notice if a governmental authority prevents us from importing, exporting, purchasing or selling the underlying product (VARUBI in the case of the Product Agreement).  Patheon may terminate the Master Agreement or the Product Agreement if we assign any rights thereunder to a Patheon competitor.  We may terminate packaging services upon prior written notice to Patheon and may terminate manufacturing services upon prior written notice if a product is discontinued in its specified territory.
     Employees
     As of December 31, 2016, we had 446 full-time employees, 108 of whom hold Ph.D. or M.D. degrees.  Of these full-time employees, 182 were directly engaged in development activities, 134 were engaged in selling, marketing and related 

 
  32

 
activities, 48 in medical affairs, with the remainder serving in primarily general and administrative and commercial support capacities.  None of our employees are represented by labor unions or covered by collective bargaining agreements.  We consider our relationship with our employees to be good.
     Research and Development
     We have dedicated a significant portion of our resources to our efforts to develop our product candidates, particularly rolapitant and niraparib.  We incurred research and development expenses, including acquired in-process research and development, of $143.3 million, $157.4 million and $254.1 million during the years ended December 31, 2014, 2015 and 2016, respectively.  We anticipate that a significant portion of our operating expenses will continue to be related to research and development in 2017 as we continue to advance our product candidates through clinical development.
