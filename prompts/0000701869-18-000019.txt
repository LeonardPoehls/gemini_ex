Our website is located at www.ihcgroup.com. Detailed information about IHC, its corporate affiliates and insurance products and services can be found on our website. In addition, we make our Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K and all amendments to such reports available, free of charge, through our website, as soon as reasonably practicable after they are filed with or furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission. The information on our website, however, is not incorporated by reference in, and does not form part of, this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
 

IHC primarily provides specialized disability and health coverages and related services to commercial customers and individuals. We focus on niche products and/or narrowly defined distribution channels primarily in the United States. Our wholly owned insurance company subsidiaries, Standard Security Life Insurance Company of New York ("Standard Security Life"), Madison National Life Insurance Company, Inc. ("Madison National Life") and Independence American Insurance Company (“Independence American”) market their products through independent and affiliated brokers, producers and agents. Independence American also distributes to consumers through dedicated controlled distribution companies and through company-owned websites.

Madison National Life, Standard Security Life and Independence American are sometimes collectively referred to as the "Insurance Group." IHC and its subsidiaries (including the Insurance Group) are sometimes collectively referred to as the "Company", or "IHC", or are implicit in the terms "we", "us" and "our".
 
In 2018, IHC will retain the vast majority of the risk that it underwrites, and will focus on the following lines of business:

Multiple specialty health lines

Group disability, life and New York short-term disability (“DBL”)

Pet insurance

Standard Security Life, Madison National Life and Independence American are each rated A- (Excellent) by A.M. Best Company, Inc. ("Best"). Standard Security Life is domiciled in New York and licensed as an insurance company in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico. Madison National Life is domiciled in Wisconsin, licensed to sell insurance products in 49 states, the District of Columbia, the Virgin Islands and American Samoa. Independence American is domiciled in Delaware and licensed to sell insurance products in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. We have been informed by Best that a Best rating is assigned after an extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluation of a company's financial condition and operating performance and is also based upon factors relevant to policyholders, agents, and intermediaries, and is not directed toward protection of investors. Best ratings are not recommendations to buy, sell or hold any of our securities. 

Our administrative companies underwrite, market, administer and/or price life and health insurance business for our owned and affiliated carriers, and, to a lesser extent, for non-affiliated insurance companies. They receive fees for these services and do not bear any of the insurance risk of the companies to which they provide services, other than through profit commissions. During 2017, our principal administrative companies were: (i) Specialty Benefits, a technology-driven full-service marketing and distribution 

company that focuses on small employer and individual consumer products through general agents, tele-brokerages, advisor centers, private label arrangements, and through the following brands: www.HealtheDeals.com; Health eDeals Advisors; Aspira A Mas; www.PetPartners.com; and www.PetPlace.com; and (ii) IHC Carrier Solutions LLC (“Carrier Solutions”), a program management, actuarial and regulatory compliance company providing product development and valuation services for IHC’s specialty health segment. IHC owns controlling interests in Global Accident Facilities, LLC (“GAF”), Healthinsurance.org LLC (“HIO”) and PetPartners, Inc. (“PetPartners”). GAF is a holding company for an agency that produces injured on duty business. HIO is an online marketing company that owns www.healthinsurance.org, a lead generation site for individual health insurance. PetPartners is the exclusive provider of pet insurance to the American Kennel Club and the Cat Fanciers Association. Specialty Benefits, GAF, HIO and PetPartners are collectively referred to as our “Agencies.” Our Agencies earn commissions for selling life and health insurance products underwritten by IHC’s owned and affiliated insurance companies and also by unaffiliated carriers. IHC also owns a significant equity interest in Ebix Health Exchange Holdings, LLC (“Ebix Health Exchange”), an administration exchange for health and pet insurance. Ebix Health Exchange administers various lines of health insurance for IHC and non-affiliated carriers through Ebix Health Administration Exchange, Inc. (“EHAE”).
    On March 31, 2016, the Company sold IHC Risk Solutions, LLC (“Risk Solutions”), its managing general underwriter of excess or stop-loss insurance for self-insured employer groups that desire to manage the risk of large medical claims (“Medical Stop-Loss”) to Swiss Re Corporate Solutions, a division of Swiss Re (“Swiss Re”). In addition, under the purchase and sale agreement, all of the in-force stop-loss business of Standard Security Life and Independence American produced by Risk Solutions was co-insured by Westport Insurance Corporation (“Westport”), Swiss Re’s largest US carrier, as of January 1, 2016. The aggregate purchase price was $152,500,000 in cash, subject to adjustments and settlements. Approximately 89% of the purchase price was allocated to American Independence Corp. (“AMIC”). At the time of the transaction, IHC owned approximately 92% of AMIC. The balance of the purchase price was paid to Standard Security Life and other IHC subsidiaries. The aforementioned transaction is collectively referred to as the “Risk Solutions Sale and Coinsurance Transaction”. The Risk Solutions Sale and Coinsurance Transaction resulted in a gain on the sale estimated at approximately $100 million. IHC’s block of Medical Stop-Loss business is in run-off. The sale of Risk Solutions and exit from the medical stop-loss business represents a strategic shift that has had a major effect on the Company’s operations and financial results. The disposal transaction is reported as discontinued operations.

For information pertaining to the Company's business segments, reference is made to Note 18 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this report. 
 
Our Philosophy
 
Our business strategy consists of maximizing underwriting profits through a variety of niche specialty health insurance, pet, and group disability and life products and through distribution channels that enable us to access specialized or underserved markets in which we believe we have a competitive advantage. Historically, our carriers have focused on establishing preferred relationships with producers who seek an alternative to larger, more bureaucratic health insurers, and on providing these producers with personalized service, competitive compensation and a broad array of products. In 2017, larger health insurers marketed a significant amount of our ancillary health products to supplement or in lieu of their major medical products. A growing portion of our business comes from direct-to-consumer initiatives. While our management considers a wide range of factors in its strategic planning and decision-making, underwriting profit is consistently emphasized as the primary goal in all decisions. 
 
As a result of our increased control of distribution through corporate acquisitions, we have strengthened our ability to respond to market cycles in the health insurance sector by deploying our insurance underwriting activity across a larger number of business lines.

IHC’s greater emphasis on higher-margin specialty health products, increased distribution (including as a result of equity investments) and greater market demand have helped to increase our earnings despite having exited medical stop-loss in 2016 and, prior to that, exiting the individual and small group major medical markets as a result of the Affordable Care Act (“ACA”).
 


DISTRIBUTION
------------

Specialty Health 
 
The Specialty Health Segment is comprised of the following categories: (i) ancillary benefits including dental, vision, short-term medical (“STM”), supplemental products (including fixed indemnity limited benefit, critical illness, and hospital indemnity); (ii) pet insurance; and (iii) non-subscriber occupational accident and injured on duty. The segment had some run-off of discontinued major medical coverage and occupational accident from one producer. Carrier Solutions and our Agencies collectively perform marketing, sales, underwriting and certain administrative functions on the majority of our Specialty Health business. EHAE and other third party administrators perform claims and other administrative functions. Prior to 2017, our pet insurance was marketed and administered by one independent agency, but IHC has expanded its distribution and administration of this product. In 2016, we reinsured expatriate health business, however, this business is now in run-off. Our non-subscriber occupational accident coverage was largely marketed and administered by a subsidiary of GAF. This subsidiary was sold in 2016 and its business is in run-off. 
 
IHC has made the following investments that have increased the distribution of our specialty health products: (1) 20% of the equity of American Insurance Agencies Direct Holding, Inc., which is a call center that is one of the leading producers of hospital indemnity (“HIP”) on Independence American’s paper; (2) 10% of the equity of The iCan Group LLC, which is a call center that is also a significant producer of HIP on Independence American’s paper; (3) a 44% interest in The Abacus Group LLC (“Abacus”), which is a managing general underwriter specializing in worksite marketing of voluntary benefits that is producing life and disability business for Madison National Life and began selling group limited medical, STM, Group Gap and other ancillary products for that carrier; (4) the domain name and assets of www.petplace.com (“PetPlace”), which attracted over 15 million visitors in 2017 with more than 10,000 veterinarian-approved articles; and (5) 85% of the stock of PetPartners, a pet insurance marketing and administration company. 
 
The Specialty Health Segment performs underwriting, risk selection and pricing, policy administration and management of the majority of our specialty health business, which totaled approximately $187.8 million of gross individual and group health premiums in 2017. In addition, our Agencies produce other coverages for multiple insurers including producing small group stop-loss for Westport. Gross earned premiums produced by our Agencies was approximately $182.4 million in 2017. 
    Except for a small number of licensed agents who are employed in IHC's call center, most agents and brokers who produce the Specialty Health business are non-salaried contractors who receive commissions. 

Disability and Life Products
 
Our disability and life products are primarily distributed by general agents, agents and brokers. The short-term statutory disability benefit product in New York State is marketed primarily through independent general agents who are paid commissions based upon the amount of premiums produced. Madison National Life's disability and group life products are primarily sold in the Midwest to school districts, municipalities and hospital employer groups through a managing general agent that specializes in these target markets. Independence American also reinsured health products serving the needs of expatriates, third-party nationals and high net-worth local nationals, which is now in run out. Abacus specializes in worksite marketing of voluntary benefits and is producing life and disability business for Madison National Life.

Medical Stop-Loss
 
Standard Security Life was the primary carrier for our employer medical stop-loss products although, in 2016, we also wrote business for Madison National Life, Independence American and unaffiliated carriers. IHC’s carriers wrote the vast majority of their medical stop-loss business through Risk Solutions, which was sold on March 31, 2016, and TRU Services, LLC. IHC owned two managing general underwriters (“MGUs”), Majestic Underwriters, LLC and Alliance Underwriters, LLC, which transferred their stop-loss blocks and employees to Risk Solutions as of January 1, 2012 in exchange for fee income based on the business transferred. These two MGUs were liquidated in 2016 as a result of the Risk Solutions Sale and Coinsurance Transaction. Risk Solutions was responsible for underwriting accounts in accordance with guidelines formulated and approved by its carriers, billing and collecting premiums, paying commissions to agents, third party administrators and/or brokers, and processing claims. With respect to the MGUs with which we did business, we established underwriting guidelines, maintained approved policy forms and oversaw claims for reimbursement, as well as appropriate accounting procedures and reserves. In order to accomplish this, we audited their underwriting, claims and policy issuance practices to assure compliance with our guidelines, provided them with access to our medical management and cost containment expertise, and reviewed cases that required referral based on our underwriting guidelines. MGUs are non-salaried contractors that receive fee income, generally a percentage of gross premiums produced by them on behalf of the insurance carriers they represent, and typically are entitled to additional income based on underwriting results. Standard Security Life and Independence American have now ceased writing medical stop-loss business. 
 
The agents and brokers that produce this business are non-salaried contractors that receive commissions.
 
PRINCIPAL PRODUCTS
 
Specialty Health Products
 
In 2017, this line of business had the following categories: (i) ancillary benefits, including dental, vision, STM, and supplemental products (including fixed indemnity limited benefit, critical illness, and hospital indemnity); (ii) pet insurance; and (iii) non-subscriber occupational accident. This category also includes reinsured international health plans sold to expatriates in 2016. In 2015, IHC exited the major medical business as a result of ACA which caused adverse underwriting results in 2013 and 2014. As a result of exiting this line of business, we focused our attention on increasing our specialty health lines of business and significantly improved our bottom line performance. Sales of specialty health products nearly doubled in 2017, and earned premiums (which will typically lag behind sales) increased by 17.8% in 2017. We expect continued growth in the specialty health lines of business in 2018.
Ancillary Products
 
This category is primarily comprised of dental, vision, STM, supplemental products (including fixed indemnity limited benefit, critical illness, and hospital indemnity). These are sold through multiple distribution strategies.
 
IHC sells group and individual dental products in all 50 states. EHAE administers the majority of IHC's dental business and IHC’s own distribution is the primary source of this line of business. The dental portfolio includes indemnity and PPO plans for employer groups of two or more lives and for individuals within affinity groups. Employer plans are offered on both employer paid and voluntary basis. As part of the distribution of our dental products, we also offer vision benefits. Vision plans will offer a flat reimbursement amount for exams and materials. We expect the dental/vision business to be relatively flat in 2018.
    IHC sells STM products in the majority of states. STM is designed specifically for people with temporary needs for health coverage. Typically, STM products are written for a defined duration of at least 30 days and less than twelve months. Among the typical purchasers of STM products are people who are in between open enrollment periods or need coverage for a limited duration until their ACA-compliant plan becomes effective, and others who need insurance for a specified period of time. Our STM plans continue many, but not all, of the essential health benefit (“EHB”) found in ACA-compliant plans. In addition, our STM plans often have lower deductibles and broader networks than many ACA-compliant policies, and are almost always more affordable for qualified purchasers. IHC’s gross premium increased in this line of business in 2017, despite the Obama Administration’s executive order, which was effective April 1, 2017, that limited the duration of an STM policy to less than 90 days. Prior to the effectiveness of this executive order, the ACA and many states permitted STM to last for up to 364 days. The Trump Administration recently released for comment a rule that would reverse the executive order and restore the decision on the duration of STM to the states. Comments on this proposed rule are due April 23, 2018 and it would go into effect 60 days after a final rule is issued. Assuming adoption of a final rule similar to what has been proposed, we anticipate material growth in this line of business (and other products sold with it) in 2018 and beyond.
 
The Company markets supplemental products to individuals and families. These lines of business are generally used as either a supplement or in lieu of an ACA-compliant plan. The main driver for growth in this line is that consumers are moving to higher-cost sharing on their individual major medical plans, and are looking for products to help them offset the additional risk of higher deductibles and out of pocket limits. The product lines included in this supplemental grouping are hospital indemnity plans, fixed indemnity limited benefit plans, critical illness and bundled packages of accident medical coverage, critical illness and life insurance. These products, which are available in most states, are available through multiple distribution sources including Company owned direct-to-consumer websites, call center and career agents, general agents and on-line agencies. In 2017, we introduced a bundled benefit package including STM, HIP, dental and a tele-med and Rx benefit. This is being sold by Company owned direct-to-consumer websites, call center and career agents, e-Health and Anthem. We anticipate material growth in these lines of business in 2018 as a result of increased distribution and demand for these products, and additional growth in 2019 due to elimination of the individual mandate.
 
IHC has medical benefit plans for employers that choose to offer non-EHB coverage to their employees. We offer a fixed indemnity limited benefit policy that offers affordable health coverage to hourly, part-time and/or seasonal employees, which is approved in a majority of states. Fixed indemnity limited benefit plans are a low cost alternative to EHB plans that permit employees who do not otherwise have health insurance to begin to participate in the healthcare system. The Company anticipates meaningful growth in this line of business in 2018 due to increased consumer demand and increased distribution channels. 
 
Prior to 2016, IHC reinsured its expatriate business which provides employee benefit insurance, including medical, life, and disability, to expatriate employees of companies based in the United States. This line of business is in run out.
 
Pet Insurance
 
In 2017, we acquired 85% of the equity of PetPartners, which is a pet insurance producer that has an exclusive distribution relationship with The American Kennel Club (“AKC”), and has a strong IT platform. Using this as our administrative platform, we are actively seeking new distribution opportunities particularly in the employer, affinity and worksite space because of our ability to deduct pet insurance premiums directly from payroll. We are also exploring opportunities with new distribution partners where Independence American would be the carrier and PetPartners would be the back-end claims payer. Also in 2017, we rebuilt the website for PetPlace.com, which we acquired in 2016, and we expect to improve lead generation from this domain. PetPlace.com attracted over 15 million visitors in 2017 with more than 10,000 

veterinarian-approved articles. During 2017, we filed a new pet policy for PetPartners and have begun marketing it in states where it has been approved; we believe that this new policy will increase sales.
 
 We entered into an agreement with an independent pet insurance distributor/administrator that has a significant block of premiums. We are in the process of filing a new pet policy for this company and expect to begin to receive approvals in the second quarter of 2018. Once this company begins writing new business on Independence American’s paper, we expect that we will receive a significant portion of their new and renewal business.
 
Substantially all of our pet premiums in 2017 were produced by a pet insurance distributor/administrator which was our first pet administrator, and in which we have a small equity position. 
 
Occupational Accident
 
In 2017, most of IHC’s occupational accident insurance had been written by Independence American through marketing and administrative companies previously owned by GAF, and other exclusive arrangements with independent entities. This occupational accident product provides accidental death, accident disability and accident medical benefits for occupational injuries to employees of companies that have elected to not participate in the Texas Worker’s Compensation system (non-subscribers). The product also gives the employer the option to purchase coverage for employer’s liability, which protects the employer from an action brought by an injured worker. The employer is covered for damages and costs arising from the settlement of such action, subject to the terms and limits of the policy. In 2016, GAF sold the entity that provided administrative services for occupational accident insurance. Independence American still offers Injured on Duty coverage through another subsidiary of GAF and IHC continues to write a smaller block of occupational accident coverage through unaffiliated entities. As a result of the aforementioned sale, total premiums are expected to continue to decrease in 2018. 
Major Medical Health Benefit Coverages
 
This category is primarily comprised of group major medical insurance and individual major medical policies, both of which are in run-off as we have exited that market. We were not able to earn an acceptable profit margin on ACA-compliant products. The Company will monitor proposals from the Trump Administration regarding association health plans and STM lasting longer than 12 months to see if these would be of interest to us given our continuing expertise in individual major medical business. 
 
Group Disability; Life and DBL
 
Group Long-Term and Short-Term Disability

The Company sells group long-term disability ("LTD") products to employers that wish to provide this benefit to their employees. Depending on an employer's requirements, LTD policies (i) cover between 40% and 90% of insurable salary; (ii) have elimination periods (i.e., the period between the commencement of the disability and the start of benefit payments) of between 30 and 730 days; and (iii) terminate after two, five, or ten years, or extend to age 65 or the employee's Social Security normal retirement date. Benefit payments are reduced by social security, workers compensation, pension benefits and other income replacement payments. Optional benefits are available to employees, including coverage for partial or residual disabilities, survivor benefits and cost of living adjustments. The Company also markets short-term disability ("STD") policies that provide a weekly benefit to disabled employees until the earlier of: recovery from disability, eligibility for long-term disability benefits or the end of the STD benefit period. We continue our efforts to expand our position in the worksite market with new product filings and administration/distribution partners to position us for growth in 2018 and beyond. We have developed relationships with large health carriers to provide our life and disability programs. We are also negotiating with union-based entities to continue to leverage our strengths, namely overall risk management for 
disability programs in a benefit-rich and complex environment. The Company anticipates moderate growth in 2018.
 
New York Short-Term Disability and Paid Family Leave (“PFL”)
 
Standard Security Life markets DBL. All companies with more than one employee in New York State are required to provide DBL insurance for their employees. DBL coverage provides temporary cash payments to replace wages lost as a result of disability due to non-occupational injury or illness. The DBL policy provides for (i) payment of 50% of salary to a maximum of $170 per week; (ii) a maximum of 26 weeks in a consecutive 52 week period; and (iii) benefit commencement on the eighth consecutive day of disability. Policies covering fewer than 50 employees have fixed rates approved by the New York State Insurance Department. Policies covering 50 or more employees are individually underwritten. 

Starting January 1, 2018 the DBL policy will be amended to include PFL. The PFL benefit allows for parent bonding with a newborn or an adopted child, caring for a seriously ill family members and will help military families during times of need. Beginning January 1, 2018, with incremental changes until 2021, the benefit will be phased in. The maximum benefit (once completely phased in starting January 1, 2021) will be for 12 weeks at 67% of an employees’ weekly wage up to a maximum benefit of $869 per week. Based on our current DBL block, we anticipate DBL premiums will increase by approximately $50 million in 2018.
 
Group Term Life
 
The Company sells group term life products, including group term life, accidental death and dismemberment ("AD&D"), supplemental life and supplemental AD&D and dependent life. As with its group disability business, IHC anticipates modest growth in this line of business through expansion of its sales of these group term life products through existing distribution sources. 

Medical Stop-Loss
 
The Company was a leading writer nationally of excess or stop-loss insurance for self-insured employer groups that desire to manage the risk of large medical claims. Medical Stop-Loss insurance provides coverage to public and private entities that elect to self-insure their employees' medical coverage for losses within specified ranges, which permits such groups to manage the risk of excessive health insurance costs by limiting specific and aggregate losses to predetermined amounts. This coverage is available on either a specific or a specific and aggregate basis, although the majority of the Insurance Group's policies covered both specific and aggregate claims. Plans were designed to fit the identified needs of the self-insured employer by offering a variety of deductibles (i.e., the level of claims after which the medical stop-loss benefits become payable).
 
The Risk Solutions Sale and Coinsurance Transaction closed on March 31, 2016 and as a result, this line is in run-off and had substantially reduced premiums in 2017. 

Individual Life, Annuities and Other
 
Madison National Life ceded 100% of its remaining runoff life and annuity policies to National Guardian Life Insurance Company in 2015. In addition, Madison National Life ceased writing any life or annuity policies in the summer of 2015.
   The following lines of Standard Security Life's in-force business are in runoff: individual accident and health, individual life (of which a significant portion was 100% ceded to National Guardian Life Insurance Company in 2015), single premium immediate annuities, disability income and miscellaneous insurance business.


ACQUISITIONS OF POLICY BLOCKS
-----------------------------



Prior to reinsuring the life and annuity business in 2015 IHC’s acquisition group acquired blocks of existing life insurance, annuity and disability policies from other insurance companies, guaranty associations and liquidators. Now the acquisition group’s focus is on existing blocks of long-term and short-term disability policies, group life policies, and specialty health policies.
 

REINSURANCE AND POLICY RETENTIONS
---------------------------------



IHC retained approximately 97%, 94%, and 92%, of gross and assumed Specialty Health exposure in 2017, 2016 and 2015. The Company's average retention of gross and assumed Medical Stop-Loss exposure was 2% in 2017, 5% in 2016, and 69% in 2015. The reduction in 2016 and 2017 was a result of closing the Risk Solutions Sale and Coinsurance Transaction, pursuant to which all of the in-force stop-loss business of Security Life and Independence American produced by Risk Solutions was co-insured as of January 1, 2016. 

The Company purchases quota share reinsurance and excess reinsurance in amounts deemed appropriate by its risk committee. The Company monitors its retention amounts by product line, and has the ability to adjust its retention as appropriate.

Reinsurance is used to reduce the potentially adverse financial impact of large individual or group risks, and to reduce the strain on statutory income and surplus related to new business. By using reinsurance, the Insurance Group is able to write policies in amounts larger than it could otherwise accept. The amount reinsured is the portion of each policy in excess of the retention limit on a particular policy. 
 
In 2015, Madison National Life and Standard Security Life together entered into a coinsurance and sale agreement with an unaffiliated reinsurer to cede substantially all of their individual life and annuity policy blocks, which are currently in run-off.
 
The following reinsurers represent approximately 86% of the total ceded premium for the year ended December 31, 2017:
 

RGA Reinsurance Company | 41%
-----------------------------------------+----
National Guardian Life Insurance Company | 31%
Westport Insurance Corporation | 9% 
GBG Insurance Ltd. | 5% 
 | 86%



The Insurance Group remains liable with respect to the insurance in-force, which has been reinsured in the unlikely event that the assuming reinsurers are unable to satisfy their obligations. The Insurance Group cedes business (i) to individual reinsurance companies that are rated "A-" or better by Best or (ii) upon provision of adequate security. The ceding of reinsurance does not discharge the primary liability of the original insurer to the insured. At December 31, 2017 and 2016, the Insurance Group's ceded reinsurance in-force was $6.9 billion and $6.3 billion, respectively.
 
For further information pertaining to reinsurance, reference is made to Note 9 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8.


INVESTMENTS AND RESERVES
------------------------



The Company's cash, cash equivalents and securities portfolio are managed by employees of IHC and its affiliates, and ultimate investment authority rests with IHC's in-house investment group. As a result of the nature of IHC's insurance liabilities, IHC endeavors to maintain a significant percentage of its assets in investment grade securities, cash and cash equivalents. At December 31, 2017, 100% of the fixed maturities were investment grade and continue to be rated on average AA. The internal investment group provides a summary of the investment portfolio and the performance thereof at the meetings of the Company's board of directors.
   As required by insurance laws and regulations, the Insurance Group establishes reserves to meet obligations on policies in-force. These reserves are amounts that, with additions from premiums expected to be received and with interest on such reserves at certain assumed rates, are calculated to be sufficient to meet anticipated future policy obligations. Premiums and reserves are based upon certain assumptions with respect to mortality, morbidity on health insurance, lapses and interest rates effective at the time the polices are issued. The Insurance Group also establishes appropriate reserves for substandard business, annuities and additional policy benefits, such as waiver of premium and accidental death. Standard Security Life and Madison National Life are also required by law to have an annual asset adequacy analysis, which, in general, projects the amount and timing of cash flows to the estimated maturity date of liabilities, prepared by the certifying actuary for each insurance company. The Insurance Group invests their respective assets, which support the reserves and other funds in accordance with applicable insurance law, under the supervision of their respective board of directors. The Company manages interest rate risk seeking to maintain a portfolio with a duration and average life that falls within the band of the duration and average life of the applicable liabilities. The Company occasionally utilizes options to modify the duration and average life of the assets. 

Under Wisconsin insurance law, there are restrictions relating to the percentage of an insurer's admitted assets that may be invested in a specific issuer or in the aggregate in a particular type of investment. With respect to the portion of an insurer's assets equal to its liabilities plus a statutorily-determined security surplus amount, a Wisconsin insurer cannot, for example, invest more than a certain percentage of its assets in non-amortizable evidences of indebtedness, securities of any issuer and its affiliates (other than a subsidiary and the United States government), or common stock of any corporation and its affiliates (other than a subsidiary or mutual funds).

Under New York insurance law, there are restrictions relating to the percentage of an insurer's admitted assets that may be invested in a specific issuer or in the aggregate in a particular type of investment. For example, a New York life insurer cannot invest more than a certain percentage of its admitted assets in common or preferred shares of any one institution, obligations secured by any one property (other than those issued, guaranteed or insured by the United States or any state government or agency thereof), or medium and lower grade obligations. In addition, there are certain qualitative investment restrictions.    
Under Delaware insurance law, there are restrictions relating to the percentage of an insurer's admitted assets that may be invested in a specific issuer or in the aggregate in a particular type of investment. In addition, there are qualitative investment restrictions.

The Company's total pre-tax investment performance for each of the last three years is summarized below, including amounts recognized in net income and unrealized gains and losses recognized in other comprehensive income or loss (in thousands): 
 

 | | 2017 | | 2016 | | 2015 
---------------------------------------------------------------+---+--------+---+---------+---+--------
Consolidated Statements of Income: | | | | | | 
Net investment income | $ | 16,276 | $ | 16,570 | $ | 17,237 
Net realized investment gains | | 2,539 | | 4,502 | | 3,094 
Other-than-temporary impairments | | - | | (1,475) | | (228) 
Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss): | | | | | | 
Net unrealized gains (losses) on available-for-sale securities | | 4,996 | | (5,424) | | (5,475)
Total pre-tax investment performance | $ | 23,811 | $ | 14,173 | $ | 14,628 

 
Net unrealized gains (losses) on available-for-sale securities recognized through other comprehensive income (loss) represents the pre-tax change in unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale securities arising during the year net of reclassification adjustments and includes the portion attributable to noncontrolling interests. The Company does not have any non-performing fixed maturity investments at December 31, 2017.


COMPETITION AND REGULATION
--------------------------



We compete with many large mutual and stock insurance companies, small regional health insurers and managed care organizations. Mutual companies may have certain competitive advantages since profits inure directly to the benefit of the policyholders. 

The health insurance industry tends to be cyclical, and excess products, such as medical stop-loss, tend to be more volatile than specialty health products. During a “soft” market cycle, a larger number of companies offer insurance on a certain line of business, which causes premiums in that line to trend downward. In a “hard” market cycle, insurance companies limit their writings in certain lines of business following periods of excessive losses and insurance and reinsurance companies redeploy their capital to lines that they believe will achieve higher margins. 
 
IHC is an insurance holding company; and as such, IHC and its subsidiary carriers and administrative companies are subject to regulation and supervision by multiple state insurance regulators, including the New York State Insurance Department (Standard Security Life's domestic regulator), the Wisconsin Office of the Commissioner of Insurance (Madison National Life's domestic regulator) and the Office of the Insurance Commissioner of the State of Delaware (Independence American’s domestic regulator). Each of Standard Security Life, Madison National Life and Independence American is subject to regulation and supervision in every state in which it is licensed to transact business. These supervisory agencies have broad administrative powers with respect to the granting and revocation of licenses to transact business, the licensing of agents, the approval of policy forms, the approval of commission rates, the form and content of mandatory financial statements, reserve requirements and the types and maximum amounts of investments which may be made. Such regulation is primarily designed for the benefit of policyholders rather than the stockholders of an insurance company or insurance holding company.

Certain transactions within the IHC holding company system are also subject to regulation and supervision by such regulatory agencies. All such transactions must be fair and equitable. Notice to or prior approval by the applicable insurance department is required with respect to transactions affecting the ownership or control of an insurer and of certain material transactions, including dividend declarations, between an insurer and any person in its holding company system. Under New York, Wisconsin and Delaware insurance laws, "control" is defined as the possession, directly or indirectly, of the power to direct or cause the direction of the management and policies of a person. Under New York law, control is 
presumed to exist if any person, directly or indirectly, owns, controls or holds, with the power to vote ten percent or more of the voting securities of any other person. In Wisconsin, control is presumed if any person, directly or indirectly, owns, controls or holds with the power to vote more than ten percent of the voting securities of another person. In Delaware, control is presumed if any person, directly or indirectly, owns, controls or holds with the power to vote ten percent or more of the voting securities of any other person. In all three states, the acquisition of control of a domestic insurer needs to be approved in advance by the Commissioner of Insurance. See Note 17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 for information as to restrictions on the ability of the Company's insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends.
 
Risk-based capital requirements are imposed on life and property and casualty insurance companies. The risk-based capital ratio is determined by dividing an insurance company's total adjusted capital, as defined, by its authorized control level risk-based capital. Companies that do not meet certain minimum standards require specified corrective action. The risk-based capital ratios for each of Standard Security Life, Madison National Life and Independence American exceed such minimum ratios.
