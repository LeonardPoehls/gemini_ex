ITEM 1. Business
Overview
Actua Corporation (f/k/a ICG Group, Inc.) (referred to in this Report as "Actua", the "Company," "we," "our," or "us") was formed on March 4, 1996 and is headquartered in Radnor, Pennsylvania. Prior to Actua’s recent sale of its interests in its three majority-owned businesses, VelocityEHS Holdings, Inc. ("Velocity"), BOLT Solutions Inc. ("Bolt") and Folio Dynamics Holdings, Inc. ("FolioDynamix"), which together constituted substantially all of Actua’s assets (such sales together, the "Transactions"), Actua was a multi-vertical cloud technology company with software and service offerings that Actua believes created unique and compelling value for its customers and provided transformative efficiency to vertical markets. 
Actua’s common stock was traded on The NASDAQ Global Select Market under the symbol "ACTA" until Actua voluntarily delisted its common stock, effective as of February 7, 2018. Actua’s common stock is currently trading on the OTCQB Market under the symbol "ACTA." 
Following stockholder approval of the Transactions, the sale of Actua’s interests in Velocity and Bolt (the "Velocity/Bolt Sale") was completed on December 12, 2017, and the sale of FolioDynamix was completed on January 2, 2018. In light of the Transactions and the previous sale of GovDelivery Holdings, Inc. ("GovDelivery") to an affiliate of Vista Equity Partners ("Vista") on October 18, 2016 (the "GovDelivery Sale"), our results of operations for these companies are being presented as discontinued operations as of December 31, 2017 and for all comparable periods.
Whenever Actua completes an acquisition or disposition, it evaluates the impact of the transaction on its reportable segments.  Due to the Transactions, Actua no longer has separate operating segments. For information regarding the results of operations, see "Item 7—Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" and "Item 8—Financial Statements and Supplementary Data," including our Consolidated Financial Statements; that information is incorporated herein by reference.
On January 18, 2018, the Actua Board of Directors (the "Board") approved a formal plan of dissolution (the "Plan of Dissolution"), subject to stockholder approval. At a special meeting of Actua’s stockholders to be held on April 18, 2018, Actua’s stockholders will be asked to approve the voluntary dissolution and liquidation of Actua pursuant to the Plan of Dissolution. If the Plan of Dissolution is approved by the requisite vote of Actua’s stockholders, Actua will file a Certificate of Dissolution with the Delaware Secretary of State and, thereafter, conduct only business activities relating to winding up and liquidating its business and affairs, including but not limited to the following: 

• | the receipt of amounts due to Actua and/or resulting from the sale, exchange or other disposition of all or substantially all of Actua’s non-cash property and assets, in one transaction or in several transactions, including:


◦ | proceeds from the disposition of its minority ownership stakes (generally less than 10%) in several private companies, including:


▪ | InstaMed Holdings, Inc. (a cloud-based healthcare payments network) ("InstaMed");


• | Parchment Inc. (a provider of cloud-based technology for education credentials) ("Parchment");


• | Savana, Inc. (a provider of financial process automation technology);


• | Relay Holdings, LLC (a provider of a mobile customer communications platform);


• | Stage2 Capital Ventures Associates, L.P. (an investor in technology businesses); and


• | Audyssey Laboratories, Inc., Blurb, Inc. and Solarflare Communications, Inc. (each of which is a technology business in which Actua acquired a stake through the wind-down and liquidation of Anthem Ventures Fund, L.P. and Anthem Annex Fund, L.P.) (collectively, the "Minority Investments"); and


◦ | proceeds, if any, from the Client Consent Adjustment Amount (as such term is defined in that certain Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated September 25, 2017, among FolioDynamix, Envestnet, Inc. ("Envestnet"), FCD Merger Sub, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Envestnet, and Actua USA Corporation, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Actua, as the representative of FolioDynamix’s stockholders, the merger agreement underlying Actua’s sale of its interests in FolioDynamix to Envestnet (such agreement, the "Folio

3

Sale Agreement")), pursuant to which Actua may realize approximately $11.6 million in additional cash proceeds in the second quarter of 2018 if and to the extent that FolioDynamix is able to meet an agreed-upon threshold under a previously disclosed purchase price adjustment mechanism relating to client consents (all such future amounts received (including from the sale of Minority Investments), collectively, the "Potential Additional Proceeds");

• | the defense, resolution and/or settlement of any litigation against Actua (including the previously disclosed lawsuit in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware captioned Inter-Atlantic Fund II, L.P. and Neurone II Investments G.P. Ltd. v. Actua Corporation et al., Case No. 2017-0858-JTL (and any other lawsuit, action or claim from any Bolt stockholder relating to Actua’s ownership or sale of Bolt or any subsequent sale of Bolt), along with any indemnification claims against Actua or other obligations related thereto (collectively, the "Bolt Litigation")), as well as any potential claims for indemnification in connection with sales of Actua’s businesses, and the making of reasonable provision to pay insurance retentions and legal fees in connection with any such lawsuit or claim;


• | the payment of or the making of reasonable provision to pay all known claims and obligations, including all contingent, conditional or un-matured contractual claims known to Actua;


• | the making of such provision as will be reasonably likely to be sufficient to satisfy any claim against Actua which is the subject of a pending action, suit or proceeding to which Actua is a party;


• | the making of such provision as will be reasonably likely to be sufficient to satisfy any claims that have not been made known to Actua or that have not arisen but that, based on facts known to Actua, are likely to arise or become known to Actua within ten years after the date of dissolution;


• | the setting aside of a reserve consisting of cash and/or property to satisfy such claims and contingent obligations;


• | the payment of any additional liquidating distribution to Actua’s stockholders; and


• | the pro rata distribution to Actua’s stockholders, or the transfer to one or more liquidating trustees for the benefit of Actua’s stockholders under a liquidating trust, of the remaining assets of Actua after payment or provision for payment of claims against and obligations of Actua.

Under Delaware law, Actua will continue to exist for three years after Actua’s dissolution or for such longer period as the Delaware Court of Chancery directs, or as may be required to resolve any pending litigation matters, for the purpose of prosecuting and defending suits against Actua and enabling Actua gradually to close its business, to dispose of its property, to discharge its liabilities and to distribute any remaining assets to its stockholders. The Plan of Dissolution also provides for the appointment, at the Board’s discretion, of a manager to oversee the sale of Actua’s assets and Actua’s liquidation and wind up (such individual, or any successor person(s) as the Board may later designate, the "Manager"). 
The proportionate interests of all of Actua’s stockholders will be fixed on the basis of their respective stock holdings at the close of business on the date the Certificate of Dissolution is filed with the Delaware Secretary of State as determined by the Board, which date is referred to herein as the "Final Record Date". Actua intends to discontinue recording transfers of shares of its common stock on the Final Record Date, and thereafter certificates representing shares of Actua’s common stock will not be assignable or transferable on Actua’s books except by will, intestate succession or operation of law. After the Final Record Date, any distributions made by Actua will be made solely to the stockholders of record as of the close of business on the Final Record Date, except as may be necessary to reflect subsequent transfers recorded on Actua’s books as a result of any assignments by will, intestate succession or operation of law. In light of the dissolution, Actua intends to request permission from the SEC to suspend certain of Actua's reporting obligations under the Exchange Act, and ultimately to terminate the registration of its common stock. 
On February 1, 2018, Actua distributed to each holder of its common stock an amount equal to $14.89 per share (the "Transaction Distribution"); such distribution is intended to be a liquidating distribution assuming approval of the Plan of Dissolution. If funds are available and to the extent permitted by Delaware law, Actua intends to make additional liquidating distributions to its stockholders from time to time following the effective date of the filing of the Certificate of Dissolution. Actua is unable to predict the precise amount or timing of any additional liquidating distributions (or whether any additional liquidating distributions will occur at all), however, as many of the factors influencing the amount of cash distributed to Actua’s stockholders in additional liquidating distribution(s) and/or the timing of such distributions cannot be currently quantified with certainty and are subject to change. Total actual distributions, if any, could be higher or lower, than Actua's previously disclosed estimates or there may not be any additional liquidating distributions at all. It is possible that any distribution could be followed in the future by additional 
4

distributions if it is determined that any reserved amounts no longer need to be reserved or if Actua realizes more Potential Additional Proceeds than expected as part of the liquidation process. The actual amounts and timing of any additional liquidating distributions may vary substantially, depending on, among other things, the actual operating expenses Actua incurs during the dissolution and wind-down process, Actua’s ability to successfully defend, resolve and/or settle the Bolt Litigation and any other litigation matters that may arise (and the timing of any such successful defense, resolution or settlement), whether Actua becomes subject to additional liabilities or claims, including potential claims for indemnification relating to sales of Actua’s businesses (and the speed with which Actua is able to defend, resolve or discharge any such liabilities or claims), whether Actua incurs unexpected or greater than expected losses with respect to presently unknown, contingent and/or conditional liabilities, and the extent to which (and the speed with which) Actua is able to realize proceeds from the sale of Minority Investments and/or receive any other Potential Additional Proceeds. 
That certain Membership Interest Purchase Agreement, dated as of September 23, 2017, among Actua, Actua Holdings, Inc. (“Actua Holdings”), Bolt Holdings LLC (f/k/a Arsenal Acquisition Holdings, LLC) (“Bolt Holdings”) and Velocity Holdco III Inc. (f/k/a Arsenal Buyer Inc.), an affiliate of CVC Growth Fund (“CVC”) (such agreement, as amended on March 22, 2018, the “Velocity/Bolt Sale Agreement”), provides that if a sale of Bolt meeting certain requirements occurs pursuant to a definitive agreement executed prior to March 30, 2018 (any such sale, a “Bolt Sale”), Actua Holdings would be entitled to receive a portion of the net proceeds paid in that Bolt Sale, subject to certain adjustments. Since no definitive agreement providing for or contemplating a Bolt Sale has been executed prior to March 30, 2018, Actua Holdings is not entitled under the Velocity/Bolt Sale Agreement to receive any proceeds in connection with a Bolt Sale.
