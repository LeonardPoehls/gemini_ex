ITEM 1. BUSINESS
General

(All Registrants)

PPL Corporation, headquartered in Allentown, Pennsylvania, is a utility holding company, incorporated in 1994, in connection with the deregulation of electricity generation in Pennsylvania, to serve as the parent company to the regulated utility, PPL Electric, and to generation and other unregulated business activities. PPL Electric was founded in 1920 as Pennsylvania Power & Light Company. PPL, through its regulated utility subsidiaries, delivers electricity to customers in the U.K., Pennsylvania, Kentucky, Virginia and Tennessee; delivers natural gas to customers in Kentucky; and generates electricity from power plants in Kentucky. In June 2015, PPL completed the spinoff of PPL Energy Supply, which combined its competitive power generation businesses with those of Riverstone to form a new, stand-alone, publicly traded company named Talen Energy. See "Spinoff of PPL Energy Supply" below for more information.

PPL's principal subsidiaries at December 31, 2016 are shown below (* denotes a Registrant).

Spinoff of PPL Energy Supply

In June 2014, PPL and PPL Energy Supply executed definitive agreements with affiliates of Riverstone to spin off PPL Energy Supply and immediately combine it with Riverstone's competitive power generation businesses to form a new, stand-alone, publicly traded company named Talen Energy. On April 29, 2015, PPL's Board of Directors declared the June 1, 2015 distribution to PPL's shareowners of record on May 20, 2015 of a newly formed entity, Holdco, which at closing owned all of the membership interests of PPL Energy Supply and all of the common stock of Talen Energy.

Immediately following the spinoff on June 1, 2015, Holdco merged with a special purpose subsidiary of Talen Energy, with Holdco continuing as the surviving company to the merger and as a wholly owned subsidiary of Talen Energy and the sole owner of PPL Energy Supply. Substantially contemporaneous with the spinoff and merger, RJS Power was contributed by its owners to become a subsidiary of Talen Energy. PPL's shareowners received approximately 0.1249 shares of Talen Energy common stock for each share of PPL common stock they owned on May 20, 2015. Following completion of these transactions, PPL shareowners owned 65% of Talen Energy and affiliates of Riverstone owned 35%. The spinoff had no effect on the number of PPL common shares owned by PPL shareowners or the number of shares of PPL common stock outstanding. The transaction is intended to be tax-free to PPL and its shareowners for U.S. federal income tax purposes.

PPL has no continuing ownership interest in or control of Talen Energy and Talen Energy Supply (formerly PPL Energy Supply).

Segment Information

(PPL)

PPL is organized into three reportable segments as depicted in the chart above: U.K. Regulated, Kentucky Regulated, and Pennsylvania Regulated. The U.K. Regulated segment has no related subsidiary Registrants. PPL's other reportable segments' results primarily represent the results of its related subsidiary Registrants, except that the reportable segments are also allocated certain corporate level financing and other costs that are not included in the results of the applicable subsidiary Registrants. PPL also has corporate and other costs which primarily include financing costs incurred at the corporate level that have not been allocated or assigned to the segments, as well as certain other unallocated costs. As a result of the June 1, 2015 spinoff of PPL Energy Supply, PPL no longer has a Supply segment.

(PPL Electric, LKE, LG&E and KU)

PPL Electric has two operating segments that are aggregated into a single reportable segment. LKE, LG&E and KU are individually single operating and reportable segments.

• | U.K. Regulated Segment (PPL)

Consists of PPL Global, which primarily includes WPD's regulated electricity distribution operations, the results of hedging the translation of WPD's earnings from British pound sterling into U.S. dollars, and certain costs, such as U.S. income taxes, administrative costs and acquisition-related financing costs.

WPD, through indirect wholly owned subsidiaries, operates four of the 15 regulated distribution networks providing electricity service in the U.K. The number of network customers (end-users) served by WPD totals 7.8 million across 21,600 square miles in south Wales and southwest and central England.

Revenues, in millions, for the years ended December 31 are shown below. 

 | 2016 | | 2015 | 2014
Operating Revenues | $ | 2,207 | | $ | 2,410 | $ | 2,621


The majority of WPD's operating revenue is known as DUoS and is generated by providing regulated electricity distribution services to licensed third party energy suppliers who pay WPD for the use of WPD's distribution network to transfer electricity to the suppliers' customers, the end-users.

Franchise and Licenses

The operations of WPD's principal subsidiaries, WPD (South West), WPD (South Wales), WPD (East Midlands) and WPD (West Midlands), are regulated by Ofgem under the direction of the Gas and Electricity Markets Authority. The Electricity Act 1989 provides the fundamental framework for electricity companies and established licenses that require each of the DNOs to develop, maintain and operate efficient distribution networks. WPD operates under a regulatory year that begins April 1 and ends March 31 of each year.

WPD is authorized by Ofgem to provide electricity distribution services within its concession areas and service territories, subject to certain conditions and obligations. For instance, WPD is subject to Ofgem regulation with respect to the regulated revenue it can earn and the quality of service it must provide, and WPD can be fined or have its licenses revoked if it does not meet the mandated standard of service.

Ofgem has formal powers to propose modifications to each distribution license. In January 2014, Ofgem and WPD agreed to a reduction of £5 per residential end-user in the 2014/15 regulatory year to be recovered in the 2016/17 regulatory year. See "Item 7. Combined Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Overview - U.K. Distribution Revenue Reduction" for additional information.

Competition
Although WPD operates in non-exclusive concession areas in the U.K., it currently faces little competition with respect to end-users connected to its network. WPD's four distribution businesses are, therefore, regulated monopolies, which operate under regulatory price controls.
Revenue and Regulation

Ofgem has adopted a price control mechanism that establishes the amount of base demand revenue WPD can earn, subject to certain true-ups, and provides for an increase or reduction in revenues based on incentives or penalties for performance relative to pre-established targets. WPD's allowed revenue primarily includes base demand revenue (adjusted for inflation using RPI), performance incentive revenues or penalties, adjustments for over- or under-recovery from prior periods and adjustments related to the DPCR4 line loss close out.

WPD is currently operating under the eight-year price control period of RIIO-ED1, which commenced on April 1, 2015. The RIIO framework is intended to:

• | encourage DNOs to deliver safe, reliable and sustainable network service at long-term value to customers;


• | enable DNOs to finance required investment in a timely and efficient way;


• | remunerate DNOs according to their delivery for customers;


• | increase emphasis on outputs and incentives;


• | enhance stakeholder engagement including network customers;


• | provide a stronger incentive framework to encourage more efficient investment and innovation; and


• | continue to stimulate innovation.

Additionally, from a financial perspective the RIIO-ED1 framework:

• | regulates revenues for the DNOs in real terms using 2012/13 prices;


• | inflates revenue components using the RPI beginning March 31, 2013, which has the effect of inflating RAV, with respect to base demand revenue;


• | splits the recovery of Totex between immediate recovery (called "fast pot") and deferred recovery as an addition to the RAV (called "slow pot");


• | provides DNOs with a general pass-through for costs over which the DNOs have no control (i.e., Ofgem fees, National Grid transmission charges and property taxes);


• | provides a tax allowance based on Ofgem's notional tax charge, which may not equal the actual corporate tax paid;


• | extends the recovery period for depreciation of RAV additions after April 1, 2015 from a 20 year life as used under DPCR5, to 45 years, with a transitional arrangement that will gradually increase the average asset life for RAV additions during RIIO-ED1 to approximately 35 years. The RAV as of March 31, 2015 will continue to be depreciated over 20 years. The asset lives used to determine depreciation expense for U.S. GAAP purposes are not the same as those used for the depreciation of the RAV in setting revenues and, as such, vary by asset type and are based on the expected useful lives of the assets;


• | provides successful DNOs an incentive to be fast-tracked through the regulatory approval process, equivalent to 2.5% of Totex during the 8-year price control period; and


• | maintains an incentive scheme for DNOs to be rewarded or penalized for performance in the areas of reliability and customer satisfaction, but places a maximum cap on the amount of incentive revenues that can be earned by a DNO.

The key components of WPD's four Ofgem-accepted RIIO-ED1 business plans are:

• | all four DNO business plans were accepted for fast-track status (fast-track incentive is worth approximately $35 million annually for WPD assuming a $1.30/£ foreign currency exchange rate);


• | WPD received a higher level of cost savings retention, which was established at 70% for WPD compared to approximately 55% for slow-tracked DNOs;


• | a cost of debt recovery comprised of a 10-year trailing average debt allowance, to be adjusted annually, compared to a 20-year trailing average for slow-tracked DNOs applied to 65% of RAV;


• | a return on regulatory equity (RORE) allowance with an equity ratio of 35% of RAV and a cost of equity rate of 6.4% compared to 6.0% for slow-tracked DNOs;


• | a Totex split of 80% slow pot and 20% fast pot;


• | recovery of approximately 80% of pension deficit funding for certain of WPD's defined benefit pension plans; and


• | incentive targets that are significantly more stringent than those set under DPCR5, reducing the expected incentive revenues WPD can earn in RIIO-ED1 compared to DPCR5.

6

WPD's combined business plans include funding for total expenditures of approximately $16.6 billion over the eight-year period (assuming a $1.30/£ foreign currency exchange rate), broken down as follows:

• | Totex - $11.0 billion ($8.8 billion additions to RAV; $2.2 billion fast pot);


• | Pension deficit funding - $1.6 billion;


• | Cost of debt recovery - $1.3 billion;


• | Property taxes, Ofgem fees and National Grid transmissions charges - $2.1 billion; and


• | Corporate income taxes recovery - $600 million.

The U.K. regulatory structure is an incentive-based structure in contrast to the typical U.S. regulatory structure, which operates on a cost-recovery model. The base demand revenue that a DNO can earn in each year of the current price control period is the sum of:

• | a return on capital from RAV;


• | a return of capital from RAV (i.e., depreciation);


• | the fast pot recovery;


• | pension deficit funding;


• | an allowance for cash taxes paid less a potential reduction for tax benefits from excess leverage if a DNO is levered more than 65% Debt/RAV;


• | certain pass-through costs over which the DNO has no control;


• | certain legacy price control adjustments from preceding price control periods, including the information quality incentive (also known as the rolling RAV incentive);


• | fast-track incentive - because WPD's four DNOs were fast-tracked through the price control review process for RIIO-ED1, their base demand revenue also includes the fast-track incentive discussed above;


• | profiling adjustments - these adjustments do not affect the total base demand revenue in real terms over the eight-year price control period, but change the year in which the revenue is earned;


• | adjustments from the Annual Iteration Process (AIP), discussed further below; and


• | adjustments for inflation true-ups, discussed further below.

In addition to base demand revenue, WPD's allowed revenue primarily includes:

• | an increase or reduction in revenues based on incentives or penalties for actual performance against pre-established targets from prior periods;


• | adjustments for over- or under-recovery of allowed revenue from prior periods; and


• | a reduction in revenue related to the DPCR4 line loss close out.

During DPCR5, the prior price control review period, WPD's total base demand revenue for the five-year period was profiled in a manner that resulted in a weighted-average increase of about 5.5% per year for all four DNOs. In the first year of RIIO-ED1, base demand revenue decreased by about 11.8% primarily due to a change in profiling methodology and a lower weighted-average cost of capital. Base demand revenue will then increase by approximately 2.5% per annum before inflation for regulatory years up to March 31, 2018 and by approximately 1% per annum before inflation for each regulatory year thereafter for the remainder of RIIO-ED1.

As the regulatory model is incentive based rather than a cost recovery model, WPD is not subject to accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation as prescribed by GAAP. Therefore, the accounting treatment of adjustments to base demand revenue and/or allowed revenue is evaluated based on revenue recognition and contingency accounting guidance.

Base Demand Revenue True-up Mechanisms
Unlike prior price control reviews, base demand revenue under RIIO-ED1 will be adjusted during the price control period. The most significant of those adjustments are:

• | Inflation True-Up - The base demand revenue for the RIIO-ED1 period was set in 2012/13 prices. Therefore an inflation factor as determined by forecasted RPI, provided by HM Treasury, is applied to base demand revenue. Forecasted RPI is trued up to actuals and affects future base demand revenue two regulatory years later. This revenue change is called the "TRU" adjustment.


◦ | The TRU for the 2015/16 regulatory year was a $40 million reduction to revenue and will reduce base demand revenue in calendar years 2017 and 2018 by $27 million and $13 million, respectively.


◦ | The projected TRU for the 2016/17 regulatory year is a $6 million reduction to revenue and will reduce base demand revenue in calendar years 2018 and 2019 by $4 million and $2 million, respectively.


• | Annual Iteration Process - The RIIO-ED1 price control period also includes an Annual Iteration Process (AIP). This will allow future base demand revenues agreed with the regulator as part of the price control review to be updated

7

during the price control period for financial adjustments including tax, pensions and cost of debt, legacy price control adjustments from preceding price control periods and adjustments relating to actual and allowed total expenditure together with the Totex Incentive Mechanism (TIM). Under the TIM, WPD's DNOs are able to retain 70% of any amounts not spent against the RIIO-ED1 plan and bear 70% of any over-spends. The AIP calculates an incremental change to base demand revenue, known as the "MOD" adjustment. 

◦ | The MOD provided by Ofgem in November 2016 included the TIM for the 2015/16 regulatory year as well as the cost of debt calculation based on the 10-year trailing average to October 2016. This MOD of $15 million will reduce base demand revenue in calendar years 2017 and 2018 by $10 million and $5 million, respectively.


◦ | The projected MOD for the 2016/17 regulatory year is a $52 million reduction to revenue and will reduce base demand revenue in calendar years 2018 and 2019 by $35 million and $17 million, respectively.


As both MOD and TRU are changes to future base demand revenues as determined by Ofgem, these adjustments are recognized as a component of revenues in future years in which service is provided and revenues are collected or returned to customers. PPL's projected earnings per share growth rate through 2020 includes both the TRU and MOD for regulatory year 2015/16 and the estimated TRU and MOD for 2016/17.

Allowed Revenue Components
In addition to base demand revenue, certain other items are added or subtracted to arrive at allowed revenue. The most significant of these are discussed below.

Incentives: Ofgem has established incentives to provide opportunities for DNO's to enhance overall returns by improving network efficiency, reliability and customer service. Some of the more significant incentives that may affect allowed revenue include:


• | Interruptions Incentive Scheme (IIS) - This incentive has two major components: (1) Customer interruptions (CIs) and (2) Customer minutes lost (CMLs), and both are designed to incentivize the DNOs to invest in and operate their networks to manage and reduce both the frequency and duration of power outages. The IIS target under RIIO-ED1 is divided into interruptions caused by planned and unplanned work. The target for planned interruptions is calculated as the annual average level of planned interruptions and minutes lost over a previous three-year period. The targets for unplanned interruptions for RIIO-ED1 are specified in the DNOs license, and targets for both the CIs and CMLs become more demanding each year.


• | In addition to the IIS, the broad measure of customer service is enhanced in RIIO-ED1. This broad measure encompasses:


• | customer satisfaction in supply interruptions, connections and general inquiries;


• | complaints;


• | stakeholder engagement; and


• | delivery of social obligations.

The following table shows the amount of incentive revenue, primarily from IIS, that WPD has earned during DPCR5 and RIIO-ED1: 

 | Incentive Earned | | Regulatory Year Ended Incentive
Regulatory Year Ended | (in millions) | | Included in Revenue 
March 2012 | $ | 83 | | | March 2014
March 2013 | 104 | | | March 2015
March 2014 | 117 | | | March 2016
March 2015 | 110 | | | March 2017
March 2016 | 99 | | | March 2018


Based on applicable GAAP, incentive revenues are recorded in revenues when they are billed to customers.

DPCR4 Line Loss Adjustment
For regulatory years 2015/16 through 2018/19, allowed revenue will also be reduced to reflect Ofgem's final decision on the DPCR4 line loss incentives and penalties mechanism. WPD has a liability recorded related to this future revenue reduction and, therefore, this will not impact future earnings. See Note 6 to the Financial Statements for additional information.
Correction Factor
During the price control period, WPD sets its tariffs to recover allowed revenue. However, in any fiscal period, WPD's revenue could be negatively affected if its tariffs and the volume delivered do not fully recover the allowed revenue for a particular 
8

period. Conversely, WPD could over-recover revenue. Over and under-recoveries are subtracted from or added to allowed revenue in future years, known as the "Correction Factor" or "K-factor." Over and under-recovered amounts arising for periods beginning with the 2014/15 regulatory year and refunded/recovered under RIIO-ED1 will be refunded/recovered on a two year lag (previously one year). Therefore, the 2014/15 over/under-recovery adjustment will occur in the 2016/17 regulatory year. Under this mechanism, in the 2016/17 regulatory year, WPD will recover the £5 per residential network customer reduction given through reduced tariffs in 2014/15. As a result, revenues were positively affected by $39 million in calendar year 2016 and are projected to be positively affected by $16 million in calendar year 2017.

Historically, tariffs have been set a minimum of three months prior to the beginning of the regulatory year (April 1). In February 2015, Ofgem determined that, beginning with the 2017/18 regulatory year, tariffs would be established a minimum of fifteen months in advance. Therefore, in December 2015, WPD was required to establish tariffs for 2016/17 and 2017/18. This change will potentially increase volatility in future revenue forecasts due to the need to forecast components of allowed revenue including MOD, TRU, K-factor and incentive revenues.

See Note 1 to the Financial Statements for additional information on revenue recognition. 
See "Item 1A. Risk Factors - Risks Related to U.K. Regulated Segment" for additional information on the risks associated with the U.K. Regulated Segment.
Customers

WPD provides regulated electricity distribution services to licensed third party energy suppliers who use WPD's networks to transfer electricity to their customers, the end-users. WPD bills energy suppliers for this service and the supplier is responsible for billing its end-users. Ofgem requires that all licensed electricity distributors and suppliers become parties to the Distribution Connection and Use of System Agreement. This agreement specifies how creditworthiness will be determined and, as a result, whether the supplier needs to collateralize its payment obligations.

• | Kentucky Regulated Segment (PPL)

Consists of the operations of LKE, which owns and operates regulated public utilities engaged in the generation, transmission, distribution and sale of electricity and distribution and sale of natural gas, representing primarily the activities of LG&E and KU. In addition, certain acquisition-related financing costs are allocated to the Kentucky Regulated segment.  
(PPL, LKE, LG&E and KU)

LG&E and KU, direct subsidiaries of LKE, are engaged in the regulated generation, transmission, distribution and sale of electricity in Kentucky and, in KU's case, Virginia and Tennessee. LG&E also engages in the distribution and sale of natural gas in Kentucky. LG&E provides electric service to approximately 407,000 customers in Louisville and adjacent areas in Kentucky, covering approximately 700 square miles in nine counties and provides natural gas service to approximately 324,000 customers in its electric service area and eight additional counties in Kentucky. KU provides electric service to approximately 521,000 customers in 77 counties in central, southeastern and western Kentucky, approximately 28,000 customers in five counties in southwestern Virginia, and four customers in Tennessee, covering approximately 4,800 non-contiguous square miles. KU also sells wholesale electricity to 11 municipalities in Kentucky under load following contracts.

Franchises and Licenses

LG&E and KU provide electricity delivery service, and LG&E provides natural gas distribution service, in their respective service territories pursuant to certain franchises, licenses, statutory service areas, easements and other rights or permissions granted by state legislatures, cities or municipalities or other entities. 
Competition
There are currently no other electric public utilities operating within the electric service areas of LKE. From time to time, bills are introduced into the Kentucky General Assembly which seek to authorize, promote or mandate increased distributed generation, customer choice or other developments. Neither the Kentucky General Assembly nor the KPSC has adopted or approved a plan or timetable for retail electric industry competition in Kentucky. The nature or timing of legislative or regulatory actions, if any, regarding industry restructuring and their impact on LKE, which may be significant, cannot currently be predicted. Virginia, formerly a deregulated jurisdiction, has enacted legislation that implemented a hybrid model of cost-based regulation. KU's operations in Virginia have been and remain regulated.

Alternative energy sources such as electricity, oil, propane and other fuels indirectly impact LKE's natural gas revenues. Marketers may also compete to sell natural gas to certain large end-users. LG&E's natural gas tariffs include gas price pass-through mechanisms relating to its sale of natural gas as a commodity; therefore, customer natural gas purchases from alternative suppliers do not generally impact LG&E's profitability. Some large industrial and commercial customers, however, may physically bypass LG&E's facilities and seek delivery service directly from interstate pipelines or other natural gas distribution systems.
Power Supply

At December 31, 2016, LKE owned, controlled or had a minority ownership interest in generating capacity of 8,011 MW, of which 2,916 MW related to LG&E and 5,095 MW related to KU, in Kentucky, Indiana, and Ohio. See "Item 2. Properties - Kentucky Regulated Segment" for a complete list of LKE's generating facilities.

10

The system capacity of LKE's owned or controlled generation is based upon a number of factors, including the operating experience and physical condition of the units, and may be revised periodically to reflect changes in circumstances.

During 2016, LKE's Kentucky power plants generated the following amounts of electricity.

 | GWh 
Fuel Source | LKE | LG&E | | KU
Coal (a) | 28,029 | | 11,722 | | 16,307
Oil / Gas | 6,357 | | 1,463 | | 4,894 
Hydro | 408 | | 321 | | 87 
Total (b) | 34,794 | | 13,506 | | 21,288


(a) | Includes 864 GWh of power generated by and purchased from OVEC for LKE, 598 GWh for LG&E and 266 GWh for KU.


(b) | This generation represents a 0.1% increase for LKE, a 0.6% decrease for LG&E and a 0.4% increase for KU from 2015 output.

The majority of LG&E's and KU's generated electricity was used to supply their retail and KU's municipal customer base.

LG&E and KU jointly dispatch their generation units with the lowest cost generation used to serve their retail and municipal customers. When LG&E has excess generation capacity after serving its own retail customers and its generation cost is lower than that of KU, KU purchases electricity from LG&E and vice versa.

As a result of environmental requirements, KU retired two coal-fired units, with a combined capacity of 161 MW, at the Green River plant in September 2015. LG&E retired a 240 MW coal-fired unit in March 2015 and two additional coal-fired units, with a combined capacity of 323 MW, in June 2015 at the Cane Run plant. KU retired a 71 MW coal-fired unit at the Tyrone plant in 2013. In June 2016, LG&E and KU completed construction activities and placed into commercial operation a 10 MW solar generating facility at the E.W. Brown generating site. 
In 2016, LG&E and KU received approval from the KPSC to develop a 4 MW solar share facility to service a solar share program. The solar share program is an optional, voluntary program that allows customers to subscribe capacity in the solar share facility. Construction is expected to begin, in 500-kilowatt phases, when subscription is complete.
Fuel Supply

Coal continues to be the predominant fuel used by LG&E and KU for generation for the foreseeable future. As a result of Cane Run Unit 7 being placed into operation during 2015, natural gas is also a prominent fuel. The natural gas for this generating unit is purchased using contractual arrangements separate from LG&E's natural gas distribution operations. Natural gas and oil will continue to be used for intermediate and peaking capacity and flame stabilization in coal-fired boilers.

Fuel inventory is maintained at levels estimated to be necessary to avoid operational disruptions at coal-fired generating units. Reliability of coal deliveries can be affected from time to time by a number of factors including fluctuations in demand, coal mine production issues and other supplier or transporter operating difficulties.

LG&E and KU have entered into coal supply agreements with various suppliers for coal deliveries through 2023 and augment their coal supply agreements with spot market purchases, as needed.

For their existing units, LG&E and KU expect for the foreseeable future to purchase most of their coal from western Kentucky, southern Indiana and southern Illinois. LG&E and KU continue to purchase certain quantities of ultra-low sulfur content coal from Wyoming for blending at Trimble County Unit 2. Coal is delivered to the generating plants primarily by barge and rail.

To enhance the reliability of natural gas supply, LG&E and KU have secured firm long-term pipeline transport capacity with contracts of various durations from 2019 to 2024 on the interstate pipeline serving Cane Run Unit 7. This pipeline also serves the six simple cycle combustion turbine units located at the Trimble County site as well as four other simple cycle units at the Cane Run and Paddy's Run sites. LG&E has also secured long-term firm pipeline transport capacity on an interstate pipeline for the summer months through October 2018 to serve an additional simple cycle gas turbine operated under a tolling agreement. For the seven simple cycle combustion turbines at the E.W. Brown facility, no firm long-term pipeline transport capacity has been purchased due to the facility being interconnected to two pipelines and some of the units having dual fuel capability.

LG&E and KU have firm contracts for a portion of the natural gas fuel for Cane Run Unit 7 for delivery in future months. The bulk of the natural gas fuel remains purchased on the spot market. 
11

(PPL, LKE and LG&E)
Natural Gas Distribution Supply

Five underground natural gas storage fields, with a current working natural gas capacity of approximately 15 billion cubic feet (Bcf), are used in providing natural gas service to LG&E's firm sales customers. By using natural gas storage facilities, LG&E avoids the costs typically associated with more expensive pipeline transportation capacity to serve peak winter heating loads. Natural gas is stored during the summer season for withdrawal during the following winter heating season. Without this storage capacity, LG&E would be required to purchase additional natural gas and pipeline transportation services during winter months when customer demand increases and the prices for natural gas supply and transportation services can be expected to be at their highest. At December 31, 2016, LG&E had 12 Bcf of natural gas stored underground with a carrying value of $42 million.
LG&E has a portfolio of supply arrangements of varying durations and terms that provide competitively priced natural gas designed to meet its firm sales obligations. These natural gas supply arrangements include pricing provisions that are market-responsive. In tandem with pipeline transportation services, these natural gas supplies provide the reliability and flexibility necessary to serve LG&E's natural gas customers.

LG&E purchases natural gas supply transportation services from two pipelines. LG&E has contracts with one pipeline that are subject to termination by LG&E between 2018 and 2021. Total winter season capacity under these contracts is 184,900 MMBtu/day and summer season capacity is 60,000 MMBtu/day. With this same pipeline, LG&E also has another contract for pipeline capacity through 2026 in the amount of 60,000 MMBtu/day during both the winter and summer seasons. LG&E has a single contract with a second pipeline with a total capacity of 20,000 MMBtu/day during both the winter and summer seasons that expires in 2018.

LG&E expects to purchase natural gas supplies for its gas distribution operations from onshore producing regions in South Texas, East Texas, North Louisiana and Arkansas, as well as gas originating in the Marcellus and Utica production areas.

(PPL, LKE, LG&E and KU)
Transmission
LG&E and KU contract with the Tennessee Valley Authority to act as their transmission reliability coordinator and contract with TranServ International, Inc. to act as their independent transmission operator.
Rates

LG&E is subject to the jurisdiction of the KPSC and the FERC, and KU is subject to the jurisdiction of the KPSC, the FERC and the VSCC. LG&E and KU operate under a FERC-approved open access transmission tariff.

LG&E's and KU's Kentucky base rates are calculated based on a return on capitalization (common equity, long-term debt and short-term debt) including adjustments for certain net investments and costs recovered separately through other means. As such, LG&E and KU generally earn a return on regulatory assets in Kentucky.
KU's Virginia base rates are calculated based on a return on rate base (net utility plant plus working capital less deferred taxes and miscellaneous deductions). As all regulatory assets and liabilities, except the levelized fuel factor, are excluded from the return on rate base utilized in the calculation of Virginia base rates, no return is earned on the related assets.

KU's rates to 11 municipal customers for wholesale power requirements are calculated based on annual updates to a formula rate that utilizes a return on rate base (net utility plant plus working capital less deferred taxes and miscellaneous deductions). As all regulatory assets and liabilities are excluded from the return on rate base utilized in the development of municipal rates, no return is earned on the related assets. In April 2014, nine municipalities submitted notices of termination, under the notice period provisions, to cease taking power under the wholesale requirements contracts. Such terminations are to be effective in 2019, except in the case of one municipality with a 2017 effective date.
Rate Case
On November 23, 2016, LG&E and KU filed requests with the KPSC for increases in annual base electricity rates of approximately $103 million at KU and an increase in annual base electricity and gas rates of approximately $94 million and $14 million at LG&E. The proposed base rate increases would result in an electricity rate increase of 6.4% at KU and 
12

electricity and gas rate increases of 8.5% and 4.2% at LG&E. New rates are expected to become effective on July 1, 2017. LG&E's and KU's applications include requests for CPCNs for implementing an Advanced Metering System and a Distribution Automation program. The applications are based on a forecasted test year of July 1, 2017 through June 30, 2018 and a requested return on equity of 10.23%. A number of parties have been granted intervention requests in the proceedings. Data discovery and the filing of written testimony will continue through April 2017. A public hearing on the applications is scheduled to commence on May 2, 2017. LG&E and KU cannot predict the outcome of these proceedings.
On October 31, 2016, KU filed a request with the FERC to modify its formula rates to provide for the recovery of CCR impoundment closure costs from its departing municipal customers. On December 30, 2016, the FERC accepted the revised rate schedules providing recovery of the costs effective December 31, 2016, subject to refund, and established limited hearing and settlement judge procedures relating to determining the applicable amortization period.
See Note 6 to the Financial Statements for additional information on cost recovery mechanisms.

• | Pennsylvania Regulated Segment (PPL)

Franchise, Licenses and Other Regulations
PPL Electric is authorized to provide electric public utility service throughout its service area as a result of grants by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania in corporate charters to PPL Electric and companies, which it has succeeded and as a result of certification by the PUC. PPL Electric is granted the right to enter the streets and highways by the Commonwealth subject to certain conditions. In general, such conditions have been met by ordinance, resolution, permit, acquiescence or other action by an appropriate local political subdivision or agency of the Commonwealth.
Competition
Pursuant to authorizations from the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and the PUC, PPL Electric operates a regulated distribution monopoly in its service area. Accordingly, PPL Electric does not face competition in its electricity distribution business. Pursuant to the Customer Choice Act, generation of electricity is a competitive business in Pennsylvania, and PPL Electric does not own or operate any generation facilities.

The PPL Electric transmission business, operating under a FERC-approved PJM Open Access Transmission Tariff, is subject to competition pursuant to FERC Order 1000 from entities that are not incumbent PJM transmission owners with respect to the construction and ownership of transmission facilities within PJM.

Rates and Regulation

Transmission

PPL Electric's transmission facilities are within PJM, which operates the electricity transmission network and electric energy market in the Mid-Atlantic and Midwest regions of the U.S.

PJM serves as a FERC-approved Regional Transmission Operator (RTO) to promote greater participation and competition in the region it serves. In addition to operating the electricity transmission network, PJM also administers regional markets for energy, capacity and ancillary services. A primary objective of any RTO is to separate the operation of, and access to, the transmission grid from market participants that buy or sell electricity in the same markets. Electric utilities continue to own the transmission assets and to receive their share of transmission revenues, but the RTO directs the control and operation of the transmission facilities. Certain types of transmission investment are subject to competitive processes outlined in the PJM tariff.
As a transmission owner, PPL Electric's transmission revenues are recovered through PJM and billed in accordance with a FERC-approved Open Access Transmission Tariff that allows recovery of incurred transmission costs, a return on transmission-related plant and an automatic annual update based on a formula-based rate recovery mechanism. Under this formula, rates are put into effect in June of each year based upon prior year actual expenditures and current year forecasted capital additions. Rates are then adjusted the following year to reflect actual annual expenses and capital additions, as reported in PPL Electric’s annual FERC Form 1, filed under the FERC’s Uniform System of Accounts. Any difference between the revenue requirement in effect for the prior year and actual expenditures incurred for that year is recorded as a regulatory asset or regulatory liability.
As a PLR, PPL Electric also purchases transmission services from PJM. See "PLR" below.

See Note 6 to the Financial Statements for additional information on rate mechanisms.

Distribution

PPL Electric's distribution base rates are calculated based on a return on rate base (net utility plant plus a cash working capital allowance less plant-related deferred taxes and other miscellaneous additions and deductions). All regulatory assets and liabilities are excluded from the return on rate base; therefore, no return is earned on the related assets unless specifically provided for by the PUC. Currently, PPL Electric's Smart Meter rider and the DSIC are the only riders authorized to earn a return. Certain operating expenses are also included in PPL Electric's distribution base rates including wages and benefits, other operation and maintenance expenses, depreciation and taxes.

Pennsylvania's Alternative Energy Portfolio Standard (AEPS) requires electricity distribution companies and electricity generation suppliers to obtain from alternative energy resources a portion of the electricity sold to retail customers in Pennsylvania. Under the default service procurement plans approved by the PUC, PPL Electric purchases all of the alternative energy generation supply it needs to comply with the AEPS.

Act 129 created an energy efficiency and conservation program, a demand side management program, smart metering technology requirements, new PLR generation supply procurement rules, remedies for market misconduct and changes to the existing AEPS.

Act 11 authorizes the PUC to approve two specific ratemaking mechanisms: the use of a fully projected future test year in base rate proceedings and, subject to certain conditions, the use of a DSIC. Such alternative ratemaking procedures and mechanisms provide opportunity for accelerated cost-recovery and, therefore, are important to PPL Electric as it is in a period of significant capital investment to maintain and enhance the reliability of its delivery system, including the replacement of aging assets. PPL Electric has utilized the fully projected future test year mechanism in the 2015 base rate proceeding. PPL has had the ability to utilize the DSIC recovery mechanism since July 2013.

See "Regulatory Matters - Pennsylvania Activities" in Note 6 to the Financial Statements for additional information regarding Act 129 and other legislative and regulatory impacts.

PLR

The Customer Choice Act requires Electric Distribution Companies (EDCs), including PPL Electric, or an alternative supplier approved by the PUC to act as a PLR of electricity supply for customers who do not choose to shop for supply with a competitive supplier and provides that electricity supply costs will be recovered by the PLR pursuant to PUC regulations. In 
14

2016, the following average percentages of PPL Electric's customer load were provided by competitive suppliers: 49% of residential, 86% of small commercial and industrial and 99% of large commercial and industrial customers. The PUC continues to be interested in expanding the competitive market for electricity. See "Regulatory Matters - Pennsylvania Activities - Act 129" in Note 6 to the Financial Statements for additional information.

PPL Electric's cost of electricity generation is based on a competitive solicitation process. The PUC approved PPL Electric's default service plan for the period June 2015 through May 2017, which included 4 solicitations for electricity supply held semiannually in April and October. The PUC approved PPL Electric's default service plan for the period June 2017 through May 2021, which includes a total of 8 solicitations for electricity supply held semiannually in April and October. Pursuant to both the current and future plans, PPL Electric contracts for all of the electricity supply for residential customers and commercial and industrial customers who elect to take that service from PPL Electric. These solicitations include a mix of 6- and 12-month fixed-price load-following contracts for residential and small commercial and industrial customers, and 12-month real-time pricing contracts for large commercial and industrial customers to fulfill PPL Electric's obligation to provide customer electricity supply as a PLR.

Numerous alternative suppliers have offered to provide generation supply in PPL Electric's service territory. Since the cost of generation supply is a pass-through cost for PPL Electric, its financial results are not impacted if its customers purchase electricity supply from these alternative suppliers. 

• | Corporate and Other (PPL)

PPL Services provides PPL subsidiaries with administrative, management and support services. The costs of these services are charged directly to the respective recipients for the services provided or indirectly charged to applicable recipients based on an average of the recipients' relative invested capital, operation and maintenance expenses and number of employees.

PPL Capital Funding, PPL's financing subsidiary, provides financing for the operations of PPL and certain subsidiaries. PPL's growth in rate-regulated businesses provides the organization with an enhanced corporate level financing alternative, through PPL Capital Funding, that enables PPL to cost effectively support targeted credit profiles across all of PPL's rated companies. As a result, PPL plans to utilize PPL Capital Funding as a source of capital in future financings, in addition to continued direct financing by the operating companies.

Unlike PPL Services, PPL Capital Funding's costs are not generally charged to PPL subsidiaries. Costs are charged directly to PPL. However, PPL Capital Funding participated significantly in the financing for the acquisitions of LKE and WPD Midlands and certain associated financing costs were allocated to the Kentucky Regulated and U.K. Regulated segments. The associated financing costs, as well as the financing costs associated with prior issuances of certain other PPL Capital Funding securities, have been assigned to the appropriate segments for purposes of PPL management's assessment of segment performance. The financing costs associated primarily with PPL Capital Funding's securities issuances beginning in 2013, with certain exceptions, have not been directly assigned or allocated to any segment.
