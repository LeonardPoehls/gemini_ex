Item 1.  Business
Reorganization Agreement
 
On September 6, 2016, the Company and BlackRidge Technology Holdings, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("BlackRidge") entered into an Agreement and Plan of Reorganization (the "Reorganization Agreement") originally dated as of September 6, 2016, and amended on February 22, 2017 to update the number of common shares, warrants, and options granted and outstanding as of the closing date.
 
On February 22, 2017 (the "Closing Date"), we completed the actions contemplated by the Reorganization Agreement and merged with and into BlackRidge with BlackRidge continuing as the surviving corporation. Upon completion of the Agreement, we issued 3,783,791 shares of our newly designated Series A Preferred Stock and 12,825,683 shares of Common Stock to the stockholders of BlackRidge in exchange for all the issued and outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock and Common Stock of BlackRidge.  Additionally, certain stockholders of the Company returned for cancellation a total of 16,284,330 shares of our Common Stock.  Upon the completion of the Reorganization, BlackRidge became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company and the Company had a total of 3,783,791 shares of Series A Preferred Stock and 21,790,683 shares of Common Stock outstanding, with the former BlackRidge stockholders owning 3,783,791 shares or 100% of Series A Preferred Stock and 12,825,683 shares or approximately 58.9% of Common Stock.  Upon completion of the Reorganization, we also had outstanding warrants entitling the holders to acquire a total of 18,541,579 shares of the Company's Common Stock at an average exercise price of $0.46 per share.  The Reorganization resulted in a change of control of the Company.  For accounting purposes, BlackRidge will be treated as the acquirer and the historical financial statements of BlackRidge will become the Company's historical financial statements.  The acquisition is intended to constitute a tax-free reorganization pursuant to the applicable provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.
 
At the closing of the Reorganization, Robert Graham was appointed as President, and John Bluher was appointed Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer and Secretary.  In addition, Bruce Crane resigned from his position as a director and Robert Graham was appointed as a director of the Company to fill the vacancy created by such resignation.  John Hofman, our remaining director, resigned from such position effective following our compliance with rule 14f-1 promulgated under the Exchange Act, and John Hayes and Robert Lentz were appointed as directors of the Company effective at such time as Mr. Hofman's resignation became effective.
 
On March 31, 2017, the Company completed the sale of substantially all assets, other than cash, used in or connection with the Company's home grain mill and kitchen mixer business to John Hofman and Bruce Crane, former officers and directors of the Company, in consideration for the assumption by such persons of substantially all the liabilities incurred by the Company in connection with such business.  The assets divested consisted of the non-cybersecurity assets of the Company and included accounts receivable, inventory, deposits, property and equipment and intangible assets.  The liabilities divested included the non-cybersecurity liabilities of the Company and included accounts payable and accrued expenses and long and short-term notes payable and accrued interest thereon.

Due to the change of control and the significant change in the Company's business resulting from the Reorganization, the Company has determined to include in this report information with regard to BlackRidge and the business of BlackRidge.
 
Information about Grote Molen, Inc.
 
General
 
Grote Molen, Inc. was incorporated under the laws of Nevada in March 2004.  We also operate a wholly owned subsidiary by the name of BrownWick, LLC, which was organized as An Idaho Limited Liability Company in June 2005.  Unless otherwise indicated, Grote Molen, Inc. and BrownWick, LLC are referred to collectively herein as "we," "us," or the "Company."
 
We are engaged in the business of distributing our proprietary line of grain mills, known as the "WonderMill," and our kitchen mixer, known as the "WonderMix," for home use.  Our WonderMills are available in electric and manual models and are used to grind wheat, rice and other small grains, but will also grind legumes and beans as large as garbanzos. Our electric WonderMill can mill about 12 cups of flour in 3 minutes and is adjustable to provide a texture ranging from a fine pastry flour to a coarse flour.  Our WonderMix is an electric heavy-duty 3-speed mixer with a large 5.5 quart mixing bowl and a variety of available attachments.  We sell our grain mills on a wholesale basis to retail dealers in all fifty states, in Australia, Canada, the United Kingdom and other foreign countries and to several online retailers.  We sell our kitchen mixer on a wholesale basis to retail dealers in all fifty states and to certain foreign countries supplied by 110-volt electric current.  Our mills and mixers are manufactured to our specifications under contract with manufacturers in India and Korea and we are dependent on such suppliers to provide us with our inventory of products. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in continuing to expand our business or that our sales will not decline in the future.  We believe we will require substantial additional capital in order to expand our business and no assurance can be given that we will be successful in raising such additional capital.
 
Corporate History
 
We were organized under the laws of Nevada on March 15, 2004.  Our wholly owned subsidiary, Brownwick, LLC, was organized under the laws of Idaho on June 5, 2005 and was acquired by us in August 2005 in exchange for shares of our common stock.
Our WonderMill Grinders
 
We are engaged in the business of contract manufacturing and distributing our proprietary line of electric and manual grain mills, known respectively as the "WonderMill" and the "Wonder Junior Hand Grain Mill." The market for our WonderMill grinders consists primarily of home users and small natural foods restaurants desiring to grind their own grains due to the increased nutrients found in freshly ground whole wheat flour as compared to bleached white flour in which the bran and germ are removed prior to grinding.  Our Wonder Junior Hand Grain Mill is also purchased by persons for use as an emergency preparedness device because it can be operated without electricity to grind the whole wheat which is often stored in bulk for emergency situations.  Our WonderMill and Wonder Junior Hand Grain Mill both contain stainless steel blades and self cleaning milling chambers.  Our WonderMills and Wonder Junior Hand Grain Mills are sold with limited lifetime warranties and warranty work is performed at our service center in Pocatello, Idaho or at our authorized service locations in Australia, Canada and the United Kingdom.
 
We believe our electric WonderMill is one of the quietest and fastest electric flourmills available.  It may be used to grind wheat, rice and other small grains at temperatures that preserve nutrients, but will also grind legumes and beans as large as garbanzos. The WonderMill is adjustable to provide a texture ranging from fine pastry flour to coarse flour. Our electric WonderMill has a relatively large capacity and a 1250-watt motor that enables it to grind approximately 100 pounds of flour in one hour.  The electric WonderMill has also been designed to be easy to use. The user simply fills the hopper, selects the grinding setting, turns it on and it begins to grind the grain. There are no small parts or gaskets to misplace, and cleaning the WonderMill is quick, easy and almost dust free. The list price for our electric WonderMill is $259.95.

We believe our Wonder Junior Hand Grain Mill is a high quality and versatile hand mill. The Wonder Junior will grind wheat, rice and other small grains and will also grind legumes and beans as large as garbanzos. It can be adjusted to create very fine flour or coarse cracked grains for cereals. By swapping the stone heads for the stainless steel burr heads a user can also make peanut butter or other nut butters, can grind flax or any other oily or wet grain, and can grind herbs and spices, soybeans, and legumes. The whole Wonder Junior mill is powder-coated making it safe to wash for easy clean up. The hopper is large and holds over one quart. The octagon shape of the hopper makes it easy to fill. And because the Wonder Junior is one-piece construction the user does not need to worry about the hopper coming off during milling like some other hand grain mill models. The Wonder Junior also contains a heavy-duty patented double clamp that attaches to tables or counters up to two inches thick.  The Wonder Junior Hand Grain Mill uses large lifetime lubricated bearings and has a heavy base that can be bolted to any table or counter if desired.  We believe the stone heads on the Wonder Junior are approximately one-third thicker than most of the competing manual grain mills that are designed to result in a smoother operation. In seconds, the high-quality stainless steel burr heads can be put on the Wonder Junior for milling wet or oily grains.  The Wonder Junior is also easy to use. The user simply loads the easy-fill hopper, turns the handle, and it begins to grind flour or other grains. The list price for the Wonder Junior Hand Grain Mill is $239.95.
 
Our WonderMix Kitchen Mixer
 
In early 2015 we introduced our newest product, a kitchen mixer known as the "WonderMix."  The WonderMix is a heavy-duty, 3-speed mixer with a large 5.5 quart mixing bowl and available cookie whip, blender, slicer shredder, meat grinder, grain flaker and grain mill attachments. It includes a heavy duty Tru-Mix dough hook for mixing up to 6 loaves of bread. The WonderMix is powered by a large, 900-Watt motor and a high torque direct drive transmission and is backed by a 3-year warranty.  It is BPA (bisphenol A) free, has a safety bowl locking mechanism, overload protection and a cord storage compartment.  We believe the market for our WonderMix mixer will be substantially identical to the market for our WonderMill grinders and will consist primarily of home users and small natural foods restaurants.  The WonderMix is a 110-volt appliance is not available in Europe or other countries supplied by 220-volt electricity. The list price for our WonderMix kitchen mixer is $299.95.
 
Manufacturing
 
Our mills and mixers are manufactured to our specifications under contract with a manufacturer in India for our Wonder Junior Hand Grain Mill and in Korea for our electric WonderMill and our WonderMix and we are dependent on such suppliers to provide us with our inventory of products.  Such manufacturers manufacture our products pursuant to purchase orders provided by us from time to time and then drop ship the products to our warehouse in Pocatello, Idaho and to our authorized resellers in Australia and the United Kingdom.  We typically order a minimum of 1,000 products in each purchase order and we attempt to maintain an inventory of 1,000 products in our warehouse.  We submit payment with our purchase orders and we submit our purchase orders based on sales projections that take into account the prior year's sales, sales in the current year, general economic conditions and other factors.  The lead-time between submission of a purchase order and delivery of finished products is approximately 60 days for our electric WonderMill and WonderMix and approximately 90 days for our Wonder Junior Hand Grain Mill.  If we should underestimate sales and fail to timely submit purchase orders for new products, we could face delays in providing our products to dealers and their customers, which could have a negative effect on our reputation and result in a decline in our product sales.  If we should overestimate sales, we will have invested our capital in products that remain in our warehouse or in the facilities of our authorized resellers, which will have a negative effect on our financial condition and results of operations.  No assurances can be given that we will be able to accurately predict sales so as to maintain an optimal level of inventory in our system.
 
Our products are assembled using parts that we believe to be readily available from several sources and we believe the assembly process could be performed by a number of different manufacturers in India and Asia.  However, we are dependent on our current manufacturers to provide timely deliveries of quality parts and products in order to meet customer demand for the timely delivery of our products.  Furthermore, the ability of our manufacturers and their suppliers to timely deliver raw materials, parts and finished goods may be affected by events beyond their control, such as the inability of shippers to timely deliver merchandise due to work stoppages or slowdowns, or significant weather and health conditions (such as SARS) affecting manufacturers and/or shippers.  Any adverse change in such things as our relationship with our third party manufacturers, the financial condition of such manufacturers, our ability to import our products from such manufacturers and their ability to manufacture and deliver our products on a timely basis could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.  No assurance can be given that we could quickly or effectively replace any of our manufacturers if the need arose, and we cannot assure you that we could retrieve tooling and molds possessed by either of our manufacturers.  Our dependence on these two manufacturers could also adversely affect our ability to react quickly and effectively to changes in the market for our products.  The use of international manufacturers also subjects us to several significant risks that are beyond our control and the control of our manufacturers including, among other things, labor unrest, social, political and economic instability, restrictions on transfers of funds, domestic and international customs and tariffs, unexpected changes in regulatory environments and potentially adverse tax consequences.

Labor in India and Korea has historically been readily available at relatively low cost as compared to labor costs in North America.  However, both countries have experienced rapid social, political and economic changes in recent years. We cannot assure you that labor will continue to be available to us in India or Korea at costs consistent with historical levels or that changes in labor or other laws will not be enacted which would have a material adverse effect on our operations in such countries.  A substantial increase in labor costs in India or Korea could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
 
Marketing and Sales
 
We sell our grain mills on a wholesale basis to retail dealers in all fifty states, in Australia, Canada, the United Kingdom and other foreign countries and to several online retailers.  We sell our kitchen mixer on a wholesale basis to retail dealers in all fifty states and to certain foreign countries supplied by 110-volt electric current.  We maintain websites at www.thewondermill.com and www.wondermix.com that include information about our products, video demonstrations, dealer locator information, customer reviews, recipes for use with WonderMill and WonderMix products, information with regard to grain varieties and where to purchase them, customer support and repair forms and information on how to become a dealer.  John Hofman and Bruce Crane, our former officers, directors and principal stockholders, each own retail stores that purchase our WonderMill grain mills from us on the same terms as other retailers.  Sales to these related parties for our 2016 and 2015 fiscal years were $43,664 and $81,062 respectively, which amounted to approximately 4% and  5%, respectively, of our total sales each year.  In addition, we have one other customer that accounted for approximately 10% and 7% of our total sales during the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  The loss of any of these major customers would be expected to have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.
 
We incur advertising costs of a non-direct nature due in connection with advertising on our website and to our authorized dealers.  During our fiscal years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, our advertising costs were $68,431 and $58,894, respectively.
 
Intellectual Property
 
We hold a patent on our Wonder Junior Hand Grain Mill and we hold trademarks on the design of the electric WonderMill and the name "WonderMill."  We also hold a copyright on the Wonder Junior Hand Grain Mill.  However, no assurance can be given that this patent and these trademarks will provide sufficient protection against potential competitors and we may be unable to successfully assert our intellectual property rights or these rights may be invalidated, circumvented or challenged.  Any such inability, particularly with respect to our product names, or a successful intellectual property challenge or infringement proceeding against us, could have a material adverse effect on our business.
 
During 2012, we purchased from a German manufacturer a license to the design and manufacture of its home kitchen mixer.  We recently completed the molds and the design process to allow us to produce the WonderMix and introduced it to market in 2015.  During the fourth quarter of 2014, we completed the contract manufacturing of our first shipment of the WonderMix.  Because of its late completion in the prime sales season, we were unable to introduce the WonderMix in 2014.  However, the response has been good by our dealers, and we experienced a successful introduction to market in 2015.
 
Although we have purchased the license and now manufacture under contract the WonderMix, no assurance can be given that we will be successful in the marketing of the grain mill or that the license will provide sufficient protection against potential competitors.  Further, we may be unable to successfully assert our intellectual property rights or these rights may be invalidated, circumvented or challenged.

This office consists of 200 square feet of office space and is leased from a third party pursuant to a twelve-month operating lease that renews annually.  The rent for the facility is a flat monthly amount of $400 and the lease is renewable annually at the option of BlackRidge.
 
Grote Molen's offices are at 322 West Griffith Road, Pocatello, Idaho 83201, where our telephone number is (208) 234-9352.  Our facilities consist of approximately 3,000 square feet of warehouse and office space located in a building owned by Big John's Store LLC, a company owned by John Hofman, our president, director and principal stockholder, which is shared with Big John's, a retail store owned by Mr. Hofman.  Such space is provided to us under an Idaho Management Agreement with Big John's Store LLC pursuant to which we pay a flat rate of $12,500 per month for management services and the use of such space.  Such agreement is on a month-to-month basis.
 
Competition
 
The home grain grinding and kitchen mixer industry is intensely competitive with respect to price, quality, features and durability and it is often difficult to entice customers to try a new product.  There are also many well-established competitors with substantially greater financial and other resources than the Company.  Such competitors include a large number of national and regional companies and most of our competitors have been in existence for a substantially longer period than have we and are better established.  We believe our primary competitors are Blendtec, which produces the Blendtec Grain Mill, Nutrimill, which produces the Nutrimill Wheat Grinder, Country Living, which produces the Country Living Grain Mill, and Chris Enterprises, which produces the Family Grain Mill.  Also, in the kitchen mixer market, we compete with Kitchenaid and Bosch.  Almost all of such competitors are more established and have more experience and financial and human resources than do we.  As such, there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete effectively in our chosen market.  In addition, a change in the pricing, marketing or promotional strategies or product mix of one or more of these competitors could have a material adverse impact on our sales and earnings.
Government Regulation
 
Our operations are subject to numerous Federal, state and local government regulations, including those relating to the manufacture and distribution of electric and food preparation equipment and the importation of manufactured products from foreign countries.  Our electric WonderMills meet the applicable requirements of Underwriters Laboratories (UL), Canadian Standards Association (CSA), and have received CE mark approval in Europe. Our WonderMix meets the applicable requirements of Underwriters Laboratories and may only be sold by us in countries supplied by 110 volt electric current.  The failure to comply with such requirements or increase in the cost of compliance could adversely affect our operations.  Our company is subject to licensing and regulation by a number of governmental authorities, which include health, safety, sanitation, building and fire agencies in Idaho. We are also subject to Federal and state environmental regulations, but these have not had a material effect on our operations to date.  Our operations are also subject to Federal and state laws governing such matters as wages, working conditions, citizenship requirements and overtime.
Employees and Consultants
 
We currently have two employees, both of whom are officers and directors of the Company.  None of our employees are represented by a labor union and we believe our relationship with our employees to be good.  The loss of our officers, particularly our president, would have a material adverse impact on our business and there is no assurance that we could locate qualified replacements.  We have not entered into employment agreements with our officers and we do not carry "key man" life insurance on their lives.

Business
 
BlackRidge develops, markets and supports a family of products that provide a next generation cyber security solution for protecting enterprise networks and cloud services. With our patented technology, network and server resources located in the enterprise, datacenters and cloud systems, are better protected, less expensive to protect, and less vulnerable to compromise from cyber-attacks. We believe that our identity-based approach to network and cloud security offers superior performance compared to legacy network security approaches, and reduces the total cost of ownership for organizations by eliminating malicious and unwanted traffic from their networks and systems.
 
Our proprietary technology, BlackRidge Transport Access Control (TAC), authenticates user or device identity and applies security policies across networks and cloud services before application sessions are established. Underlying BlackRidge TAC is our patented First Packet Authentication™ which conveys and authenticates identity in the "first packet" of a TCP network session request. This fundamental invention addresses a security gap in how the Internet operates: the inability to authenticate network traffic sources. Without authentication, unidentified and unauthorized users and devices can scan, probe and access networks and cloud services. This security gap is exploited in all cyber-attacks through the process of network scanning and reconnaissance, and it has been further exposed and magnified by cloud services, mobile connectivity, and the Internet of Things (IoT)
 
BlackRidge products are protected by multiple U.S. Patents including "First Packet Authentication," "Concealing a Network Connected Device," "Digital Identity Authentication," and "Statistical Object Identification."
 
Products
 
BlackRidge and our partners sell network security products and solutions based on our proprietary BlackRidge TAC software technology. BlackRidge TAC provides high throughput and low latency network security that operates pre-session, in real time, before other security defenses engage. BlackRidge products can be deployed inside a network to cloak and protect servers and segment networks, in front of existing security stacks to filter anonymous traffic, or as part of service provider or OEM solution.

Markets, Customers and Distribution Channels
 
The BlackRidge network security and cyber defense solution is broadly applicable to all enterprise and government market segments.  Whether deployed directly in a customer's environment or consumed as part of cloud service or solution, BlackRidge provides a new level of cyber defense not available in the market today.
 
BlackRidge markets and sells its products through multiple channels, including direct sales, integrator and reseller channel partners, cloud and managed service providers, and through strategic Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) partners to government and commercial users. The initial sales focus and market entry strategy for BlackRidge was the US Department of Defense, which is a key leverage point for the company's current commercial and government sales efforts. Our customers and partners include IBM, Ciena, Crimson Logic, the US Department of Defense, the US Department of Energy, Marist College, Splunk, and some large financial institutions.
 
For commercial markets, BlackRidge sells direct and also with strategic partners to large enterprise accounts, and indirectly through channel partners to specific vertical and international market segments. Our initial commercial market entry strategy is to sell directly to and establish customer and analyst references with large enterprises in North America that have high security and compliance requirements such as Financial Services and Insurance companies. Channel partners are recruited to assist with expanding enterprise sales, addressing specific vertical markets, and for selling and delivering in international markets and other vertical markets. Revenue from commercial sales includes product licensing fees, installation services, and annual support based on a standard price list.

For government markets, BlackRidge sells its standard commercial products through a wholly owned subsidiary, BlackRidge Technology Government, to government integrators and contractors who sell to the Department of Defense (DOD) and civilian agencies. BlackRidge has been involved with the DOD for over five years, including receiving initial product development funding. The BlackRidge products have been designed into several large DOD programs and they have been extensively tested and validated for use. The timing of the DOD adoption of BlackRidge products depends on approval of budgets and final product testing approvals from the DOD. BlackRidge Government revenue is net of government discounts, contracting fees, and channel and service partner discounts.
 
The BlackRidge OEM and service provider partnership strategy is to make targeted investments in specific market segments such as the industrial Internet of Things (IoT), network and server equipment providers, and cloud solution providers. For these markets and partners, BlackRidge TAC is an integrated or embedded capability in the partners' vertical market solutions, and it will be sold and supported by the partner. BlackRidge provides unique, integrated identity-based cyber defense for these OEM products or service offerings that provides them with a competitive market advantage in the face of today's advanced cyber threats. Revenue from OEM offerings comes from embedded product licensing fees and support fees that may be unique to each OEM offering.
 
Marketing
 Our marketing is focused on building our brand reputation and market awareness for our platform, driving customer demand and building a strong sales pipeline, and working with our channel and OEM partners. Our marketing team when fully developed will consist of corporate marketing, channel marketing, lead development, operations, and corporate communications. Marketing activities include demand generation, digital marketing programs, product launch activities, managing our corporate website, trade shows and conferences, and press and analyst relations.
Research and Development
 
We continue to enhance our BlackRidge TAC software, the core software used in the BlackRidge products. This software is responsible for the TAC token generation, token validation, the token cache, packet processing and the insertion of TAC tokens into TCP connection requests. The TAC software has been developed domestically within the U.S. using only U.S. citizens. This software includes implementations of granted and pending patents owned by BlackRidge.
 
We continue to pursue research and development to improve our existing products. These improvements include making our products easier to manage, easier to deploy in large numbers, and improvements in our integrations with 3rd party products that communicate with BlackRidge products.
 
Our product development efforts release software with new features from time to time.  When a new feature is significant enough, we produce a major software release.  In between major software releases, there may be one or more minor software releases that also introduce less significant new features.
 
Intellectual Property
 
BlackRidge focuses on developing patent protection for products it develops and for products and features that are anticipated. We constantly perfect and file new applications.  We continue to develop our products; we will continue to file additional patent applications where appropriate.

Competition
 
BlackRidge TAC operates at the Transport Layer to provide a highly scalable, non-interactive authentication protocol that does not rely on signatures, sandboxing, or deep packet inspection. This provides key competitive differentiators including high through-put with very low latency, compatibility with existing network and security technologies and middle boxes, address and topology independent, and supports it network address translation (NAT).
 
We compete with other technology research and development, and sales companies for enterprise security spending and for financing from a limited number of investors that are prepared to invest in such companies. The presence of competing companies in our field of endeavor may impact our ability to raise additional capital to fund our operations or further acquisitions, if investors perceive that investments in our competitors are more attractive based on the merit of their technologies, or the advanced stage of marketing or development or the price of the investment opportunity. We face competition from many companies, major universities and research institutions in the United States and abroad. Many of our competitors have substantially greater resources, experience in conducting research, experience in obtaining regulatory approvals for their products, operating experience, research and development and marketing capabilities, name recognition and production capabilities. We will face competition from companies marketing existing products or developing new products which may render our technologies (and products) obsolete.
 These companies may have numerous competitive advantages, including:
  10
 


· | significantly greater name recognition; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | established distribution networks; 
· | more advanced technologies and product development; 
· | additional lines of products, and the ability to offer rebates, higher discounts or incentives; and 
· | greater experience in conducting research and development, manufacturing, obtaining regulatory approval for products

 
Our commercial success will depend on our ability to compete effectively in product development areas such as, but not limited to, safety, price, marketing and distribution. There can be no assurance that competitors will not succeed in developing products that are more effective than our cyber security technology, therefore rendering our products obsolete and noncompetitive.  Accordingly, in addition to our research and development efforts, we believe we need to create a public relations/advertising program designed to establish our "brand" name recognition; we intend to continue to develop and market our brand name pending commercialization of products, if any, we may derive from our research and development efforts.
 
We believe our strategy ultimately will facilitate the marketing, distribution and public acceptance of any products we may derive from our research and development.  Competition with respect to our technologies is and will be based, among other things, on effectiveness, latency, reliability, availability, price, marketing, distribution and patent position. Another important factor will be the timing of market introduction of any new versions of the software or development of new products and cyber security solutions new markets such as the Internet of Things ("IoT").
 
Accordingly, the speed with which we can distribute and sell products and the speed to market with new or updated versions of the existing software, complete testing and proof of concept processes and ultimately supply commercial quantities of our products to the market and channels is expected to be an important competitive factor.
 
Our competitive position will also depend upon our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel, to obtain patent protection or otherwise develop proprietary products or processes, and to secure sufficient capital resources for the often-substantial period between technological conception and commercial sales.
