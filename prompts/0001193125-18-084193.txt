--------+-------------------------

Overview 
 We are a specialty pharmaceutical company with a focus in the areas of pain management and addiction medicine. We have built a portfolio of products utilizing our novel and proprietary BioErodible MucoAdhesive (or BEMA®) drug delivery technology, a small, erodible polymer film for application to the buccal mucosa (the lining inside the cheek), which we currently commercialize in the U.S. utilizing our own sales force while working in partnership with third parties to commercialize our products outside the U.S. We were incorporated in the State of Indiana in 1997 and were reincorporated as a Delaware corporation in 2002. 
 BELBUCA® (buprenorphine) buccal film incorporates buprenorphine in our BEMA technology and was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on October 26, 2015, for the management of pain severe enough to require daily, around the clock, long-term opioid treatment for which alternative treatment options are inadequate. BELBUCA® is designated by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) as a Schedule III product, meaning it has less abuse and addiction potential compared to Schedule II products such as morphine, oxycodone and hydrocodone. BELBUCA® is also commercially available in Canada following market authorization from Health Canada in June 2017 and our subsequent exclusive agreement with Purdue Pharma (Canada) in July 2017 for the licensing and distribution rights of BELBUCA® in Canada. 
 Along with BELBUCA®, we utilize our sales force to commercialize BUNAVAIL® (buprenorphine and naloxone) buccal film, which was approved by the FDA on June 6, 2014. BUNAVAIL® utilizes our BEMA technology to deliver higher doses of buprenorphine along with the abuse deterrent, naloxone, for the treatment of opioid dependence and as part of a complete treatment plan to include counseling and psychosocial support. 
 Our third approved product, ONSOLIS® (fentanyl buccal soluble film), is currently marketed outside the U.S. through partnerships, and we are currently assessing strategic options for the reintroduction of ONSOLIS® to the U.S. market following the termination during 2017 of a licensing agreement with Collegium Pharmaceutical, Inc. (or Collegium). 
 As part of our corporate growth strategy, we have licensed, and will continue to explore opportunities to acquire or license additional drug delivery technologies or drugs utilizing the delivery or other technologies of other companies. As we gain access to such drugs and technologies, we will seek to utilize our development and commercialization experience to, either by ourselves or through partnerships, navigate the resulting products through the regulatory review process and ultimately bring them to the marketplace. 
 Our clinical and regulatory development strategy has focused primarily on our ability to utilize the FDAs 505(b)(2) approval process to obtain more timely and efficient approval of new formulations of previously approved, active therapeutics incorporated into our drug delivery technology. Because the 505(b)(2) approval process is designed to address new formulations of previously approved drugs, we believe it has the potential to be more cost efficient and expeditious and have less regulatory approval risk than other FDA approval approaches. 
 An overview of our approved products and key products in development is set out below: 
 BELBUCA® (buprenorphine) buccal film for Chronic Pain 
 BELBUCA® is a partial mu-opioid agonist and a treatment indicated for the management of pain severe enough to require daily, around the clock, long-term opioid treatment for which alternative treatment options are inadequate. As described further below, our former commercial partner, Endo Pharmaceuticals Inc. (or Endo), received approval of the New Drug Application (or NDA) for BELBUCA® on October 23, 2015. 
 In January 2012, we announced the signing of a worldwide licensing and development agreement for BELBUCA® (which we refer to herein as the Endo Agreement) with Endo under which we granted to Endo the exclusive, worldwide rights to develop and commercialize BELBUCA® for the treatment of chronic pain. The financial terms of our agreement with Endo included: (i) a $30 million upfront, non-refundable license fee, which we received in January 2012; (ii) $95 million in milestone payments based on achievement of pre-defined intellectual property, clinical development and regulatory events (which we have received following receipt of a $50 million milestone payment associated with the FDA approval of BELBUCA®); (iii) $55 million in potential sales threshold payments upon achievement of designated sales levels; and (iv) a tiered, mid- to upper-teen royalty on net sales of BELBUCA® in the United States and a mid- to high-single digit royalty on net sales of BELBUCA® outside the United States.

On January 23, 2014, we announced with Endo positive top-line results from the Phase 3 efficacy study of BELBUCA® in opioid-naïve subjects. The trial successfully met its primary efficacy endpoint in demonstrating that BELBUCA® resulted in significantly (p=0.0012) improved chronic pain relief compared to placebo. Additional secondary endpoints were supportive of the efficacy of BELBUCA® compared to placebo. The most commonly reported adverse events in patients treated with BELBUCA® compared to placebo during the double-blind portion of the study were nausea (10% vs. 7%, respectively), vomiting (4% vs. <1%, respectively) and constipation (4% vs. 3%, respectively). The locking of the database for the opioid naïve study triggered a $10 million milestone payment from Endo per the terms of the license agreement, which we received in February 2014. 
 On July 7, 2014, we announced with Endo positive top-line results from the Phase 3 efficacy study of BELBUCA® in opioid-experienced subjects. The trial successfully met its primary efficacy endpoint in demonstrating that BELBUCA® resulted in significantly (p<0.00001) improved chronic pain relief compared to placebo. Additional secondary endpoints were supportive of the efficacy of BELBUCA® compared to placebo. The most commonly reported adverse events in patients treated with BELBUCA® compared to placebo were nausea (7% vs. 7%, respectively), vomiting (5% vs. 2%, respectively) and constipation (3% vs. 1%, respectively). Locking of the database for the opioid experienced study triggered an additional $10 million milestone payment from Endo per the terms of the license agreement, which we received in July 2014. 
 On December 23, 2014, we and Endo announced the NDA submission for BELBUCA®, which was accepted by FDA in February 2015. Acceptance of the filing of the NDA by FDA triggered and we received an additional $10 million milestone payment from Endo which we subsequently received. 
 On October 26, 2015, we and Endo announced the FDA approval of BELBUCA® for use in patients with chronic pain severe enough to require daily, around-the-clock, long-term opioid treatment and for which alternative treatment options are inadequate. The approval of BELBUCA® was based on the two double-blind, placebo-controlled, enriched-enrollment Phase 3 studies. A total of 1,559 opioid experienced (study BUP-307) and opioid naïve (BUP-308) patients received study drug. In both studies, BELBUCA® demonstrated a consistent, statistically significant improvement in patient-reported pain relief at every week from baseline to week 12, compared to placebo. BELBUCA® is available in seven dose strengths, allowing for flexible dosing ranging from 75 mcg to 900 mcg every 12 hours. This enables physicians to individualize titration and treatment based on the optimally effective and tolerable dose for each patient. The FDAs approval of BELBUCA® triggered a milestone payment to us from Endo of $50 million, of which $20 million had been deferred for future revenue recognition but was recognized as revenue in January 2017 upon termination of our agreement with Endo. (See below for Endo Termination). 
 BELBUCA® became commercially available from Endo in February 2016. Endo reported favorable early healthcare provider feedback and positive patient experience with regard to efficacy, tolerability and the buccal film formulation. Endo also filed a submission for BELBUCA® with Health Canada in the second quarter of 2016. 
 On December 8, 2016, we announced an agreement with Endo terminating Endos licensing of rights for BELBUCA®. This announcement followed a strategic decision made by Endo to discontinue commercial efforts of its branded pain business. On January 6, 2017, we announced the closing of the transaction to reacquire the license to BELBUCA® from Endo. As a result, the worldwide rights to BELBUCA® were transferred back to us. Going forward, we will not be responsible for future royalties or milestone payments to Endo, and Endo will not be obligated to any future milestone payments to us. 
 Behind a revised commercialized plan that took into consideration the current climate for prescribing opioids for chronic pain, we initially leveraged our existing sales force to capitalize on commercial synergies with BUNAVAIL® for a focused commercial approach targeting identified healthcare providers which we believe creates the potential to incrementally grow BELBUCA® sales without the requirement of significant resources. In mid-January 2017, we completed the expansion and training of our sales force, allowing for promotion of BELBUCA® to commence in late January. As a Schedule III opioid (meaning that buprenorphine, the active ingredient in BELBUCA®, has less abuse and addiction potential compared to Schedule II opioids such as oxycodone, hydrocodone and morphine), BELBUCA® is differentiated from other opioids and has the potential to address some of the most critical issues facing healthcare providers treating chronic pain with prescription opioids  abuse, misuse, addiction and the risk of overdose. These elements are at the center of the opioid crisis in our country and led to the 2017 declaration by the President of a Public Health Emergency. We are working with health care providers as well as various government agencies to provide education on buprenorphine and these key differences. As part of these efforts, we participated in a round table meeting convened in Washington D.C. by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (or HHS) in October 2017 with nine other manufacturers to discuss efforts to advance pain management therapies and the treatment of opioid use disorder in response to the opioid crisis. The meeting provided an opportunity for us to share the work we are doing to use our innovative drug delivery technology and products and make available alternative formulations of buprenorphine based on knowledge that it provides an effective, Schedule III alternative to other more addictive opioids. Based on this and other meetings we will continue to have with government policy makers, we are optimistic about the future role of buprenorphine for chronic pain management.

BELBUCA® total prescriptions in 2017, according to Symphony Health, totaled nearly 86,000, an increase of 84% over 2016. BELBUCA share of total buprenorphine prescriptions (products for the treatment of chronic pain only) for 2017 totaled 12% versus 7% for the prior year. In addition to a steady increase in BELBUCA prescription sales through 2017, there was also an increase in the use of higher doses of BELBUCA as healthcare providers became more comfortable with the use of BELBUCA and awareness of the full range of doses increased. In 2016, 19% of BELBUCA prescriptions were for doses of 450 mcg or greater, compared to 33% in 2017. As such, the average price per prescription increased. 
 In June 2017, we announced the approval of BELBUCA® by Health Canada and in July our exclusive agreement with Purdue Pharma (Canada) for the licensing, distribution, marketing and sale of BELBUCA® in Canada. According to the Canadian Pain Society, pain is the most common reason for seeking healthcare, with 1 in 5 Canadian adults suffering from chronic pain. We view Purdue as a strong partner for BELBUCA® in Canada given its long history and commitment to pain management as well as its expertise and strong presence in the Canadian pain market. In return for the licensing and distribution rights to BELBUCA® in Canada, BioDelivery Sciences is eligible to receive upfront and potential milestones of up to $4.5 million CAD as well as royalties on net sales. On January 30, 2018, we along with Purdue announced the launch and commercial availability of BELBUCA in Canada. 
 Additionally, to capitalize on the commercial opportunity for BELBUCA, we increased the size of our sales force in early 2018 from 65 to 85 sales representatives. This increase allows us to reach additional high potential targets that were not covered previously, as well as improve our ability to optimize our reach and frequency among existing targets. 
 BUNAVAIL® (buprenorphine and naloxone) buccal film 
 We believe that the widespread use of buprenorphine for the treatment of opioid dependence and the need for improved means of delivery to address existing administration challenges present an important commercial opportunity. Therefore, we developed a BEMA® formulation of buprenorphine and naloxone specifically for the treatment of opioid dependence. The product combines a high dose of buprenorphine along with an abuse deterrent agent, naloxone. BUNAVAIL® provides us with an opportunity to compete in the growing opioid dependence market which, according to Symphony Health, exceeded $2.5 billion in sales in the U.S in 2017, an increase of 14% over the prior year. 
 In September 2012, we announced the positive outcome of the pivotal pharmacokinetic study comparing BUNAVAIL® to Suboxone® sublingual tablets. The study was designed to compare the relative bioavailability of buprenorphine and naloxone between BUNAVAIL® and the reference product, Suboxone® tablets. The results demonstrated that the two key pharmacokinetic parameters, maximum drug plasma concentration (Cmax) and total drug exposure (AUC), for buprenorphine were comparable to Suboxone® sublingual tablet, and that the same parameters for naloxone were similar or less than Suboxone® tablet. This was followed by initiation of the safety study requested by the FDA, assessing the safety and tolerability of BUNAVAIL® in patients converted from a stable dose of Suboxone® (buprenorphine and naloxone) sublingual tablets or films. A total of 249 patients were enrolled in the study, (191 patients completed) which completed in December 2012. Results of the study showed a very favorable safety and tolerability profile along with strong study subject retention and high dose form acceptability ratings. Data showed that over 91% of patients who switched from Suboxone® film or tablets considered the taste of BUNAVAIL® to be very pleasant, pleasant or neutral and over 82% rated the ease of use of BUNAVAIL® as very easy, easy or neutral. The study also showed a decrease in the incidence of constipation symptoms from 41% at baseline, before conversion of patients from Suboxone tablets or films to BUNAVAIL®, to 13% following 12 weeks of treatment with BUNAVAIL®. 
 On July 31, 2013, we submitted the NDA for BUNAVAIL® to the FDA for review, and On June 6, 2014, we announced the FDA approval of BUNAVAIL® for the maintenance treatment of opioid dependence as part of a complete treatment plan to include counseling and psychosocial support. 
 Following thorough review and analysis of a variety of commercialization strategies, which included entertaining commercial partnerships, a decision was made to commercialize BUNAVAIL® utilizing both internal and external resources. 
 On November 3, 2014, we announced the availability of BUNAVAIL® in the U.S. During the year ended 2015, we recognized $4.2 million in BUNAVAIL® sales revenue in its first full year on the market. In 2016, we took several steps to grow sales and profitability of the product including consolidating the sales force to focus on our most productive territories and executing additional managed care contracts. Six such agreements were secured between July and November 2016. BUNAVAIL® sales in 2016 were $8.3 million, representing a 98% increase from the previous year. 
 In May 2017, we announced that the FDA had approved a Supplemental New Drug Application (known as an sNDA) for BUNAVAIL revising the indication to include the initiation of buprenorphine treatment for opioid dependence. The approval broadened the indication for BUNAVAIL to include induction, or the initial process undertaken when a patient is transitioned from the abused opioid responsible for their addiction to the dose of BUNAVAIL which is intended to provide relief from cravings and withdrawal.

As a result of the reacquisition of BELBUCA® in January 2017 and its market opportunity, our field sales force focus was shifted primarily to BELBUCA®, with BUNAVAIL® efforts limited to existing BUNAVAIL® prescribers and support behind existing BUNAVAIL managed care contracts. Following the transition of our sales force focus to BELBUCA®, total prescriptions of BUNAVAIL® in 2017 declined 20% over the prior year and subsequently leveled off as the year progressed. Given the significantly lower margins associated with BUNAVAIL, we continue to place our primary commercial efforts behind the continued growth of BELBUCA going into 2018. However, we continue to believe opportunity remains for BUNAVAIL growth as efforts to improve access to all treatment options for opioid dependence continues to gain support and government legislation has allowed for an increase in the number of patients that a physician can treat with buprenorphine. In November 2016, HHS also announced that nurse practitioners and physician assistants could begin taking the required training to prescribe buprenorphine for opioid use disorder and that those nurse practitioners and physician assistants who completed the required training could seek a waiver to begin prescribing buprenorphine beginning in early 2017, which further improved access to treatment. 
 ONSOLIS® (fentanyl buccal soluble film) 
 On July 16, 2009, we announced the U.S. approval of our first product, ONSOLIS® (fentanyl buccal soluble film). ONSOLIS® is indicated for the treatment of breakthrough pain (i.e., pain that breaks through the effects of other medications being used to control persistent pain) in opioid tolerant patients with cancer. In May 2010, regulatory approvals were granted for Canada, and in October 2010, approval was obtained in the European Union (which we refer to herein as E.U.) through the E.U.s Decentralized Procedure, with Germany acting as the reference member state. ONSOLIS® is marketed in Europe under the trade-name BREAKYL. 
 The FDA approval of ONSOLIS®, together with our satisfactory preparation of launch supplies of ONSOLIS®, triggered the payment to us by our commercial partner, Meda AB, a leading international specialty pharmaceutical company based in Sweden that was acquired by Mylan N.V. in 2016 (which we refer to herein as Meda), of approval milestones aggregating $26.8 million. The first national approval of BREAKYL in the E.U. resulted in a milestone payment of $2.5 million from Meda. A second milestone payment of $2.5 million was subsequently realized at the time of first commercial sale in the E.U. in October 2012. We began receiving royalties from Meda on net sales of ONSOLIS® in the U.S. following launch and from BREAKYL following launch in the E.U. Our royalty revenue from this product remains below original projections due to certain regulatory conditions in the U.S., which are discussed below. 
 We granted commercialization and distribution rights for ONSOLIS® on a worldwide basis (except in South Korea and Taiwan) to Meda. Meda secured access to additional markets through acquisition of European businesses from Valeant Pharmaceuticals International, Inc. 
 In 2010, we licensed commercialization rights for ONSOLIS® for the remaining worldwide territories through execution of licensing agreements with KUNWHA Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. (or Kunwha), for South Korea and TTY Biopharm Co., Ltd. (or TTY) for Taiwan where the product is marketed as PAINKYL. The Kunwha License Agreement was terminated on August 31, 2015. 
 Although we have generated licensing-related and other revenue to date from the commercial sales of ONSOLIS®/BREAKYL/PAINKYL, such revenue has been limited to date due to multiple factors, including a highly restrictive Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) imposed by the FDA and certain formulation issues described below. The lack of approved REMS programs for our direct competitors resulted in an un-level playing field, which created an unfavorable selling environment for ONSOLIS® into 2012. In the E.U., BREAKYL was launched on a country by country basis starting in the fourth quarter of 2012 and continues to be sold by Meda. TTY launched PAINKYL in Taiwan in 2015. 
 On December 29, 2011, the FDA approved a class-wide REMS program covering all transmucosal fentanyl products under a single risk management program. The program, which is referred to as the Transmucosal Immediate Release Fentanyl (TIRF) REMS Access Program, was designed to ensure informed risk-benefit decisions before initiating treatment with a transmucosal fentanyl product, and while patients are on treatment, to ensure appropriate use. The TIRF REMS program was implemented in March 2012. The approved program covers all marketed transmucosal fentanyl products under a single program which will enhance patient safety while limiting the potential administrative burden on prescribers and their patients. One common program also ended the disparity in prescribing requirements for ONSOLIS® compared to similar products and provided ONSOLIS® with the opportunity for retail and inpatient facility access. 
 On March 12, 2012, we announced the postponement of the U.S. relaunch of ONSOLIS® following the initiation of the class-wide REMS until the product formulation could be modified to address two appearance-related issues. The appearance-related issues involved the formation of microscopic crystals and a fading of the color in the mucoadhesive layer and were raised by the FDA during 
 
5 
 
 an inspection of our North American manufacturing partner for ONSOLIS®, Aveva Drug Delivery Systems, Inc. (or Aveva) which is now a subsidiary of Apotex Inc. (or Apotex). While the appearance issues did not affect the products underlying integrity, safety or performance, the FDA believed that the fading of the color in particular may potentially confuse patients, necessitating a modification of the product and its specification before it can be manufactured and distributed. The source of microcrystal formation and the potential for fading of ONSOLIS® was found to be specific to a buffer used in its formulation. We modified the formulation and submitted a prior approval supplement that responded to the FDA questions and led to FDA approval of the new formulation of ONSOLIS® in August 2015. 
 On January 27, 2015, we announced that we had entered into an assignment and revenue sharing agreement with Meda to return to us the marketing authorizations for ONSOLIS® for the U.S. and the right to seek marketing authorizations for ONSOLIS® in Canada and Mexico. 
 On May 11, 2016, we announced the signing of a licensing agreement under which we granted to Collegium the exclusive rights to develop and commercialize ONSOLIS® in the U.S. Under terms of the agreement, Collegium was responsible for the manufacturing, distribution, marketing and sales of ONSOLIS® in the U.S. We collaborated with Collegium on the ongoing transfer of manufacturing to a new contract manufacturer, which includes a planned submission of a Prior Approval Supplement (Supplement) to the FDA. Financial terms of our agreement with Collegium included a $2.5 million upfront non-refundable payment, a $4 million payment upon first commercial sale, $3 million payable to us related to ONSOLIS® patent milestone, up to $17 million in potential payments based on achievement of performance and sales milestones, and upper-teen percent royalties based on various annual U.S. net sales thresholds, with Meda to share in a major portion of the partnership proceeds. Meda continues to commercialize ONSOLIS® under the brand name BREAKYL in the E.U. 
 In December 2017, we announced the reacquisition of U.S. rights to ONSOLIS® from Collegium, which agreement formally terminated March 8, 2018. We are assessing options for U.S. commercialization of ONSOLIS®, including the use of our current sales force, or potentially out-licensing the product. 
 Buprenorphine Extended Release Injection 
 In 2014, we entered into an exclusive agreement with Evonik Corporation (or Evonik) to develop and commercialize a proprietary, injectable microparticle formulation of buprenorphine potentially capable of providing 30 days of continuous therapy following a single subcutaneous injection. Microsphere-based, long acting buprenorphine injection has the ability to change the treatment paradigm in opioid dependence. Such a dosage form has the opportunity to improve therapy compliance through continuous delivery of drug for up to 30 days and addresses challenges regarding patient adherence to long-term buprenorphine treatment, which is critical to successfully manage opioid dependence and the potential for misuse and diversion. 
 While we plan to pursue an indication for the maintenance treatment of opioid dependence, we have also secured the rights and plans to develop a product for the treatment of chronic pain in patients requiring continuous opioid therapy. As part of the agreement, we will have the right to license the product(s) following the attainment of Phase 1 ready formulations. At that point, Evonik could receive downstream payments for milestones related to regulatory filings and subsequent NDA approvals as well as product royalties. Evonik has the exclusive rights to develop the formulation and manufacture the product(s). 
 In 2015, we completed initial development work and preclinical studies which have resulted in the identification of a formulation we believe is capable of providing 30 days of continuous buprenorphine treatment. During a pre-IND meeting with the FDA in November 2015, the FDA requested an additional study to assess the fate of the polymers used in the formulation. In 2016, we completed this study as well as additional preclinical work and other activities to support a planned Phase 1 clinical study. We submitted an Investigational New Drug application (or IND) for this product candidate to the FDA in December 2016 and as of December 31, 2017, have completed steps necessary to initiate a Phase 1 clinical study. 
 Clonidine Topical Gel 
 In March 2013, we announced our entry into a worldwide Exclusive License Agreement (which we refer to as the Arcion Agreement) with privately held Arcion Therapeutics (or Arcion), under which we would develop and commercialize Clonidine Topical Gel (formerly ARC4558) for the treatment of painful diabetic neuropathy (or PDN) and potentially other indications. Under the terms of the agreement, we made an upfront payment of $2 million to Arcion in the form of unregistered shares of our common stock. Additional financial terms of the licensing agreement include a milestone payment to Arcion of $2.5 million in unregistered shares of our common stock upon acceptance by the FDA of a NDA for Clonidine Topical Gel and a cash payment to Arcion of between $17.5 and $35 million upon NDA approval, depending on certain regulatory and commercial considerations. In addition, the licensing agreement includes sales milestones and low single-digit royalties on net worldwide sales.

In March 2015, we announced that the primary efficacy endpoint in a Phase 3 study of Clonidine Topical Gel compared to placebo did not meet statistical significance, although certain secondary endpoints showed statistically significant improvement over placebo. Final analysis of the study identified a sizeable patient population with a statistically significant improvement (n=158; p<0.02) in pain score vs placebo. Following thorough analysis of the data and identification of the reasons behind the study results, we announced on December 8, 2015 that we had initiated a Phase 2b study. On December 13, 2016, we announced that the Phase 2b study failed to show a statistically significant difference in pain relief between Clonidine Topical Gel and placebo, and as a result we have no further plans for development of Clonidine Topical Gel. Given the perceived lack of efficacy, at least in this dosage form and at this strength, and given the resources to support the product by us, the rights to Clonidine Topical Gel were returned to Arcion in February 2017. 
 Additional Overview Information 
 From our inception through December 31, 2017, we have recorded accumulated losses totaling approximately $305.1 million. Our historical operating losses have resulted principally from our research and development activities, including clinical trial activities for our product candidates and general and administrative expenses. Ultimately, if we secure additional approvals from the FDA and other regulatory bodies throughout the world for our product candidates or other products or product candidates that we may acquire or in-license in the future, our goal will be to augment our current sources of revenue and, as applicable, deferred revenue (principally licensing fees), with sales of such products or royalties from such sales, on which we may pay royalties or other fees to our licensors and/or third-party collaborators as applicable. 
 We intend to finance our research and development, commercialization and distribution efforts and our working capital needs primarily through: 
 

 | commercializing our approved products such as BELBUCA® and BUNAVAIL®;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------


 | partnering with other pharmaceutical companies, as we have done with Purdue and Meda, to assist in the distribution and commercialization of our products, for which we would expect to receive an upfront payment, milestones and royalty payments; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | securing proceeds from public and private financings and other potential strategic transactions.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We have based our estimates of development costs, market size estimates, peak annual sales projections and similar matters described below and elsewhere in this Report on our market research, third party reports and publicly available information which we consider reliable. However, readers are advised that the projected dates for filing and approval of our INDs or NDAs with the FDA or other regulatory authorities, our estimates of development costs, our projected sales and similar metrics regarding BUNAVAIL®, BELBUCA®, ONSOLIS®, Buprenorphine Extended Release Injection or any other product candidates discussed below and elsewhere in this Report are merely estimates and subject to many factors, many of which may be beyond our control, which will likely cause us to revise such estimates. Readers are also advised that our projected sales figures do not take into account the royalties and other payments we will need to make to our licensors and strategic partners. Our estimates are based upon our managements reasonable judgments given the information available and their previous experiences, although such estimates may not prove to be accurate. 
 The BEMA® Drug Delivery Technology 
 Our BEMA® drug delivery technology consists of a small, bi-layered erodible polymer film for application to the buccal mucosa (the lining inside the cheek). BEMA® films have the capability to deliver a rapid, reliable dose of drug across the buccal mucosa for time-critical conditions such as breakthrough cancer pain or in situations where gastrointestinal absorption of an oral drug is not practical or reliable, or in facilitating the administration of drugs with poor oral bioavailability. 
 We believe that the BEMA® technology permits control of two critical factors allowing for better dose-to-dose reproducibility: (i) the contact area for mucosal drug delivery, and (ii) the time the drug is in contact with that area, known as residence time. In contrast to competing transmucosal delivery systems like lozenges, buccal tablets and matrix-based delivery systems placed under the tongue or sprayed in the oral cavity, BEMA® products are designed to: 
 

 | adhere to buccal mucosa in seconds and dissolve in minutes;
--+------------------------------------------------------------


 | permit absorption without patients being required to move the product around in the mouth for absorption, thus avoiding patient intervariability;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | allow for unidirectional drug flow into the mucosa as a result of a backing layer on the side of the BEMA® film facing into the patients mouth
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
7 
 

 | provide a reproducible delivery rate, not susceptible to varying or intermittent contact with oral membranes; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | dissolve completely, leaving no residual product or waste and avoiding patient removal, and the possibility for diversion or disposal of partially used product.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We currently own the BEMA® drug delivery technology. We previously licensed the BEMA® drug delivery technology on an exclusive basis from Atrix Laboratories (previously known as QLT USA, Inc., now known as TOLMAR Therapeutics, Inc., which we refer to herein as Tolmar). 
 Overview of Specialty Pharmaceuticals and the 505(b)(2) Regulatory Pathway 
 Our corporate focus is specialty pharmaceuticals with characteristics that provide substantial points of differentiation from existing products. Our product portfolio is based on the application of drug delivery technologies and/or new dosage forms/indications to existing drugs for the creation of novel products. We then seek proprietary protection and FDA approval, and subsequently commercialize these products ourselves or through partners. We believe that research and development efforts focused on novel dose forms of FDA approved drugs is less risky than attempting to discover new drugs, sometimes called new chemical entities (known as NCEs). Our corporate focus came to initial fruition with the FDAs approval of ONSOLIS® (fentanyl buccal soluble film) in 2009 and was replicated in 2014 with the approval of BUNAVAIL® (buprenorphine and naloxone) buccal film and again in 2015 with the approval of BELBUCA® (buprenorphine) buccal film. It is our goal to replicate this success with our current product candidates, and to identify new product candidates suitable for this development strategy that would add significant commercial value to us. 
 An important part of our strategy is the utilization of FDAs 505(b)(2) NDA process for approval. Under the 505(b)(2) process, we are able to seek FDA approval of a new dosage form, dosage regimen or new indication of an FDA approved drug. This regulation enables us to partially rely on the FDAs previous findings of safety and effectiveness for the drug, including clinical and nonclinical testing, and thereby reduce, although not eliminate, the need to engage in these costly and time-consuming activities. A typical development program for a 505(b)(2) submission will include: 
 

 | single and multiple dose toxicity studies in a single animal species,
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------


 | pharmacokinetic evaluation of the new dosage form in humans,
--+-------------------------------------------------------------


 | stability data on the drug substance,
--+--------------------------------------

 This drug development and regulatory approval process is less extensive and lengthy than for a NCE and, as a result, we believe, is a more cost-effective way to bring new product candidates to market. 
 We have and intend to continue to target markets with unmet needs and new dosage forms of known drugs. As a result of employing well known drugs in novel technologies or new dosage forms/indications, we believe health care providers will be familiar with the drugs and accustomed to prescribing them. As with ONSOLIS®, BELBUCA®, and BUNAVAIL® our drug candidates have been through the regulatory process with safety and efficacy established for an indication, a formulation and a dose range. Consequently, our clinical trials need to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of our products in the chosen patient population. 
 Endo Licensing Agreement for BELBUCA® and its Termination 
 On January 6, 2012, we entered into the world-wide licensing and development agreement for BELBUCA® with Endo, which was subsequently terminated as described above. Under terms of the agreement, Endo was responsible for the manufacturing, distribution, marketing and sales of BELBUCA® on a worldwide basis. The agreement called for Endo to commercialize BELBUCA® outside the U.S. through its own efforts or through regional partnerships. In the U.S., we and Endo collaborated on the planning and finalization of the Phase 3 clinical development program and regulatory strategy for BELBUCA® for chronic pain. On October 23, 2015 the FDA approved BELBUCA® for licensing in the United States.

In aggregate, the agreement was worth up to $180 million to us if all milestones or thresholds are met, which includes an upfront non-refundable license fee of $30 million (received January 2012), as well as intellectual property, development, regulatory and commercial milestone and sales threshold payments. We would have received a tiered mid to upper teen royalty on U.S. net sales of BELBUCA® and a tiered mid to upper single-digit royalty on sales outside the U.S. One of the key intellectual property milestones under our Endo Agreement was achieved when, in April 2012, the USPTO granted US Patent No. 8,147,866 (issued from US Patent Application No. 13/184,306), which will extend the exclusivity of the BEMA® drug delivery technology for BELBUCA® (as well as BUNAVAIL® discussed below) from 2020 to 2027. As a result (and included in the aforementioned $180 million if all milestones or thresholds are met), we received a milestone payment in the amount of $15 million in May 2012, and also received an additional milestone payment of $20 million which was paid at the time of approval of a NDA by the FDA for BELBUCA®. The aforementioned $20 million patent-related payment will be earned over the extended patent period from 2020 to 2027. As mentioned above, the obligations of this milestone were extinguished upon the closing of the termination arrangements. Additionally, we achieved another milestone with the locking of the database for our Phase 3 opioid naive clinical study on January 17, 2014. For the achievement of this milestone, per the terms of the agreement, we were due a milestone payment in the amount of $10 million, which was received February 2014 (which is included in the aforementioned $180 million if all milestones or thresholds are met) within thirty (30) days of the database lock. On June 25, 2014, the database for the pivotal Phase 3 efficacy study of BELBUCA® in opioid-experienced patients was locked. The locking of the database triggered a $10 million milestone payment from Endo, which was received July 2014. On December 23, 2014, we and Endo announced the submission of a NDA for BELBUCA® to the FDA, which was accepted February 23, 2015, which triggered a $10 million milestone payment due from Endo to us. As stated above, on October 23, 2015 the FDA approved BELBUCA® for licensing in the United States, which we announced on October 26, 2015. The FDAs approval of BELBUCA® triggered a milestone payment to us from Endo of $50 million, of which $20 million has been deferred for future revenue recognition as the payment is contingently refundable in the event a generic product is commercially launched during the patent extension period. As mentioned below, the obligations of this milestone were extinguished upon the closing of the termination agreement. This $20 million was recognized as revenue in January 2017. 
 On December 8, 2016 we announced we had entered into a termination agreement with Endo (the Endo Termination Agreement) terminating Endos licensing of rights for BELBUCA® CIII (buprenorphine) buccal film. The transaction terminating Endos licensing of rights for BELBUCA® closed on January 6, 2017. This transaction follows a strategic decision announced by Endo in December regarding its U.S. branded pain business. As a result of the agreement, the world-wide rights to BELBUCA® were transferred back to us. We are not responsible for future royalties or milestone payments to Endo and Endo will not be obligated to any future milestone payments to us. The termination agreement with Endo is filed as an exhibit to this Report. 
 At the closing of the transactions contemplated by the Endo Termination Agreement we purchased from Endo the following assets (which we refer to as the Assets): (i) current BELBUCA® product inventory and work-in-progress, (ii) material manufacturing contracts related to BELBUCA®, (iii) BELBUCA-related domain names and trademarks (including the BELBUCA® trademark), (iv) BELBUCA®-related manufacturing equipment, and (v) all pre-approval regulatory submissions, including any Investigational New Drug Applications and New Drug Applications, regulatory approvals and post-approval regulatory submissions concerning BELBUCA®. The purchase price for the Assets (which we refer to as the Asset Purchase Price) was equal to the sum of: (i) the aggregate book value of the portion of the transferred product inventory forecasted to be used or sold by the Company, (ii) the aggregate book value of work-in-progress inventory, and (iii) the assumption of any assumed liabilities. Upon Closing, we accepted transfer of the Assets and assumed and agreed to discharge when due all applicable liabilities assumed by us, which consisted of post-closing obligations for liabilities and payments associated with the Assets, the assumed contracts related to the Assets and applicable taxes (with the obligation for pre-closing and other certain liabilities resulting from the acts or omissions of Endo being retained by Endo). 
 The Asset Purchase Price, together with all other payments (including a non-compete covenant payment) due to Endo under the Endo Termination Agreement, are payable to Endo in cash, in four quarterly installments on the last calendar day of each quarter in 2017. Furthermore, we will not be responsible for future royalties or milestone payments to Endo, and Endo will not be obligated to any future milestone payments to us. The Termination Agreement contains customary representations and warranties and mutual releases and indemnification. 
 At the closing of the Termination Agreement, we and Endo entered into a Transition Services Agreement which governed the post-closing rights and responsibilities of us and Endo in connection with the license termination and the transfer of the Assets to us. Under this agreement, we and Endo agreed to the handling of transition matters such as managing customer contracts, BELBUCA® price reporting, payments, returns and rebates, and customer and managed care relations. In connection therewith, Endo agreed to provide to us an agreed upon number of work hours to be provided by Endo personnel during the transition for certain of these transition services and other assistance with respect to the transition of BELBUCA® to us. 
 In conjunction with the aforementioned Endo Termination Agreement, on December 7, 2016, we also entered into a distribution agreement (which we refer to as the Distribution Agreement) with Par Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (or Par) for the distribution of an authorized generic BELBUCA® product after the launch of a generic BELBUCA® product by a third party. The Distribution 
 
9 
 
 Agreement covers distribution within the entire United States, has an initial term of three years after the launch of a generic BELBUCA® product by a third party, an initial automatic renewal period of two years, and additional automatic one-year renewal periods thereafter, which will occur unless either party provides written notice of termination an agreed upon period of time prior to the expiration of the initial term or any renewal term. In exchange for distribution rights of the generic product, Par will pay us an agreed upon base purchase price and a deferred purchase price equal to a percentage of profit (as such term is specifically agreed to in the Distribution Agreement) with respect to units of each dosage strength of generic product. During the term of the Distribution Agreement, Par is precluded from manufacturing for sale in the United States, or distributing in the United States, any equivalent product, provided that nothing prohibits Par from continuing or undertaking to develop any equivalent product or selling such equivalent product outside of the U.S. The Distribution Agreement contains customary termination provisions for bankruptcy, withdrawal of product from the market, and regulatory and legislative changes, as well as a termination right for insufficient profits or Pars acquisition by or of a party challenging our patents with respect to BELBUCA®. 
 Meda Licensing Agreements for ONSOLIS®
North American Agreement. On September 5, 2007, we entered into a definitive License and Development Agreement with Meda and our subsidiary Arius pursuant to which we and Arius agreed to grant to Meda an exclusive commercial license to market, sell, and, following regulatory approval, continue development of ONSOLIS® in the United States, Mexico and Canada (which we refer to as the Meda North American License). 
 Pursuant to such license agreement, we have received or will receive: 
 

 | a $30.0 million milestone payment (received in 2007).
--+------------------------------------------------------


 | a $29.8 million milestone payment for the approval of ONSOLIS® by the FDA and provision of commercial supplies of ONSOLIS® in the U.S. (received in 2009).
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | a double-digit royalty on net sales of ONSOLIS® in the covered territories, subject to certain third-party royalty payment costs and adjustments, as well as other adjustments in the event of certain specific supply disruptions. The license agreement provides for certain guaranteed minimum annual royalties to us during the second through seventh years following the products first commercial sale, which occurred in the fourth quarter of 2009.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | sales milestones equaling an aggregate of $30 million will be payable at:
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | $10.0 million when and if annual sales meet or exceed $75.0 million;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------


 | $10.0 million when and if annual sales meet or exceed $125.0 million; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | $10.0 million when and if annual sales meet or exceed $175.0 million.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------

 European Agreement. In 2006, we announced collaboration with Meda to develop and commercialize BEMA® Fentanyl (marketed as BREAKYL in Europe). Under terms of the agreement, we granted Meda rights to the European development and commercialization of BREAKYL, in exchange for an upfront fee of $2.5 million and a $2.5 million milestone payment (received in 2008) for completion of Phase 3 clinical trials. We have also received a double-digit royalty on net sales and additional milestone payments of $2.5 million upon approval and $2.5 million upon launch in the first country in the European territory (received in 2012). Meda has managed the regulatory submission in Europe that led to approval in October 2010. Meda will exclusively commercialize BREAKYL in Europe. 
 In 2009, we received a $3 million payment in exchange for amending the European agreement to provide Meda the worldwide rights to ONSOLIS®, except for South Korea and Taiwan. The sales royalties to be received by us will be the same for all territories as agreed to for Europe. In addition, various terms of the European agreements have been modified to reflect the rights and obligations of both us and Meda in recognition of the expansion of the scope of the European agreements. 
 On January 27, 2015, we announced that we had entered into an assignment and revenue sharing agreement with Meda to return to us the marketing authorization for ONSOLIS® in the U.S. and the right to seek marketing authorizations for ONSOLIS® in Canada and Mexico. Following the return of the U.S. marketing authorization from Meda, we submitted a prior approval supplement for the new formulation to the FDA in March 2015, which was approved in August 2016. In connection with the return of the U.S. marketing authorization by Meda to us in January 2015, the remaining U.S.-related deferred revenue of $1.0 million was recorded as contract revenue during the year ended December 31, 2015. There was no remaining U.S.-related contract revenue to record during the year ended December 31, 2016. On February 27, 2016, we entered into an extension of the assignment and revenue sharing agreement to extend the period until December 31, 2016. 
 
10 
 
Efforts to extend our supply agreement with its ONSOLIS® manufacturer, Aveva, which is now a subsidiary of Apotex, Inc., were unsuccessful and the agreement expired. However, we identified an alternate supplier and requested guidance from the FDA on the specific requirements for obtaining approval to supply product from this new vendor. Based on current estimates, we expect to submit the necessary documentation to the FDA for qualification of the new manufacturer by the first quarter of 2018. 
 Collegium License and Development Agreement for ONSOLIS® and its Termination 
 On May 11, 2016, we entered into a definitive License and Development Agreement (which we refer to as the Collegium Agreement) with Collegium under which we granted Collegium the exclusive rights to develop and commercialize ONSOLIS® in the U.S. Under the terms of the Collegium Agreement, Collegium will be responsible for the manufacturing, distribution, marketing and sales of ONSOLIS® in the U.S. We are obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to continue the transfer of manufacturing to the anticipated manufacturer for ONSOLIS® and to submit a corresponding Prior Approval Supplement (the Supplement) to the FDA with respect to the current NDA for ONSOLIS®. Following approval of the Supplement, the NDA and manufacturing responsibility for ONSOLIS® (including the manufacturing relationship with our manufacturer, subject to our entering into an appropriate agreement with such manufacturer that is acceptable and assignable to Collegium) will be transferred to Collegium. 
 Financial terms of the License Agreement include; 
 

 | $2.5 million upfront non-refundable payment, (received in June 2016);
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------


 | reimbursement to us for a pre-determined amount of the remaining expenses associated with the ongoing transfer of the manufacturing of ONSOLIS®;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | $4 million payable to us upon first commercial sale of ONSOLIS® in the U.S;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | $3 million payable to us related to ONSOLIS® patent milestone;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------


 | up to $17 million in potential payments to us based on achievement of certain performance and sales milestones; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | upper-teen percent royalties payable by Collegium to us based on various annual U.S. net sales thresholds, subject to customary adjustments and the royalty sharing arrangements described below.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The Collegium Agreement also contained customary termination provisions that include a right by either party to terminate upon the other partys uncured material breach, insolvency or bankruptcy, as well as in the event a certain commercial milestone is not met. 
 On December 8, 2017, Collegium provided us the required 90-day notice regarding termination of the license and development agreement for ONSOLIS® between us and Collegium. Collegiums decision to terminate the license involved their execution of a license agreement to commercialize Nucynta® (tapentadol) Immediate Release and Nucynta® ER (tapentadol). The license and development agreement for ONSOLIS® between us and Collegium formally ended on March 8, 2018. We are working with Collegium to transfer the assets back to us and reach final resolution of financial matters. 
 ONSOLIS® was originally licensed to, and launched in the U.S. by, Meda. In January 2015, we entered into an assignment and revenue sharing agreement (which we refer to as the ARS Agreement) with Meda pursuant to which Meda transferred the marketing authorizations for ONSOLIS® in the United States back to us. Under the ARS Agreement, financial terms were established that enable Meda to share a significant portion of the proceeds of milestone and royalty payments received by us from any new North American partnership for ONSOLIS® that may be executed by us. The execution of the Collegium Agreement also required the execution of a definitive termination agreement between us and Meda embodying those royalty-sharing terms, returning ONSOLIS®-related assets and rights in the U.S., Canada, and Mexico to us, and including certain other provisions. In addition, our royalty obligations to CDC IV, LLC (or CDC IV), an entity that originally provided funding for the development of ONSOLIS®, and its assignees will remain in effect. CDC IV provided funding for the development of ONSOLIS® in the past. 
 Key Collaborative and Supply Relationships 
 We are and have been a party to collaborative agreements with corporate partners, contractors, universities and government agencies. Research collaboration may result in new inventions which are generally considered joint intellectual property unless invented solely by individuals we employ, or by third party transfer to us by contract. Our collaboration arrangements are intended to provide us with access to greater resources and scientific expertise in addition to our in-house capabilities. We also have supply arrangements with several of the key component producers of our delivery technology. Our collaborative and supply relationships include: 
 

 | Meda. For a description of our agreements with Meda, please see Meda Licensing Agreements for ONSOLIS® above.

 | ARx. Effective July 30, 2014, we entered into an agreement with ARx, LLC. Pursuant to which ARx acts as a supplier of BUNAVAIL® laminate or bulk product for the United States. Our supply agreement with ARx was then amended July 14, 2017 and now the agreement runs until December 31, 2023. The agreement can be further renewed for additional terms by mutual agreement.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Sharp. Effective March 6, 2014, we entered into an agreement with Sharp Corporation (Sharp) to punch or cut the BUNAVAIL® laminate or bulk product into individual dosage units and package them to supply finished BUNAVAIL® film products. Our supply agreement with Sharp ran for an initial term from March 6, 2014 until December 31, 2016 and was extended by mutual agreement for a subsequent one-year term until December 31, 2017, which has been extended to December 31, 2018. Effective January 6, 2017, we assumed Endos agreement with Sharp to package the individual dosage units to supply finished BELBUCA® film products, which expires on December 31, 2022. This specific BELBUCA® packaging agreement is being added to our original supply agreement with Sharp so that both BUNAVAIL® and BELBUCA® packaging are governed by the same agreement which can be extended by mutual agreement for subsequent one-year terms.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Tapemark. Effective January 6, 2017, we assumed Endos agreement with The Tapemark Company to punch or cut the BELBUCA® laminate or bulk product into individual dosage units which are then transferred to Sharp for final packaging and supply of finished BELBUCA® film products. Our BELBUCA® agreement runs from the assumption of the agreement on January 6, 2017 and shall continue until terminated under the following conditions: i) at will termination, with 36-months prior written notice, ii) default, with prior written notice, iii) finished product withdrawal, iv) inability to supply, v) bankruptcy/insolvency, and vi) mutual agreement.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We also have relationships with third party contract research organizations that assist us with the management of our clinical trials. 
 In pursuing potential commercial opportunities, we intend to seek and rely upon additional collaborative relationships with corporate partners. Such relationships may include initial funding, milestone payments, licensing payments, royalties, access to proprietary drugs or potential applications of our drug delivery technologies or other relationships. Our agreements with Endo and Meda are examples of these types of relationships, and we will continue to seek other similar arrangements. 
 Relationship with CDC IV, LLC 
 On July 14, 2005, we entered into a Clinical Development and License Agreement (which we refer to as the CDLA), with the predecessor of CDC IV, which provided funds to us for the development of ONSOLIS®. On February 16, 2006, we announced that, as a result of our achievement of certain milestones called for under the CDLA, CDC IV made its initial $2 million payment to us. On May 16, 2006, we issued CDC IV 2 million shares of our common stock in return for accelerating the funding of the $4.2 million balance of $7 million of aggregate commitment under the CDLA and for eliminating the then required $7 million milestone repayment to CDC IV upon the approval by the FDA of ONSOLIS®. 
 Under the CDLA, as amended, CDC IV is entitled to receive a low-double digit royalty based on net sales of ONSOLIS®. The CDLA includes minimum royalties of $375,000 per quarter beginning in the second full year following commercial launch. The minimum provision came into effect in 2011. The royalty term and minimum payments end upon the latter of expiration of the patent or generic entry into any particular country. 
 The term of the CDLA lasts until the CDLA is terminated. Either we or CDC IV may terminate the CDLA for uncured breach or upon bankruptcy-like events, in each case following written notice. CDC IV may terminate the CDLA, following applicable cure periods, if we: (i) default on indebtedness in excess of $1 million which was accelerated or for which payment has been demanded, or (ii) fail to satisfy a judgment greater than $500,000. 
 
12 
 
We and CDC IV entered into a Royalty Purchase and Amendment Agreement, dated September 5, 2007 (or the RPAA) pursuant to which we granted CDC IV a 1% royalty on sales of the next BEMA® product, which is BUNAVAIL®, including an active pharmaceutical ingredient other than fentanyl, to receive FDA approval. In connection with the 1% royalty grant as previously mentioned: (i) CDC IV shall have the option to exchange its royalty rights to BUNAVAIL® in favor of royalty rights to a substitute BEMA® product, (ii) we shall have the right, no earlier than six (6) months prior to the initial commercial launch of BUNAVAIL®, to propose in writing and negotiate the key terms pursuant to which it would repurchase the royalty from CDC IV, (iii) CDC IVs right to the royalty shall immediately terminate at any time if annual net sales of BUNAVAIL® equal less than $7.5 million in any calendar year following the third (3rd) anniversary of initial launch of the product and CDC IV receives $18,750 in three (3) consecutive quarters as payment for CDC IVs 1% royalty during such calendar year and (iv) CDC IV shall have certain information rights with respect to BUNAVAIL®. The amount of royalties which we may be required to pay (including estimates of the minimum royalties) is not presently determinable because product sales estimates cannot be reasonably determined and the regulatory approvals of the product for sale is not possible to predict. As such, we expect to record such royalties, if any, as cost of sales. 
 On November 21, 2016 we entered into an Amended and Restated Clinical Development and License Agreement with CDC IV and Athyrium that did not materially change the rights of the parties under the CDLA, but merely clarified and memorialized in a single agreement the rights and obligations of our company, CDC IV and Athyrium under the CDLA and its various amendments as described above. 
 Research and Development 
 Most of our research and development relating to our BEMA® and other technologies is conducted through third parties in collaboration with us. 
 Research and development expenses include salaries and benefits for personnel involved in our research and development activities and direct and third-party development costs, which include costs relating to the formulation and manufacturing of our product candidates, costs relating to non-clinical studies, including toxicology studies, and clinical trials, and costs relating to compliance with regulatory requirements applicable to the development of our product candidates. For the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, we spent approximately $13.0 million, $18.9 million and $20.6 million, respectively, on research and development, and such expenses represented approximately 18%, 28% and 27%, respectively, of our total operating expenses for such fiscal years. 
 Endo was responsible for reimbursing us for certain research and development clinical trial expenses that exceed $45 million, as detailed in our License and Development Agreement that was executed on January 5, 2012. For the year ended December 31, 2015, we incurred $0.9 million in such research and development expenses that were reimbursable by Endo to us. There were no reimbursements by Endo in 2017 or 2016 as the program ended in 2015. 
 Collegium was responsible for reimbursing us for a pre-determined amount of the remaining expenses associated with the ongoing transfer of the manufacturing of ONSOLIS®, as detailed in our definitive License and Development Agreement that was executed on May 11, 2016. For the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, we have incurred $0.8 million and $1.1 million, respectively, in such reimbursements that are reimbursable by Collegium to us. There were no reimbursements by Collegium in 2015.

 The pharmaceutical industry and the therapeutic areas in which we compete are highly competitive and subject to rapid and substantial regulatory and technological changes. Developments by others may render our BEMA® technology, our marketed products and any proposed drug products and formulations under development noncompetitive or obsolete, or we may be unable to keep pace with technological developments or other market factors. Technological competition in the industry from pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, universities, governmental entities and others diversifying into the field is intense and is expected to increase. 
 Below are some examples of companies seeking to develop potentially competitive technologies, though the examples are not all-inclusive. Many of these entities have significantly greater research and development capabilities than do we, as well as substantially more sales and marketing, manufacturing, financial and managerial resources. These entities represent significant competition for us. In addition, acquisitions of, or investments in, competing pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies by large corporations could increase such competitors research, financial, sales and marketing, manufacturing and other resources. Such potential competitive technologies may ultimately prove to be safer, more effective, or less costly than any product candidates that we are currently developing or may be able to develop. Additionally, our competitive position may be materially affected by our ability to develop or successfully commercialize our drugs and technologies. Other external factors may also impact the ability of our products to meet expectations or effectively compete, including pricing pressures, healthcare reform and other government interventions as well as limitations on access that may be placed upon us through managed care organizations or through competitive contracting with payers. 
 There have been a growing number of companies developing products utilizing various thin film drug delivery technologies. While numerous over-the-counter pharmaceutical products have been brought to market in thin film formulations, few containing prescription products have been introduced in the U.S. Among the products to receive FDA approval are BUNAVAIL®, BELBUCA®, and ONSOLIS® (BDSI), Suboxone® film (Indivior) and Zuplenz® (Midatech Pharma). Companies in the development and manufacture of thin film technologies include LTS, ARx LLC and MonoSol Rx LLC, dba Aquestive Therapeutics (Aquestive). In addition, a number of companies are developing improved versions of existing products using oral dissolving, nasal spray, aerosol, sustained release injection and other drug delivery technologies. We believe that potential competitors are seeking to develop and commercialize technologies for buccal, sublingual or mucosal delivery of various therapeutics or groups of therapeutics. While our information concerning these competitors and their development strategy is limited, we believe our technology can be differentiated because the BEMA® technology provides for a rapid and consistent delivery, high drug bioavailability and convenient use based on how the BEMA® technology adheres to the buccal membrane and dissolves. Our clinical trials across a number of BEMA® products have demonstrated that the technology is an effective means of drug delivery that is well tolerated and offers convenience to patients. 
 BELBUCA® (buprenorphine) buccal film for chronic pain 
 Chronic pain is often defined as any pain lasting more than 12 weeks. Whereas acute pain is a normal sensation that alerts us to possible injury, chronic pain persists  often for months or even longer. Chronic pain may arise from an initial injury, such as back sprain, or there may be an ongoing cause, such as an illness. Sometimes there is no clear cause. According to the National Institutes of Health, approximately 100 million people in the U.S. are living with chronic pain. 
 BELBUCA® was approved by the FDA on October 26, 2015 for use in patients with pain severe enough to require daily, around-the-clock, long-term opioid treatment for which alternative options are inadequate. Compared to currently marketed products and products under development, we believe that BELBUCA® is differentiated based on the following features: 
 

 | strong and durable efficacy in both opioid naïve and opioid experienced patients;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Schedule III designation by DEA, which indicates less abuse and addiction potential compared Schedule II opioids, which include oxycodone, hydrocodone and morphine;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
14 
 

 | at higher doses, published studies have shown that buprenorphines physiologic effects reach a plateau, and this ceiling effect may result in a lower risk of overdose related respiratory depression;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | favorable tolerability with a low incidence of constipation and low discontinuation rate;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | flexible dosing options covering up to 160 mg morphine sulfate equivalents (MSE); and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | buccal administration to optimize buprenorphine delivery.
--+----------------------------------------------------------

 Because of the safety, tolerability and efficacy benefits associated with this opioid, we believe that BELBUCA® is well suited for patients with pain severe enough to require daily, around-the-clock, long-term opioid treatment for which alternative treatments, such as non-opioids or immediate release opioids, are inadequate. 
 The pain market is well established, with many pharmaceutical companies marketing new formulations of existing products as well as generic versions of older, non-patent protected products. In 2017, according to data from Symphony Health, the market for extended release opioids in the U.S. totaled nearly $4.5 billion in annual sales with nearly 16 million prescriptions dispensed. However, prescription sales of long acting opioids declined by 10% in 2017 compared to 2016 amidst wide-ranging efforts to curb misuse, abuse and over use of opioids in order to address the current opioid crisis. In March 2017, the President Trump signed an executive order establishing the Presidents Commission on Combating Drug Addiction and the Opioid Crisis and in October declared the opioid crisis a national emergency. While governmental and other efforts continue to focus on combating the current opioid epidemic, we remain committed to focusing on responsible opioid prescribing and believe that products such as BELBUCA and BUNAVAIL can help play an important role in addressing the current healthcare crisis in the U.S. 
 A number of products are competitors to BELBUCA®. One area of focus for us (and previously for Endo) is to position BELBUCA® in patients who are transitioning from short to long acting opioids. Indications for such use include pain associated with lower back and severe arthritis conditions where alternative treatment options have been inadequate, and pain is severe enough to require daily, around-the-clock, long-term opioid treatment. Marketed competitors for these indications include Butrans® (buprenorphine transdermal patch) from Purdue and Schedule II opioids such as OxyContin® from Purdue and Nucynta® ER from Depomed/Collegium. Other competition includes multiple generic Schedule II oral opioid formulations, such as morphine, hydrocodone, and fentanyl containing products. 
 Additionally, abuse deterrent formulations of pain products are currently being marketed, in clinical development or under FDA review. These formulations, such as Embeda® from Pfizer, Hysingla® ER from Purdue, Zohydro® ER from Pernix Therapeutics, MorphaBond ER from Daiichi Sankyo, Xtampza® ER from Collegium and Arymo ER from Egalet, as well as new formulations of OxyContin®, use a variety of technologies that aim to minimize the potential for abuse and misuse. Abuse deterrent products are likely to play an unclear but increasingly important role in prescribing, potentially even replacing the original product. 
 An advantage of BELBUCA® is that the compound, buprenorphine, may be inherently less likely to cause abuse and addiction given the lower propensity for the product to cause euphoria and is the current basis of its Schedule III classification. 
 The first buprenorphine formulation for the treatment of chronic pain, Purdue Pharmas Butrans® (buprenorphine transdermal system), was approved in 2010. Butrans®, like BELBUCA®, is indicated for use in patients with pain severe enough to require daily, around-the-clock, long-term opioid treatment for which alternative options are inadequate. Butrans delivers buprenorphine transdermally (through the skin) over a period of seven days. The approval of Butrans® signaled the interest and approvability of new formulations of buprenorphine. Butrans is available in a range of doses to treat patients on up to 80 mg MSE (morphine sulfate equivalents) compared to 180 mg MSE with BELBUCA®. It is our view that the flexibility of dosing with a BEMA® formulation, wider range of doses and ease of use will make it a preferred formulation for a significant number of patients with chronic pain conditions. Butrans® was launched in early 2011. Sales of Butrans® in 2017 totaled over $239 million, a decrease of 10% over the prior year. The decrease is primarily attributed to the launch of generic buprenorphine transdermal patches in 2017, which in December 2017, accounted for one-third of all buprenorphine transdermal patch prescriptions. 
 Insys Therapeutics, Inc. (or Insys) is developing sublingual buprenorphine spray for the treatment of pain. Results of a Phase 3 trial of this product were reported in August 2016 and indicated that sublingual buprenorphine spray was well tolerated and led to reduced pain vs. placebo over 48 hours after a bunionectomy procedure. Insys announced in December 2017 that the New Drug Application for its buprenorphine sublingual spray for moderate-to-severe acute pain had been accepted for filing by the FDA. Insys is also considering future studies in chronic pain; however, development of a product for the treatment of chronic pain is more complex with lengthier trials and greater risk, thus sublingual buprenorphine spray for chronic pain is not viewed as a near-term threat to BELBUCA®. While limited information is available, other formulations of buprenorphine may also be in early stages of development for the treatment of pain. Relmada Therapeutics Inc. has in its pipeline an oral, enteric-coated buprenorphine (BuTab) for chronic pain and opioid dependence indications. In December 2015, Relmada announced topline results of a proof-of-concept pharmacokinetic study in healthy volunteers which showed that the product can be delivered at therapeutic levels through the gastrointestinal route, though the bioavailability remained low. No further development is noted.

In addition to direct competitors, there are other factors that impact the market for pain products in general. The significant pricing pressures and availability of generic products in the U.S. and other regions are likely to have increasing influence on the pharmaceutical market, including pain products. Additionally, opioids continue to garner increased scrutiny based on the growing problem of prescription drug abuse and addiction. It remains unclear what additional steps, if any, the FDA or other government agencies may take to address the problem of opioid abuse and addiction. However, in July 2012 the FDA approved a class-wide REMS program for the extended release and long-acting opioids. The class-wide REMS program consists of a REMS-compliant educational program offered by an accredited provider of continuing medical education, patient counseling materials and a medication guide. BELBUCA® falls within the existing class-wide REMS program. In August 2014, the DEA published in the Federal Register its final ruling moving hydrocodone combination products (such as Vicodin, Lortab, Norco, etc.) from Schedule III to the more-restrictive Schedule II, as recommended by the Assistant Secretary for Health of HHS and as supported by the DEAs own evaluation of relevant data. As a result of the ruling, hydrocodone containing products are now classified in the same category (Schedule II) as morphine and oxycodone. In addition, HHSs Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (or the CDC) in March 2016 issued guidelines for prescribing opioids for chronic pain. CDC developed and published the
 CDC Guideline for Prescribing Opioids for Chronic Pain to provide recommendations for the prescribing of opioid pain medication for patients 18 and older in primary care settings. Recommendations focus on the use of opioids in treating chronic pain. The guidelines advocate use of nonpharmacologic therapy and nonopioid pharmacologic therapy as first line therapy for chronic pain. When starting opioid therapy for chronic pain, clinicians are advised to prescribe immediate-release opioids instead of extended-release/long-acting (ER/LA) opioids and to prescribe the lowest effective dosage. The availability of the guidelines has resulted in confusion and cautiousness, particularly among primary care physicians, and a reduced willingness to treat patients for chronic pain. A sharp reduction in prescriptions among Primary Care Physicians and an increase among Pain Specialists are evidence of the shift in prescribing and in the dynamics of pain treatment. Additionally, in June 2017, the FDA requested that Endo Pharmaceuticals remove Opana ER (oxymorphone), from the market based on concerns that the benefits of the drug may no longer outweigh its risks. This is the first time the agency has taken steps to remove a currently marketed opioid pain medication from sale due to the public health consequences of abuse. The FDAs decision was based on a review of all available postmarketing data, which demonstrated a significant shift in the route of abuse of Opana ER from nasal to injection following the products reformulation. It is anticipated that other steps will be taken to further limit the use, duration dose or availability of certain opioids  particularly those with Schedule II designation. 
 BUNAVAIL®
In June 2014, BUNAVAIL® was approved by the FDA for the maintenance treatment of opioid dependence  and in May 2017 we announced that the BUNAVAIL® indication was expanded to include induction of buprenorphine treatment for opioid dependence. BUNAVAIL® contains the partial opioid agonist buprenorphine, which binds to the same receptors as opiate drugs but has a higher affinity. Naloxone, an opioid antagonist, is included as an abuse deterrent. When used as directed, the naloxone is swallowed and minimally absorbed; however, if misused (i.e., dissolved and injected), the naloxone rapidly precipitates withdrawal symptoms. 
 Treatment with buprenorphine reduces the typical cravings and withdrawal symptoms associated with coming off opioid prescription painkillers and heroin. This allows the individual suffering from an addiction to opioids along with counseling and support  to work toward recovery. On average, treatment lasts a couple months, reflecting relatively high dropout rates, but a significant number of people remain on buprenorphine treatment chronically, with nearly one-quarter of patients still on therapy after nine months. BUNAVAIL® provides an alternative treatment utilizing the advanced BEMA® drug delivery technology. BUNAVAIL® provides the highest bioavailability of any buprenorphine-containing product for opioid dependence, allowing for effective treatment with half the dose compared to Suboxone® film. Additionally, BUNAVAIL® offers convenient and discrete buccal administration and avoids the need for patients to avoid talking and swallowing during administration. Data has also demonstrated an excellent tolerability profile with a 68% reduction at the end of 12 weeks in the incidence of constipation in a Phase 3 trial in patients converted from Suboxone® sublingual tablets or film to BUNAVAIL®. 
 The total U.S. market for buprenorphine containing products for opioid dependence exceeded $25 billion in 2017, an increase of 14% over 2016. The market has grown steadily as a result of the rapidly escalating problem of prescription opioid misuse and abuse, a recent resurgence of heroin use, the growing number of physicians treating opioid dependence, and the inclusion of addiction treatment as an essential benefit in the Affordable Care Act. Additionally, important steps were taken by government agencies in 2015 to expand access to medication assisted treatment (MAT) with buprenorphine for opioid use disorder. In August 2016, based on a new ruling from HHS, the cap on the number of patients eligible to be treated by waivered physicians increased from a maximum of 100 to 275. According to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), over 3,900 clinicians applied for and were granted waivers to prescribe buprenorphine for the treatment of opioid dependence at the increased limit by early 2018 with a total of over 46,000 waivered practitioners in total. Subsequently, The Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act (CARA) was signed into law. This was the first major federal addiction legislation in 40 years, and the most comprehensive effort undertaken to address the opioid epidemic. The legislation included expansion of office-based treatment by allowing Nurse Practitioners and Physician Assistants to prescribe buprenorphine for opioid dependence beginning in 2018.

The products currently marketed for this indication include Suboxone®, a sublingual film formulation of buprenorphine and naloxone, a sublingual tablet of buprenorphine and naloxone, (Zubsolv®), and generic formulations of both buprenorphine and buprenorphine/naloxone tablets. Buprenorphine/naloxone combination products make up the majority of the category and represent 82% of total prescriptions. Suboxone® film, the market leader with 70% of total buprenorphine/naloxone prescriptions, achieved sales of over $1.7 billion in the U.S. in 2017. In December 2014, Reckitt Benckiser Group PLC, the manufacturer of Suboxone® sublingual tablets and films, announced that it completed the spin-off of that companys pharmaceutical business (including the Suboxone® brand) under the name Indivior PLC (or Indivior) in order to allow the consumer goods group to focus on its consumer health and hygiene products. The Indivior business focuses on addiction treatment and closely related areas including opioid overdose, cocaine overdose and alcohol dependence. 
 Generic buprenorphine/naloxone tablet formulations were launched in early 2013 by Actavis (now known as Teva Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (or Teva) and Amneal Pharmaceuticals and were followed by additional entrants. The impact of generic buprenorphine/naloxone tablets on Suboxone® film and on the overall branded market has been somewhat limited to date, with generic buprenorphine/naloxone tablets accounting for only 23% of total buprenorphine/naloxone product prescriptions. Additional generics may enter the market, though the timing is unclear and the impact is anticipated to be limited. 
 A sublingual tablet, referred to as Zubsolv® was approved by FDA in July 2013 and subsequently launched in September 2013. Zubsolv® is a sublingual formulation of buprenorphine/naloxone using Orexos proprietary sublingual drug delivery technology. Orexo is a specialty pharmaceutical company with headquarters in Sweden. Orexo is developing treatments using its proprietary sublingual drug delivery technology, which includes the marketed product Abstral® that delivers fentanyl for the treatment of breakthrough cancer pain. Zubsolv® is being marketed predominantly based on its claims of improved taste and faster dissolve time compared to Suboxone®. Sales for Zubsolv® in 2017 were relatively flat and totaled approximately $123 million in the U.S. for a prescription market share of 5%. 
 While limited information is available, a sublingual spray formulation of buprenorphine/naloxone is in development from Insys Therapeutics and is currently in Phase I development studies. 
 While we anticipate that the market for buprenorphine/naloxone products for the treatment of opioid dependence will get increasingly more competitive, we believe a BEMA® formulation of buprenorphine/naloxone has significant appeal given its buccal administration, enhanced delivery of buprenorphine, tolerability profile, convenience, and lack of taste issues. We also believe that the increased number of companies promoting the use of buprenorphine containing-products for opioid dependence has the potential to create greater awareness and help to further expand what is already a significant and growing market. 
 ONSOLIS®
According to the National Cancer Institute, there are approximately 14.5 million people in the United States diagnosed with or living with cancer. Cancer patients often suffer from a variety of symptoms including pain as a result of their cancer or cancer treatment. Pain is a widely prevalent symptom in cancer patients, and an estimated 50% to 90% of those with cancer also suffer from what is referred to as breakthrough cancer pain (or BTCP). Following rapid onset that peaks in three to five minutes, BTCP episodes can last several minutes to an hour, and usually occur several times per day. BTCP can be difficult to treat due to its severity, rapid onset and the often unpredictable nature. Physicians typically treat BTCP with a variety of short-acting opioid medications, including morphine and fentanyl. A number of formulations of fentanyl are available employing a variety of drug delivery technologies, all which provide rapid onset and relatively short duration of action to address the fast onset and short duration of BTCP. 
 For ONSOLIS®, in the breakthrough cancer pain area, the market has become increasingly crowded and more competitive in recent years. The principal competitor had traditionally been Teva Pharmaceutical, which completed its acquisition of Cephalon in October 2011. Teva markets both lozenge (Actiq®) and effervescent buccal tablet (Fentora®) formulations of fentanyl. In recent years, newer product entries, particularly Subsys® (fentanyl sublingual spray) from Insys, have gained significant market share. Additional competitors include the sublingual tablet formulation of fentanyl (Abstral®) and a nasal spray formulation of fentanyl (Lazanda®). In addition, multiple generic formulations of Actiq® are currently available. 
 On December 29, 2011, the FDA approved a REMS program covering all transmucosal fentanyl products. The program, which is referred to as the Transmucosal Immediate Release Fentanyl (TIRF) REMS Access Program, was designed to ensure informed risk-benefit decisions before initiating treatment with a transmucosal fentanyl product, and while patients are on treatment, to ensure 
 
17 
 
 appropriate use. The approved program covers all marketed transmucosal fentanyl products, including ONSOLIS®, under a single program which is meant to enhance patient safety while limiting the potential administrative burden on prescribers and their patients. One common program ended the disparity in prescribing requirements for ONSOLIS® compared to similar products. 
 Other potent acute pain products are also in development, including ARX-04 from AcelRx Pharmaceuticals, which is a sublingual tablet drug/device delivery system containing sufentanil for the treatment of acute pain. Following a December 2016 NDA submission, AcelRx received a complete response letter from the FDA in October 2017. While we have limited information regarding ARX-04 and potential other competitors and their development status and strategy, we believe that our technology may be differentiated because unlike these potential competitors, ONSOLIS® has a predefined residence time on the buccal membrane providing for consistent drug delivery from dose to dose. We believe that the competitive formulations of fentanyl will have intra-dose variability, meaning the patient may not get the same response each time the product is administered. In addition, it is our belief that many of the other competitive products may have tolerability issues and a higher level of potential abuse based on how they are delivered. 
 The chart below lists products that we believe may compete directly with ONSOLIS®. 
 

Product | Company | Description | Status 
Actiq® (oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate) | Teva/Generics | Lozenge | Marketed (generics available)
Fentora® (fentanyl buccal tablet) | Teva Pharmaceutical | Effervescent buccal tablet | Marketed 
Abstral® (fentanyl sublingual tablet) | Sentynl Therapeutics | Sublingual tablet | Marketed 
Lazanda® (fentanyl nasal spray) | Slan Medicinal | Nasal spray | Marketed 
Subsys® (fentanyl sublingual spray) | INSYS Therapeutics | Sublingual spray | Marketed 
NAL1239 | NAL Pharmaceuticals | Orally dissolving film | Proposed 505(b)(2) NDA 
ARX-04 (sufentanil) | AcelRx Pharmaceuticals | Sublingual tablet | NDA filed (U.S.) 

 In Europe, multiple formulations of fentanyl have been approved and launched for the treatment of breakthrough cancer pain, including ONSOLIS® (marketed as BREAKYL by Meda/Mylan) as well as Abstral®, Effentora®, and Instanyl® (intranasal fentanyl spray). 
 Buprenorphine Extended Release Injection 
 Despite the availability of effective treatments, including BUNAVAIL® buccal film, challenges remain regarding patient adherence to long-term buprenorphine treatment, which is critical to successfully managing opioid dependence. This has led to interest in alternative delivery systems for buprenorphine. One such opportunity is the development of an injectable, long-acting formulation. Microsphere-based, long acting, buprenorphine extended release injection has the ability to change the treatment paradigm in opioid dependence and pain management. Such a dosage form provides improved therapy compliance through continuous delivery of drug for up to 30 days. In 2014, we entered into an exclusive agreement with Evonik to develop and commercialize a proprietary, injectable microparticle formulation of buprenorphine potentially capable of providing 30 days of continuous therapy following a single subcutaneous injection. While we plan to pursue an indication for the maintenance treatment of opioid dependence, we have also secured the rights and are developing a product for the treatment of chronic pain in patients requiring continuous opioid therapy. Significant progress has been made in the development of a formulation to allow for delivery once per month as well as provide advantages over other injectable buprenorphine products. We submitted an IND for Buprenorphine Extended Release Injection in December 2016. 
 In terms of potential competition for Buprenorphine ER Injection, Probuphine, a subcutaneous implantable rod containing buprenorphine from Braeburn Pharmaceuticals was approved in May 2016. In December 2012, Titan Pharmaceuticals announced the signing of a license agreement with Braeburn Pharmaceuticals. The license granted Braeburn exclusive commercialization rights in the United States and Canada. While limited information is available on current use of Probuphine, given the need for surgical implantation and removal as well as dosing limitations, we do not expect Probuphine to be a significant competitor to our buprenorphine injection. 
 In November 2017, Indivior announced the FDA approval of Sublocade (buprenorphine extended release) injection for subcutaneous use. Sublocade is the first once-monthly injectable buprenorphine formulation and was approved for the treatment of moderate to severe opioid use disorder in patients who have initiated treatment with a transmucosal buprenorphine-containing product followed by dose adjustment for a minimum of seven days. Sublocade was evaluated in a 24-week, Phase 3 pivotal study in which 
 
18 
 
 patients were randomized to one of two Sublocade regimens or placebo. Both dosage regimens of Sublocade were shown to be superior to placebo in achieving more illicit opioid-free weeks. Sublocade is expected to be made available in the first quarter of 2018 in single dose, pre-filled syringes (100 mg, 300 mg) and will require refrigeration. The product is intended to be administered only by a healthcare provider and will distributed through a restricted distribution system. A second extended release buprenorphine injection, CAM2038, is also in development. In January 2018, Braeburn Pharmaceuticals announced it had received a complete response letter from the FDA for their weekly and monthly injection. The FDA has requested additional information in order to progress the application forward. 
 Licenses, Intellectual Property and Proprietary Information 
 Our intellectual property strategy is intended to maximize protection of our proprietary technologies and know-how and to further expand targeted opportunities by extension of our patents, trademarks, license agreements and trade secrets portfolio. In addition, an element of our strategic focus provides for varying specific royalty or other payment obligations by our commercial partners as our applicable intellectual property portfolio changes or business activity reaches certain thresholds. 
 However, patent positions of biotechnology and pharmaceutical organizations are uncertain and involve complex legal and technical issues. There is considerable uncertainty regarding the breadth of claims in patent cases which results in varied degrees of protection. While we believe that our intellectual property position is sound, it may be that our pending patent applications will not be granted or that our awarded claims may be too narrow to protect the products against competitors. It is also possible that our intellectual property positions will be challenged or that patents issued to others prior to our patent issuance may preclude us from commercializing our products. It is also possible that other parties could have or could obtain patent rights which may cover or block our products or otherwise dominate our patent position. 
 BEMA® Technology 
 The drug delivery technology space is congested, although we do not believe that our BEMA® products conflict with, are dominated by, or infringe any external patents and we do not believe that we require licenses under external patents for our BEMA® based products in the United States. It is possible, however, that a court of law in the United States or elsewhere might determine otherwise. If a court were to determine that we were infringing other patents and that those patents were valid, we might be required to seek one or more licenses to commercialize our products or technologies and we may be unable to obtain such licenses from the patent holders. If we were unable to obtain a license, or if the terms of the license were onerous, there may be a material adverse effect upon our business plan to commercialize these products. 
 This potential exists in our present litigation with Aquestive. Aquestive claimed in a litigation initiated in late 2010 that our confidential and trade secret manufacturing process for ONSOLIS® infringes their patented manufacturing process for thin films. We do not believe that we have infringed these claims. Moreover, we believe that the original claims in Aquestive patents 588, 292 and 891 are invalid or overbroad, and, in connection with inter partes and ex parte reexamination proceedings we have brought before the USPTO, the USPTO has either rejected and cancelled all claims, amended the original claims to make them narrower, or issued narrower, new claims replacing the broader original claims for each of the 588, 292 and US patent No 7,357,891 (which we refer to as the 891 Patent), respectively. We also believe that the manufacturing processes for our products, including BELBUCA® and BUNAVAIL® do not infringe Aquestives patents, at least because they do not meet the limitations of the original, amended or new claims of Aquestives patents. We maintain our manufacturing processes for our BEMA® products and product candidates as trade secrets. Based on our examination of these patents, we do not believe our manufacturing processes infringe Aquestives patents. On March 7, 2012, the court granted our motion to stay the case pending outcome of the reexamination proceedings in the USPTO. On July 3, 2012, the USPTO issued an ex parte reexamination certificate on the 891 patent, in which all original claims were amended to make them narrower. On August 26, 2012, the USPTO issued an ex parte reexamination certificate on the United States Patent No 7,425,292 (which we refer to as the 292 Patent), in which all the original broader claims were replaced with narrower, new claims. As for the United States Patent No. 7,824,588) (which we refer to as the 588 Patent), after the reexamination proceedings (and its appeals process), on April 17, 2014, the Patent Trial and Appeal Board (PTAB) of the USPTO issued a Decision on Appeal affirming the Examiners rejection (and confirming the invalidity) of all the claims of the 588 Patent. Aquestive did not request a rehearing by the May 17, 2014 due date for making such a request and did not further appeal the Decision to the Federal Court of Appeals by the June 17, 2014 due date for making such an appeal. Subsequently, on August 5, 2014, the USPTO issued a Certificate of Reexamination cancelling the 588 Patent claims. The litigation resumed and on September 25, 2015 the court granted our motion of Summary Judgement of Intervening Rights and dismissed the case. Aquestive filed an appeal with the Federal Circuit and has subsequently decided to withdraw the appeal. On February 25, 2016, Aquestive filed an Unopposed Motion For Voluntary Dismissal Of Appeal, which was granted by the court on February 26, 2016 and the case dismissed. Thus, the district courts grant of the Summary Judgement of Intervening Rights will stand.

On March 1, 2011, we were granted a patent extending the exclusivity of the BEMA® drug delivery technology in Canada to 2027. The Canadian Patent No. 2,658,585 provides additional patent protection for ONSOLIS® and BELBUCA®. In April 2012, the USPTO granted US Patent No. 8,147,866, which will extend the exclusivity of the BEMA® drug delivery technology for BELBUCA® and BUNAVAIL® in the United States from 2020 to 2027. In April 2014, the USPTO granted US Patent No. 8,703,177 (issued from US Patent Application No. 13/590,094), which will extend the exclusivity of the BEMA® drug delivery technology for BUNAVAIL® in the United States to at least 2032. In February 2018, we were granted US Patent No. 9,901,539, which will extend the exclusivity of the BEMA® technology for BELBUCA® in the United States to December 21, 2032. 
 We own various patents and patent applications relating to the BEMA® technology. US Patent No. 6,159,498 (expiration date October 2016), US Patent No. 7,579,019 (expiration date January 22, 2020), US Patent No. 8,147,866 (expiration date July 23, 2027), US Patent 8,703,177 (expiration date August 20, 2032), US Patent 9,522,188 (expiration date April 24, 2035), US Patent 9,597,288 (expiration date July 23, 2027), US Patent 9,655,843 (expiration date July 23, 2027), US Patent 9,901,539 (expiration date December 21, 2032, Canadian Patent No. 2,658,585 (expiration date July 2027), EP2054031 (expiration date July 2027) and EP 0 973 497 (expiration date October 2017) are of particular value to our business and technology platform relating to the BEMA® delivery technology. On February 16, 2010, we filed a complaint with the United States Federal District Court for the District of Columbia, requesting the USPTO be required to further extend the patent term for US 7,579,019 from 835 days to 1,191 days. In March 2011, we prevailed in this case, and the patent expiration date of US Patent No. 7,579,019 is now extended from January 31, 2019 to January 22, 2020. 
 On January 22, 2014, Aquestive filed a Petition for Inter Partes Review (or IPR) on US Patent No. 7,579,019 with the USPTO. In the Petition, Aquestive is requesting an inter partes review because it is asserting that the claims of US Patent No. 7,579,019 are alleged to be unpatentable over certain prior art references. The USPTO instituted the IPR on the US Patent No. 7,579,019 (which we refer to as the 019 Patent).. The USPTO found all claims patentable and Aquestive filed a Request for Rehearing. On December 19, 2016, the PTAB issued a final decision denying Aquestives request for rehearing. Aquestive did not appeal this final decision. 
 With respect to trademarks, BDSI®, BEMA®, BELBUCA® and BUNAVAIL® are registered trademarks of BioDelivery Sciences International, Inc. ONSOLIS® and BREAKYL are also trademarks owned by BioDelivery Sciences International, Inc. PAINKYL is a trademark owned by TTY Biopharm. 
 Clonidine Topical Gel 
 On March 26, 2013, we entered into the Arcion Agreement with Arcion pursuant to which Arcion agreed to grant to us an exclusive commercial world-wide license, with rights of sublicense, under certain patent and other intellectual property rights of Arcion to develop, manufacture, market, and sell gel products containing clonidine (or a derivative thereof), alone or in combination with other active ingredients, for topical administration for the treatment of painful diabetic neuropathy and other indications (the Clonidine Gel Products). 
 Per the Arcion Agreement, we had exclusive rights to various patents pertaining to the Clonidine Gel Products. US Patent No. 6,147,102 (expiration date October 26, 2019), US Patent No. 6,534,048 (expiration date October 26, 2019), US Patent No. 8,026,266 (expiration date September 30, 2029) and their corresponding patents in other countries (e.g., Australia, Canada, Germany, etc.) which were of value to our business and technology platform relating to the Clonidine Gel Products. 
 On December 13, 2016, we announced that the Phase 2b study failed to show a statistically significant difference in pain relief between Clonidine Topical Gel and placebo, and as a result we have no further plans for development of Clonidine Topical Gel. Given the perceived lack of efficacy, at least in this dosage form and at this strength, and given the resources to support the product by us, the rights to Clonidine Topical Gel were returned to Arcion in February 2017. 
 Buprenorphine Extended Release Injection Product Candidate 
 On October 27, 2014, we entered into a definitive Development and Exclusive License Option Agreement (which we refer to as the Evonik Development Agreement) with Evonik pursuant to which Evonik agreed to grant two exclusive options to acquire exclusive worldwide licenses, with rights of sublicense, to certain patents and other intellectual property rights of Evonik to develop and commercialize certain injectable, extended release products containing buprenorphine (which we refer to as Buprenorphine Extended Release Injection Products). If such options are exercised, such licenses would be memorialized in a definitive license agreement. 
 Although we do not believe that any Buprenorphine Extended Release Injection Products would conflict with, dominated by, or infringing any external patents and we do not believe that we require licenses under external patents for Buprenorphine Extended Release Injection Products, it is possible, however, that a court of law in the United States or elsewhere might determine otherwise. If a court were to determine that we were infringing other patents and that those patents were valid, we might be required to seek one or more licenses to commercialize our products or technologies. We may be unable to obtain such licenses from the patent holders. If we were unable to obtain a license, or if the terms of the license were onerous, there may be a material adverse effect upon our business plan to commercialize these products.

Manufacturing 
 We rely on third-party manufacturers, packagers, and analytical testing laboratories to produce commercial product and developmental products for research, product development, and clinical supplies. We are currently party to the following manufacturing arrangements for different companies: 
 BELBUCA®
Effective January 5, 2012, we entered a license and development agreement with Endo for BELBUCA®. Over the past two years, the technical operations and supply activities have been gradually transitioned from our company to Endo. As a result of the licensing and developmental agreement, all of the commercial supply agreements will be negotiated by and the responsibility of Endo. 
 On December 8, 2016, we announced the reacquisition of the world-wide rights of BELBUCA® from Endo. This agreement went into effect on January 6, 2017. As a part of the reacquisition rights, we continue to honor the contractual relationships put in place by Endo with the API and excipient manufacturers, contract manufacturing and packaging organizations, and analytical testing facilities. 
 BUNAVAIL®
Effective July 30, 2014, we entered a Supply Agreement with ARx LLC for manufacturing, and effective March 6, 2014, we entered a Supply Agreement with Sharp for packaging for BUNAVAIL® commercial supplies, respectively. Both companies underwent successful FDA preapproval inspections and will be subject to annual quality audits. Both our contracts are also supported by a quality assurance agreement requiring our counterparties to adhere to product quality standards and cGMP manufacturing and packaging requirements. BUNAVAIL® is currently manufactured by ARx LLC. 
 ONSOLIS®
Effective October 17, 2005, we entered into an agreement with Aveva to supply ONSOLIS® for clinical trials and commercial sale. Under the terms of this agreement, Aveva was the sole supplier of ONSOLIS® for the United States and Canada. On March 12, 2012, we announced the postponement of the U.S. relaunch of ONSOLIS® following the initiation of the class-wide REMS with two appearance issues raised by FDA during an inspection of Avevas manufacturing facility. Specifically, the FDA identified the formation of microscopic crystals and a fading of the color in the mucoadhesive layer during the 24-month shelf life of the product. ONSOLIS® has been subsequently reformulated with 24 months of available stability data on the reformulated product. 
 On March 30, 2012, Apotex, Inc. announced its acquisition of our contract manufacturing organization Aveva Drug Delivery Systems and issued a notification of termination of the supply agreement for manufacturing of ONSOLIS®. On October 9, 2014, Aveva sent us written notice of their intent not to renew our supply agreement. In February 2015, we re-acquired the rights to the ONSOLIS® NDA from Meda, and we submitted the reformulated product on March 27, 2015 as a prior approval supplement. The reformulated product was approved by the FDA on August 11, 2015. Subsequently, our supply agreement with Aveva expired on October 15, 2015. 
 In May 2016, we engaged in a licensing agreement with Collegium for ONSOLIS® and initiated a facility qualification and manufacturing of registration batches with Tapemark, our contract manufacturing organization for ONSOLIS®. We anticipate submission of the Prior Approval Supplement in the first quarter of 2018 for this new commercial manufacturing and packaging site. 
 BREAKYL
Effective December 15, 2006, we entered into a process development agreement and a commercial Supply Agreement on April 26, 2012, both with LTS. Under the terms of this supply agreement, LTS is the exclusive manufacturer of BEMA® Fentanyl for all countries with exception of the United States and Canada. LTS continues to manufacture BREAKYL for MEDA since it was first launched in the E.U. in September 2012. 
 
21 
 
PAINKYL
We entered a license and commercial supply agreement with TTY in Taiwan on October 4, 2010. In July 2013, Taiwan FDA (TFDA) approved PAINKYL for market authorization. LTS manufacture PAINKYL for TTY since it was first launched on January 28, 2015. 
 Buprenorphine Extended Release Injection 
 Effective October 27, 2014, we entered into an exclusive agreement with Evonik to develop and commercialize a proprietary long acting, sustained release, biodegradable microparticle buprenorphine formulation capable of providing 30 days of continuous therapy following a subcutaneous injection. Through the agreement, we also secured the license to Evonik-owned intellectual property related to products for the maintenance treatment of opioid dependence and for the treatment of chronic pain. This product is currently in development. 
Clonidine Topical Gel 
 Effective October 22, 2014, we entered into a master service agreement with Ei LLC for formulation, analytical and manufacturing services, clinical supplies, packaging and product release for the Clonidine Topical Gel. We have also made similar arrangements with Frontage and Tapemark for bulk manufacture for initial clinical trial supplies and individual dose units packaging, respectively. In December 2016, we announced that our CLO-291 study did not meet its primary end point and as a result, all manufacturing plans for the clonidine gel have been terminated. 
 Sales and Marketing 
 Following, and assuming, completion of clinical development and regulatory approval for each candidate product, we will pursue one of several approaches (or a combination thereof) for marketing and selling our products. These include selling the products through our own sales force, licensing the products to appropriate partners so that they can market and distribute the products for us, co-promotions where we would share in the sales promotion, or use of a contract sales organization. We currently employ two of these approaches as we promote BELBUCA® and BUNAVAIL® through our own sales force and have licensed commercialization rights to Meda and TTY for BREAKYL/ PAINKYL for breakthrough cancer pain. 
 In 2014, we launched BUNAVAIL® with the creation of an exclusive contract sales force through Quintiles, a contract sales organization. In 2016, we converted the contract sales force into one employed by us to provide a greater sense of belonging and responsibility, to reduce administrative costs and inefficiencies, and to give us greater flexibility to accommodate future strategic options. Using our own sales force provides us with significantly more control over commercialization efforts and makes us capable of selling our own products in specialty pharmaceutical markets while leaving promotional responsibilities for large primary care audiences and ex-U.S. markets with partners. 
 In January 2017, following the reacquisition of BELBUCA® from Endo, our sales force began selling BELBUCA® in addition to BUNAVAIL®. Given the greater long-term commercial and profitability opportunities with BELBUCA®, we have transitioned our primary commercial emphasis to BELBUCA®. We also expanded the sales force to 65 territories because of the opportunity created by the reacquisition of BELBUCA®. 
 In January 2018, to further accelerate the growth of BELBUCA® we further expanded the sales force to 85 territories and 9 Regional Sales Managers supporting both BELBUCA® and BUNAVAIL®. 
 BELBUCA® (buprenorphine) buccal film for Chronic Pain 
 We announced the signing of a worldwide licensing and development agreement for BELBUCA® with Endo in January 2012. Under terms of the agreement, Endo was responsible for the manufacturing, distribution, marketing and sales of BELBUCA® on a worldwide basis. On December 8, 2016, we announced that we were reacquiring the worldwide license to BELBUCA® from Endo; the transition went into effect on January 6, 2017. We believe that Endo built a significant foundation for BELBUCA® and that the safety, tolerability and efficacy profile of BELBUCA provides us with a strong opportunity to gain a share of the $10 billion U.S. opioid market. 
 Given this large market opportunity and the greater profitability of BELBUCA®, we have expanded our sales force and have made BELBUCA® our primary commercial emphasis, while continuing to support BUNAVAIL®. Our sales force is focused on current BELBUCA® prescribers and clinicians we believe have the greatest opportunity to be adopters of BELBUCA®, such as high prescribers of: long-acting opioids, Butrans and/or short acting opioids chronically. In parallel, we are heavily focused on increasing 
 
22 
 
 market access for BELBUCA®. More than half of all long-acting opioid prescriptions are through commercial payers. As of January 2018, BELBUCA® is covered in formulary platforms that represent more than 85% of commercial lives. Approval rates within the commercial channel remain favorable at about 80%. This improved formulary position has also had a positive impact on reversal rates which declined to approximately 6.5% in 2017 as patient cost shares improved. Although we continue to see favorable approval rates for BELBUCA® within the Medicare space, we continue to pursue improved access to make BELBUCA® more accessible to the senior population suffering with chronic pain. 
 We believe that educating clinicians regarding the safety, tolerability and efficacy benefits of BELBUCA® will also be important to gaining share in the large chronic pain market. As such, we are sponsoring BELBUCA®-focused speaker programs in regions across the U.S. A key goal of these programs is to position BELBUCA® as an alternative to Schedule II opioids for the treatment of moderate to severe chronic pain that is not adequately controlled with commonly prescribed first-line therapies (e.g. short acting opioids). 
 Canada 
 On July 12, 2017 we announced the signing of a licensing agreement under which we granted the exclusive rights to distribute, market and sell BELBUCA® in Canada to Purdue Pharma (Canada). Under terms of the agreement, we will receive upfront and potential milestones of up to $4.5 million CAD as well as royalties on net sales from Purdue. In January 2018, BELBUCA® became commercially available in Canada. 
 Other Regions 
 For commercialization of BELBUCA® in other regions outside the U.S. and Canada, we are currently seeking partners with commercial reach and experience in pain management in their respective regions. 
 BUNAVAIL®
During 2013, we engaged in the process of assessing a variety of strategic options for the commercialization of BUNAVAIL® in the U.S. The options we explored included commercial partnerships, co-promotion arrangements, leading commercial efforts internally using contract resources, or a combination of the strategic options. Outside the U.S., we are pursuing partnerships. 
 Following a thorough assessment of commercialization options for BUNAVAIL®, we identified BUNAVAIL® as an attractive product to build a commercial presence capable of supporting both BUNAVAIL® and our other future products. Additionally, the self-commercialization of BUNAVAIL® supported our longer-term vision to become a fully integrated pharmaceutical company. The dynamics of the opioid dependence market made self-commercialization a feasible and attractive option. In total, approximately 90% of all prescriptions are written by approximately 5,000 physicians  which include primary care physicians, psychiatrists, addiction medicine specialists and pain specialists, with most concentrated in the eastern third of the U.S. and the west coast, allowing for coverage of a majority of the prescriber base with a modest sized sales force. Additionally, the relatively small prescriber base along with the limited number of competitors results in relatively modest marketing expenditures. And finally, the high awareness and physician acceptance of buprenorphine for the treatment of opioid dependence lessens the need for costly educational and promotional programs. 
 On November 3, 2014, we announced the availability of BUNAVAIL® in the U.S. where it was supported by a 60-person field sales force and a full marketing effort targeting the nearly 5,000 physicians who are responsible for approximately ninety percent of prescriptions for buprenorphine products for the treatment of opioid dependence. The launch was also supported by a full marketing effort aimed at increasing product awareness including advertising and promotion, direct mail and email, a speakers program and a number of initiatives, including a copay support program, to minimize access issues. Our managed care efforts continued to progress as we executed six new managed care contracts between July and November 2016 which were beneficial to our sales efforts in 2017. 
 In August 2015, we announced the appointment of Scott M. Plesha as Senior Vice President of Sales. Mr. Plesha joined us with more than 25 years of sales experience within the pharmaceutical and medical industries. In January 2018, Mr. Plesha was promoted to President of our company. 
 As noted above, in January 2017 with the reacquisition of BELBUCA®, we transitioned our primary commercial emphasis from BUNAVAIL® to BELBUCA®. Our BUNAVAIL® efforts are now focused on current BUNAVAIL® prescribers and on increasing prescriptions related to current, upcoming and future managed care contracts where BUNAVAIL® is placed in a favorable formulary position. We believe that in this structure, and with the increase in our sales force size in late 2016 and early 2017, we can maintain a competitive share of voice through both personal and non-personal selling efforts. We also believe that BUNAVAIL® offers distinct and important benefits over other products in the opioid dependence market which will allow for sales growth in the long term.

ONSOLIS®/BREAKYL
Europe 
 In September 2006, we secured an exclusive licensing and supply agreement with Meda for the commercialization rights for BEMA® Fentanyl in the E.U., which is being marketed in Europe under the trade name BREAKYL. BREAKYL received marketing authorization from the European regulatory authorities in October 2010 and has been launched in over thirteen European countries including Germany, France and the U.K. On January 2, 2009, we entered into amendments to our agreements with Meda to grant Meda worldwide commercialization rights for ONSOLIS®/BREAKYL except for Taiwan and South Korea. The sales royalties to be received by us will be the same for all Meda territories as agreed to for Europe. 
North America 
 In September 2007, we secured an exclusive licensing and supply agreement with Meda for the commercialization rights for ONSOLIS®, under which Meda was responsible for the sales, marketing and distribution of ONSOLIS® in the U.S., Canada and Mexico. 
 ONSOLIS® was commercially launched in the United States in mid-October 2009 following approval by the FDA in July 2009. Under the Meda agreement, ONSOLIS® commercial efforts were supported by a therapeutic specialty sales force assembled by Meda to target oncologists and pain management specialists treating breakthrough cancer pain. 
 ONSOLIS® was approved by the Canadian regulatory authorities in May 2010 and was the first product approved in Canada for the management of breakthrough cancer pain. Meda Valeant Pharma Canada Inc., a joint venture between Meda and Valeant Canada Limited was responsible for promotion of ONSOLIS® in Canada. ONSOLIS® was launched in Canada in the third quarter of 2011. 
 On March 12, 2012, we announced the postponement of the U.S. relaunch of ONSOLIS® following the initiation of the class-wide REMS until the product formulation could be modified to address two appearance-related issues. Such appearance-related issues involved the formation of microscopic crystals and a fading of the color in the mucoadhesive layer, raised by the FDA during an inspection of our North American manufacturing partner for ONSOLIS®, Aveva. While the appearance issues do not affect the products underlying integrity, safety or performance, the FDA believed that the fading of the color in particular may potentially confuse patients, necessitating a modification of the product and its specification before it can be manufactured and distributed. The source of microcrystal formation and the potential for fading of ONSOLIS® was found to be specific to a buffer used in its formulation. 
 On January 27, 2015, we announced that we had entered into the Assignment Agreement with Meda to return to us the marketing authorizations for ONSOLIS® for the U.S. and the right to seek marketing authorizations for ONSOLIS® in Canada and Mexico. We made modifications to the formulation for ONSOLIS®, submitted a prior approval supplement and subsequently received FDA approval in August 2015. On May 11, 2016, we announced the signing of a licensing agreement under which we granted the exclusive rights to develop and commercialize ONSOLIS® in the U.S. to Collegium. Under terms of the agreement, Collegium will be responsible for the manufacturing, distribution, marketing and sales of ONSOLIS® in the U.S. Both companies are collaborating on the ongoing transfer of manufacturing, which includes submission of a Prior Approval Supplement (Supplement) to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). 
 On December 8, 2017, we received a 90-day notice from Collegium regarding the return of the U.S. rights to ONSOLIS® from Collegium; which transition went into effect on March 8, 2018. We are currently evaluating a range of options for commercializing ONSOLIS®, including the potential to market and sell ONSOLIS® via our existing sales force. 
 Additional Territories 
 In 2010, licensing agreements were secured in Taiwan and South Korea providing the opportunity for commercialization in all territories globally. In May 2010, we announced a commercial partnership with Kunwha for the exclusive rights to develop and commercialize ONSOLIS® in the Republic of Korea. Those rights were subsequently returned to us due to changes in the market dynamics and the Kunwha License Agreement was terminated on August 31, 2015. In October 2010, a commercial partnership with TTY was announced, providing commercialization rights for Taiwan. This agreement resulted in potential milestone payments of up to $1.3 million (including an upfront payment of $0.3 million) along with royalties based on sales. 
 In November 2011, we announced that TTY had submitted a NDA for marketing authorization of BEMA® Fentanyl to the Taiwan Food and Drug Administration. This triggered a milestone payment to us of approximately $0.3 million, which was received November 2011. In July 2013, we announced the regulatory approval of BEMA® Fentanyl in Taiwan, where the product is now marketed under the brand name PAINKYL. The approval in Taiwan resulted in a milestone payment of $0.3 million to us, which was received in the third quarter of 2013. TTY launched PAINKYL in Taiwan in 2015.

Government Regulation 
 The nonclinical and clinical development, manufacturing and marketing of any drug product, is subject to significant regulation by governmental authorities in the United States and other countries. Complying with these regulations involves considerable time, expense and uncertainty. 
 In the United States, drugs are subject to rigorous federal regulation and, to a lesser extent, state regulation. The Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, as amended, and the regulations promulgated thereunder, and other federal and state statutes and regulations govern, among other things, the testing, manufacture, safety, efficacy, labeling, storage, record keeping, approval, advertising and promotion of our drugs. Drug development and approval within this regulatory framework is difficult to predict, requires a number of years and involves the expenditure of substantial resources. Moreover, ongoing legislation by Congress and rulemaking by the FDA presents an ever-changing landscape where we could be required to undertake additional activities before any governmental approval to market our products is granted. 
 The steps required before a pharmaceutical product may be marketed in the United States include: 
 

1. | small scale manufacturing of the product;
---+------------------------------------------


2. | laboratory and nonclinical tests for safety of the product;
---+------------------------------------------------------------


3. | submission of an IND to the FDA for the product which must become effective before human clinical trials can commence;
---+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


4. | larger scale manufacturing of the product;
---+-------------------------------------------


5. | clinical trials to characterize the efficacy and safety of the product in the intended patient population;
---+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


6. | submission of an NDA to the FDA; and
---+-------------------------------------


7. | approval of the NDA by the FDA.
---+--------------------------------

 In addition to obtaining FDA approval for each product, each product-manufacturing establishment must be registered with, and approved by, the FDA. Manufacturing establishments are subject to biennial inspections by the FDA and must comply with the FDAs Good Manufacturing Practices and with other federal and local regulations. 
 Nonclinical Testing 
 Nonclinical testing includes laboratory evaluations of the active drug substance and formulation, as well as tissue culture and animal studies to assess the safety and potential efficacy of the investigational product. Nonclinical tests must be conducted by laboratories that comply with FDA Good Laboratory Practices regulations. Nonclinical testing is inherently risky and the results can be unpredictable or difficult to interpret. The results of nonclinical testing are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND and are reviewed by the FDA prior to the commencement of clinical trials. Unless the FDA places a clinical hold on an IND, clinical studies may begin thirty (30) days after the IND is submitted. 
 We have relied and intend to continue to rely on third party contractors to perform nonclinical trials. 
 Clinical Research 
 Clinical research involves administration of the investigational product to healthy volunteers and/or to patients under the supervision of a qualified investigator. Clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with Good Clinical Practices following protocols acceptable to FDA that detail the objectives of the study, the parameters to be used to monitor safety and the efficacy and the planned evaluation of results. Each protocol must be submitted to the FDA prior to its conduct. Further, each clinical study must be conducted under the auspices of an independent institutional review board that protects the rights and welfare of the study subjects. The drug product used in clinical trials must be manufactured according to Good Manufacturing Practices. 
 
25 
 
Clinical research is typically conducted in three sequential phases, but the phases may overlap and not all phases may be necessary when developing investigational products that will utilize the FDAs 505(b)(2) approval process. Phase 1 studies are typically performed in normal healthy volunteers to assess the safety (adverse side effects), absorption, metabolism, bio-distribution, excretion, and food and drug interactions of the investigational drug product. Additional studies may be performed to assess abuse potential as well as limited measures of pharmacologic effect. Phase 2 is the proof of principle stage and involves studies in a limited number of patients in order to: 
 

 | assess the potential efficacy of the product for specific, targeted indications;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | identify the range of doses and dose regimens likely to be effective for the indication; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | identify possible adverse events and safety risks.
--+---------------------------------------------------

 When there is evidence that the product may be effective and has an acceptable safety profile in Phase 2 evaluations, Phase 3 trials are undertaken to establish the clinical efficacy and safety profile of the product within a larger population at geographically dispersed clinical study sites. Phase 3 frequently involves randomized controlled trials and, whenever possible, studies are conducted in a manner so that neither the patient nor the investigator knows what treatment is being administered. We, or the FDA, may suspend clinical trials at any time if it is believed that the individuals participating in such trials are being exposed to unacceptable health risks. 
 New Drug Application and FDA Approval Process 
 The results of the pharmaceutical and manufacturing development work, nonclinical studies and clinical studies are submitted to the FDA in the form of an NDA for approval to market and sell the product. The testing and approval process is likely to require substantial time and effort. In addition to the results of nonclinical and clinical testing, the NDA applicant must submit detailed information about chemistry, manufacturing and controls that will describe how the product is made, packaged, labeled, and tested through the manufacturing process. The manufacturing process continues to develop throughout the period of clinical trials such that, at the time of the NDA, it has been demonstrated that there is control of the process and the product can be made consistently at commercial scale. 
 The NDA review process involves FDA investigation into the details of the manufacturing process, as well as the design and analysis of each of the nonclinical and clinical studies. This review includes inspection of the manufacturing facility, the data recording process for the clinical studies, the record keeping at a sample of clinical trial sites and a thorough review of the results for each nonclinical and clinical study. Through this review, the FDA reaches a decision about the risk-benefit profile of a product candidate. If the benefit outweighs the risk, the FDA begins negotiation with the company on the content of an acceptable package insert and an associated REMS plan if required. 
 The NDA review process is affected by many factors, including the severity of the disease, the availability of alternative treatments, and the risks and benefits demonstrated in clinical trials. Consequently, there is a risk that approval may not be granted on a timely basis, if at all. The FDA may deny approval of an NDA if applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied. Moreover, if regulatory approval of a product is granted, such approval may entail limitations on the indicated uses for which it may be marketed, require additional testing or information, or require post-marketing testing (Phase 4) and surveillance to monitor the safety of a companys product if it does not believe the NDA contains adequate evidence of its safety. Finally, product approvals may be withdrawn if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or health problems are identified that would alter the risk-benefit analysis for the product. Post-approval studies may be conducted to explore the use of the product for new indications or populations such as pediatrics. 
 Among the conditions for NDA approval is the requirement that any prospective manufacturers quality control and manufacturing procedures conform to Good Manufacturing Practices and the specifications approved in the NDA. In complying with standards set forth in these regulations, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of quality control and quality assurance to ensure full technical compliance. Manufacturing establishments, both foreign and domestic, also are subject to inspections by or under the authority of the FDA and by other federal, state or local agencies. Additionally, in the event of non-compliance, the FDA may issue warning letters and/or seek criminal and civil penalties, enjoin manufacture, seize product or revoke approval. 
 Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy 
 In March 2008, new legislation designated as the Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act of 2007 (the FDAAA) took effect. This legislation strengthened the FDAs authority over drug safety and directs the FDA to develop systems aimed at managing the risk-benefit ratio of a drug, with a particular focus on post-approval safety. FDAAA authorized the FDA to require and enforce a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, if the FDA determines that it is necessary to ensure that the benefits of a drug outweigh the potential risks. The legislation also provides the FDA with increased authority to require REMS at any point in a drug products lifecycle based on new safety information. 
 
26 
 
A REMS is defined by the FDA as a strategy to manage a known or potential serious risk associated with a drug or biological product. The FDAs assessment of whether to require a REMS as a condition for approval considers factors such as the size of the population likely to use the drug, the seriousness of the disease or condition that is to be treated by the drug, the expected benefit, and the seriousness of any known or potential adverse events that may be related to the drug. A REMS may be conveyed through the use of a number of tools including a Medication Guide for distribution when the drug is dispensed, a communication plan to physicians to convey potential risks, and elements to ensure safe use. These elements may include provisions that healthcare providers who prescribe the drug and pharmacists who dispense the drug have particular training, experience or special certifications; that the drug be dispensed only in certain healthcare settings; that the drug be dispensed to patients with evidence of safe-use conditions; and/or that patients must be enrolled in a registry. Under the FDAAA, the FDA has also been granted enforcement authority over violations of the REMS provisions. The FDA may impose civil monetary penalties, the drug or biological product can be deemed misbranded, and/or the FDA may obtain injunctive relief against further distribution of the product. 
 On December 29, 2011, the FDA approved a class-wide REMS program covering all transmucosal fentanyl products under a single risk management program. ONSOLIS® is subject to this REMS. 
 Additionally, FDA has implemented a class-wide REMS covering the extended release and long acting opioid drug products. The class-wide REMS program consists of a REMS-compliant educational program offered by an accredited provider of continuing medical education, patient counseling materials and a medication guide. BELBUCA® is subject to this existing class-wide REMS program. The cost and implementation of the extended release and long-acting opioid REMS is shared among multiple companies in the category. 
 There also continues to be a REMS in place for buprenorphine for the treatment of opioid dependence. BUNAVAIL® is included in this existing REMS that is far less cumbersome than the ONSOLIS® REMS and includes a medication guide and healthcare professional and patient education. 
 International Approval 
 Whether or not FDA approval has been obtained, approval of a product by regulatory authorities in foreign countries must be obtained prior to the commencement of commercial sales of the drug in such countries. The requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials and drug approvals vary widely from country to country, and the time required for approval may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval. Although there are some procedures for unified filings for certain European countries, in general, each country at this time has its own procedures and requirements. 
Other Regulation 
 In addition to regulations enforced by the FDA, we are also subject to United States regulation under the Controlled Substances Act, the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the Environmental Protection Act, the Toxic Substances Control Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act and other present and potential future federal, state, local or similar foreign regulations. Our research and development may involve the controlled use of hazardous materials, chemicals and radioactive compounds. Although we believe that our safety procedures for handling and disposing of such materials comply with the standards prescribed by state and federal regulations, the risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials cannot be completely eliminated. In the event of any accident, we could be held liable for any damages that result and any such liability could exceed our resources. 
Employees 
 As of March 13, 2018, we have 115 full-time and 1 part-time employees. Six are involved in our clinical development program and operations, fourteen handle our administration, accounting, and supply chain management, four handle our marketing and managed markets and ninety-two handle our outside sales. Advanced degrees and certifications of our staff include one Ph.D, one M.D, two CPAs, eleven MBAs, four MSs, four MAs, one JD, one MPA, one MEDU, one RAC and one RN. None of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements. From time to time, we also employ independent contractors on a consulting basis or to support our administrative functions. We consider relations with all of our employees to be good. Each of our employees has entered into confidentiality, intellectual property assignment and non-competition agreements with us.
