The Deal
 
In September 2012, we acquired The Deal, L.L.C., or The Deal, which began as a broadsheet newspaper for retail investors and transformed its business into a digital subscription model that delivers sophisticated coverage primarily to institutional investors on changes in corporate control, including merges and acquisitions, private equity, corporate activism and restructuring. The Deal is a trusted information source for organizations seeking to generate deal flow, improve client intelligence and enhance market knowledge. It provides full access to proprietary commentary, analysis and data produced every day by our editors and journalists and content feeds can be customized based on each client’s job function, deal focus and workflow.

Segments
 
Our operations consist of three reportable segments: TheDeal/BoardEx, RateWatch and Business to Consumer. Further information regarding our operating segments may be found in Note 17 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.
Sales, Marketing and Distribution
 
We pursue a variety of sales and marketing initiatives to increase traffic to our sites, license our content, sell advertising, increase subscriptions for our B2B and B2C products and expose our brands to new audiences. These initiatives include promotion through online, search marketing, email, social, direct mail and telemarketing channels. We employ marketers and designers who plan and create campaigns for the various business units which are then implemented by our technical and operations team as well as by third-party service providers. Our business intelligence group, responsible for reporting and analysis, helps determine the effectiveness of our campaigns and make informed decisions. In addition to these marketing efforts, we employ a sales force that sells directly to advertisers and their agencies, as well as to institutional clients as outlined above.
 
We use content syndication and subscription distribution to capitalize on the cost efficiencies of digital distribution and to garner additional value from content we have produced for our own properties. By syndicating our content to other leading digital properties, we expose our brands and top-quality journalism to millions of potential users/subscribers. For example, we provide digital properties in our vertical, including Yahoo! Finance, AOL Finance, Marketwatch and MSN Money, with selected content to host along with additional article headlines that these partners display on their stock quote result pages, in both instances providing links back to our site. This type of content licensing exposes new audiences to our brands and generates additional traffic to our sites, creating the opportunity for us to increase our advertising revenue and subscription sales.
 
To attract additional visitors to our sites, we utilize search engine optimization tools to increase the visibility of our content on Google, Yahoo, Bing and similar search engines. We also have a social media team that works across platforms such as Facebook, LinkedIn and Twitter to increase awareness and drive traffic to our content, events and subscription products.

With digital traffic now almost evenly split between desktop and mobile platforms and devices, we continually improve our products to be as mobile-friendly as possible, while developing and distributing mobile and tablet applications to deliver our content to mobile-first audiences. The Deal and BoardEx both have robust mobile sites and apps and are using mobile alerts to continually engage with users/subscribers. We maintain a “unified” TheStreet app which will allow users to access our free and paid content in a single environment. Finally, we continue to focus on increasing the engagement our visitors have with our online and mobile offerings, measured by visits per visitor, page views per visit and by time spent on site, and we continuously seek to improve the experience our digital products offer.
 
We consistently obtain exposure through other media outlets who cite our journalists and our content or who invite our editorial staff to appear on segments to provide key market commentary and consumer advice. In 2017, we were mentioned or featured in almost 100 reports by national publications and national and local broadcast media including The Wall Street Journal, The New York Times and CNBC, NBC, ABC, CBS and Fox, among others.
 
Competition
 
We compete with a broad range of content providers, newsletter publishers, event producers and information services. We face competition primarily from:
 

● | with respect to our B2B business, particularly The Deal, providers of business intelligence on mergers and acquisitions, restructurings and financings primarily to investment banks, law firms, hedge funds, private equity firms and corporate institutions, such as Bloomberg, S&P Capital IQ, Dealogic, ThomsonOne and Acuris/Mergermarket Limited; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | with respect to our B2B business, particularly BoardEx, providers of relationship capital management services and director, officer and dealmaker data, including Bloomberg, S&P Capital IQ, Dow Jones, The New York Stock Exchange, LexisNexis, Relationship Science, Equilar and Thomson Reuters; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | with respect to our B2B business, particularly RateWatch, established ratings services, such as Standard & Poor’s, Morningstar and Lipper as well as rate database providers such as Informa and SNL Financial;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | with respect to our B2C business, online content providers focused on business, personal finance or investing content, such as The Wall Street Journal Digital Network, CNN Money, Forbes.com, Reuters.com, Bloomberg.com, Seeking Alpha, Business Insider and CNBC.com, as well as portals such as Yahoo! Finance, AOL Daily Finance and MSN Money; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | with respect to our B2B and B2C businesses, publishers and distributors of traditional media with a focus on business, finance or investing, such as The Wall Street Journal and the Financial Times, personal finance talk radio programs and business television networks such as Bloomberg, CNBC and the Fox Business Channel as well as investment newsletter publishers, such as The Motley Fool, Stansberry & Associates Investment Research and InvestorPlace Media.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Many of these competitors have significantly greater scale and resources than we do. Additionally, advances in technology have reduced the cost of production and online distribution of written, audio and video content, which has resulted in the proliferation of small, often self-published providers of free content.
 
Advertisers and their agencies often look to independent measurement data such as that provided by comScore, Inc., a leading cross-platform measurement company that measures audiences and consumer behavior, or comScore, in order to gain a sense of the performance of various sites, in relation to their peer category, when determining where to allocate advertising dollars. TheStreet.com has consistently ranked as one of the top websites by comScore for users having a portfolio value over $1 million, a household income over $75,000 and those checking stock quotes.
 
Our ability to compete successfully depends on many factors, including the format, quality, originality, timeliness, insightfulness and trustworthiness of our content and that of our competitors, the reputations of our contributors and our brands, the success of our recommendations and research, our ability to introduce products and services that keep pace with new technology and distribution methods, investing trends, the experience we and our competitors offer our users and the effectiveness of our sales and marketing efforts.

Infrastructure, Operations and Technology
 
B2B
 
The Deal and BoardEx are based on proprietary and commercial systems developed for consumption by institutional clients. Both our BoardEx and The Deal systems consist of a mixture of proprietary and commercial software hosted within the Amazon Web Services environment.  The Deal system distributes the content via an email delivery system or web based platform. The BoardEx system distributes data to multiple client platforms either hosted within Amazon Web Services or on the clients’ premises via commercial software before redistributing it via a standard email delivery system, data feed processes, or to a web interface.
 
RateWatch maintains a constantly-updated database of deposit, loan and fee rate data from over 100,000 financial institutions using proprietary software and commercial software both internally and within the Amazon Web Services environment. This historical and real-time rate data is licensed to financial institutions, government agencies, educational researchers and commercial organizations. Data is provided in formats ranging from standard rate templates to large raw data files for use with third party analytical tools. The RateWatch product line also includes banking-related product and fee comparisons, financial strength reporting, educational webinars, mystery shopping and consumer and financial institution surveys.
 
B2C
 
Our main technological infrastructure consists of proprietary and Drupal-based content management, subscription management and e-commerce systems provided by third party vendors.  We also utilize the services of third-party cloud computing providers, more specifically Amazon Web Services, as well as content delivery networks such as Fastly, to help us efficiently distribute our content to our customers and ensure resiliency and scalability of service. Our content-management systems are based on proprietary software, Drupal and Kaltura Content Management Systems. They allow our stories, videos and data to be prepared for distribution online to a large audience. These systems enable us to distribute and syndicate our content economically and efficiently to multiple destinations in a variety of technical formats.
 
Intellectual Property
 
To protect our intellectual property, or IP, we rely on a combination of trademarks, copyrights, patent protection, confidentiality agreements and various other contractual arrangements with our employees, affiliates, customers, strategic partners, vendors and others. We have many trademark registrations and copyrights in the United States and internationally, and have pending trademark and patent applications in the United States and internationally. In addition, our Code of Conduct and Business Ethics, employee handbook, and other internal policies seek to protect our IP against misappropriation, infringement, and unfair competition. We also utilize various tools to police the Internet to monitor piracy and unauthorized use of our content. Finally, whether we are contracting out our IP or licensing third-party content and/or technology, we incorporate contractual provisions to protect our IP and seek indemnification for any third-party infringement claims.
 
However, we cannot provide any guarantee that the foregoing provisions will be adequate to protect us from third-party claims or that these provisions will prevent the theft of our IP, as we may be unable to detect the unauthorized use of, or take appropriate steps to enforce, our IP rights. Failure to adequately protect our intellectual property could harm our brand, devalue our proprietary content, and affect our ability to compete effectively. Further, any infringement claims, even if not meritorious, could result in the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources on our part, which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.

Customers
 
For the year ended December 31, 2017, no single customer accounted for 10% or more of our consolidated revenue. As of December 31, 2017, one single customer accounted for more than 10% of our gross accounts receivable balance.
Employees
 
As of December 31, 2017, we had 597 full-time employees with approximately 56% located in Chennai, India. We have never had a work stoppage and none of our employees are represented under collective bargaining agreements. We consider our relations with our employees to be good.
Government Regulation
 
We are subject to government regulation in connection with securities laws and regulations applicable to all publicly-owned companies, as well as laws and regulations applicable to businesses generally, including privacy regulations and taxes levied adopted at the local, state, national and international levels. In recent years, consumer protection regulations, particularly in connection with the Internet, has become more aggressive, and we expect that new laws and regulations will continue to be enacted at the local, state, national and international levels. Such new legislation, alone or combined with increasingly aggressive enforcement of existing laws, could have a material adverse effect on our future operating performance and business due to increased compliance costs.
Available Information
 
We were founded in 1996 as a limited liability company, and reorganized as a C corporation in 1998. We consummated our initial public offering in 1999 and we file annual, quarterly and current reports, proxy statements and other information with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC.
