 Item 1. Business
 Overview
 We are a Houston, Texas based independent oil and natural gas company. Our business is to maximize production and cash flow from our offshore properties in the shallow waters of the Gulf of Mexico (“GOM”) and onshore properties in Texas and Wyoming and to use that cash flow to explore, develop, exploit, increase production from and acquire crude oil and natural gas properties in onshore West Texas, the Texas Gulf Coast and the Rocky Mountain regions of the United States.
 The following table lists our primary producing areas as of December 31, 2017:

Location | Formation 
Gulf of Mexico | Offshore Louisiana - water depths less than 300 feet
Madison and Grimes counties, Texas | Woodbine (Upper Lewisville) 
Pecos County, Texas | Southern Delaware Basin (Wolfcamp) 
Other Texas Gulf Coast | Conventional and smaller unconventional formations 
Zavala and Dimmit counties, Texas | Buda / Austin Chalk 
Weston County, Wyoming | Muddy Sandstone 
Sublette County, Wyoming | Jonah Field (1)

  Since October 2013, upon the merger with Crimson Exploration Inc. (“Crimson”) (the “Merger”), and prior to the decline in crude oil and natural gas prices in 2015, we focused our drilling efforts on liquids-rich horizontal resource plays. Beginning in the second half of 2015, we reduced our drilling program in response to the challenging commodity price environment, and instead focused on: (i) the preservation of our strong and flexible financial position, including limiting our overall capital expenditure budget; (ii) the identification of opportunities for cost and production efficiencies in all areas of our operations; and (iii) the maintenance of core leases and the continued identification of new resource potential opportunities. As a result, until the latter half of 2016, our only drilling activity was in Weston County, Wyoming, where we completed our third well targeting the Muddy Sandstone formation. During the third quarter of 2016, we acquired a 12,100 gross acre position (5,000 net) in the Southern Delaware Basin in Pecos County, Texas (the “Acquisition”), and as of December 31, 2017, had increased our acreage in the Southern Delaware Basin to 16,500 gross acres (6,800 net). Since the Acquisition, we have begun production from seven wells in the Southern Delaware Basin and are waiting on completion of an eighth well. We currently expect that the Southern Delaware Basin position will continue to be the primary focus of our drilling program for 2018.
     In addition to our above producing properties, we also have (i) operated producing properties in the Haynesville Shale, Mid Bossier Shale and the James Lime formations in East Texas and (ii) operated conventional producing properties in the south and southeast areas of Texas. In December 2016, we sold our operated producing properties in the Denver Julesburg Basin (“DJ Basin”) in Weld and Adams counties in Colorado.
     During the quarter ended September 30, 2016, in conjunction with the Acquisition, we completed an underwritten public offering of 5,360,000 shares of our common stock for net proceeds of approximately $50.5 million, which were used to fund the initial purchase of this acreage and provide funding for the costs associated with drilling our initial wells in the Southern Delaware Basin. 
 Our production for the year ended December 31, 2017 was approximately 20.1 Bcfe (or 55.1 Mmcfe/d), was 68% from our offshore properties and was 69% natural gas. Our production for the three months ended December 31, 2017 was approximately 4.8 Bcfe (or 51.8 Mmcfe/d), was 66% from our offshore properties and was 68% natural gas. As of December 31, 2017, our proved reserves were approximately 65% proved developed, were 40% offshore, were 48% natural gas and were 98% attributed to wells and properties operated by us.

 As of December 31, 2017, our proved reserves, as estimated by Netherland, Sewell & Associates, Inc. (“NSAI”) and William M. Cobb and Associates (“Cobb”), our independent petroleum engineering firms, in accordance with reserve reporting guidelines required by the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), were approximately 189.3 Bcfe, consisting of 91.7 Bcf of natural gas, 10.6 MMBbl of crude oil and condensate and 5.6 MMBbl of natural gas liquids (“NGLs”), with a present value, discounted at a 10% rate (PV‑10), of $257.3 million, and a Standardized Measure of Discounted Future Net Cash Flows (“Standardized Measure”) of $255.9 million. PV-10 as of December 31, 2017 was based on adjusted prices of $2.92 per MMbtu of natural gas, $47.41 per barrel of oil, and $18.59 per barrel of NGLs. PV-10 is not an accounting principle generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”) and is therefore classified as a non-GAAP financial measure. A reconciliation of our Standardized Measure to PV‑10 is provided under “Item 2. Properties ‑ PV-10”.
 The following summary table sets forth certain information with respect to our proved reserves as of December 31, 2017 (excluding reserves attributable to our investment in Exaro), as estimated by NSAI and Cobb, and our net average daily production for the year ended December 31, 2017:

  Our Strategy
 Our long-term business strategy is: 
 • Enhancing our portfolio by dedicating the majority of our drilling capital to our oil and liquids-rich opportunities. A key element of our long term strategy is to continue to develop the oil and natural gas liquids resource potential that we believe exists in numerous formations within our various oil/liquids weighted resource plays, and where possible, to expand our presence in those plays. Due to the current superior economics of oil production, as compared to natural gas, we expect to focus on oil and liquids-weighted opportunities as we strive to transition from a heavily weighted natural gas production profile to a more balanced reserve and production profile between oil/liquids and natural gas. For the foreseeable future, we will focus our drilling capital on the Southern Delaware Basin position, as we believe it provides excellent returns in the current oil price environment. We believe we possess the flexibility to focus on the development of our Southern Delaware Basin potential without jeopardizing our acreage position in other areas, as the vast majority of our acreage in those other areas is held by production or has longer term lease terms.   
 • Pursuing accretive, opportunistic acquisitions that meet our strategic and financial objectives. We intend to evaluate opportunistic acquisitions of crude oil and natural gas properties, both undeveloped and developed, in areas where we currently have a presence and/or specific operating expertise, and to pursue undeveloped acreage positions, at reasonable cost, in new areas that we believe to be complementary to our existing plays and feel have significant exploration, exploitation or operational upside. We believe that the ongoing low commodity price environment might provide growth opportunities for us through potential corporate combinations.
 • Selectively exploiting, in a higher commodity price environment, our existing onshore producing conventional natural gas property portfolio to generate additional cash flows. We believe our multi-year drilling inventory of 

 
  2

 
exploitation opportunities on our existing onshore conventional natural gas oriented producing properties provides us with a solid, dependable platform for future reserve and production growth. We will continuously monitor the commodity price environment and technical advancements, and if warranted, make adjustments to our investment strategy.
 We currently expect to focus our 2018 capital program on our Southern Delaware Basin acreage, which is expected to continue to generate positive returns on our drilling investment in the current price environment. Assuming results are as expected, and market conditions remain favorable, we will proceed to drill throughout the year. Until a sustained improvement in commodity prices occurs, we do not currently expect to devote meaningful capital to our other areas, but will devote capital to those areas to fulfill leasehold commitments, preserve core acreage and, where determined appropriate to do so, expand our presence in those existing areas. We will continue to make balance sheet strength a priority in 2018 by limiting capital expenditures to a level that can be funded through internally generated cash flow and non-core asset sales. We will continue to evaluate new organic opportunities for growth and will continue to evaluate pursuing stressed or distressed acquisition opportunities that may arise in this low price environment. We retain the flexibility to be more aggressive in our drilling plans should planned results exceed expectations, should commodity prices continue to improve, and/or we continue to show progress in reducing our drilling and completion costs, thereby making an expansion of our drilling program an appropriate business decision. Our 2018 capital expenditure budget is initially expected to include the following: 

· | Pecos County, Texas – We forecast capital expenditures of approximately $52 million for drilling in this area.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Other – We forecast capital expenditures of approximately $2 million for unproved leasehold acquisition costs.

  Properties
 Offshore Gulf of Mexico 
 As of December 31, 2017, our offshore assets consisted of six federal and five state of Louisiana company-operated wells in the shallow waters of the GOM. These 11 wells are located in two fields. The following summary table sets forth certain information with respect to our offshore reserves as of December 31, 2017 and average daily offshore production for the year ended December 31, 2017:
 | | | | | | | | | | Average Daily
 | Estimated Proved | % Crude Oil / | | % Natural | | % Natural Gas | | % Proved | | Production 
Field | Reserves (Bcfe) | Condensate | | Gas | | Liquids | | Developed | | (Mmcfe/d) 
Dutch and Mary Rose | 72.0 | 3 | % | 81 | % | 16 | % | 100 | % | 33.7 
Vermilion 170 | 3.4 | 4 | % | 84 | % | 12 | % | 100 | % | 3.8 
South Timbalier 17 | — | — | % | — | % | — | % | — | % | 0.2 
Total | 75.4 | | | | | | | | | 37.7 

  Dutch and Mary Rose Field
 We operate five wells located in federal waters at Eugene Island 10 (“Dutch”), and five wells located in adjacent Louisiana state waters (“Mary Rose”). All Dutch and Mary Rose wells flow to a Company-owned and operated production platform at Eugene Island 11. While we do not own the lease for the Eugene Island 11 block, this does not impact our ability to operate our facilities located on that block. Operators in the GOM may place platforms and facilities on any location without having to own the lease, provided that permission and proper permits from the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement (“BSEE”) have been obtained. We have obtained such permission and permits. We installed our facilities at Eugene Island 11 because that was the optimal gathering location in proximity to our wells and marketing pipelines.
 From our production platform we are able to access two separate gas markets thereby minimizing downtime risk and providing the ability to select the best sales price for our natural gas production. Oil and natural gas production can flow through our 20” gas pipeline to third-party owned and operated onshore processing facilities near Patterson, Louisiana. Alternatively, natural gas can flow via our 8” pipeline to a third-party owned and operated onshore processing facility at Burns Point, Louisiana. We have recently completed a 6” oil pipeline to third-party owned and operated onshore processing facilities in St. Mary Parish, Louisiana, providing us with two separate oil markets. Production facilities include a turbine type compressor capable of servicing all ten Dutch and Mary Rose wells at the Eugene Island 11 platform. Condensate can also flow to onshore markets and multiple refineries.

 Vermilion 170 Field
 We own and operate one well located in federal waters with a dedicated production facility at Vermilion 170. Production from this platform, which includes compression equipment, flows via the Sea Robin Pipeline to a third-party owned and operated onshore processing plant.  Other Offshore
 Our Ship Shoal 263 field, located in federal waters, and South Timbalier 17 field, located in Louisiana state waters, were historically included in “Other Offshore”. During 2017, the Ship Shoal field was permanently plugged and abandoned, and the production facilities were removed and sold. In late 2017, the South Timbalier well was permanently plugged and abandoned, and the production facilities were removed. Onshore Properties
 Southern Delaware Basin  
 Since the closing of the Acquisition in late July 2016, we and our partner have increased our leasehold footprint to approximately 6,800 acres, net to Contango. As of December 31, 2017, we currently estimate that we have proven reserves of 55.5 Bcfe and close to 400 gross drilling locations, initially targeting the Wolfcamp A, Wolfcamp B and Second Bone Spring formations. Substantially all of the locations can accommodate 10,000 foot laterals. As previously disclosed, during 2017 we brought our first four Southern Delaware Basin wells on production (two in the Upper Wolfcamp A, one in the Middle Wolfcamp A, and one in the Lower Wolfcamp A), with an average maximum 30 day initial production rate (“IP”) of 968 Boed (72% oil).  
     In mid-December 2017, we brought our fifth horizontal well on production, the Crusader #1H, targeting the Lower Wolfcamp A. This well was drilled to a total measured depth (“TMD”) of 20,275 feet, including a 10,184 foot lateral, and was completed with 50 stages of fracture stimulation, reaching a 30-day average IP of 389 Boed (67% oil). Our sixth well, the Ragin Bull #3H, targeting the Lower Wolfcamp A, was spud in November 2017. This well was drilled to a TMD of 20,570 feet, including a 10,325 foot lateral, and was completed with 50 stages of fracture stimulation. Production began in January 2018, and the well reached a 30-day average IP of 716 Boed (67% oil).   
     Our seventh well, the River Rattler #1H, our first Wolfcamp B test, was spud in December 2017. This well was drilled to a TMD of 20,710 feet, including a 10,275 foot lateral, and was completed with 50 stages of fracture stimulation. Production is expected to begin in mid-March 2018. We continue to identify cost efficiencies in our drilling efforts, as evidenced by the fact that the Ragin Bull #3H and River Rattler #1H have been our most efficient wells to date, taking only 27 days from spud to TMD.  
     Our eighth well, the Ragin Bull #2H, our second Wolfcamp B test, was spud in January 2018. This well was drilled to a TMD of 20,624 feet, including a 10,344 foot lateral, and is currently waiting on completion with 50 stages of fracture stimulation. There have been multiple Wolfcamp B wells adjacent to our leasehold that have been put on production recently by our offset operators, thereby derisking the Wolfcamp B in the area and providing encouragement for the development of that formation on our acreage.
 Southeast Texas (Woodbine)
 As of December 31, 2017, our Southeast Texas region included approximately 29,300 gross (17,100 net) acres, proven reserves of 30.9 Bcfe, and 81 gross (45 net) producing wells. No drilling capital was allocated to this area in 2016 or 2017 due to the low commodity price environment. For 2018, our current budget does not anticipate further drilling in this area, but should we experience sustained improvement in commodity prices, we could increase our activity. We currently have approximately 12,100 net acres in Madison and Grimes counties, with a multi-year inventory of potential drilling locations encompassing the Woodbine, Eagle Ford Shale and/or Georgetown/Buda formations.  South Texas (Buda/Eagle Ford)
 As of December 31, 2017, our South Texas region included approximately 89,600 gross (40,800 net) acres, proven reserves of 25.7 Bcfe, and 217 gross (96.5 net) producing wells. We believe approximately 16,700 gross (7,800 net) acres to be prospective for the Buda and Eagle Ford Shale plays. No drilling activity has been conducted in 

 
  4

 
this area since 2014 due to the reduction in our capital expenditure programs in response to the commodity price environment. We do not anticipate devoting any drilling capital to this area in 2018.
 Our estimated net proven Buda/Eagle Ford reserves in this area were 12.2 Bcfe, comprised of 94% liquids, with 41 gross (17.6 net) producing wells, as of December 31, 2017.
 South Texas (Elm Hill Project)  
 As of December 31, 2017, we held approximately 4,900 gross acres (2,700 net) in Fayette, Gonzales, Caldwell and Bastrop counties, Texas. There was no drilling activity in 2016 or 2017, and we recognized an impairment expense of $6.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The Company and its partner have no plans to further test this area. 
 The remaining 68,000 gross (30,300 net) acres in our South Texas region are located in our conventional fields that produce primarily from the Wilcox, Frio, and Vicksburg sands. Our estimated net proved conventional reserves in this region were 12.1 Bcfe, comprised of 71% gas, with 176 gross (78.9 net) producing wells, as of December 31, 2017. 
 Weston County, Wyoming (N. Cheyenne Project)
 In 2015, we began drilling the first of three successful wells in this area targeting the Muddy Sandstone formation. Based on current results, a sustained improvement in oil prices will be needed to justify allocation of drilling capital to this area compared to our Southern Delaware Basin position. As a result of drilling these wells, we have satisfied the right to earn 35,000 net acres (approximately 4% of which is held by production).  Natrona County, Wyoming (FRAMS Project) 
 We spud our first well targeting the Mowry Shale in 2015, which proved to be unsuccessful. As a result, we recognized $6.7 million in exploration expenses for the cost of drilling the well for the year ended December 31, 2016 and $2.9 million in impairment expense in 2016 related to our unproved acreage in Natrona County, Wyoming. No drilling activity was conducted in this area in 2017. Other (East Texas)
 As of December 31, 2017, our East Texas region included approximately 6,000 gross (3,600 net) acres primarily in San Augustine County, with proven reserves of 0.5 Bcfe comprised of 90% gas, and 10 gross (5.1 net) producing wells. We believe that the further exploitation of our acreage in the Haynesville, Mid-Bossier and James Lime formations may provide long-term natural gas reserve and production growth potential in the future. There has been renewed interest in this area by offset operators as they experiment with new frac techniques and refracing of previously drilled wells. We will continue to monitor that activity and results; however, we do not anticipate devoting any capital to this area during 2018. As of December 31, 2017, substantially all of our acreage in our East Texas region was held by production. Other (Colorado) 
 On December 30, 2016, we completed the sale of all of our Colorado assets to an independent oil and gas company for an aggregate purchase price of $5.0 million, subject to normal post-closing adjustments. The properties sold consisted of approximately 16,000 gross (11,200 net) acres and associated producing vertical wells primarily in Adams and Weld counties. At the time of sale, the sold properties had proved reserves of 4.2 Bcfe and during 2016 average net daily production was 0.4 Mmcfe/d. Other
 As of December 31, 2017, we held approximately 8,300 gross (6,000 net) mostly undeveloped acres in Louisiana, Mississippi, and North Texas.
 Impairment of Long-Lived Assets
 We recognized approximately $1.8 million in non-cash impairment charges in 2017. Under US GAAP, an impairment charge is required when the unamortized capital cost of any individual property within the Company’s 

 
  5

 
proved property base exceeds the risked estimated future net cash flows from the proved, probable and possible reserves for that property. Included in the impairment charge for the year is approximately $0.3 million related to proved property impairment for our Tuscaloosa Marine Shale (“TMS”) properties, a shale play in central Louisiana and Mississippi, due to revised estimated reserves. The 2017 impairment charges also consist of $1.5 million related to the partial impairment of two unused offshore platforms in onshore storage. 
 If oil and/or natural gas prices decline from prices at December 31, 2017, we may be required to record additional non-cash impairment in the future, thereby impacting our financial results for that period.
 Onshore Investments
 Jonah Field – Sublette County, Wyoming
 Our wholly-owned subsidiary, Contaro Company (“Contaro”), owns a 37% ownership interest in Exaro. As of December 31, 2017, we had invested approximately $46.9 million in Exaro, with no anticipation of making any additional equity contributions, as our commitment to invest in Exaro expired on March 31, 2017. We account for Contaro’s ownership in Exaro using the equity method of accounting, and therefore, do not include its share of individual operating results, reserves or production in those reported for our consolidated results.
 As of December 31, 2017, Exaro had 645 wells on production over its 5,760 gross acres (1,040 net acres), with a working interest between 2.4% and 32.5%. These wells were producing at a rate of approximately 26 Mmcfe/d, net to Exaro. The operator of these interests has applied for multiple drilling permits for horizontal wells that will be located on parts of our acreage. Exaro’s working interest in the drilling spacing units for the applied for horizontal wells ranges from 1% to 6%. As of December 31, 2017, the operator has been approved to drill two horizontal wells, in which Exaro has a net working interest of 2.4%. For the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company recognized a net investment gain of approximately $2.7 million, net of no tax expense, as a result of its investment in Exaro. As of December 31, 2017, reserves attributable to our investment in Exaro were 30.7 Bcfe. See Note 10 to our Financial Statements - “Investment in Exaro Energy III LLC” for additional details related to this investment. 
 Title to Properties
 From time to time, we are involved in legal proceedings relating to claims associated with ownership interests in our properties. We believe we have satisfactory title to all of our producing properties in accordance with standards generally accepted in the oil and gas industry. Our properties are subject to customary royalty interests, liens incident to operating agreements, and liens for current taxes and other burdens, which we believe do not materially interfere with the use of or affect the value of such properties. As is customary in the industry in the case of undeveloped properties, little investigation of record title is made at the time of acquisition (other than a preliminary review of local records). Detailed investigations, including a title opinion rendered by a licensed independent third party attorney, are typically made before commencement of drilling operations.
 We have granted mortgage liens on substantially all of our natural gas and crude oil properties to secure our senior secured revolving credit facility. These mortgages and the related credit agreement contain substantial restrictions and operating covenants that are customarily found in credit agreements of this type. See Note 12 to our Financial Statements ‑ “Long-Term Debt” for further information.
 Marketing and Pricing
 We derive our revenue principally from the sale of natural gas and oil. As a result, our revenues are determined, to a large degree, by prevailing natural gas and oil prices. We sell a portion of our natural gas production to purchasers pursuant to sales agreements which contain a primary term of up to three years and crude oil and condensate production to purchasers under sales agreements with primary terms of up to one year. The sales prices for natural gas are tied to industry standard published index prices, subject to negotiated price adjustments, while the sale prices for crude oil are tied to industry standard posted prices subject to negotiated price adjustments.
 We typically utilize commodity price hedge instruments to minimize exposure to declining prices on our crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids production, by using a series of swaps and/or costless collars. Unrealized gains or losses associated with hedges vary period to period, and will be a function of hedges in place, the strike prices of those hedges and the forward curve pricing for the commodities being hedged.

  Decreases in commodity prices would adversely affect our revenues, profits and the value of our proved reserves. Historically, the prices received for natural gas and oil have fluctuated widely. Among the factors that can cause these fluctuations are:

· | The domestic and foreign supply of natural gas and oil.
--+--------------------------------------------------------


· | Overall economic conditions.
--+-----------------------------


· | The level of consumer product demand.
--+--------------------------------------


· | Adverse weather conditions and natural disasters.

· | The price and availability of competitive fuels such as heating oil and coal.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Political conditions in the Middle East and other natural gas and oil producing regions.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | The level of LNG imports/exports.

 Historically, we have been dependent upon a few purchasers for a significant portion of our revenue. The largest purchaser of our production for the year ended December 31, 2017, calculated on an equivalent basis, was ConocoPhillips Company (51.2%). This concentration may increase our overall exposure to credit risk, and our purchasers will likely be similarly affected by changes in economic and industry conditions. Our financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected if one or more of our significant purchasers fails to pay us or ceases to acquire our production on terms that are favorable to us. However, we believe our current purchasers could be replaced by other purchasers under contracts with similar terms and conditions.
 Competition
 The oil and gas industry is highly competitive, and we compete with numerous other companies. Our competitors in the exploration, development, acquisition and production business include major integrated oil and gas companies as well as numerous independent companies, including many that have significantly greater financial resources.
 The primary areas in which we encounter substantial competition are in locating and acquiring desirable leasehold acreage for our drilling and development operations, locating and acquiring attractive producing oil and gas properties and obtaining purchasers and transporters for the natural gas and crude oil we produce. There is also competition between producers of natural gas and crude oil and other industries producing alternative energy and fuel. Furthermore, competitive conditions may be substantially affected by various forms of energy legislation and/or regulation considered from time to time by federal, state and local governments; however, it is not possible to predict the nature of any such legislation or regulation that may ultimately be adopted or its effects upon our future operations. Such laws and regulations may, however, substantially increase the costs of exploring for, developing or producing natural gas and crude oil and may prevent or delay the commencement or continuation of a given operation. The effect of these risks cannot be accurately predicted.
 Governmental Regulations and Industry Matters    Industry Regulations
 The availability of a ready market for crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids production depends upon numerous factors beyond our control. These factors include regulation of crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids production, federal, state and local regulations governing environmental quality and pollution control, state limits on allowable rates of production by well or proration unit, the amount of crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids available for sale, the availability of adequate pipeline and other transportation and processing facilities, and the marketing of competitive fuels. For example, a productive natural gas well may be “shut-in” because of an oversupply of natural gas or lack of an available natural gas pipeline in the area in which the well is located. State and federal regulations generally are intended to prevent waste of crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids, protect rights to produce crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids between owners in a common reservoir, control the amount of crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids produced by assigning allowable rates of production, and protect the environment. Pipelines are subject to the jurisdiction of various federal, state and local agencies. We are also subject to changing and extensive tax laws, the effects of which cannot be predicted.
 The following discussion summarizes the regulation of the U.S. oil and gas industry. Such statutes, rules, regulations and government orders may be changed or reinterpreted from time to time in response to economic or political conditions, and there can be no assurance that such changes or reinterpretations will not materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. The following discussion is not intended to constitute a complete discussion of the various statutes, rules, regulations and governmental orders to which our operations may be subject.
 Regulation of Crude Oil, Natural Gas and Natural Gas Liquids Exploration and Production
 Our operations are subject to various types of regulation at the federal, state and local levels. Such regulation includes requiring permits for the drilling of wells, maintaining bonding requirements in order to drill or operate wells and regulating the location of wells, the method of drilling and casing wells, the surface use and restoration of properties upon which wells are drilled, the plugging and abandoning of wells and the disposal of fluids used in connection with operations. Our operations are also subject to various conservation laws and regulations. These include the regulation of the size of drilling and spacing units or proration units and the density of wells that may be drilled in and the unitization or pooling of crude oil and natural gas properties. In this regard, some states allow the forced pooling or integration of tracts to facilitate exploration while other states rely primarily or exclusively on voluntary pooling of lands and leases. In 

 
  8

 
areas where pooling is voluntary, it may be more difficult to form units, and therefore more difficult to develop a project, if the operator owns less than 100% of the leasehold. In addition, state conservation laws, which establish maximum rates of production from crude oil and natural gas wells, generally prohibit the venting or flaring of natural gas and impose certain requirements regarding the ratability of production. The effect of these regulations may limit the amount of crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids we can produce from our wells and may limit the number of wells or the locations at which we can drill. The regulatory burden on the oil and gas industry increases our costs of doing business and, consequently, affects our profitability. Inasmuch as such laws and regulations are frequently expanded, amended and interpreted, we are unable to predict the future cost or impact of complying with such regulations.
 Regulation of Sales and Transportation of Natural Gas
 Federal legislation and regulatory controls have historically affected the price of natural gas produced by us, and the manner in which such production is transported and marketed. Under the Natural Gas Act of 1938 (the “NGA”), the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (the “FERC”) regulates the interstate transportation and the sale in interstate commerce for resale of natural gas. Effective January 1, 1993, the Natural Gas Wellhead Decontrol Act (the “Decontrol Act”) deregulated natural gas prices for all “first sales” of natural gas, including all sales by us of our own production. As a result, all of our domestically produced natural gas may now be sold at market prices, subject to the terms of any private contracts that may be in effect. However, the Decontrol Act did not affect the FERC’s jurisdiction over natural gas transportation.
 Section 1(b) of the NGA exempts gas gathering facilities from the FERC's jurisdiction. We believe that the gas gathering facilities we own meet the traditional tests the FERC has used to establish a pipeline system's status as a non-jurisdictional gatherer. There is, however, no bright-line test for determining the jurisdictional status of pipeline facilities. Moreover, the distinction between FERC-regulated transmission services and federally unregulated gathering services is the subject of litigation from time to time, so the classification and regulation of some of our gathering facilities may be subject to change based on future determinations by the FERC and the courts. While we own some gas gathering facilities, we also depend on gathering facilities owned and operated by third parties to gather production from our properties, and therefore, we are affected by the rates charged by these third parties for gathering services. To the extent that changes in federal or state regulation affect the rates charged for gathering services, we also may be affected by these changes. Accordingly, we do not anticipate that we would be affected any differently than similarly situated gas producers.
 Under the provisions of the Energy Policy Act of 2005 (the “2005 Act”), the NGA has been amended to prohibit market manipulation by any person, including marketers, in connection with the purchase or sale of natural gas, and the FERC has issued regulations to implement this prohibition. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (the “CFTC”) also holds authority to monitor certain segments of the physical and futures energy commodities market including oil and natural gas. With regard to physical purchases and sales of natural gas and other energy commodities, and any related hedging activities that we undertake, we are thus required to observe anti-market manipulation laws and related regulations enforced by FERC and/or the CFTC. FERC holds substantial enforcement authority, including the ability to potentially assess maximum civil penalties of approximately $1.24 million per day per violation, subject to annual adjustment for inflation. CFTC also holds substantial enforcement authority, including the ability to potentially assess maximum civil penalties of up to approximately $1.12 million per day per violation or triple the monetary gain.
 Under the 2005 Act, the FERC has also established regulations that are intended to increase natural gas pricing transparency through, among other things, new reporting requirements and expanded dissemination of information about the availability and prices of gas sold. For example, on December 26, 2007, FERC issued a final rule on the annual natural gas transaction reporting requirements, as amended by subsequent orders on rehearing, or Order No. 704. Order No. 704 requires buyers and sellers of natural gas above a de minimis level, including entities not otherwise subject to FERC jurisdiction, to submit on May 1 of each year an annual report to FERC describing their aggregate volumes of natural gas purchased or sold at wholesale in the prior calendar year to the extent such transactions utilize, contribute to or may contribute to the formation of price indices. Order No. 704 also requires market participants to indicate whether they report prices to any index publishers and, if so, whether their reporting complies with FERC’s policy statement on price reporting. It is the responsibility of the reporting entity to determine which individual transactions should be reported based on the guidance of Order No. 704 as clarified in orders on clarification and rehearing. In addition, to the extent that we enter into transportation contracts with interstate pipelines that are subject to FERC regulation, we are subject to FERC requirements related to use of such interstate capacity. Any failure on our part to comply with the FERC’s regulations could result in the imposition of civil and criminal penalties.

 Our natural gas sales are affected by intrastate and interstate gas transportation regulation. Following the Congressional passage of the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978 (the “NGPA”), the FERC adopted a series of regulatory changes that have significantly altered the transportation and marketing of natural gas. Beginning with the adoption of Order No. 436, issued in October 1985, the FERC has implemented a series of major restructuring orders that have required interstate pipelines, among other things, to perform “open access” transportation of gas for others, “unbundle” their sales and transportation functions, and allow shippers to release their unneeded capacity temporarily and permanently to other shippers. As a result of these changes, sellers and buyers of gas have gained direct access to the particular interstate pipeline services they need and are better able to conduct business with a larger number of counterparties. We believe these changes generally have improved our access to markets while, at the same time, substantially increasing competition in the natural gas marketplace. It remains to be seen, however, what effect the FERC’s other activities will have on access to markets, the fostering of competition and the cost of doing business. We cannot predict what new or different regulations the FERC and other regulatory agencies may adopt, or what effect subsequent regulations may have on our activities. We do not believe that we will be affected by any such new or different regulations materially differently than any other seller of natural gas with which we compete.
 In the past, Congress has been very active in the area of gas regulation. However, as discussed above, the more recent trend has been in favor of deregulation, or “lighter handed” regulation, and the promotion of competition in the gas industry. There regularly are other legislative proposals pending in the federal and state legislatures that, if enacted, would significantly affect the natural gas industry. At the present time, it is impossible to predict what proposals, if any, might actually be enacted by Congress or the various state legislatures and what effect, if any, such proposals might have on us. We do not believe that we will be affected by any such new legislative proposals materially differently than any other seller of natural gas with which we compete.
 Oil Price Controls and Transportation Rates 
 Sales prices of crude oil, condensate and gas liquids by us are not currently regulated and are made at market prices. Our sales of these commodities are, however, subject to laws and to regulations issued by the Federal Trade Commission (the “FTC”) prohibiting manipulative or fraudulent conduct in the wholesale petroleum market. The FTC holds substantial enforcement authority under these regulations, including the ability to potentially assess maximum civil penalties of approximately $1.18 million per day per violation, subject to annual adjustment for inflation. Our sales of these commodities, and any related hedging activities, are also subject to CFTC oversight as discussed above.
 The price we receive from the sale of these products may be affected by the cost of transporting the products to market. Much of the transportation is through interstate common carrier pipelines. Effective as of January 1, 1995, the FERC implemented regulations generally grandfathering all previously approved interstate transportation rates and establishing an indexing system for those rates by which adjustments are made annually based on the rate of inflation, subject to certain conditions and limitations. The FERC’s regulation of crude oil and natural gas liquids transportation rates may tend to increase the cost of transporting crude oil and natural gas liquids by interstate pipelines, although the annual adjustments may result in decreased rates in a given year. Every five years, the FERC must examine the relationship between the annual change in the applicable index and the actual cost changes experienced in the oil pipeline industry. We are not able at this time to predict the effects of these regulations or FERC proceedings, if any, on the transportation costs associated with crude oil production from our crude oil producing operations.
 There regularly are other legislative proposals pending in the federal and state legislatures that, if enacted, would significantly affect the petroleum industry. At the present time, it is impossible to predict what proposals, if any, might actually be enacted by Congress or the various state legislatures and what effect, if any, such proposals might have on us. We do not believe that we will be affected by any such new legislative proposals materially differently than any other seller of petroleum with which we compete.
 Environmental and Occupational Health and Safety Matters 
 Our crude oil and natural gas exploration, development and production operations are subject to stringent federal, regional, state and local laws and regulations governing occupational health and safety aspects of our operations, the discharge of materials into the environment, or otherwise relating to environmental protection. Numerous governmental authorities, including the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (the “EPA”) and analogous state agencies, have the power to enforce compliance with these laws and regulations and the permits issued under them, which may cause us to incur significant capital expenditures or costly actions to achieve and maintain compliance. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of sanctions, including administrative, 

 
  10

 
civil and criminal penalties, the imposition of investigatory, remedial and corrective action obligations, the occurrence of delays or restrictions in permitting or performance of projects and the issuance of orders enjoining some or all of our operations in affected areas. Public interest in the protection of the environment has increased dramatically in recent years. The trend in environmental legislation and regulations in recent years has been to place more restrictions and limitations on activities that may affect the environment, which is expected to result in increased costs of doing business and consequently affect profitability.
 The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, as amended, (“CERCLA”), also known as the “Superfund Law”, and similar state laws, impose strict joint and several liability, without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct, on certain classes of potentially responsible persons that are considered to have contributed to the release of a “hazardous substance” into the environment. These potentially responsible persons include the current or past owner or operator of the disposal site or sites where the release occurred and companies that disposed or arranged for the disposal of the hazardous substances released at the site. Persons who are or were responsible for releases of hazardous substances under CERCLA may be subject to liability for the costs of cleaning up the hazardous substances that have been released into the environment, for damages to natural resources and for the costs of certain health studies, and it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the hazardous substances released into the environment. We generate materials in the course of our operations that may be regulated as hazardous substances.
 We also generate wastes that are subject to the federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, as amended (the “RCRA”), and comparable state statutes. The RCRA imposes strict requirements on the generation, storage, treatment, transportation and disposal of nonhazardous and hazardous wastes, and the EPA and analogous state agencies stringently enforce the approved methods of management and disposal of these wastes. While the RCRA currently exempts certain drilling fluids, produced waters, and other wastes associated with exploration, development and production of crude oil and natural gas from regulation as hazardous wastes, allowing us to manage these wastes under RCRA’s less stringent non-hazardous waste requirements, we can provide no assurance that this exemption will be preserved in the future. For example, following in response to the filing of a lawsuit by several non-governmental environmental groups against the EPA for the agency’s failure to timely assess its RCRA Subtitle D criteria regulations for oil and gas wastes, EPA and the environmental groups entered into an agreement that was finalized in a consent decree issued by the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia in December 2016.  Under the decree, the EPA is required to propose no later than March 15, 2019, a rulemaking for revision of certain Subtitle D criteria regulations pertaining to oil and gas wastes or sign a determination that revision of the regulations is not necessary. If EPA proposes a rulemaking for revised oil and gas waste regulations, the Consent Decree requires that the EPA take final action following notice and comment rulemaking no later than July 15, 2021. Any removal of this exclusion could increase the amount of waste we are required to manage and dispose of as hazardous waste rather than non-hazardous waste, and could cause us to incur increased operating costs, which could have a significant impact on us as well as the natural gas and oil industry in general.
 The Clean Air Act, as amended (the “CAA”), and comparable state laws restrict the emission of air pollutants from many sources and also impose various monitoring and reporting requirements. These laws and regulations may require us to obtain pre-approval for the construction or modification of certain projects or facilities expected to produce or significantly increase air emissions, obtain and strictly comply with stringent air permit requirements or utilize specific equipment or technologies to control emissions. Obtaining permits has the potential to delay the development of crude oil and natural gas projects. Over the next several years, we may be required to incur certain capital expenditures for air pollution control equipment or other air emissions-related issues.
 Based on findings made by the EPA that emissions of carbon dioxide, methane and other greenhouse gases (“GHGs”) present an endangerment to public health and the environment, the EPA adopted regulations under existing provisions of the CAA that, among other things, impose permit reviews and restrict emissions of GHGs from certain large stationary sources. These EPA regulations could adversely affect our operations and restrict or delay our ability to obtain air permits for new or modified sources. In addition, the EPA has adopted rules requiring the monitoring and reporting of GHG emissions from specified sources in the United States on an annual basis, including certain onshore and offshore production facilities, which include the majority of our operations. We are monitoring and reporting on GHG emissions from certain of our operations.
 While Congress has, from time to time considered legislation to reduce emissions of GHGs, there has not been significant activity in the form of adopted legislation to reduce GHG emissions at the federal level in recent years. In the absence of such federal climate legislation, a number of state and regional efforts have emerged that are aimed at 

 
  11

 
tracking and/or reducing GHG emissions by means of cap and trade programs that typically require major sources of GHG emissions to acquire and surrender emission allowances in return for emitting those GHGs. Moreover, in December 2015, the United States joined other countries of the United Nations in preparing an agreement requiring member countries to review and establish goals for limiting GHG emissions. This “Paris Agreement” was signed by the United States in April 2016 and entered into force in November 2016; however, this agreement does not create any binding obligations for nations to limit their GHG emissions but, rather, includes pledges to voluntarily limit or reduce future emissions. However, in August 2017, the U.S. State Department informed the United Nations of the intent of the United States to withdraw from the Paris Agreement. The Paris Agreement provides for a four-year exit process beginning when it took effect in November 2016, which would result in an effective exit date of November 2020. The United States’ adherence to the exit process and/or the terms on which the United States may re-enter the Paris Agreement or a separately negotiated agreement are unclear at this time.
 Although it is not possible at this time to predict how legislation or new regulations that may be adopted to address GHG emissions would impact our business, any such future international, federal or state laws or regulations that impose reporting obligations on us with respect to, or require the elimination of GHG emissions from, our equipment or operations could require us to incur increased operating costs and could adversely affect demand for the oil and natural gas we produce.
 The Federal Water Pollution Control Act, as amended (the “Clean Water Act”) and analogous state laws impose restrictions and strict controls regarding the discharge of pollutants into state waters and waters of the United States. Any such discharge of pollutants into regulated waters is prohibited except in accordance with the terms of an issued permit. Spill prevention, control and countermeasure plan requirements under federal law require appropriate containment berms and similar structures to help prevent the contamination of navigable waters in the event of a petroleum hydrocarbon tank spill, rupture or leak. In addition, the Clean Water Act and analogous state laws require individual permits or coverage under general permits for discharges of storm water runoff from certain types of facilities. The Clean Water Act also prohibits the discharge of dredge and fill material in regulated waters, including wetlands, unless authorized by permit. Federal and state regulatory agencies can impose administrative, civil and criminal penalties for noncompliance with discharge permits or other requirements of the Clean Water Act and analogous state laws and regulations.
 Our oil and natural gas exploration and production operations generate produced water, drilling muds and other waste streams, some of which may be disposed via injection in underground wells situated in non-producing subsurface formations. The disposal of oil and natural gas wastes into underground injection wells are subject to the Safe Drinking Water Act, as amended (the “SDWA”), and analogous state laws. The Underground Injection Well Program under the SDWA requires that we obtain permits from the EPA or analogous state agencies for our disposal wells, establishes minimum standards for injection well operations, restricts the types and quantities that may be injected, and prohibits the migration of fluid containing any contaminants into underground sources of drinking water. Any leakage from the subsurface portions of the injection wells may cause degradation of freshwater, potentially resulting in cancellation of operations of a well, issuance of fines and penalties from governmental agencies, incurrence of expenditures for remediation of the affected resource, and imposition of liability by third parties for alternative water supplies, property damages and personal injuries. Furthermore, in response to a growing concern that the injection of  produced water and other fluids into belowground disposal wells triggers seismic activity in certain areas, some states, including Texas, where we operate, have imposed, and other states are considering imposing, additional requirements in the permitting or operation of produced water injection wells. In Texas, the Texas Railroad Commission (“TRC”) has adopted a final rule governing the permitting or re-permitting of disposal wells that requires, among other things, the submission of information on seismic events occurring within a specified radius of the disposal well location, as well as logs, geologic cross sections and structure maps relating to the disposal area in question. If the permittee or an applicant of a disposal well fails to demonstrate that the injected fluids are confined to the disposal zone or if scientific data indicates such a disposal well is likely to be or determined to be contributing to seismic activity, then the TRC may deny, modify, suspend or terminate the permit application or existing operating permit for that well. Increased regulation and attention given to induced seismicity could lead to greater opposition, including litigation, to oil and natural gas activities utilizing injection wells for produced water disposal. These existing and any new seismic requirements applicable to disposal wells that impose more stringent permitting or operational requirements could result in added costs to comply or, perhaps, may require alternative methods of disposing of produced water and other fluids, which could delay production schedules and also result in increased costs.
 The Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (the “OPA”) and regulations thereunder impose a variety of regulations on “responsible parties” related to the prevention of oil spills and liability for damages resulting from such spills in U.S. waters. The OPA applies to vessels, onshore facilities and offshore facilities, including exploration and production 

 
  12

 
facilities that may affect waters of the United States. Under OPA, responsible parties including owners and operators of onshore facilities and lessees and permittees of offshore leases may be held strictly liable for oil cleanup costs and natural resource damages as well as a variety of public and private damages that may result from oil spills. While liability limits apply in some circumstances, a party cannot take advantage of liability limits if the spill was caused by gross negligence or willful misconduct or resulted from violation of federal safety, construction or operating regulations. Few defenses exist to the liability imposed by the OPA. In addition, in January 2018, the federal Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (“BOEM”) has raised OPA’s damages liability cap to $137.7 million. OPA requires owners and operators of offshore oil production facilities to establish and maintain evidence of financial responsibility to cover costs that could be incurred in responding to an oil spill, and to prepare and submit for approval oil spill response plans. These oil spill response plans must detail the action to be taken in the event of a spill; identify contracted spill response equipment, materials, and trained personnel; and identify the time necessary to deploy these resources in the event of a spill. In addition, OPA currently requires a minimum financial responsibility demonstration of between $35 million and $150 million for companies operating on the federal Outer Continental Shelf (“OCS”) waters, including the Gulf of Mexico. We are currently required to demonstrate, on an annual basis, that we have ready access to $35 million that can be used to respond to an oil spill from our facilities on the OCS. In addition, to the extent the Company’s offshore lease operations affect state waters, the Company may be subject to additional state and local clean-up requirements or incur liability under state and local laws. 
 Hydraulic fracturing is an important and common practice that is used to stimulate production of natural gas and/or crude oil from dense subsurface rock formations. The hydraulic fracturing process involves the injection of water, sand or other proppant and chemical additives under pressure into targeted subsurface formations to stimulate production. We routinely use hydraulic fracturing techniques in many of our completion programs. Hydraulic fracturing typically is regulated by state oil and natural gas commissions, or other similar state agencies, but several federal agencies have also asserted regulatory authority over, or conducted investigations that focus upon, certain aspects of the process, including a suite of proposed rulemakings and final rules issued by the EPA and the federal Bureau of Land Management (the “BLM”), which legal requirements, to the extent finalized and implemented by the agencies, may impose more stringent requirements relating to the composition of fracturing fluids, emissions and discharges from hydraulic fracturing, chemical disclosures, and performances of fracturing activities on federal and Indian lands. Also, in December 2016, the EPA released its final report on the potential impacts of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water resources, concluding that “water cycle” activities associated with hydraulic fracturing may impact drinking water under certain circumstances. 
 Congress has from time to time considered, but not enacted, legislation to provide for federal regulation of hydraulic fracturing and to require disclosure of the chemicals used in the hydraulic fracturing process while, at the state level, several states, including Texas and Wyoming, where we operate, have adopted, and other states are considering adopting legal requirements that could impose more stringent permitting, public disclosure, or well construction requirements on hydraulic fracturing activities. States could elect to prohibit high volume hydraulic fracturing altogether, following the approach taken by the State of New York. Local government may also seek to adopt ordinances within their jurisdictions regulating the time, place and manner of drilling activities in general or hydraulic fracturing activities in particular. If new or more stringent federal, state, or local legal restrictions relating to the hydraulic fracturing process are adopted in areas where we operate, we could incur potentially significant added costs to comply with such requirements, experience delays or curtailment in the pursuit of exploration, development, or production activities, and perhaps even be precluded from drilling or completing wells.
 Oil and natural gas exploration, development and production activities on federal lands, including Indian lands and lands administered by the BLM, are subject to the National Environmental Policy Act, as amended (“NEPA”). NEPA requires federal agencies, including the BLM, to evaluate major agency actions having the potential to significantly impact the environment. In the course of such evaluations, an agency will prepare an Environmental Assessment that assesses the potential direct, indirect and cumulative impacts of a proposed project and, if necessary, will prepare a more detailed Environmental Impact Statement that may be made available for public review and comment. Governmental permits or authorizations that are subject to the requirements of NEPA are required for exploration and development projects on federal and Indian lands. This process has the potential to delay, limit or increase the cost of developing oil and natural gas projects. Authorizations under NEPA are also subject to protest, appeal or litigation, any or all of which may delay or halt projects.
 Environmental laws such as the Endangered Species Act, as amended (“ESA”), may impact exploration, development and production activities on public or private lands. The ESA provides broad protection for species of fish, wildlife and plants that are listed as threatened or endangered in the United States, and prohibits taking of endangered 

 
  13

 
species. Similar protections are offered to migratory birds under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act. Some of our facilities may be located in areas that are designated as habitat for endangered or threatened species. If endangered species are located in areas of the underlying properties where we wish to conduct seismic surveys, development activities or abandonment operations, such work could be prohibited or delayed or expensive mitigation may be required. Moreover, as a result of one or more settlements entered into by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (the “FWS”), the agency is required to make a determination on listing of numerous species as endangered or threatened under the ESA by specified timelines. The designation of previously unprotected species as threatened or endangered in areas where underlying property operations are conducted could cause us to incur increased costs arising from species protection measures, time delays or limitations on our drilling program activities, which costs delays or limitation could have an adverse impact on our ability to develop and produce reserves.
 We are subject to the requirements of the federal Occupational Safety and Health Act, as amended, and comparable state statutes, whose purpose is to protect the health and safety of workers. In addition, the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration hazard communication standard, the EPA community right-to-know regulations under Title III of the federal Superfund Amendment and Reauthorization Act and comparable state statutes require that information be maintained concerning hazardous materials used or produced in our operations and that this information be provided to employees, state and local government authorities and citizens. 
 In recent years, the BOEM and the BSEE, each agencies of the U.S. Department of the Interior, have imposed more stringent permitting procedures and regulatory safety and performance requirements for wells in federal waters. In addition, states may adopt and implement similar or more stringent legal requirements applicable to exploration and production activities in state waters. Compliance with these more stringent regulatory restrictions, together with any uncertainties or inconsistencies in current decisions and rulings by governmental agencies, delays in the processing and approval of drilling permits or exploration, development, oil spill-response and decommissioning plans, and possible additional regulatory initiatives could result in difficult and more costly actions and adversely affect or delay new drilling and ongoing development efforts. In addition, new regulatory initiatives may be adopted or enforced by the BOEM or the BSEE in the future that could result in additional costs, delays, restrictions or obligations with respect to oil and natural gas exploration and production operations conducted offshore. Any new rules, regulations or legal initiatives could delay or disrupt our operations, increase the risk of expired leases due to the time required to develop new technology, result in increased supplemental bonding requirements and limit activities in certain areas, or cause us to incur penalties, fines, or shut-in production at one or more of our facilities. If the BOEM determines that increased financial assurance is required in connection with our offshore facilities but we are unable to provide the necessary supplemental bonds or other forms of financial assurance, the BOEM could impose monetary penalties or require our operations on federal leases to be suspended or cancelled. For example, in April 2016, the BOEM published a proposed rule that would update existing air-emissions requirements relating to offshore oil and natural gas activity on the OCS. Additionally, the BOEM issued a Notice to Lessees and Operators (the “NTL #2016-N01”) that became effective in September 2016 and bolsters supplemental bonding procedures for the decommissioning of offshore wells, platforms, pipelines and other facilities. Also, if material spill incidents were to occur, the United States could elect to again issue directives to temporarily cease drilling activities and, in any event, may from time to time issue further safety and environmental laws and regulations regarding offshore oil and natural gas exploration and development, any of which developments could have a material adverse effect on our business. Any one or more of the offshore-related matters described above could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
 These regulatory actions, or any new rules, regulations or legal initiatives could delay or disrupt our operations, increase the risk of expired leases due to the time required to develop new technology, result in increased supplemental bonding and costs, and limit activities in certain areas, or cause us to incur penalties, fines, or shut-in production at one or more of our facilities or result in the suspension or cancellation of leases. Moreover, under existing BOEM rules relating to assignment of offshore leases and other legal interests on the OCS, assignors of such interest may be held jointly and severally liable for decommissioning of OCS facilities existing at the time the assignment was approved by the BOEM, in the event that the assignee is unable or unwilling to conduct required decommissioning. In the event that we, in the role of assignor, receive orders from the BOEM to decommission OCS facilities that one of our assignees of offshore facilities is unwilling or unable to perform, we could incur costs to perform those decommissioning obligations, which costs could be material. If the BOEM determines that increased financial assurance is required in connection with our or any previously assigned offshore facilities but we are unable to provide the necessary supplemental bonds or other forms of financial assurance, the BOEM could impose monetary penalties or require our operations on federal leases to be suspended or cancelled.

 During 2017, however, with the issuance of Order 3350 in May 2017 by U.S. Department of the Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke that directed the BOEM and the BSEE to reconsider a number of regulatory initiatives governing oil and natural gas exploration, development and production activities on the OCS (“Order 3350”), the BSEE and the BOEM have been directed to reconsider a number of regulatory initiatives governing offshore oil and gas safety and performance-related activities, including, for example, NTL #2016-N01 and the rules relating to blow-out preventers and well control, and provide recommendations on whether such regulatory initiatives should continue to be implemented. Moreover, Order 3350 directed the BOEM to immediately cease all activities to promulgate the April 2016 proposed rule relating to offshore air quality control. One consequence of this review is that on December 29, 2017, the BSEE published proposed revisions to its regulations regarding offshore drilling safety equipment, which proposal includes the removal of the requirement for offshore operators to certify through an independent third party that their critical safety and pollution prevention equipment (e.g., subsea safety equipment, including blowout preventers) is operational and functioning as designed in the most extreme conditions. The December 2017 proposed rule has not been finalized, and there remains substantial uncertainty as to the scope and extent of any revisions to existing oil and gas safety and performance-related regulations and other regulatory initiatives that ultimately will be adopted by the BSEE and the BOEM pursuant to those agencies’ review process.
 See “Item 1A. Risk Factors” for further discussion on hydraulic fracturing; ozone standards; climate change, including methane or other greenhouse gas emissions; releases of regulated substances; and other aspects of compliance with legal or financial assurance requirements or relating to environmental protection, including with respect to offshore leases.
 Other Laws and Regulations
 Various laws and regulations often require permits for drilling wells and also cover spacing of wells, the prevention of waste of natural gas and oil including maintenance of certain gas/oil ratios, rates of production and other matters. The effect of these laws and regulations, as well as other regulations that could be promulgated by the jurisdictions in which the Company has production, could be to limit the number of wells that could be drilled on the Company’s properties and to limit the allowable production from the successful wells completed on the Company’s properties, thereby limiting the Company’s revenues.
 Whereas the BLM administers oil and natural gas leases held by the Company on federal onshore lands, the BOEM administers the natural gas and oil leases held by the Company on federal onshore lands and offshore tracts in the OCS. The Office of Natural Resources Revenue (the “ONRR”) collects a royalty interest in these federal leases on behalf of the federal government. While the royalty interest percentage is fixed at the time that the lease is entered into, from time to time the ONRR changes or reinterprets the applicable regulations governing its royalty interests, and such action can indirectly affect the actual royalty obligation that the Company is required to pay. However, the Company believes that the regulations generally do not impact the Company to any greater extent than other similarly situated producers. 
 To cover the various obligations of lessees on the OCS, such as the cost to plug and abandon wells, decommission or remove platforms and pipelines, and clear the seafloor of obstructions at the end of production (collectively, “decommissioning obligations”), the BOEM generally requires that lessees post supplemental bonds or other acceptable financial assurances that such obligations will be met.  Historically, our financial assurance costs to satisfy decommissioning obligations have not had a material adverse effect on our results of operations; however, the BOEM continues to consider imposing more stringent financial assurance requirements on offshore operators on the OCS. For example, the BOEM issued NTL #2016-N01 that went into effect in September 2016 and augments requirements for the posting of additional financial assurance by offshore lessees, among others, to assure that sufficient funds are available to satisfy decommissioning obligations on the OCS. If the BOEM determines under this new NTL that a company does not satisfy the minimum requirements to qualify for providing self-insurance to meet its decommissioning and other obligations, that company will be required to post additional financial security as assurance. While we do not meet the requirements for self-insurance, we estimated the impact of the requirement to provide additional security under NTL #2016-N01 for our operations in the Gulf of Mexico and do not believe that the revised policy will have a material impact on our operations in the Gulf of Mexico. 
 During 2017, however, with the issuance of Order 3350, the BSEE and the BOEM have been directed to reconsider a number of regulatory initiatives governing offshore oil and gas safety and performance-related activities, including, for example, NTL #2016-N01. Consequently, during 2017, the BOEM extended the start date for implementing NTL #2016-N01 indefinitely beyond June 30, 2017. This extension currently remains in effect; however,

the BOEM reserved the right to re-issue sole liability orders in the future, including in the event that it determines there is a substantial risk of nonperformance of the interest holder’s decommissioning sole liabilities. Following completion of its review, the BOEM may elect to retain NTL #2016-N01 in its current form or may make revisions thereto and, thus, until the review is completed and the BOEM determines what additional financial assurance may be required by us, we cannot provide assurance that such financial assurance coverage can be obtained. Moreover, the BOEM could in the future make other demands for additional financial assurances covering our obligations under sole liability properties and/or non-sole liability properties. In the event that we are unable to obtain the additional required bonds or assurances as requested, the BOEM may require certain of our operations on federal leases to be suspended or cancelled or otherwise impose monetary penalties. 
 Risk and Insurance Program    In accordance with industry practice, we maintain insurance against many, but not all, potential perils confronting our operations and in coverage amounts and deductible levels that we believe to be economic. Consistent with that profile, our insurance program is structured to provide us financial protection from significant losses resulting from damages to, or the loss of, physical assets or loss of human life, and liability claims of third parties, including such occurrences as well blowouts and weather events that result in oil spills and damage to our wells and/or platforms. Our goal is to balance the cost of insurance with our assessment of the potential risk of an adverse event. We maintain insurance at levels that we believe are appropriate and consistent with industry practice, and we regularly review our risks of loss and the cost and availability of insurance and revise our insurance program accordingly.
 We continuously monitor regulatory changes and regulatory responses and their impact on the insurance market and our overall risk profile, and adjust our risk and insurance program to provide protection at a level that we can afford considering the cost of insurance, against the potential and magnitude of disruption to our operations and cash flows. Changes in laws and regulations regarding exploration and production activities in the Gulf of Mexico could lead to tighter underwriting standards, limitations on scope and amount of coverage, and higher premiums, including possible increases in liability caps for claims of damages from oil spills.
 Health, Safety and Environmental Program
 Our Health, Safety and Environmental (“HS&E”) Program is supervised by an operating committee of senior management to ensure compliance with all state and federal regulations. In support of the operating committee, we have contracted with J. Connor Consulting (“JCC”) to coordinate the regulatory process relative to our offshore assets. JCC is a regulatory consulting firm specializing in the offshore Gulf of Mexico. They provide preparation of incident response plans, safety and environmental services and facilitation of comprehensive oil spill response training and drills on behalf of oil and gas companies and pipeline operators.
 Additionally, in support of our Gulf of Mexico operations, we have established a Regional Oil Spill Response Plan which has been approved by the BSEE. Our response team is trained annually and is tested through in-house spill drills. We have also contracted with O’Brien’s Response Management (“O’Brien’s”), who maintains an incident command center on 24 hour alert in Houston, TX. In the event of an oil spill, the Company’s response program is initiated by notifying O’Brien’s of any reportable incident. While the Company response team is mobilized to focus on source control and containment of the spill, O’Brien’s coordinates communications with state and federal agencies and provides subject matter expertise in support of the response team.
 We also have contracted with Clean Gulf Associates (“CGA”) to assist with equipment and personnel needs in the event of a spill. CGA specializes in onsite control and cleanup and is on 24-hour alert with equipment currently stored at eight bases along the gulf coast, from South Texas to East Louisiana. The CGA equipment stockpile is available to serve member oil spill response needs and includes open seas skimmers, shoreline protection boom, communications equipment, dispersants with application systems, wildlife rehabilitation and a forward command center. CGA has retainers with aerial dispersant and mechanical recovery equipment contractors for spill response.
 In addition to our membership in CGA, the Company has contracted with Wild Well Control for source control at the wellhead, if required. Wild Well Control is one of the world’s leading providers of firefighting and well control services.
 We also have a full time health, safety and environmental professional who supports our operations and oversees the implementation of our onshore HS&E policies.

 Safety and Environmental Management System
 We have developed and implemented a Safety and Environmental Management System (“SEMS”) to address oil and gas operations in the OCS, as required by the BSEE. Our SEMS identifies and mitigates safety and environmental hazards and the impacts of these hazards on design, construction, start-up, operation, inspection, and maintenance of all new and existing facilities. The Company has established goals, performance measures, training and accountability for SEMS implementation. We also provide the necessary resources to maintain an effective SEMS, and we review the adequacy and effectiveness of the SEMS program annually. Company facilities are designed, constructed, maintained, monitored, and operated in a manner compatible with industry codes, consensus standards, and all applicable governmental regulations. We have contracted with Island Technologies Inc. to coordinate our SEMS program and to track compliance for production operations.
 The BSEE enforces the SEMS requirements through regular audits. Failure of an audit may result in an Incident of Non-Compliance and could ultimately require a shut-in our Gulf of Mexico operations if not resolved within the required time.
 Employees
 On December 31, 2017, we had 63 full time employees, of which 20 were field personnel. We have been able to attract and retain a talented team of industry professionals that have been successful in achieving significant growth and success in the past. As such, we are well-positioned to adequately manage and develop our existing assets and also to increase our proved reserves and production through exploitation of our existing asset base, as well as the continuing identification, acquisition, and development of new growth opportunities. None of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements. We believe our relationship with our employees is good.
 In addition to our employees, we use the services of independent consultants and contractors to perform various professional services. As a working interest owner, we rely on certain outside operators to drill, produce and market our natural gas and oil where we are a non-operator. In prospects where we are the operator, we rely on drilling contractors to drill and sometimes rely on independent contractors to produce and market our natural gas and oil. In addition, we frequently utilize the services of independent contractors to perform field and on-site drilling and production operation services and independent third party engineering firms to evaluate our reserves.
 Corporate Offices
 Our corporate offices are located at 717 Texas Avenue in downtown Houston, Texas, under a lease that expires March 31, 2019. Rent, including parking, related to this office space for the year ended December 31, 2017 was approximately $2.2 million. As of January 2017, a portion of our space in the building is being subleased through the lease expiration date for $0.5 million annually.  Code of Ethics

 Seasonal Nature of Business
 The demand for oil and natural gas fluctuates depending on the time of year. Seasonal anomalies such as mild winters or cooler summers sometimes lessen this fluctuation. In addition, pipelines, utilities, local distribution companies, and industrial end users utilize oil and natural gas storage facilities and purchase some of their anticipated winter requirements during the summer, which can also lessen seasonal demand.
