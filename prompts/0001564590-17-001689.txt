ITEM 1. | BUSINESS
--------+---------

Overview
 West Corporation (the “Company” or “West”) is a global provider of communication and network infrastructure services. “We,” “us” and “our” also refer to West and its consolidated subsidiaries, as applicable. We help our clients more effectively communicate, collaborate and connect with their audiences through a diverse portfolio of solutions that include unified communications services, safety services, interactive services such as automated notifications, specialized agent services and telecom services.
 The scale and processing capacity of our technology platforms, combined with our expertise in managing multichannel interactions, enable us to provide reliable, high-quality, mission-critical communications designed to maximize return on investment for our clients and help them build smarter, more meaningful connections. We are dedicated to delivering and improving upon new channels, new capabilities and new choices for how businesses and consumers collaborate, connect and transact.
 Our clients include Fortune 1000 companies, along with small and medium enterprises in a variety of industries. We have sales and/or operations in the United States, Canada, Europe, the Middle East, Asia-Pacific, Latin America and South America.
 Our focus on large addressable markets with attractive growth characteristics has allowed us to deliver steady, profitable growth. For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016, we generated revenue from continuing operations of $2,292.0 million, $193.4 million in income from continuing operations, or 8.4% of revenue from continuing operations, Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations of $664.1 million, or 29.0% Adjusted EBITDA margin, $428.3 million in net cash flows from continuing operating activities and $301.7 million in free cash flows from continuing operating activities. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources—Adjusted EBITDA” for a definition of EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Free Cash Flows, which are non-GAAP measures, and a reconciliation of net income to EBITDA, cash flows from continuing operations to EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Covenant Adjusted EBITDA and cash flows from continuing operations to free cash flows.
 The following summaries further highlight the steps we have taken to evolve and improve our business:
 —Evolution to a Predominantly Technology-Based Solutions Business. Since our founding in 1986, we have invested significantly to expand our technology platforms and develop our operational processes to meet the complex communications needs of our clients. We have evolved our business mix from labor-intensive communication services to predominantly diversified technology-driven services. We have also invested approximately $3.0 billion in strategic acquisitions. We have increased our penetration into international unified communications markets, strengthened our interactive services business and established what we believe is a leadership position in safety services and healthcare advocacy services. As we continue to increase the variety of services we provide, we intend to pursue opportunities in markets where we are able to leverage our technological capabilities and industry expertise.
 On March 3, 2015, we divested several of our agent-based businesses. Businesses sold included our consumer-facing customer sales and lifecycle management, account services and receivables management businesses. The divestiture is consistent with our stated objective of focusing on faster growing, more profitable lines of business. As a result of this transaction, our employee count decreased from approximately 35,000 to 10,700 at December 31, 2016, making us a significantly less labor-intensive company.
 —Well Positioned for Emerging Technologies and Societal Trends. We endeavor to operate at the scale and speed necessary to capitalize on emerging technologies and the advantages they will provide. We have reoriented our business in response to the emergence of fast-growing markets such as healthcare, as well as emerging technology, industry and societal trends such as Internet Protocol (“IP”) infrastructure, unified communications as a service (“UCaaS”), migration to cloud-based solutions, mobility, Internet of Things (“IoT”), consumer’s desire for personalized experiences, analytics or “Big Data,” globalization, remote workforce and video-based collaboration.
 —Developed and Enhanced Large Scale Technology Platforms. Investing in technology and developing specialized expertise in the industries we serve are critical components to our strategy of enhancing our services and delivering operational excellence. The scale of our technology platforms is a competitive advantage in many of the markets we serve. Our open standards-based platforms allows for the flexibility to add new capabilities as our clients demand. In addition, we have integrated mobile, social media and cloud computing capabilities into our platforms and offer those services to our clients.
 —Expanded Safety Services. We have invested significant resources into our safety services line of business. Since 2006, we have made several strategic acquisitions, including Intrado Inc. (“Intrado”), Positron Public Safety Systems and the 911 Enable business of Connexon Group, Inc. (“911 Enable”). In 2016, we acquired 911 Emergency Telecom Company, Inc. ("911 ETC") to

further enhance our enterprise service offering. This combination of acquisitions has provided us with a leading platform in safety communication and infrastructure services. Today, we believe we are one of the largest providers of safety services to telecommunications service providers, government agencies and public safety organizations, based on the number of 9-1-1 calls that we and other participants in the industry facilitate and the percentage of the U.S. population covered by our services. Our presence in this market has steadily increased through substantial investments in proprietary systems, such as our Emergency Services IP Network (“ESInet”), call handling product suite, and geographic information system (“GIS”) offerings and programs designed to upgrade the capabilities of 9-1-1 centers by delivering a broader set of features and functionality. We provide a comprehensive hosted platform that seamlessly integrates handset and network-based mobile location technologies. Our location determination services automatically apply precise locating methods to deliver accurate results. We plan to continue to develop our presence in the mobility industry in support of wireless carriers, Voice over IP (“VoIP”) providers, telematics and cable companies, enterprises and alarm/security companies.
 —Expanded Interactive Services. We have grown our interactive services line of business organically and through acquisitions. We provide automated outbound notification services (voice, text/short message service ("SMS") and chat), inbound voice and speech services and cloud contact center technologies across several industries, including healthcare, utilities, financial services, telecommunications, transportation, government and public safety. Additionally, with the acquisitions in 2014, 2015 and 2016 of Reliance Holding, Inc., doing business through its wholly owned subsidiary Reliance Communications, LLC as SchoolMessenger (“SchoolMessenger”), the assets of GroupCast, LLC, doing business as SchoolReach (“SchoolReach”), substantially all of the assets of Intrafinity, Inc., doing business as SharpSchool (“SharpSchool”), and substantially all of the assets of Synrevoice Technologies, Inc. (“Synrevoice”), we expanded our interactive services into a leadership position for communications and parental engagement technology in the K-12 education market in the U.S. and Canada.
 —“One West” Initiative. Our history of acquisitions provided us with industry-leading brands such as Intrado, InterCall, TeleVox, SchoolMessenger and many more. These brands are well known in their respective markets. However, many of our clients were not aware of the breadth of our offerings sold under different brand names. We believe that unifying our offerings under the “West” name will allow us to leverage one brand in our marketing efforts and drive additional cross-selling opportunities.
 This initiative is not limited to the branding of our services. Our management team is focused on internal programs that are intended to leverage the existing assets and expertise of our employees across all of our lines of business. We have, and will, focus on several efforts to transform the Company’s operations to be more efficient. These efforts include collaboration between employees in different lines of business, simplification and automation of certain processes, leveraging existing technology infrastructure and consolidating efforts across the Company in each of our procurement, capital expenditure and carrier management functions.
 The primary goal of these initiatives is to become a more responsive organization, delivering faster innovation to satisfy our clients’ needs, and to develop the ability to offer clients solutions for their communications needs that combine services across our lines of business.
 Corporate Information
 Our business was founded in 1986 through a predecessor company, and West Corporation was incorporated in 1994. On October 24, 2006, we completed a recapitalization (the “Recapitalization”) of the Company in a transaction sponsored by an investor group led by Thomas H. Lee Partners, LP and Quadrangle Group LLC (the “Sponsors”). Pursuant to the Recapitalization, a merger subsidiary was merged with and into West Corporation, with West Corporation continuing as the surviving corporation, and our publicly traded securities were cancelled in exchange for cash.
 We financed the Recapitalization with equity contributions from the Sponsors and the rollover of a portion of our equity interests held by Gary and Mary West, the founders of the Company (the “Founders”), and certain members of management, along with a senior secured term loan facility, a senior secured revolving credit facility and the private placement of senior notes and senior subordinated notes.
 On December 30, 2011, we completed the conversion of our outstanding Class L Common Stock into shares of Class A Common Stock (the “Conversion”) and thereafter the reclassification (the “Reclassification”) of all of our Class A Common Stock as a single class of common stock by filing amendments to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation (the “Charter Amendments”) with the Delaware Secretary of State. Upon the effectiveness of the filing of the Charter Amendments, each share of our outstanding Class L Common Stock was converted into 40.29 shares of Class A Common Stock pursuant to the Conversion, and all of the outstanding shares of Class A Common Stock were reclassified as shares of common stock pursuant to the Reclassification. Following the Conversion and Reclassification, all shares of common stock share proportionately in dividends. On March 8, 2013, we completed a 1-for-8 reverse stock split.
 3


On March 27, 2013, we completed our initial public offering by selling an aggregate of 21,275,000 shares of our common stock at a price to the public of $20.00 per share. The initial public offering resulted in net proceeds to us of $398.1 million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions of approximately $24.5 million and other offering expenses of approximately $3.0 million.

Unified Communications Services
 We provide our clients with a range of integrated unified communications (“UC”) services. We combine reliable, world-class technologies with deep experience and flexibility to provide solutions that are easy to use and scalable for every client’s specific needs. Our products and services can improve many aspects of business by enabling personalized engagement, meetings anywhere, enhanced productivity and immersive communication experiences.
Unified Communications Defined:
 

UC is commonly defined as the integration of real-time enterprise communication services with non-real-time communication services like unified messaging (email, integrated voicemail, SMS and fax). We focus specifically on mid-market and large enterprise clients with a complete UC cloud-based solution which consists of enterprise voice, conferencing and collaboration, network management, unified messaging and presence, contact center and client application integration. In addition, we continue to expand our broad communications services with support for high-end videoconferencing, Skype for Business integration, webcasts and other digital media services.
 Utilizing UC services allows our clients to replace their premises-based private branch exchange (“PBX”) infrastructure with a cloud-based, hosted UC service and derive the benefits of moving from a capital expenditure investment model to a more flexible, scalable and responsive operating expense model. It also allows clients to focus their limited resources on their core business and benefit from the support, reliability and efficiency of West as their service provider. Our Unified Communications Services reportable segment includes the following:

UCaaS. The delivery of UC technology is provided as a hosted, or cloud-based, service commonly referred to as UCaaS. Our Company has extensive experience in designing, deploying and managing UCaaS solutions as well as the ability to provide superior long-term support to our clients. Gartner, Inc., (“Gartner”) a leading research and advisory firm, has positioned West in the “Leaders” quadrant of its “Magic Quadrant for UCaaS, Worldwide” report for each of the past five years. This recognition is based on West’s ability to execute and the completeness of our vision in the UCaaS space. As one of 16 UCaaS providers assessed by Gartner for the 2016 report, West is one of five to be positioned within the “Leaders” quadrant.
 In its November 2016 “Critical Capabilities for Unified Communications as a Service, Global” report, Gartner rated West as one of the top three providers of UCaaS services in its two use cases centered on the needs of the large enterprise. 
 West delivers solutions that include technology from leading providers such as Cisco and Microsoft, while adding our own technology to bring together a complete UC solution for clients. West holds Cisco Gold Partner, Cisco Cloud Provider and Cisco Managed Services Channel Program Master certifications and was named the 2016 Collaboration Cloud Partner of the Year for the Americas region by Cisco.

On October 31, 2015, we completed the acquisition of Magnetic North Software, Ltd., (“Magnetic North”), a leading U.K.-based provider of hosted customer contact center and UC solutions to enterprises. This acquisition provides us with an expanded presence in Europe, the Middle East and Africa (“EMEA”), strong partner relationships and an integrated UC contact center platform that we expect to use across our lines of business to provide clients with the capability to deliver seamless and contextual multichannel consumer experiences.

We believe we are the leading database management provider in the industry, managing over 223 million ILEC, CLEC and VoIP records. We continue to develop and support new technologies for existing providers as well as support new entrants such as Over the Top (“OTT”) providers. 
 We believe we are one of the largest providers of safety services based on the number of 9-1-1 calls that we and other participants in the industry facilitate and the percentage of the population served by our desktop communication technology. In 2016, we facilitated approximately 444 million Automatic Location Information bids and Enhanced 9-1-1 (“E9-1-1”) transactions in support of our clients' routing and location requests.

Market Opportunity
 Consistent with our investment strategy, we have and will continue to target new and complementary markets that leverage our depth of expertise in technology-enabled communication services. As we continue to increase the variety of services we provide, we intend to pursue opportunities in markets where we are able to leverage our technology capabilities and industry expertise. We believe 
 12


our strongest growth opportunities will come from UCaaS, safety services and interactive services. These businesses serve large, fast-growing markets with relatively predictable and steady growth, and are characterized by recurring, valuable transactions and strong margin profiles.
 Unified Communications Services
 The market for cloud-based UCaaS worldwide was approximately $13 billion in 2016 and is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (“CAGR”) of 15% through 2020 according to Gartner.
 We are and have been the leading global provider of conferencing services since 2008 based on revenue, according to Wainhouse Research. The market for worldwide audio and web conferencing is large and mature. According to Wainhouse, in 2016, the worldwide audio conferencing market had revenue of approximately $3.6 billion and the market for standalone worldwide web conferencing was approximately $2.5 billion. 
 Wainhouse expects revenue growth in the mid-teens for web conferencing that is integrated with UC services over the next four years. This market had revenue of approximately $1 billion in 2016.
 Safety Services
 The market for safety services continues to be an attractive opportunity. Government agencies and other public safety organizations are increasingly prioritizing funding for upgrading traditional 9-1-1 services to leverage new functionality and ensure dependable delivery. 
 Each city, county and state in the U.S. is expected to implement changes to its 9-1-1 systems and manage the evolution to NG9-1-1 technologies in the manner most appropriate for the community’s needs. Most municipalities are currently in the process of planning or modernizing their 9-1-1 systems. As communities across the U.S. upgrade outdated 9-1-1 systems to NG9-1-1 platforms, we believe our suite of services is best suited to capture the demand. Frost & Sullivan expects the total NG9-1-1 market to grow from approximately $100 million in 2015 to over $460 million by 2021, a 29% CAGR.
 Interactive Services
 According to Gartner and Frost & Sullivan, the addressable market for the solutions we provide in Interactive Services, including cloud contact center; SMS/mobile apps; IVR and outbound notifications; and customer management services, in North America and Western Europe was approximately $11 billion in 2016. Industry analysts believe growth is being driven by a number of factors, including the accelerating product and technology innovation cycles leading to greater adoption of customer data analytics, self-service functions and multichannel interaction across services and consumer devices.
Technology, Industry and Societal Trends
 We also believe that we are well positioned to take advantage of rapidly growing markets such as healthcare, as well as emerging technology, industry and societal trends such as IP infrastructure, UC, migration to cloud-based solutions, mobility, IoT, consumer’s desire for personalized experiences, analytics or “Big Data,” globalization, a growing remote workforce and video.
 Enterprises continue to shift business applications to the cloud. According to Gartner: “As premise-based telephony infrastructure reaches end of life, organizations of all sizes will increasingly evaluate cloud telephony solutions as a preferred option to purchasing another premise-based platform.” Gartner also predicts that by 2020 over 90% of enterprise voice calls in the digital workplace will originate from collaboration applications, up from less than 30% today. We see opportunities to take advantage of this transition with our UCaaS line of business.
 Continued focus by companies on meeting the needs of more demanding consumers who want self-service and a better customer experience is propelling growth in our cloud-based customer engagement solutions like those offered by our interactive services line of business. Mobile location-based services and marketing continue to grow rapidly. We believe this “mobile-centric” mindset and the use of contextual mobile advertising and customer service will drive additional growth opportunities.
 The IoT is expected to grow rapidly over the next several years. Industry experts estimate that there were approximately 6 billion devices connected to the Internet in 2016, growing to an estimated 20 to 30 billion devices by 2020. We see opportunities to leverage our technology to take advantage of this growth with our Safety Services and Interactive Services reportable segments.

We believe the healthcare market provides us with opportunities to leverage our technology capabilities across our lines of business. We currently serve healthcare providers/health systems, health plans/payers, self-insured employers, pharmaceutical companies and retail pharmacies. As every sector of healthcare moves to value-based reimbursement, each is seeking new strategies, coupled with technology, to drive an enhanced consumer experience. Healthcare consumers are being compelled to take a more active role in managing their health and healthcare spend. Expanded use of communication tools and technologies that cater to consumer needs are expected to continue to grow. We have communication technologies, clinical agent support services and analytics to deliver a better, more efficient healthcare consumer experience. The focus of our healthcare practice is to provide healthcare organizations with patient-centered communication solutions that are self-serving and automated using communication channels that include voice, text, email and mobile technologies. Our communication solutions are supported by robust analytics and complemented with clinical agent support.
 Our Competitive Strengths
 We serve clients who place a premium both on the solutions we provide and our industry expertise. We believe the following strengths have helped us to establish a leading competitive position in the markets we serve and enable us to deliver operational excellence to clients.
 —Broad Portfolio of Product Offerings. Our technology platforms combined with our experience and operational expertise allow us to provide a broad range of service offerings for our clients. Our ability to provide our clients with a reliable, efficient and cost-effective alternative to process high volume, complex voice and data transactions helps them to improve their business and better serve their users and customers.

Our ten largest clients in 2016 had an average tenure with us of over 15 years. In 2016, our 100 largest clients represented approximately 43% of our revenue and approximately 35% of our revenue came from clients purchasing multiple service offerings. We also have strong relationships with partners in many of our lines of business that significantly enhance our go-to-market sales and distribution capability. Some of our partners provide complementary technology that we integrate with our core service offerings to deliver higher value to our clients. In many of these cases, we are also able to leverage our partners’ sales and distribution capabilities. Other partners resell our services, private label our services under their brand, or integrate our services into their core products.
 —Operational and Service Excellence. We achieve the results our clients are seeking through increased productivity, reliability and scale. Our ability to improve upon our clients’ communications processes is an important aspect of our value proposition. We leverage our technology infrastructure and shared services platforms to manage higher value transactions and achieve cost savings for our clients and ourselves.
 —Ability to Optimize Cash Flows from Continuing Operating Activities. Our business generates significant cash flows from continuing operating activities. In 2016, we generated $428.3 million in cash flows from continuing operating activities. We used these funds to repay $191.1 million of long-term debt, invest $126.6 million in capital expenditures, acquire two companies, repurchase one million shares of our common stock for $22.0 million, pay $74.7 million in dividends to shareholders and reinvest in our business. In 2017, we expect to generate between $380 million and $420 million in cash flows from continuing operating activities. We expect to use this cash for dividends, to pay down debt, make acquisitions and for stock buybacks.
 —Experienced Management Team with Track Record of Growth. Our senior leadership has an average tenure of approximately 15 years with us and has delivered strong results through various market cycles, both as a public and a private company. As a group, this team has created a culture of superior client service and growth in revenue and profitability. Our team has also established a long track record of successfully acquiring and integrating companies to drive growth.
 As demand for outsourced services grows with greater adoption of our technologies and services, we believe our long history of delivering results for our clients combined with our scale and the investments we have made in our businesses provide us with a significant competitive advantage.

Our Business Strategy
 Our strategy is to identify growing markets where we can deploy our existing assets, experience and expertise to strengthen our competitive position. Our strategy is supported by our commitment to superior client service, operational excellence and market leadership. Key aspects of our strategy include the following:
 —Expand Relationships with Existing Clients. We are focused on deepening and expanding relationships with our existing clients by delivering value in the form of reduced costs, improved customer relationships and enhanced revenue opportunities. Approximately 35% of our revenue in 2016 came from clients purchasing multiple service offerings from us. We intend to leverage our large global sales team and diversified client base to continue to cross-sell our services. We seek out clients with plans for growth and expect to participate in that growth along with our clients. As we demonstrate the value that our services provide, often starting with a single service, we are frequently able to expand the size and scope of our client relationships.
 —Develop New Client Relationships. We will continue to focus on building long-term client relationships across a wide range of industries to further diversify our revenue base. We target clients in industries in which we have expertise or other competitive advantages and an ability to deliver a wide range of solutions that have a meaningful impact on their business. By continuing to add new long-term client relationships in large and growing markets, we believe we enhance the stability and growth potential of our revenue base.
 —Capitalize on Select Global Opportunities. In addition to expanding and enhancing our existing relationships domestically, we will selectively pursue new client opportunities globally. Our expertise in collaboration services has allowed us to penetrate international markets. In 2016, approximately 20% of our consolidated revenue was generated outside of the U.S. We believe our distribution capabilities, including approximately 304 international sales personnel, provide us with the opportunity to drive incremental revenue. We anticipate that the 2015 acquisition of U.K.-based Magnetic North and the 2016 acquisitions of Synrevoice and 911 ETC will drive additional opportunities internationally.
 —Continue to Enhance Leading Technology Capabilities. We believe our service offerings are enhanced by our superior technology capabilities and track record of innovation, and we will continue to target services where our reliability, scale and efficiencies enable us to address our clients’ communication issues or enhance the results of their communications.
 —Continue to Enhance Our Market Position Through Selective Acquisitions. Since 2002, we have completed 35 acquisitions of businesses and technologies with a total value of approximately $3.0 billion. We will continue to expand our suite of communication services across industries, geographies and end-markets. While we expect this will occur primarily through organic growth, we also expect to continue to acquire assets and businesses that strengthen our value proposition to clients, differentiate us from our competitors and drive value to us. We have developed an internal capability to source, evaluate and integrate acquisitions that we believe has created value for shareholders.
Sales and Marketing
 Generally, our sales personnel target growth-oriented clients and selectively pursue those with whom we have the greatest opportunity for long-term success. Their goals are both to maximize our current client relationships and expand our client base. To accomplish these goals, we attempt to sell additional services to existing clients and to develop new relationships. We generally pay commissions to sales professionals on both new sales and incremental revenue generated from existing clients.
 At December 31, 2016, we had approximately 724 sales and marketing personnel in our Unified Communications Services reportable segment, approximately 49 sales and marketing personnel in our Safety Services reportable segment, approximately 103 sales and marketing personnel in our Interactive Services reportable segment and approximately 97 sales and marketing personnel in our Specialized Agent Services reportable segment.

 The principal competitive factors in the specialized agent services markets in which we participate include, among others, quality of service, industry-specific expertise and price. Competitors in the healthcare advocacy market include health insurance plan providers as well as companies that specialize in specific programs we offer, such as employee assistance plans or wellness programs. Competitors in the cost management industry include a company’s internal operations, Cotiviti, The Rawlings Group and Optum. Competition in the business-to-business services market generally comes from companies that perform these activities in-house. 
Our Clients
 Our clients vary by line of business and operate in a wide range of industries, including telecommunications, retail, financial services, government, education, utilities, technology and healthcare. We have tens of thousands of clients that use our services, ranging from small businesses to Fortune 100 clients.
 Although we serve many clients, we derive a significant portion of our revenue from relatively few clients. In 2016, our 100 largest clients accounted for approximately 43% of our consolidated revenue. No client accounted for 10% or more of our consolidated revenue in 2016.
 16


Our Personnel
 As of December 31, 2016, we had approximately 10,720 total employees, of which approximately 3,790 were employed in the Unified Communications Services reportable segment, approximately 1,020 were employed in the Safety Services reportable segment, approximately 1,180 were employed in the Interactive Services reportable segment, approximately 3,490 were employed in the Specialized Agent Services reportable segment and approximately 1,240 were employed in corporate and shared service support functions. Of the total employees, approximately 2,250 were international employees.
 Employees of our subsidiaries in France and Germany are represented by local works councils. Employees in France and certain other countries are also covered by the terms of industry-specific national collective agreements. Our employees are not represented by any labor organization in the United States. We believe that our relations with our employees and the labor organizations identified above are good.
 Our Technology and Systems Development
 Technology is critical to our business and we believe the scale and flexibility of our platforms is a competitive strength. Our software and hardware systems, as well as our network infrastructure, are designed to offer high-quality, integrated solutions. We have made significant investments in reliable hardware systems and integrated commercially available software when appropriate. Our technology platforms are designed to handle greater transaction volume than our competitors. Because our technology is client focused, we often rely on internally developed software systems to customize our services. As of December 31, 2016, we employed a staff of approximately 2,580 professionals in our technology departments.
 We recognize the importance of providing uninterrupted service for our clients. We have invested significant resources to develop, install and maintain facilities and systems that are designed to be highly reliable and scalable. Our facilities and systems are designed to maximize system availability and minimize the possibility of service disruption.
 We have network operations centers that operate 24 hours a day, seven days a week and use both internal and external systems to effectively operate our equipment, people and sites. We interface directly with telecommunications providers and have the ability to manage capacity in real time. Our network operations centers monitor the status of elements of our network on a real-time basis. All functions of our network operations centers have the ability to be managed at backup centers.
 We rely on a combination of copyright, patent, trademark and trade secret laws, as well as on confidentiality procedures and non-compete agreements, to establish and protect our proprietary rights in each of our segments. At December 31, 2016, we owned approximately 395 registered patents and approximately 298 registered trademarks including several patents and trademarks that we obtained as part of our past acquisitions. Certain of our patents will expire in 2018. From time to time, we may sell a portion of our patent portfolio when we have concluded that the benefit of the sale outweighs the benefits to our business of continuing to maintain exclusive ownership of the applicable patents. We do not expect these patent expirations or sales to have a material adverse effect on our business. Trademarks continue as long as we actively use the mark. We have approximately 245 pending patent applications pertaining to technology relating to transaction processing, call center and specialized agent management, data collection, reporting and verification, collaboration and credit card processing. New patents that are issued have a life of 20 years from the date the patent application is initially filed. We believe the existence of these patents and trademarks, along with our ongoing processes to add additional patents and trademarks to our portfolio, may be a barrier to entry for specific products and services we provide and may also be used for defensive purposes in certain litigation.
 Our International Operations
 In 2016, revenue attributed to foreign countries was approximately 20% of our consolidated revenue and long-lived assets attributed to foreign countries were approximately 7% of our total consolidated long-lived assets.
 In 2016, we operated out of facilities in the U.S. and approximately 19 foreign jurisdictions in North America, EMEA and Asia-Pacific. 
 For additional information regarding our domestic and international revenues, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and the financial statements included herewith.

Government Regulation
 Privacy
 We provide services to healthcare clients that, as providers of healthcare services, are considered “covered entities” under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”). As covered entities, our clients must comply with standards for privacy, transaction and code sets, and data security. Under HIPAA, we are sometimes considered a “business associate,” which requires that we protect the security and privacy of “protected health information” provided to us by our clients. We have implemented HIPAA and Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (“HITECH”) compliance training and awareness programs for our healthcare services employees. We also have undertaken an ongoing process to test data security at all relevant levels. In addition, we have reviewed physical security at all healthcare operation centers and have implemented systems to control access to all work areas.
 In addition to healthcare information, our databases contain personal data of our customers and clients’ customers, including credit card and other personal information. Federal law requires protection of customer proprietary network information (“CPNI”) applicable to our clients. Federal and state laws in the U.S. as well as those in the European Union require notification to consumers in the event of a security breach in or at our systems if the consumers’ personal information may have been compromised as a result of the breach. We have implemented processes and procedures to reduce the risk of security breaches, and have prepared plans to comply with these notification rules should a breach occur. Any failures in our security and privacy measures, however, could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. See the risk factors related to security breaches in “Risk Factors.”
 Telecommunications
 Our Safety Services, Unified Communications Services and Interactive Services reportable segments are subject to significant regulation by the Federal Communications Commission (“FCC”) and state utility commissions. For some services, we are required to maintain licenses with the FCC and/or state utility commissions.
 With respect to Safety Services, our wholly-owned indirect subsidiary, West Safety Communications Inc. (formerly Intrado Communications Inc.) (“West Safety Communications”) is subject to various regulations as a result of its status as a regulated CLEC, and/or an emergency services provider, and/or an inter-exchange carrier, including state utility commissions’ regulations and FCC regulations adopted under the Telecommunications Act of 1996, as amended. West Safety Communications holds licenses from public utility commissions in 45 states and the District of Columbia. Its wholly owned affiliate, West Safety Communications of Virginia Inc. holds a license in Virginia. Also, under the New and Emerging Technologies 9-1-1 Improvement Act of 2008 (NET911 Act, P.L. 11-283, 47 U.S.C. 609) and its attendant FCC regulations (WC Docket No. 08-171, Report and Order dated October 21, 2008), West’s wholly owned subsidiary, West Safety Services, Inc. (“Intrado Inc.”), is required to provide access to VoIP telephony providers certain 9-1-1 and E9-1-1 elements.
 On December 12, 2013, the FCC released a Report and Order (“9-1-1 Order”), Improving 9-1-1 Reliability, Reliability and Continuity of Communications Networks, Including Broadband Technologies, FCC 13-158, requiring Covered 9-1-1 Service Providers (as defined in the 9-1-1 Order), among other things, to notify PSAPs within 30 minutes of discovering an outage and annually certify that the Covered 9-1-1 Service Provider has audited and identified critical 9-1-1 transmission and monitoring facilities and taken reasonable steps to ensure reliability. For the purpose of the annual certification, West Safety Communications may need cooperation from third party providers of network services to obtain relevant data. The providers West Safety Communications relies on may not be able to provide the necessary data or may not agree to provide the necessary data at a reasonable commercial rate.
 On November 11, 2014, the FCC issued a Policy Statement and Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (“NPRM”), FCC 14-186, proposing to add additional 9-1-1 reliability requirements and to expand the scope of Covered 9-1-1 Service Providers to which the existing 9-1-1 reliability and outage notification rules apply. The NPRM also proposes certification of new Covered 9-1-1 Service Providers as well as notice and approval requirements when Covered 9-1-1 Service Providers change network configuration or discontinue service. If the rules are adopted, they could impact business operations and require costs associated with compliance.
 On May 26, 2016, the FCC released a Report and Order (“Part 4 Order”), Order on Reconsideration, and Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (“Part 4 FNPRM”), FCC 16-63, adopting amendments to the outage reporting rules under Part 4 of the FCC’s rules concerning disruptions to communications and proposing additional outage reporting rules to address broadband network disruptions. The Part 4 Order, among other things, amends the reporting of wireless outages and expands what qualifies as a loss of communications to a PSAP. West Safety Communications may need cooperation from third-party providers to obtain relevant data required for compliance with the amended rules in the Part 4 Order and proposed rules in the Part 4 FNPRM, and the rules could impact business operations and require costs associated with compliance. 
 18


The market in which our Safety Services business unit operates may also be influenced by legislation, regulation, and judicial or administrative determinations which seek to promote a national broadband plan, a nationwide public safety network, next generation services, and/or competition in local telephone markets, including 9-1-1 service as a part of local exchange service, or seek to modify the Universal Service Fund (“USF”) program.
 Through our wholly owned subsidiary West IP Communications, Inc. (“WIPC”), we provide interconnected VoIP services, which are subject to certain requirements imposed by the FCC, including without limitation, obligations relating to access to 9-1-1, Federal USF contributions, privacy, disability access, porting numbers and other requirements, even though the FCC has not classified interconnected VoIP services as telecommunications services. The regulatory requirements applicable to WIPC’s VoIP services could change if the FCC determines the services to be telecommunications services regulated under Part II of the Communications Act. In addition, many state regulatory agencies impose taxes and other surcharges on VoIP services. Applying these state taxes and surcharges to VoIP service can be challenging where the law has historically only been applied and interpreted for traditional telecommunications services. Certain states have recently taken the position that interconnected VoIP service can be regulated in the same manner as providers of traditional telecommunications services. The full impact of this issue on our business cannot be assessed and will not be resolved until the FCC definitely decides the regulatory classification and jurisdiction of interconnected VoIP service.
 Federal laws regulating the provision of traditional telecommunications services may adversely impact our collaboration business. Our collaboration business has submitted forms to the Universal Service Administrative Company (“USAC”) and paid federal USF and similar fees since August 1, 2008, based on our good faith interpretation of the revenue reporting requirements and classification of our services. To the extent that USAC or the FCC disagrees with the methodology or classification of our services, we may be subject to additional costs and obligations applicable to more traditional telecommunications service providers. The FCC released an Order on December 16, 2016 granting Cisco WebEx LLC’s (“Cisco”) request for review of an audit of Cisco’s 2009 revenues by USAC in In the Matter of Universal Service Contribution Methodology Request for Review of a Decision of the Universal Service Administrator by Cisco WebEx LLC, WC Docket No. 06-122, DA 16-1401. We are reviewing the Cisco Order for potential impact to our business and the assessment and payment of USF. 
 International laws regulating the provision of VoIP, conferencing, Internet access, cloud-based communications services, and other communications services provided by the Unified Communications Services segment vary by country, and are often unsettled or more burdensome than those imposed in the U.S. Some countries have laws that prohibit the provision of certain VoIP offerings and others have laws that impose stringent licensing requirements on providers of communication services. It is often unclear in international locations how laws that have been historically applied to traditional telecommunications services will be applied to VoIP and IP-based communications services. The effect of any future laws or any changes in interpretation or enforcement of existing laws could negatively impact our operations and impose compliance costs in international locations.
 Through our wholly owned indirect subsidiary, West Telecom Services, LLC (formerly HyperCube Telecom Services, LLC) (“West Telecom Services”), we act as a telecommunications carrier and provider of switching services throughout the United States. West Telecom Services routes communications traffic to all other carriers, including wireless, wireline, cable telephony and VoIP companies. West Telecom Services has obtained licenses to offer telecommunications services from the FCC and authorization to offer facilities-based and resold telecommunications services from state utility commissions in 47 states and the District of Columbia.
 The FCC exercises regulatory authority over the pricing of the tandem transit and access services offered by West Telecom Services. On November 18, 2011, the FCC released a Report and Order and Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, FCC Release No. 11-161 (“FCC Order”) that comprehensively reforms the system under which regulated service providers compensate each other for the termination of interstate, intrastate, and local traffic. The FCC adopted bill-and-keep as the ultimate uniform, national methodology for all terminating telecommunications traffic exchanged with a local exchange carrier. Under bill-and-keep, the rate for exchanging terminating traffic is zero and terminating carriers look to their subscribers to cover the costs of providing termination services. The FCC Order did not address rate levels for tandem transit services.
 The rules adopted by the FCC provide for a multi-year transition to a national uniform bill-and-keep framework. Carriers were required to cap most terminating interstate and intrastate intercarrier compensation rate elements as of December 29, 2011. To reduce the disparity between interstate and intrastate terminating end office rates, carriers were required to bring intrastate rates, where they were higher than interstate rates, to the level of interstate rates in two steps, the first by July 1, 2012, and the second by July 1, 2013. Thereafter, carriers such as West Telecom Services must reduce their interstate and intrastate termination and transport rates to bill-and-keep by July 2018.
 As part of the transition of the intercarrier compensation system to bill-and-keep, the FCC also established in the FCC Order a prospective intercarrier compensation framework for traffic exchanged over PSTN facilities that originates and/or terminates in IP format (“VoIP-PSTN traffic”). The FCC found that where a providers’ interconnection agreement does not address the appropriate rate for such traffic, the default intercarrier compensation rate for all toll terminating and originating VoIP-PSTN traffic would be 
 19


equal to interstate access rates, while the default intercarrier compensation rate for other VoIP-PSTN traffic would be the otherwise applicable reciprocal compensation rates. To collect the compensation for originating or terminating VoIP-PSTN traffic in IP traffic, a local exchange carrier, or its VoIP provider partner, must perform functions functionally equivalent to the switched access functions of non-VoIP-PSTN traffic performed by local exchange carriers. The FCC also addressed intercarrier compensation between wireline carriers and wireless providers in the FCC Order. Among other things, the FCC adopted bill-and-keep as the default methodology for all non-access traffic between wireless and wireline providers.
 In the Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking adopted as part of the FCC Order, the FCC sought comment on the appropriate transition and recovery mechanism for the rate elements not reduced as part of the FCC Order, including originating access (including originating charges for 8YY traffic) and certain common and dedicated transport. The FCC also sought comment on the appropriate policy framework for IP-to-IP interconnection. We cannot predict the timing or outcome of these proposals.
 Several states, industry groups, and other telecommunications carriers filed petitions for reconsideration with the FCC as well as petitions for review of the FCC Order in federal courts. The cases were consolidated for review before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit. The 10th Circuit issued a decision in May 2014 that upheld the FCC Order. That decision was further appealed to the United States Supreme Court, and the petition for writ of certiorari was denied.
 On April 25, 2012, the Commission issued a reconsideration of the FCC Order and revised the rate that local exchange carriers could recover for originating intrastate toll VoIP-PSTN traffic (regardless of whether the traffic originated and/or terminated in IP format). Specifically, the FCC directed that on and after July 1, 2014, local exchange carriers are permitted to tariff default access rates for such traffic equal to their then current interstate originating switched access rates.
 In response to billing disputes between CLECs and large interexchange carriers concerning the VoIP symmetry rule adopted in the FCC Order, the FCC released a declaratory ruling on February 11, 2015, FCC 15-14, clarifying that the VoIP symmetry rule applies in a technology- and facilities-neutral manner and, under certain circumstances, allows CLECs partnering with an over-the-top ("OTT") VoIP provider to assess and collect access charges for end office (or local) switching. On November 18, 2016, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals vacated and remanded the FCC’s declaratory ruling, finding that the FCC Order does not support the FCC’s conclusion that CLECs provide the “functional equivalent” of end-office switching when partnering with OTT VoIP providers. This issue could negatively impact the revenues and operations of West Telecom Services if it is not able to enforce all or a portion of its access tariffs with respect to VoIP or other types of calls.   
 On September 30, 2016, AT&T Services (“AT&T”) filed a petition requesting that the FCC forbear from the rules that permit tariffing of all tandem switching and tandem-switched transport charges on all traffic to or from ILECs engaged in access stimulation (even when the tandem provider is not involved in access stimulation) and from the rules permitting tariffed charges for toll-free database queries. West Telecom Services and Consolidated Communications Companies filed a joint motion for summary denial and opposition to AT&T’s petition on December 2, 2016. If granted, AT&T’s proposed forbearance could cause significant disruption and uncertainty in the tandem services market in which West Telecom Services operates.
 There are initiatives in several state legislatures to lower intrastate access rates, aligning them with interstate rates, some of which may be affected by the FCC Order. Depending on whether we are a net collector or a net payer of any adjusted rate, such rate adjustments could have a negative effect on us.
 On November 13, 2013, the FCC issued a Report and Order, In re Rural Call Completion, Report and Order and Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, FCC 13-135, mandating, among other things, that providers of long-distance voice service that make the initial long-distance call path choice for more than 100,000 domestic retail subscriber lines record and report certain data related to call completion on a quarterly basis. WIPC and West Telecom Services could be subject to enforcement action in the event that the FCC decides that their rural call completion performance is inadequate or they were not compliant with the Order.
 On November 2, 2016, the FCC issued a Report and Order, In the Matter of Protecting the Privacy of Consumers of Broadband and Other Telecommunications Services, FCC 16-148, expanding consumer privacy laws and regulations for certain voice and broadband providers to protect customer personal information, which includes without limitation CPNI and personally identifiable information. If the new customer PI rules are permitted to go into effect, they will significantly alter the way covered providers collect, use and protect their subscribers’ personal information and could have a material adverse effect on our business and costs associated with compliance. 
 The FCC has recently intensified its efforts to eliminate fraudulent or abusive network traffic. West Telecom Services cooperates with the FCC and other authorities to investigate potential unlawful activities on its network and to minimize network vulnerabilities. Fraudulent or abusive network practices and the prevention, detection and investigation of such activity could have a material adverse effect on our business and costs associated with compliance.

Any changes to these legal requirements, including those caused by the adoption of new laws and regulations or by legal challenges, could have a material adverse effect upon the market for our services and products. Any delays in implementation of the regulatory requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. See the risk factors related to the effects of such regulation on our business in “Risk Factors.”
 Teleservices
 Teleservices sales practices are regulated at both the federal and state level. The Telephone Consumer Protections Act of 1991 (“TCPA”), authorized and directed the FCC to regulate the telemarketing industry. The FCC set forth rules to implement the TCPA. Most significantly, the TCPA prohibits the use of automated dialers to call cellular telephones without consent of the consumer and the potential liability for violations of this provision is substantial. In 2013, several United States District Courts held that the defendant violated the TCPA when it used an automated dialing device to call a residential line that had been converted to a VoIP service or used an automated dialing device to call a cell phone number where appropriate consent had been obtained but the number had since been reassigned by the carrier to a third party without the knowledge of the caller. In addition, some United States District Courts in 2013 held calls dialed in a mode which required an employee to launch each call from their desktop could still be considered automated calls and a violation of the TCPA because the equipment used to make the calls had the “capacity” to act as an automatic telephone dialing system. In July 2015, the FCC issued a declaratory Ruling and a clarification making the rules under the TCPA more restrictive. We took necessary steps to address the Ruling by conducting training, reviewing dialing systems, and modifying contract language to ensure compliance. Violations of the TCPA carry a potential penalty of $500-$1,500 for each time a number is dialed in violation of the TCPA through a consumer private right of action. These rules, which have been amended over time, also place other restrictions on the methods and timing of telemarketing sales calls, including:

• | restrictions on calls placed by automatic dialing and announcing devices;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | limitations on the use of predictive dialers for outbound calls;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------


• | institution of a National “Do-Not-Call” Registry in conjunction with the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”);
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | guidelines on maintaining an internal “Do-Not-Call” list and honoring “Do-Not-Call” requests;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | restricts the use of prerecorded message telemarketing calls/text messages;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | requirements for transmitting caller identification information; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------


• | restrictions on facsimile advertising.
--+---------------------------------------

 The Federal Telemarketing Consumer Fraud and Abuse Act of 1994 authorized the FTC to issue regulations designed to prevent deceptive and abusive telemarketing acts and practices. The FTC’s Telemarketing Sales Rule (“TSR”) became effective in January 1996 and has been amended over time. The TSR applies to most outbound telemarketing calls to consumers and portions of some inbound telemarketing calls. The TSR generally:
  
• | prohibits a variety of deceptive, unfair or abusive practices in telemarketing sales;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | subjects a portion of inbound calls to additional disclosure requirements;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | prohibits the disclosure or receipt, for consideration, of unencrypted consumer account numbers for use in telemarketing;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | mandates additional disclosure statements relating to certain products or services, and certain types of offers, especially those involving negative option features;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | establishes additional authorization requirements for payment methods that do not have consumer protections comparable to those available under the Electronic Funds Transfer Act or the Truth in Lending Act, or for telemarketing transactions involving pre-acquired account information and free-to-pay conversion offers;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | institutes a National “Do-Not-Call” Registry;
--+----------------------------------------------


• | provides guidelines on maintaining an internal “Do-Not-Call” list and honoring “Do-Not-Call” requests;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | limits the use of predictive dialers for outbound calls; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------


• | restricts the use of pre-recorded message telemarketing calls.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------

 In addition to the federal regulations, there are numerous state statutes and regulations governing telemarketing activities. These include restrictions on the methods and timing of telemarketing calls as well as disclosures required to be made during telemarketing calls and individual state “Do-Not-Call” registries. Some states also require that telemarketers register in the state before conducting telemarketing business in the state. Such registration can be time-consuming and costly. Many states have an exemption for companies 
 21


which have securities that are listed on a national securities exchange. In addition, employees who are involved in certain industry-specific sales activity, such as activity regarding insurance or mortgage loans, are required to be licensed by various state commissions or regulatory bodies and to comply with regulations enacted by those bodies.
 The industries that we serve are also subject to varying degrees of government regulation, including laws and regulations, relating to contracting with the government and data security. We are subject to some of the laws and regulations associated with government contracting as a result of our contracts with our clients and also as a result of contracting directly with the U.S. government and its agencies.
 We specifically train our marketing representatives to handle calls in an approved manner. While we believe we are in compliance in all material respects with all federal and state telemarketing regulations, compliance with all such requirements is costly and time-consuming. In addition, notwithstanding our compliance efforts, any failure on our part to comply with the registration and other legal requirements applicable to companies engaged in telemarketing activities could have an adverse effect on our business. We could become subject to litigation by private parties and governmental bodies, alleging a violation of applicable laws or regulations, which could result in damages, regulatory fines, penalties and possible other relief under such laws and regulations and the accompanying costs and uncertainties of such litigation and enforcement actions.
