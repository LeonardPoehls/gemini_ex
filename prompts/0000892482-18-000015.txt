management software company in July 2014, when the Company closed on the sale of its disc publishing assets to Equus Holdings, Inc. and Redwood Acquisition, Inc. 
In October 2014, the Company acquired Kulu Valley Ltd., a private limited company incorporated and operating in England and Wales, subsequently renamed Qumu Ltd (“Kulu Valley”). The acquisition was made to expand Qumu’s addressable market through the offering of Kulu Valley’s best-in-class video content creation capabilities and easy-to-deploy pure cloud solution, while providing customers with access to industry-leading video content management and delivery capability.
Enterprise Video Content Management and Delivery Software
To increase communication, engagement and collaboration between employees and stakeholders, organizations have and continue to be invested significantly in content and network infrastructure that connects these employees and stakeholders across offices, conference rooms, computers, tablets and smart phones. As part of this, enterprises are adopting video as a mainstream communication and collaboration tool because they understand its benefits over other mediums.
Qumu video content management software solutions allow organizations to create, capture, organize and deliver content across the extended enterprise to a wide variety of end points, including mobile devices and thin clients. Qumu's video platform supports both live and on-demand streaming, and also secure download capabilities, a critical component for enterprise delivery. Qumu provides information technology administrators and corporate communication leaders a way to securely address the challenges of video that might otherwise overwhelm their data networks while utilizing their existing information technology infrastructures, thereby maximizing their investment and enabling the rapid adoption of video in their content, collaboration, communication and marketing infrastructures.
Qumu provides an end-to-end solution with an intuitive and rich user experience to create, manage and deliver live and on-demand video content both behind and beyond the secure firewall. 
Capabilities and Products
Qumu Qx Enterprise Video Platform 
Qumu Qx is an end-to-end video creation, management and delivery solution for enterprises. Qx can be purchased as a perpetual software license, cloud-hosted software as a service (SaaS) or hybrid. Qx offers a scalable and extensible platform that organizations can use to improve how they lead, learn and collaborate both internally and externally. 
Qumu’s implementations can range in size from tens of thousands to millions of dollars. The Qx platform integrates with customers' existing video services (e.g., videoconferencing systems), business applications (e.g., Skype, WebEx, etc.,.) and broader IT infrastructures using Qumu's extensive application services or "APIs." Deployments also range from a single customer location to a global infrastructure serving over one hundred thousand corporate employees. Qumu’s platform solution components are deployed as needed to serve different capabilities of the enterprise video content lifecycle of creating, capturing, managing, delivering and experiencing video content.
Qx offers a flexible deployment model that can be leveraged by organizations in three different ways: 

• | Inside the firewall as an on-premise enterprise-grade solution for high quality, secure internal communication over existing networks


• | Outside of the firewall as a cloud-based solution for flexible, external communication applications, and


• | As a hybrid solution, providing the flexibility of cloud, combined with Qumu’s intelligent delivery technology.

Qx encompasses four distinct elements:

• | Video Capture


• | Video Content Management


• | Intelligent Delivery


• | Extensions and Add-Ons

Video Capture
Qumu’s intelligent video capture (sometimes referred to as ingest) dynamically supports unlimited video content sources, accommodating a wide variety of video formats. Video conferencing solutions have emerged as a rapidly growing source of video content. These range from high-end, hardware-intensive conference room systems, such as those provided by Polycom and Cisco, to popular unified communications solutions such as Skype for Business and WebEx.
Qumu brings streaming and management to these video communications tools. As video conferencing becomes the de facto form of team communication, organizations can record, manage and broadcast these videos live or on demand to hundreds or thousands of employees. Intelligent video capture allows users to record and broadcast using existing video conferencing tools. With one enterprise-wide video management and delivery platform, IT can extend their existing video conferencing system investment and concurrently move forward with new unified communications strategies.
Video Content Management
Organizations use Qumu to centrally manage all video content through a single interface. Qumu's video content management allows system users to ingest video, create metadata and share content quickly and securely to endpoints with rights and rules management. Some of Qx’s notable functionality includes: 
Creation & Editing
Qx provides comprehensive, easy-to-use tools to create and edit video from desktop and mobile devices or using conference room and studio systems. The tools can be used across a wide range of applications from creating a simple mobile phone presentation, to editing a video conference recording, to producing a multi-camera town hall event. 
Advanced Analytics
Qumu Advanced Analytics provide leaders and communications staff with real-time visibility and insights into employee engagement for both live streaming video and video on demand (VOD). Advanced Analytics also help IT teams monitor and solve issues with buffering, bit rate and latency across internal networks, VPNs and external CDNs.
Automated Workflows
Qx allows users to automate processes and comply with policies by creating workflows for content approval, management and viewing rights. Automated workflows can be set for specific types of meeting recordings with disclaimers, security, time of life settings, and repurposing parameters.

Security and Access Control
Qumu's access control model can leverage most major enterprise authentication solutions, securing access to videos, channels and administrative functions. In cases where a corporate authentication service is not available, Qumu provides its own user management tools for user creation, self-registration, approvals, and group assignment.
Speech Search
Qumu Speech Search allows organizations to use their video repository for eDiscovery, internal clipping services or simply to find information quickly. Qumu Speech Search can quickly analyze thousands of hours of audio and video, index all spoken words and phrases, and return results beyond what metadata or caption-based searches can provide.
Intelligent Delivery
Qx provides a diverse, flexible and robust series of solutions for enterprise delivery of live streaming or on demand video. At the core of Qumu’s solution is an intelligent business rules engine and CDN broker. This proprietary technology allows organizations to configure and optimize video for their specific offices, mobile users, and various endpoints. 
Qx’s intelligent delivery supports multiple content delivery network configurations, automatically and intelligently selecting the optimal video quality for a given user, delivering video via eCDN, software CDN, and/or public CDNs. Qumu’s intelligent delivery technology can be deployed as hardware, software, or Virtual Machine. Intelligent delivery can be centrally monitored, managed, and updated. 
Extensions and Add-Ons
Qx is designed to be a customizable, enhancing the customer’s enterprise communication and collaboration solution. With its service-based extensible architecture, Qx can be built upon by third-party developers. Current integrations and extensions from Qumu and its partners include Microsoft Office 365, SharePoint, Skype for Business, Yammer, IPTV, Jive, IBM Connections and Dashboard.
Extensibility is important for meeting customers who have complex and unique digital environments and for Qumu’s network of partners. Qumu’s open, service-based architecture enables customers to more easily support native apps for iOS, Android, and Windows Mobile platforms. Qx offers robust REST APIs for both user and administrative functions, allowing customers to develop integrations of their own on top of the Qumu platform.
Marketing and Distribution
Qumu’s solutions serve a growing customer base of medium- and large-sized enterprises across a wide range of vertical and horizontal markets, the five primary markets being 1) Banking, Finance and Insurance, 2) Manufacturing, 3) Services and Consulting, 4) Telecom and Technology, and 5) Biotech and Health Care. Qumu has historically targeted enterprises with 10,000+ employees and a history of video use for corporate communications, although its Qumu Cloud product can service organizations as small as 5,000 or more employees. Across all deployment types (cloud, on premise and hybrid), Qumu’s customers are among the largest Fortune 500 and Global 2000 companies in the world.
Qumu serves its customer base primarily via direct sales, and to a lesser extent via channel partners, offering a variety of deployment methodologies and business models to meet customer demand including software, software on server appliance, software-enabled devices, SaaS and managed services.
Qumu has been identified as a leader by multiple industry analysts:

• | Gartner’s Critical Capabilities reports focuses on a group of competing products or services based on a set of use cases that match typical client deployment scenarios. These use cases are based on the real-world problems that clients need to solve, as well as how they intend to use the technology or service within their enterprises. Out of 15 competitors outlined in the current Gartner report, Qumu received a #1 ranking in both Internal Executive Messaging and Internal Collaboration, a #2 ranking in Internal Training and a #3 ranking in External Video for Sales.


• | Aragon Research named Qumu a leader in its Video Content Management report.

Qumu sells products and services internationally through its U.S. operation and its subsidiaries in the United Kingdom and Japan. International sales comprised approximately 27% of revenues for each of the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015. During each of the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, the Company had one customer that accounted for more than 10% of its revenues.
Competition
Major competitors of Qumu include Kaltura, VBrick, Brightcove, MediaPlatform and Panopto. Qumu competes with these other companies based primarily upon its unique end-to-end solution for a complete video infrastructure that includes support for mobile devices and existing IT infrastructure. Qumu occasionally encounters organizations utilizing Microsoft’s Skype and Stream technologies. By some, Microsoft is viewed as a competitor, but our technology integrates and enables organizations to securely ingest, managed and distribute video content from a wide variety of organizational tool sets with greater flexibility and improved manageability. Qumu also differentiates itself from its competitors through its video ingestion and delivery technology, as well as its flexibility as to solution deployment and service options.
Research and Development
Qumu develops its software internally and licenses or purchases software from third parties. Research and development expense was $7.3 million, $8.5 million and $10.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
As of December 31, 2017, the Company employed 41 employees in research and development. This staff engages in research and development of new products and enhancements to existing products. In addition, Qumu partners with third parties to utilize their competencies in creating products to enhance its product offerings.
Intellectual Property
Qumu currently maintains three U.S. patents and has two non-provisional utility patent applications pending in the U.S. Further, Qumu protects the proprietary nature of its software primarily through copyright and license agreements. It is Qumu's policy to protect the proprietary nature of its newly developed products whenever they are likely to become significant sources of revenue. No assurance can be given that Qumu will be able to obtain patent or other protection for its products. In addition, Qumu has registered and may in the future register trademarks and other marks used in its business.
Qumu also licenses or purchases the intellectual property ownership rights of programs developed by others with license or technology transfer agreements that may obligate Qumu to pay a flat license fee or royalties, typically based on a dollar amount per unit shipped or a percentage of the revenue generated by those programs. Contractual obligations with respect to such licenses will require cash payments of $200,000 in 2018.
As the number of Qumu's products increases and the functionality of those products expand, Qumu believes that it may become increasingly subject to attempts by others to duplicate its proprietary technology and to the possibility of infringement of its intellectual property. In addition, although Qumu does not believe that any of its products infringe on the rights of others, third parties have claimed, and may in the future claim, Qumu's products infringe on their rights and these third parties may assert infringement claims against Qumu in the future. Qumu may litigate to enforce its intellectual property rights and to defend against claimed infringement of the rights of others or to determine the ownership, scope, or validity of Qumu's proprietary rights and the rights of others. Any claim of infringement against Qumu could involve significant liabilities to third parties, could require Qumu to seek licenses from third parties and could prevent Qumu from developing, selling or using its products.
