We currently focus our business on the sale of Chinese Fenjiu liquor and imported wines. We run a growing alcoholic beverage business guided by a core purpose: to promote premium alcoholic beverages to China’s population. We aim to achieve this purpose by catering to the ever-evolving tastes in alcohols through our creative marketing strategies and innovative product designs that target different age groups of China’s population. To that end, we have hired marketing talents who have decades of experience in effective alcohol brand building. As a result, we have managed to respond to the demand for Chinese Fenjiu liquor and imported wines in the Chinese marketplace.
 
The popularity behind Chinese Fenjiu liquor is its unique combination of light alcohol fragrance and its soft and subtle sweetness. This combination has been one of the predominant taste preference amongst Chinese drinkers. Our Chinese Fenjiu liquor is a 53-proof clear spirit with a long lasting clean aftertaste. Our strategic partner, Shanxi Xinghuacun Fenjiu Group Alcohol Industry Development Zone Sales Co., Ltd. (“Fenjiu Group”), produces our Chinese Fenjiu product. Its brewing process is guided by the principle of “clean” and “pure”, and such standard is achieved by double fermentation and double distillation process in order to increase the yield of ethanol and expel any unfavorable flavors. The fermented grains, usually sorghum and barley, will be distilled; the distilled grains will be fermented once more; then the re-fermented grains will be distilled again.
 
Modern competition among different types of Chinese hard liquor is largely dependent on brand recognition that was built upon decades of customer goodwill and unique marketing strategies. Fenjiu liquor is recognized highly amongst Chinese consumers. It has long been a common liquor choice for traditional Chinese festivities, thus enjoying a deep cultural recognition amongst Chinese drinkers.
 
We believe that Fenjiu liquor presents great business opportunities for us to utilize creative product designs and marketing strategies to attract Chinese consumers. Collaborating with the Fenjiu Group, the sole producer of Fenjiu liquor in China, we have been focusing on product design to try to convey a modern feel to our Fenjiu products while maintaining Fenjiu liquor’s historical elegance. We believe our designer packaging stands out from our competitors’, symbolized by its bright coloring and prominently fat-bellied jars. With creative designs and stylized name, our registered trademarks, such as Dagangjiu (translated as “Big Jar Liquor”), are effective in capturing young and older Chinese populations’ attention.

Established in 2017, we believe our imported wine distribution business has a high growth potential as evidenced from the marked prices of the imported wines from Spain and New Zealand, countries from where we import our wine products, in the current Chinese market. A great majority of competitive players have priced their 750mL bottles of wine imported from Spain and New Zealand well above RMB 200. This price falls within the premium range in the general Chinese wine market. Within the general Chinese wine market, the premium range enjoyed the highest year-on-year growth compared to other price tiers of wine in 2017. This pricing trend for premium wines is applicable to imported wine from Spain and New Zealand, which we believe will benefit our growth in 2018. Accordingly, our strategy is to continue pricing our imported wine products within the premium range levels to generate higher margins. Though marketing and brand identity are still integral part of wine business in China, wine sales are highly driven by the origin of the wines. Since Spanish and New Zealand are considered prime origins for wine productions, our wine products will continue grab the attention of Chinese drinkers, ensuring the sustainable growth of our imported wine business.
 
We have strategically organized our wholesale and marketing channels. We sell directly to our six major distributors who then retail our products to over 300 storefronts and outlets. Even though we do not retail our products online, we believe the internet is a great way to market our products. Aside from promoting our products through traditional TV platforms, we have established our reputation on existing major Chinese e-commerce platforms such as Taobao.com and further enhanced our business goodwill through our marketing on online-to-offline (“O2O”), business-to-business (“B2B”) and business-to-consumer (“B2C”) platforms. We promote our Fenjiu liquors and imported wine through WeChat and other social media apps to strengthen our marketing efforts and to educate the general public on Chinese liquor tasting and history of Chinese Fenjiu liquors.
 
We believe that effective marketing strategies and creative product designs are two major contributing factors to our success. To improve and maintain the effectiveness of our marketing strategies, we have established integrated and collaborative processes to drive coordinated operations across our marketing efforts and sales. Our marketing strategies enable us to promote multiple sales concepts across two major alcohol categories, effectively attracting different age and cultural groups of Chinese populations. Our marketing plans are strategically designed to be efficiently executed and are tailored to meet unique taste and evolving demands of Chinese people. As a result, we believe that the Company’s innovative and highly-customized designs draw considerable public attention, which in turns is a factor in maximizing sales. As an example, in May 2015, we introduced a new line of product, “Qishierbian” (translated as “72 Earthly Transformations”), which brings modern visuals, ancient stories and new interpretations of Chinese culture to traditional Fenjiu liquor. This has helped creating acceptance of Fenjiu liquor from younger generations and its success reflects the changing needs and preferences of the Chinese populations. Over the past three years, we have generated approximately RMB 15,413,175 in revenue under “Qishierbian”. We believe it is essential to improve the overall business sustainability through focusing on marketing strategies and creative product designs to support our success.
 
For the year ended June 30, 2018, we generated revenue of approximately 84.9% from Fenjiu liquor wholesale and approximately 15.1% from imported wine wholesale. For the year ended June 30, 2017, we generated revenue of approximately 89.9% from Fenjiu liquor wholesale and approximately 10.1% from imported wine wholesale. We have not experienced any seasonality in our business.

Industry Overview
 
Chinese Fenjiu Liquor Market
 
We believe that the long-term demand for Chinese hard liquor, especially Fenjiu liquor, will continue to grow in China. The overall business environment has been optimistic, due to the continuous economic growth evidenced by the significant growth of Chinese nominal gross domestic product (“GDP”). This has led to an ever-increasing growth in China’s per capita expenditures on food, tobacco, and alcoholic beverages, indicating increased consumers’ disposable income and willingness to spend money on alcoholic beverages in general. According to the National Bureau of Statistics of China, the sales volumes of Chinese liquor in China has remained relatively flat between 2012 and 2016. Given the increasing purchasing power and improving living standards, the sales volume of Chinese liquor increased from 11,267.0 million liters in 2012 to 13,057.1 million liters in 2016, with a compound annual growth rate (“CAGR”) of 3.8%. Overall, we believe consumers are increasingly interested in drinking better quality liquor. We expect that with the Chinese consumers’ increasing purchasing power the consumption of Chinese liquor will shift to higher quality products and therefore the Chinese liquor market is expected to experience growth in the near future. According to the China Insights Consultancy (“CIC”) report, there are approximately 1,578 Chinese liquor producers in China with annual revenue above RMB 20 million in 2016. These producers are mainly located in the southwest, northeast and central China. Given the Chinese government’s implementation of policies designed to control and limit spending on “the three public consumptions”, namely overseas travel, receptions, and official cars, the high-end Chinese liquor market in China has undergone extensive restructuring since 2012. 

Chinese government officials had a long history of using high-end liquors at reception events. However, in 2012, the Chinese governments implemented policies designed to control and limit spending on “the three public consumptions”, namely overseas travel, receptions, and use of government vehicles. Ripples of this anti-corruption campaign are felt beyond the high-end liquor industry, in sectors that heavily rely on China’s gifting culture and the lavish lifestyle of the privileged for growth. This extensive restructuring of Chinese liquor market caused by the anti-corruption campaign from Chinese government lasted for several years. As a result, the overall spending on high-end liquor market in China was limited and the sales volumes of Chinese high-end liquor has remained relatively flat till 2016. Nowadays, the structure of Chinese liquor market is stable again and has a steady growth supported by constant economic growth in China. Chinese consumers are expected to spend more on purchasing high-end liquors led by their increasing purchasing power.
 
Fenjiu Group and its subsidiaries are the sole suppliers of Fenjiu liquor in China. Fenjiu liquor has a relatively long history and is one of the world-famous Chinese liquor brands. Due to the Chinese government’s implementation of policies meant to control and limit spending on “the three public consumptions”, sales revenue in the Fenjiu liquor market have followed a downward trend since 2012. However, with increasing per capita incomes and rising demand for mid- to high-range products, the Fenjiu liquor market started to rebound in 2015, the market has expanded in terms of sales revenue to reach RMB5,117.9 million in 2016. Shanxi Province is the main market of Fenjiu liquor. Approximately 55% of Fenjiu liquor sales revenue was achieved in Shanxi in 2016. It is expected that the sales revenue of Fenjiu liquor will reach a further RMB10,532.0 million in China by 2022, increasing at a CAGR of 12.8% between 2016 and 2022.
 
According to the CIC report, at the end of 2016, the total number of Fenjiu liquor distributors reached 987 in China. The Fenjiu liquor distribution market is highly competitive with no single distributor occupying a major share of the market.
 
There are relatively high entry barriers for new competitors in the Fenjiu liquor distribution market. Firstly, it is important for new entrants to get an authorization from Fenjiu Group, which is the sole provider of Fenjiu liquor products in China, to distribute Fenjiu Group’s products. Fenjiu Group started placing stricter requirements on its distributors, including, for example, new sales target, rich experience in the industry, good past performance in cooperation with the Group, etc. Thus, it has become increasingly difficult for new players to enter the market. Fenjiu liquor enjoys widespread popularity in and around Shanxi Province, with markets in other parts of China being significantly smaller. It is therefore important for new entrants to have a pre-existing distribution network in certain regions of China in order to be successful. It remains risky for new entrants to enter into new areas where Fenjiu liquor is not yet fully established and where the distribution market is already saturated. Distributors range from mom-and-pop stores in Shanxi Province to larger companies with years of experience in the Fenjiu liquor industry, each competing for a fair share of the market. Intense competition arises between distributors within the same region, selling the same or different Fenjiu brands. Fenjiu liquor includes a variety of products, differing in terms of ABV, vintage, recipe, etc. Although there are no dominant varieties in the market, some are preferred by end consumers more than others. However, almost all of these popular varieties have already been taken up by exclusive distributors. Thus, new entrants might find it difficult to source popular products directly from Fenjiu Group or will be left to source them from existing distributors, which entails lower profit margins.

Chinese Wine Market
 
According to the International Organization of Vine and Wine, or OIV, the per capita wine consumption in China is much lower than the US average level between 2012 and 2016. After the reduction of “three public consumptions” in 2013, China’s per capita consumption showed a further decrease. However, the consumption pattern has changed and the wine consumption has grown into a mass consumption accompanied by a decrease in wine price. Compared with the world average consumption, China’s per capita wine consumption has been around one-third of the world’s average since 2010. The relatively low per capita wine consumption in China indicates great growth potential for China’s wine market in the future.


According to the CIC report, Chinese consumers should, between 2017 and 2022, develop the habit of drinking wine rather than other alcoholic beverages, wine consumption is considered a healthier option. In addition, the development of O2O platforms selling wine will most certainly facilitate the purchase of wine in China.
 
There are three market drivers for China’s wine market. Firstly, China’s per capita disposable income has been increasing rapidly mainly due to increasing wages. Rising disposable income translates into increasing purchasing power for Chinese people; it also means that Chinese people tend to focus more on their quality of life. As wine is considered in China as a premium product with some beneficial health effect, we believe that increasing purchasing power will stimulate the further growth of wine consumption. In addition, the characteristics associated with drinking wine, such as beautification and antioxidation, play an important role in contributing to its consumption, especially for female customers. Secondly, China’s urbanization rate has been improving greatly during the past decades and the Chinese government sets up the goal that the urbanization rate of China is set to reach 60% by 2020. With the further improvement of the urbanization rate in China, the retail sales market is experiencing a rapid growth in urban regions in China. Thirdly, there are favorable national and international policies for imported wine. According to bilateral trade agreements signed by the PRC government with New Zealand, Chile and Australia, imported goods from the three countries will benefit from low tariff rates, effective from 2019. According to those agreements, by 2019, these tariffs will be totally eliminated. This favorable policy should reduce the wine retailing price and hence contribute to a growth in sales.
 
Our Strengths 
 
Our Company has a high brand recognition in the Chinese Fenjiu liquor market 
 
Our “Dagangjiu” brand Fenjiu liquor is one of the Chinese Fenjiu liquor market’s popular brands. We believe that we have built a reputation among Chinese drinkers as a reliable Fenjiu liquor brand. Our customers choose our Fenjiu products for personal enjoyment, gifts for loved ones or superior quality alcohol for special occasions such as weddings and other traditional Chinese festivities. We have also leveraged the strength of the Fenjiu Group to become one of the leading Fenjiu brands in international alcohol festivals such as the World Wine Culture Expo held in Shanxi, China in 2017. We believe our high brand recognition anchors our packaging and distribution business with strong customer goodwill in Shanxi province and beyond, providing us with a competitive advantage.
Our Marketing Experts’ Extensive Experience and Superior Reputation in our Industry 
 
We believe that our competitors’ marketing team cannot match our marketing experts’ extensive industry experience and their superior reputation. We believe our commercial campaigns build strong credibility with consumers and potential liquor distribution partners and shape the market trends of consumer preferences and business evolutions in the industry.
 
Additionally, we believe our marketing expertise and design proficiency required to successfully attract new customers combined with our ability to generate a range of business concepts and capability to customize each sales opportunity according to customers’ need are advantages when competing in the Chinese Fenjiu market. Our expertise also allows us to successfully manage the numerous regional and cultural complexities involved in operating a traditional liquor business in China.

A Flexible Business Model 
 
Our current business model is flexible. It can be diversified in terms of the product flavors we serve and producers we sign commissions with. While operating a mix of marketing campaigns and business concepts under our own registered trademarks “Dagangjiu” and “Dagang Jiufang”, we entrust the liquor production to reputed large-scale producers. Currently, we are in a strategic partnership with Fenjiu Group.
 
Although our current business strategy emphasizes on the marketing, packaging and distribution of Fenjiu liquor and imported wines, should we want to change our business strategy to cater to more popular product types such as Luzhou-flavor liquor and Maotai-flavor liquor, we can quickly adjust our marketing concepts and product packaging to meet customers’ evolving needs and preferences. Since our bard is well recognized and the intellectual property used for our brand is owned by us, we can change our strategic partnerships to address new product preferences while maintaining our accumulated goodwill. This approach enables us to update marketing concepts and product mix any time and allows us to be flexible in our marketing approach.
 
This reliable and flexible business model has contributed to the marketing resilience of our business performance.
 
Service-driven and Cohesive Management Team 
 
Our talented and dedicated senior management team has guided our organization through its expansion and, we believe, positioned us for continued growth. Each member of our team has an average of 20 years of expertise. Additionally, our management team possesses extensive experience across a broad range of disciplines, including Chinese liquor marketing, sales, E-Commerce, finance, franchising and business management. Our management team embraces our core purpose to “promote premium alcoholic beverages to the Chinese population of all ages” and exemplifies our passionate and customer-oriented culture, which is shared by our employees throughout our company. We believe this results in a service-driven and cohesive management team focused on long-term business growth.

Fenjiu Liquor Wholesale
 
For our Fenjiu liquor wholesale business, we secure a strategic partnership with dealers based on our market survey data, market positioning data, sales channels data, sales capabilities data and sales potential evaluation. We further evaluate dealers according to their geographical and administrative area and categorize them into provincial, municipal and county agents. We establish cooperative relationships and strategic sales partnership amongst them to further facilitate the sales of our products. We wholesale our Fenjiu liquor products directly to these dealers.
 
In addition, we target dealers with sales access to retail stores and outlets. We sell our Fenjiu products with simple and bulk packaging to these dealers. The main idea is to achieve profit margins through the reduction of high-end designs and packaging while maintaining a relatively low price of our Fenjiu liquor products. Through this approach, we believe we can reach a greater number of Chinese customers who are attracted by the cost-effectiveness of our products. We sell our products to our dealers who then resell these products to retail stores and outlets.

Competition
 
There is intense competition in the Chinese liquor market. As a result, customers face a tremendous number of choices when deciding which brand or product to choose from.
 
Fenjiu Group has nearly 1,000 multi-layered distributors as of the beginning of 2018, with these distributors often serving as Fenjiu brand co-builders. Although the Fenjiu Group is now widely known as the only producer of Fenjiu throughout the market, intense competition in the wholesale market remains since Fenjiu liquor distributors will continue working to co-build and enhance their respective brand image alongside Fenjiu Group to capture additional market share from competitors. By the end of 2016, there were nearly 1,000 distributors of Fenjiu liquor in China. Distributors range from mom-and-pop stores in Shanxi Province to larger companies with years of experience in the Fenjiu liquor industry, each competing for a fair share of the market. Competition is even more intense amongst the distributors within the same region.
 
The wine industry in China is also very competitive. Competitors conduct various marketing activities and pricing strategies in an effort to keep their market shares, which directly impact our sales, revenues and profitability. We follow the market trend constantly and adjust our own advertising, promotion, pricing and sourcing strategies accordingly. In addition, competitors in the Chinese wine market compete against us for regaining highly qualified marketing personnel and staff members.
 
In response to the intense competition in the Chinese liquor and wine markets, we have implemented a number of initiatives designed to expand revenues. Our revenue enhancement initiatives include expanding our marketing efforts, developing new products and working with start-up and bulk-sale customers to decrease our marketing costs.
 
Regulations
 
Huaxin is in the alcohol wholesale business, including Fenjiu liquor wholesale and imported wine wholesale, in China. Huaxin is subject to various existing and probable governmental regulations on its alcohol wholesale business.
 
According to the Regulations on Administration of Liquor of Shanxi Province which came into effect on January 1, 2000, entities or individuals who engage in liquor wholesale in Shanxi Province shall apply for a License for Liquor Wholesale. Huaxin has obtained the License for Liquor Wholesale and such license will expire on December 31, 2018. Also, Huaxin is required to obtain the Food Operation License pursuant to the Administrative Measures for Food Operation Licensing which came into effect on November 17, 2017. Huaxin has obtained Food Operation License and such license will expire on August 31, 2022. Nevertheless, Huaxin may be subject to penalties by PRC regulatory authorities if the wholesale license and food operation license is not timely renewed after expiration.
 
Currently, license for liquor wholesale is no longer required in nationwide level, but it is still required in some particular Provinces, such as Shanxi Province and Shanghai. In addition to Shanxi Province, the Company also sell liquor to other Provinces, namely Fujian, Ningxia, Gansu, Xinjiang, Beijing, Shanghai and Hebei Province. Liquor wholesale business of the Company is operated by its subsidiaries, Huaxin and Fenyang Jinqiang Wine Co., Ltd. (“Jinqiang”), both of which were established in Shanxi Province and have obtained wholesale licenses in Shanxi Province. According to our telephone consultation with the competent authorities in Beijing, Shanghai, Ningxia, Gansu and Hebei, no wholesale license is required for Huaxin or Jinqiang in such Provinces since Huaxin and Jinqiang were established in Shanxi Province and have already obtained wholesale licenses in Shanxi Province. In conclusion, no further wholesale license is required in other Provinces where the Company operates its business, unless the Company newly establish operating entity in such Provinces and license is still required for liquor wholesale business in such Provinces. 
 
Regarding the imported wine business, pursuant to the Foreign Trade Law of the People’s Republic of China (Revised in 2016), a foreign trade operator engaged in import and export of goods shall register with competent local regulatory authorities in Shanxi Province that in charge of foreign trades; and pursuant to the Administrative Provisions of the Customs of the People’s Republic of China on the Registration of Customs Declaration Entities, consignors and consignees of imported and exported goods shall go through customs declaration entity registration formalities with their local Customs in accordance with the applicable provisions. Huaxin has completed the registration for a record as a foreign trade operator and has obtained Certificate of the Customs of the People’s Republic of China on the Registration of Customs Declaration Entities. The registration for a record as a foreign trade operator has no time limit; while the validity period for Certificate of the Customs of the PRC on the Registration of Customs Declaration Entities is two years and such certificate can be renewed before the expiration date. Nevertheless, Huaxin may be subject to penalties by PRC regulatory authorities if Huaxin fails to go through the modification formalities in the event of a change to any of its details registered with the competent governmental authorities including its name, nature, domicile and legal representative.

Customers
 
Our customers are downstream distributors. We rely upon several of our large customers from whom we generated substantial revenue each year, and the composition of our largest customers has changed from year to year. For the year ended June 30, 2018, five of our customers, Beijing Huaxin Rongfa Trading Co., Ltd., Fuqing Jing Hong Trading Co., Ltd., Shanghai Baiwang Trading Co., Ltd., New Venus Trade (Fujian) Group Co., Ltd. and Shanxi Moneng Trading Co., Ltd. represented approximately 16.3%, 16.2%, 11.5%, 11.2% and 10.6% of Huaxin’s revenue, respectively. For the year ended June 30, 2017, four of our customers, Fuqing Jing Hong Trading Co., Ltd., Beijing Huaxin Rongfa Trading Co., Ltd., New Venus Trade (Fujian) Group Co., Ltd. and Shanghai Baiwang Trading Co., Ltd. represented approximately 27%, 30%, 11% and 15% of Huaxin’s revenue, respectively.

These purchase agreements customarily cover a one-year period and contain material subsections such as targeted customers’ selling goals, representation and warranties of the customers, rights and responsibility of the customers, pricing adjustment, logistics and shipping, payment methods, downstream management and dispute resolutions. While we believe that one or more of our major customers could account for a significant portion of our sales for at least the year 2019, we anticipate that our customer’s base will continue to expand and that in the future we will be less dependent on major customers.
Suppliers
 
We primarily rely upon five main suppliers from whom we purchase materials each year. For the year ended June 30, 2018, five of our suppliers, Shanxi Xinghuacun Liquor Group Wine Industry Development Zone Sales Co., Ltd., Fuzhou Tongshunda Trading Co., Ltd., Fenyang Xinghua Haokoufu Wine Industry Flagship Store, Shanxi Yuanquan Drinking Co., Ltd. and Shanxi Xinjin Merchants Wine Group Co., Ltd., accounted for 41%, 17%, 10%, 8% and 8% of our total supply purchases.

All supplier contracts with large suppliers were entered from year to year on an arm’s length basis.
 
In general, we enter into procurement agreements in the ordinary course of business with our suppliers, pursuant to a form of supply order typically on a “deal by deal” basis. However, we have a strategic partnership with Fenjiu Group. We entered into a partnership agreement with Fenjiu Group on June 30, 2017, pursuant to which Fenjiu Group has agreed to supply us $4,379,850 worth of Fenjiu liquor during a three-year period.

Protection of our intellectual property is a strategic priority for our business. We rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws, as well as confidentiality agreements, to establish and protect our proprietary rights. We do not rely on third-party licenses of intellectual property for use in our business.
