Overview
 
Asta Funding, Inc. (“Asta”), a Delaware corporation, together with its wholly owned significant operating subsidiaries Palisades Collection, LLC, Palisades Acquisition XVI, LLC (“Palisades XVI”), Palisades Acquisition XIX, LLC (“Palisades XIX”), Palisades Acquisition XXIII, LLC (“Palisades XXIII”), VATIV Recovery Solutions LLC (“VATIV”), ASFI Pegasus Holdings, LLC (“APH”), Fund Pegasus, LLC (“Fund Pegasus”), GAR Disability Advocates, LLC (“GAR Disability Advocates”), Five Star Veterans Disability, LLC (“Five Star”), EMIRIC, LLC (“EMIRIC”), Simia Capital, LLC (“Simia”), Sylvave, LLC (“Sylvave”) (formerly known as Pegasus Funding, LLC (“Pegasus”)), Practical Funding LLC (“Practical Funding”), and other subsidiaries, which are not all wholly owned (the “Company,” “we” or “us”), is engaged in several business segments in the financial services industry including managing for its own account and servicing distressed charged off consumer receivables, disability advocacy through our wholly owned subsidiaries GAR Disability Advocates and Five Star and funding of personal injury claims, through our wholly owned subsidiaries Sylvave, Simia and Practical Funding.
 
For the period from October 1, 2017 to January 12, 2018, we owned an 80% interest in Pegasus of which we controlled 50%, and accounted for Pegasus under the equity method in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“US GAAP”). On January 12, 2018, the Company acquired the remaining 20% minority shareholder's interest in Pegasus, changed its name to Sylvave, and now currently owns 100% of Sylvave. Commencing on the date of acquisition, the Company consolidated the financial results of this entity, which will remain in operation only to collect on its current portfolio.
 
 We operate principally in the United States in three reportable business segments: consumer receivables, social security disability advocacy and personal injury claims. We previously operated a fourth segment when we engaged in the structured settlements business through our wholly owned subsidiary CBC Settlement Funding, LLC (“CBC”), which we sold on December 13, 2017.
 
As a result of the sale of CBC all periods presented herein account for CBC as a discontinued operation. This determination resulted in the reclassification of the historical assets and liabilities comprising the structured settlement business to assets and liabilities related to discontinued operations in the consolidated balance sheets, and a corresponding adjustment to our consolidated statements of operations to reflect discontinued operations for all periods presented. See Note 2 - Discontinued Operations in the Company's notes to the consolidated financial statements.
 
Financial Information about Operating Segments
 
The Company operates through strategic business units that are aggregated into three reportable segments: consumer receivables, social security disability advocacy and personal injury claims. The three reportable segments consist of the following:
 
Consumer receivables
 
This segment is engaged in the business of purchasing, managing for its own account and servicing distressed charged off consumer receivables.  Recently, our effort has been in the international areas (mainly South America), as we have curtailed our active purchasing of consumer receivables in the United States. 
 
Personal injury claims
 
This segment is comprised of purchased interests in personal injury claims from claimants who were a party to personal injury litigation. The Company advances to each claimant funds on a non-recourse basis at an agreed upon interest rate, in anticipation of a future settlement. The interest in each claim purchased consists of the right to receive, from such claimant, part of the proceeds or recoveries which such claimant receives by reason of a settlement, judgment or award with respect to such claimant’s claim.  Simia commenced funding personal injury settlement claims in January 2017 and ceased funding claims in June 2017. The Company is continuing its personal injury claims business in a new entity Practical Funding, which was formed on March 16, 2018. As of September 30, 2018, Practical Funding has not advanced any monies to claimants for personal injury claims.
 
 Social security disability advocacy
 
 This segment consists of advocacy groups representing individuals nationwide in their claims for social security disability and supplemental social security income benefits from the Social Security and Veterans Administration.

The consumer receivable segment and the social security disability advocacy segment each accounted for more than 10% of revenues in fiscal year 2018 and 2017. The following table summarizes the net revenues by percentage from the three lines of business for the fiscal years 2018 and 2017:
 

 | Year Ended September 30, |

Consumer receivables
 
Prior to purchasing a portfolio, we perform a qualitative and quantitative analysis of the underlying receivables and calculate the purchase price which is intended to offer us an adequate return on our investment after servicing expenses. After purchasing a portfolio, we actively monitor performance and review and adjust our collection and servicing strategies accordingly.
 
We purchase receivables from credit grantors and others through privately negotiated direct sales. We fund portfolios through internally generated cash flow.
 
Our objective is to maximize our return on investment in acquired consumer receivable portfolios. As a result, before acquiring a portfolio, we analyze the portfolio to determine how to best maximize collections in a cost efficient manner and decide whether to use our internal servicing and collection department, third-party collection agencies, attorneys, or a combination of all three options.
 
When we outsource the servicing of receivables, our management typically determines the appropriate third-party collection agencies and attorneys based on the type of receivables purchased. Once a group of receivables is sent to third-party collection agencies and attorneys, our management actively monitors and reviews the third-party collection agencies’ and attorneys’ performance on an ongoing basis. Based on portfolio performance considerations, our management may either (i)move certain receivables from one third-party collection agency or attorney to another, or (ii) sell portions of the portfolio accounts. Our internal collection unit, which currently employs three collection-related staff, including senior management, assists us in benchmarking our third-party collection agencies and attorneys, and provides us with flexibility for servicing a portion of our consumer receivable portfolios in-house.
 
We have increased our focus on purchasing consumer receivables internationally from foreign banks via direct sales or credit grantors. We have established relationships in Colombia and Peru with agencies and attorneys,, and we are committed to pursue opportunities available to acquire foreign consumer receivables.
 
Personal injury claims
 
Simia commenced operations in January 2017, and conducts its business solely in the United States. Simia obtained its business from external brokers and internal sales professionals soliciting individuals with personal injury claims. Simia and Sylvave have not funded any new cases since June 2017 and April 2017, respectively, but remain in business to liquidate their existing personal injury claim advance portfolios. Practical Funding will rely on generating business from attorneys and internal sales professionals soliciting individuals with personal injury claims.
 
Social security disability advocacy
 
GAR Disability Advocates and Five Star provide its social security disability advocacy services throughout the United States. They rely upon search engine optimization (“SEO”) to bring awareness to their intended market.
 
Industry Overview
 
Consumer receivables
 
The purchasing, servicing and collection of distressed charged-off consumer receivables is an industry that is driven by:
 

• | increasing levels of consumer debt; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
• | increasing defaults of the underlying receivables; and 
• | increasing utilization of third-party providers to collect such receivables.

 
Personal injury claims
 
The funding of non-recourse personal injury claims is driven by the growth of the market for financing personal injury claims. Individuals with personal injury claims incur current cash obligations which will not be recouped until insurance settlements are paid, or adjudicated in favor of the plaintiff, if at all. These funding contracts require a lien on the proceeds of either the settlement or the favorable resolution. The demand for providing financing to individuals in need of short term funds pending insurance settlements of their personal injury claims is driven by the long periods of time taken by the insurance industry to settle and pay such claims, primarily due to lengthy litigation and the court process.

Social security disability advocacy

The social security disability advocacy industry is driven by the increasing number of social security and disability applicants who find it difficult to obtain such benefits without the aid of third party assistance.
 
Strategy

Consumer receivables
 
Our primary objective both domestically and internationally is to utilize our management’s experience and expertise by identifying, evaluating, pricing and acquiring consumer receivable portfolios and maximizing collections of such receivables in a cost efficient manner. Our strategies include:

• | managing the collection and servicing of our consumer receivable portfolios, including outsourcing those activities to maintain low fixed overhead by partnering with experienced collection and debt buying firms;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | selling accounts on an opportunistic basis; and
--+------------------------------------------------


• | capitalizing on our strategic relationships to identify and acquire consumer receivable portfolios as pricing, financing and conditions permit.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Personal Injury Claims
 
Practical Funding will rely on developing new and existing relationships with attorneys and Company management. 
 
Social security disability advocacy

In fiscal year 2018, GAR Disability Advocates and Five Star continue to assist claimants in securing disability benefits from the Social Security and Veteran's administration.
 
Operations
 
Consumer Receivables
 
      The Operations Servicing Division of consumer receivables consists of the Collection Department, which handles disputes and correspondence, and the Accounting and Finance Department.
 
Collection Department
 
The Collection Department is responsible for making contact with and receiving calls from consumers for the purpose of collecting upon the accounts contained in our consumer receivables portfolios. The Collection Department uses a friendly, customer service approach to collect receivables and utilizes collection software, a dialer and telephone system to accomplish this goal. Each collector is responsible for:
 
Initiating outbound collection calls and handling incoming calls from the consumer;
 
Identifying the debt and iterating the benefits of paying the obligation;
 
Working with the customer to develop acceptable means of satisfying the obligation; and
 
Offering (if necessary, and based upon the individual situation) an obligor a discount on the overall obligation.
 
Accounting and Finance Department
 
In addition to customary accounting activities, the Accounting and Finance Department is responsible for:
 
Making daily deposits of customer payments;
 
 6


Posting payments to customers accounts; and
 
Providing senior management with daily, weekly and monthly receivable activity and performance reports.
 
Additionally, the Accounting Department reviews the results of the collection of consumer receivable portfolios that are being serviced by third-party collection agencies and attorneys. The Accounting and Finance Department also participates in the internal auditing and consolidation of all business segments.
Personal Injury Claims
 
The operations of the personal injury claims unit includes:
 
Sales/Underwriting/Collections - The underwriting group is responsible for analyzing the merits of the personal injury claims, collections of the portfolio and for business development and sales.
 
Accounting - The accounting group is responsible for the reporting of all the financial operations of the personal injury claims unit. 
 
 Social security disability advocacy
 
GAR Disability Advocates and Five Star consists of the following departments:
 
Sales/Marketing - The Sales Group is responsible for the sales strategy and advertising campaigns.
 
Intake - The Intake Department is responsible for client development, including screening leads and developing information on individual cases.
 
Case Management - The Case Management Department oversees client claims, in an attempt to obtain social security disability benefits. 
 
Accounting - The accounting group is responsible for the reporting of all the financial operations of the social security disability segment.
 
Marketing
 
Consumer receivables
 
The Company did not make any consumer debt purchases in fiscal year 2018. We have expanded relationships with credit providers internationally, as well as maintained our existing relationships domestically with brokers, finance companies and other credit providers. We are working to expand our name recognition internationally by attending international conferences, utilizing email solicitations and attending face-to-face bank meetings.
 
Personal injury claims
 
Practical Funding will not invest in a formal marketing program at this time. However, it will rely on internal sales, underwrting and attorneys to enhance our presence in the market.
 
Social security disability advocacy
 
Security Disability Advocacy utilizes SEO to bring more awareness to prospective clients. 
 
Competition
 
Consumer receivables
 
With the competitive nature of the domestic market, there are strategic advantages of acquiring portfolios internationally in countries such as Colombia and Peru. We cannot assure that the international competition will not increase in the future, affecting our consumer receivables financial performance.
 
 7


We compete with:
 

• | other purchasers of consumer receivables, including third-party collection companies; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | other financial services companies who purchase consumer receivables.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Some of our competitors are larger and more established and may have substantially greater financial, technological, personnel and other resources than we have, including greater access to the credit and capital markets.
 
We compete in the marketplace for consumer receivable portfolios based on many factors, including:
 

• | purchase price;
--+----------------


• | representations, warranties and indemnities requested;
--+-------------------------------------------------------


• | timeliness of purchase decisions; and
--+--------------------------------------


• | reputation.
--+------------

 
We cannot assure that we will be able to compete successfully against current or future competitors or that competition will not increase in the future. 
 
Personal injury claims
 
The litigation funding business is highly competitive and fragmented, and we expect that competition from new and existing companies will continue. We compete in the litigation funding marketplace based on many factors, including:
 
cost of funds advanced;
 
reputation; and
 
marketing costs.
 
We believe that our personal injury claims funding management team has expertise and experience in identifying, evaluating, pricing, and managing the funding of personal injury claim cases. However, we cannot assure that our litigation funding businesses will be able to compete against current or future competitors or that competition will not increase in the future.
 
 Social Security Disability Advocacy
 
The social security disability advocacy environment is competitive. We believe that the management of GAR Disability Advocates and Five Star have the knowledge to compete in this environment. Nevertheless, we can offer no assurance that the business will remain competitive against current and future competitors.
Seasonality and Trends
 
Consumer receivables
 
Our management believes that our operations may, to some extent, be affected by high delinquency rates and by lower recoveries on consumer receivables acquired for liquidation during or shortly following certain holiday periods.
 
Personal injury claims
 
There are no discernible trends to indicate seasonality in the personal injury claims business.
 
Social Security Disability Advocacy

There is no indication that seasonality has any noticeable impact on the social security disability process.
 
 8


Technology
 
Consumer receivables
 
We believe that a high degree of automation is necessary to enable us to grow and successfully compete with other companies in our business sector. Accordingly, we continually look to upgrade our technology systems to support the servicing and recovery of consumer receivables acquired for liquidation. Our telecommunications and technology systems allow us to quickly and accurately process large amounts of data necessary to purchase and service consumer receivable portfolios. In addition, we rely on the information technology of our third-party collection agencies and attorneys and periodically review their systems to ensure that they can adequately service the consumer receivable portfolios outsourced to them.
 
Due to our desire to increase productivity through automation, we periodically review our systems for possible upgrades and enhancements. We are continually working to enhance our international systems capabilities enabling us to effectively compete in the international marketplace.
 
Personal injury claims
 
Practical Funding will be dependent a website to maintain and increase its business and, therefore, must remain current in its technology.
 
Social Security Disability Advocacy

GAR Disability and Five Star rely on substantial use of the internet and, therefore, endeavors to remain current technologically.
 
Government Regulation
 
Consumer receivables
 
Our businesses are subject to extensive federal and state regulations. The relationship of a consumer and a creditor is extensively regulated by federal, state and local laws, rules, regulations and ordinances. These laws include, but are not limited to, the following federal statutes and regulations: the Federal Truth-In-Lending Act, the Fair Credit Billing Act (“FCBA”), the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and the Fair Credit Reporting Act (“FCRA”), as well as comparable statutes in states where consumers reside and/or where creditors are located. Among other things, the laws and regulations applicable to various creditors impose disclosure requirements regarding the advertisement, application, establishment and operation of credit card accounts or other types of credit programs. Federal law requires a creditor to disclose to consumers, among other things, the interest rates, fees, grace periods and balance calculation methods associated with their accounts. In addition, consumers are entitled to have payments and credits applied to their accounts promptly, to receive prescribed notices and to request that billing errors be resolved promptly. Moreover, some laws prohibit certain discriminatory practices in connection with the extension of credit. Further, state laws may limit the interest rate and the fees that a creditor may impose on consumers. Failure by creditors to comply with applicable laws could create claims and rights of offset by consumers that would reduce or eliminate their obligations, which could have a material adverse effect on our operations. Pursuant to agreements under which we purchase receivables, we are typically indemnified against losses resulting from the failure of the creditor to have complied with applicable laws relating to the receivables prior to our purchase of such receivables.
 
Certain laws, including the laws described above, may limit our ability to collect amounts owing with respect to the receivables regardless of any act or omission on our part. For example, under the FCBA, a credit card issuer may be subject to certain claims and defenses arising out of certain transactions in which a credit card is used if the consumer has made a good faith attempt to obtain satisfactory resolution of a problem relative to the transaction and, except in cases where there is a specified relationship between the person honoring the card and the credit card issuer, the amount of the initial transaction exceeds $50 and the place where the initial transaction occurred was in the same state as the consumer’s billing address or within 100 miles of that address. Accordingly, as a purchaser of defaulted receivables, we may purchase receivables subject to valid defenses on the part of the consumer. Other laws provide that, in certain instances, consumers cannot be held liable for, or their liability is limited to $50 with respect to, charges to the credit card credit account that were a result of an unauthorized use of the credit card account. No assurances can be given that certain of the receivables were not established as a result of unauthorized use of a credit card account, and, accordingly, the amount of such receivables may not be collectible by us.
 
 9


Several federal, state and local laws, rules, regulations and ordinances, including, but not limited to, the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (“FDCPA”) and the Federal Trade Commission Act and comparable state statutes, regulate consumer debt collection activity. Although, for a variety of reasons, we may not be specifically subject to the FDCPA or certain state statutes that govern third-party debt collectors, it is our policy to comply with laws in our collection activities. Additionally, our third-party collection agencies and attorneys may be subject to these laws. To the extent that some or all of these laws apply to our collection activities or our third-party collection agencies’ and attorneys’ collection activities, failure to comply with such laws could have a material adverse effect on us.
 
In order to comply with the foregoing laws and regulations, we provide a comprehensive development training program for our new collection/dispute department representatives and on-going training for all collection/dispute department associates. All collection and dispute representatives are tested annually on their knowledge of the FDCPA and other applicable laws. Account representatives not achieving our minimum standards are required to complete a FDCPA review session and are then retested. In addition, annual supplemental instruction in the FDCPA and collection techniques is provided to all our account representatives.
 
There are significant corporate governance and executive compensation-related provisions in the Dodd Frank Wall Street Reform and Provision Act (“Dodd-Frank Act”) that required the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) to adopt additional rules and regulations in areas such as corporate governance, and executive compensation . Our efforts to comply with these requirements have resulted in an increase in expenses and a diversion of management’s time from other business activities. We are subject to changing rules and regulations of federal and state governments, the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (“PCAOB”), the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc. (“FINRA”) and the NASDAQ Global Market, all of which have issued a significant number of new and increasingly complex requirements and regulations over the course of the last several years and continue to develop additional regulations and requirements in response to laws enacted by Congress.
 
The Dodd-Frank Act subjects us to substantial additional federal regulation, and we cannot predict the effect of such regulation on our business, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. Through the Dodd-Frank Act, Congress established the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (the “CFPB”), which has regulatory, supervisory and enforcement authority over entities involved in consumer financial markets. The CFPB has the authority to conduct periodic examinations of “larger participants” in each market, and we believe it is likely that we will be subject to an examination.
 
The CFPB published a final rule that allows the agency to federally supervise the larger consumer debt collectors. The CFPB also released the field guide that examiners will use to ensure that companies and banks engaging in debt collection are following the law.
 
The consumer debt collection market covered by the rule includes three main types of debt collectors: first, firms that may buy defaulted debt and collect the proceeds for themselves; second, firms that may collect defaulted debt owned by another company in return for a fee; and third, debt collection attorneys that collect through litigation. A single company may be involved in any or all of these activities.
 
The CFPB’s supervisory authority over these entities began when the rule took effect on January 2, 2013. Under the rule, any firm that has more than $10 million in annual receipts from consumer debt collection activities will be subject to the CFPB’s supervisory authority. This authority will extend to about 175 debt collectors, which, according to the CFPB, account for over 60 percent of the industry’s annual receipts in the consumer debt collection market.
 
Pursuant to the CFPB’s supervisory authority, examiners assess potential risks to consumers and whether debt collectors are complying with requirements of federal consumer financial law. Among other things, examiners evaluate whether debt collectors provide required disclosures; use accurate information; maintain a consumer complaint and dispute resolution process; and communicate with consumers in the manner required by law.
 
The CFPB’s general Supervision and Examination Manual, as well as its examination manual specific to the debt collection market, provide guidance on how the bureau conducts its monitoring of debt collection activities. Examiners will evaluate the quality of the regulated entity’s compliance management systems, review practices to ensure they comply with federal consumer financial law, and identify risks to consumers throughout the debt collection process. The CFPB can seek relief that includes: rescission or reformation of contracts, restitution, disgorgement of profits, payment of damages, limits on activities and civil money penalties of up to $1 million per day for knowing violations.
 
As a company that engages in debt collection, we need to understand the oversight that the CFPB brings. Preparing for a CFPB audit will cost time and money. Additionally, the CFPB has the power to bring an enforcement action or cause a required settlement. In addition, the amount of privileged and confidential information the CFPB could release, can lead to private lawsuits, including class and mass actions, as well as other state and federal agency oversight.
 
 10


The CFPB is expressly charged with prohibiting unfair, deceptive or abusive acts or practices. Through its broad powers to regulate and enforce federal consumer financial laws, the CFPB could place restrictions on our business, the businesses of our customers and the business of our affiliates, if the CFPB were to determine through rulemaking, supervisory or enforcement actions, for example, that particular acts or practices were unfair, deceptive or abusive to consumers.
 
The CFPB thus exercises supervisory authority over us. At this time, it is not possible or practical to attempt to provide a comprehensive analysis of how these laws and regulations may impact debt collectors.
 
Additionally, the Dodd-Frank Act empowers state attorneys general (or the equivalent thereof) to bring civil actions in federal district court (or a state court that is located in that state and that has jurisdiction over the defendant), to enforce Title X of the Act or regulations issued by the CFPB thereunder. Therefore, we could also be the subject of investigations and enforcement actions by the Federal Trade Commission or by state agencies (e.g., state attorneys general) with powers to enforce CFPB regulations and the FCRA. Additional laws or amendments to existing laws, may be enacted that could impose additional restrictions on the servicing and collection of receivables. Such new laws or amendments may adversely affect our ability to collect the receivables.
 
The Dodd-Frank Act authorized the CFPB to prescribe rules interpreting the FDCPA. On November 12, 2013, the CFPB signaled its intention to promulgate substantive rules under the FDCPA by publishing an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (ANPR) with regard to debt collection practices. The ANPR requested comments with regard to a wide array of issues relating to debt collection. The comment period closed on February 28, 2014. The CFPB has not yet issued a proposed rule. In its Spring 2018 rulemaking agenda, the CFPB stated that it intends to issue a proposed rule in March 2019.
 
The Company has and will continue to have a substantive compliance program and maintain procedures to ensure that the law is followed and that consumer complaints are dealt with in an appropriate fashion.
 
We currently hold a number of licenses issued under applicable consumer credit laws or other licensing statutes or regulations. Certain of our current licenses, and any licenses that we may be required to obtain in the future, may be subject to periodic renewal provisions and/or other requirements. Our inability to renew licenses or to take any other required action with respect to such licenses could have a material adverse effect upon our results of operation and financial condition.
 
Personal injury claims

Numerous states have recently introduced legislation with respect to the litigation funding business, which, up to now, has been largely unregulated.  Recently proposed laws, while varying from state to state, generally would establish requirements for contracts relating to litigation funding, including setting maximum amounts of interest, fees and other charges that may be imposed.
 
Social security disability advocacy

The availability of funds to pay Social Security disability and Veteran's benefits, are dependent on governmental regulation and budgetary constraints, which could have a material impact on the GAR Disability Advocates and Five Star business.
 
  Employees
