ITEM 1. | BUSINESS
----------------------------------+---------

History
 
ExeLED Holdings Inc. was incorporated in the State of Delaware on October 20, 1986 under the name “Verilink Corporation.” We have also been known as Energie Holdings, Inc. and Alas Aviation Corp. On December 31, 2013, we entered into a Share Exchange Agreement (the “Share Exchange Agreement”) with OELC, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Energie LLC (hereinafter referred to as, “Energie”). The Share Exchange Agreement was not effective until July 2, 2014 due to a variety of conditions subsequent that needed to be met, which are described below. Upon effectiveness, we issued 33,000,000 “restricted” shares of our common stock, representing approximately 65% of our then issued and outstanding voting securities, in exchange for all of the issued and outstanding member interests of Energie. The accounting is identical to that resulting from a reverse acquisition, except that no goodwill or other intangible is recorded.
 
The closing of the Share Exchange Agreement was conditioned upon certain, limited customary representation and warranties, as well as conditions to close, such as the total shares of Energie Holdings, Inc. issued and outstanding being limited to 51,000,000, and the completion of an audit of Energie’s financial statements. Following the execution of the Share Exchange Agreement, but prior to closing, an additional 400,000 shares were issued and the limitation of 51,000,000 shares was waived, allowing for the issuance.
 
Thereafter, on January 27, 2014, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”) with two of our then wholly owned subsidiaries, Energie Holdings, Inc. and Alas Acquisition Company. The net effect of the Merger Agreement was to effectuate a name change from Alas Aviation Corp., to Energie Holdings, Inc. in order to provide a better understanding to investors of our entry into the light-emitting diode (“LED”) lighting industry. Our management also changed. On November 30, 2015, we filed a Certificate of Amendment to our Certificate of Incorporation with the State of Delaware to change our name from “Energie Holdings, Inc.” to “ExeLED Holdings Inc.”

As a result of these transactions we are now a holding company, with Energie acting as our operating subsidiary, engaged in the business of the import and sale of specialized interior lighting solutions to the architecture and interior design markets in North America. Our creative lighting products include both conventional fixtures and advanced solid-state technology that can integrate with digital controls and day-lighting to create energy efficiencies and a better visual environment. Our current business objective is to become a leading provider of advanced LED lighting solutions by acquiring and growing complementary LED based lighting fixture companies. We are focused on acquiring specialized lighting companies for the architecture and interior design markets for both commercial and residential applications, with the intention to grow, innovate, and fully capture the rapidly growing lighting market opportunities associated with solid state lighting. These objectives are subject to our obtaining additional financing, of which there can be no assurance.
 
All references herein to “us,” “we,” “our,” “Holdings,” or the “Company” refer to ExeLED Holdings Inc. and its subsidiary, and their respective business following the consummation of the Merger and Share Exchange Agreements, unless the context otherwise requires.
 
Description of Current Business 
 
Energie was founded in 2001 and is engaged in the import and sale of specialized interior lighting solutions to the architecture and interior design markets in North America. Our headquarters is located in Arvada, Colorado, and we also maintain a production and assembly facility in Zeeland, Michigan.
 
During the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, what success we did have was with unique and LED products in several market segments. The demand that we experienced was in education, commercial office space, large multi-unit luxury residential and health care.
 
We have developed an end-to-end production and distribution platform for imported lighting products featuring HID, fluorescent, and LED technologies. Long term contracts with five European manufacturers and one in Taiwan provide us with exclusive North American distribution rights to over 270 total products in 37 categories. After processing any modifications necessary to meet Underwriter’s Laboratories™ (“UL/CUL”) standards, and building code requirements, the products are sold to customers through a network of over 50 independent lighting sales agents. In addition to a highly competitive commission structure, we provide our sales force with promotional materials, product training and technical support.
 
We intend to capitalize on these European lighting companies’ desire to penetrate North American markets by solving many of the problems these producers encounter when approaching these markets. These obstacles include designs that do not meet UL/CUL standards and building codes, the need to provide appropriate North American oriented marketing and product information and specifications, experience to leverage the lighting industry sales agent network, and market based product supply.
 
Our business strategy is to enter into exclusive sales agreements with European suppliers that have unique lighting products and to bridge the divide between product desires of North American architects, lighting designers, electrical engineers, and interior designers who wish to access innovative European products and the desires of European manufacturers. As these European partners are continually developing new products, we collaborate in the fixture design process and have the right to launch such products in North America. In many cases, our partners will co-fund the frontend costs associated with launching new products. However, we require additional working capital to embark on our growth strategy. We estimate that we will need up to $2,000,000 in additional working capital to accomplish our initial business objectives of developing and launching new products for Energie, but significantly more capital to effectuate the acquisition campaign we have discussed elsewhere herein. See “Part II, Item 7, Management’s Discussion – Liquidity and Capital Resources”.

We have been, and continue to engage in, the design, development, enhancement, and marketing of advanced commercial grade illumination products that exclusively use LED’s as their light source in the continental United States, Canada and Puerto Rico. Our products include LED hanging and recessed ceiling fixtures, recessed wall fixtures and wall sconces. Our branded products have been installed in a wide variety of settings including commercial office space, financial trading floors, health care facilities, museums, schools, restaurants, retail stores and other public locations.
 
The latest analysis “2017 Global Lighting Market Outlook” published on November 2, 2016 by LEDinside, a division of TrendForce, finds that the LED lighting market was worth US $29.6 billion in 2016 and is to rise to US $33.1 billion in 2017. Meanwhile, the penetration rate of LED lighting is expected to reach 52%. Thanks to regional lighting development, LED lighting is expected to account for 23% of total lightings in Europe by 2016, which is the highest across the world. The second and third highest regions are to be found in North America and China. However, the Asia-Pacific region is experiencing the fastest growth rate in LED lighting.


According to a recent Freedonia Research report the LED Lighting Fixtures segment of the industry is estimated at $4 billion of architectural, specification-grade lighting fixtures with innovative, differentiated lighting products that exemplify:
 

· | Energy efficiency focused on the disruptive LED technology; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | High performance with respect to quantity and quality of light through superior optic design; and 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Aesthetic design that appeals to the senses while allowing architects and designers to make strong visual statements by accessing European lighting fixture designers. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
In order to secure such projects we cultivate relationships and build our brand through marketing and sales efforts aimed at decision-makers responsible for lighting; primarily architects, lighting designers, electrical engineers, interior designers, space planners and other product designators. We maintain a network of over 50 third-party sales agencies across North America to represent our products. Lighting sales agencies in the commercial lighting market are standalone, commission-based, geographically specific companies that represent many different manufacturers and represent only lighting fixtures and lighting control systems. We support our agents with sales and marketing resources to help drive “sell through” of our branded products. All products are assembled to Underwriter’s Laboratory requirements in our factory to control quality and meet lead time requirements of our customers.
 
Our business model and product strategy is based upon collaboration with leading European lighting manufacturing companies, including Rudolpf Zimmermann, Bamberg Gmbh, Bamberg, Germany, Regent Beleuchtungskorper AG, Basel, Switzerland, Trilux GmbH & Co. KG, Arnsberg, Germany, Multiline Licht NV, Lummen, Belgium, Luxiona-Troll, Canovelles, Spain and Tons Lightogy Inc., New Taipei City, Taiwan. Except for the agreement with RZB and Tons Lightogy, which were executed in 2012, each of these other agreements have been in place for over ten (10) years and are renewable for additional 2 year terms. Each of the agreements contain standard warranties, are either FOB manufacturer or CFR destination, and title and risk of loss passes to us upon delivery, when payment becomes due. Each also includes a list of products that are manufactured by each respective manufacturer. Order cancellation is allowed up until 21 days prior to delivery, except for Trilux, which requires a 6-month written notice. Thereafter, no cancellation is allowed. With the exception of Multiline Licht NV, the agreements are exclusive to us throughout North America.
 
The North American architectural and design community has long recognized that European lighting manufacturers have distinctive, innovative and technologically advanced product offerings. Arguably, we believe European designs and technology are several years ahead of what is available in North America. However, designers have historically encountered difficulties working with European manufacturers. Typical issues include product designs that do not meet UL/CUL standards and North American building codes, poor marketing collateral and product information, incompatible specification data, long lead times to receive product, poor sales support, limited customer service, and high overall cost and complexity due to exchange rates, freight, duties and other factors.

The European manufacturers have long viewed the North American market for architectural, specification-grade lighting as large and attractive. However, apart from a few isolated examples, attempts to penetrate this market by establishing wholly-owned U.S. operations have been costly and unprofitable and, as a result, many have failed. We believe the challenges the European manufacturers encounter include (a) incomplete understanding of the design and product attributes demanded by North American architects and designers; (b) incomplete understanding of UL/CUL and building code requirements; (c) inexperience working with indirect sales channels such as agents and distributors (European sales strategy is based on company employed direct salespeople); and (d) the overall high cost of “green fielding” and supporting U.S. operations.
 
To address these issues, we are seeking external financing and intend to expand our operations through the acquisition of related businesses that will complement our current business, should this financing come through.  There are many synergistic operations which have expressed an interest in being acquired by us due to our status as a publicly traded company.  We believe this makes economic sense, because we can eliminate duplication of general and administrative expense, provide more centralized information marketing and eliminate overlapping of services offered.  We are presently evaluating several such businesses as potential acquisition candidates and have engaged in discussions with other acquisition targets.  However, as of the date of this report there are no definitive agreements in place relating to our acquiring any such business and there can be no assurances that such agreements will be executed on favorable terms or at all in the future. If we are unable to obtain the external financing that we are targeting, we will not be able execute this plan and will not have the financial resources to continue operations.


Up to this point, our financing efforts have been unsuccessful and we can provide no assurances that they will be in the future. If they are unsuccessful, there will be significant challenges to remain in business. If we are successful in securing external financing and then in executing on our growth strategy, the acquisition of related, complimentary businesses is expected to increase revenues and profits by providing a broader range of services in vertical markets which are consolidated under one parent, thus reducing overhead costs by streamlining operations and eliminating duplicitous efforts and costs.  There are no assurances that we will increase profitability if we are successful in acquiring other synergistic companies.
 
Management intends to seek out and evaluate related, complimentary businesses for acquisition.  The integrity and reputation of any potential acquisition candidate will first be thoroughly reviewed to ensure it meets with management’s standards.  Once targeted as a potential acquisition candidate, we will enter into negotiations with the potential candidate and commence due diligence evaluation of each business, including its financial statements, cash flow, debt, location and other material aspects of the candidates’ business.  We expect to utilize the issuance of our securities as part of the consideration that we will pay for these proposed acquisitions.  If we are successful in our attempts to acquire similar companies utilizing our securities as part or all of the consideration to be paid, our current shareholders will incur dilution.   We anticipate that we will need additional capital to make these acquisitions. We have had various discussions with investment banking firms and others potential investors but as of the date of this Report there are no definitive agreements to provide us with this funding and there can be no assurances that we will obtain this funding in the future. Failure to obtain this funding will have a material negative affect on our ability to implement our business plan and our anticipated results of operations. We are continuing to seek out and discuss financing with potential partners and lenders. While no assurances can be provided, we expect that many lighting fixture companies will be interested in consolidating with us to capitalize on the application of the disruptive LED technology.
 
Our objective is to become a leading provider of advanced LED lighting solutions by acquiring and growing complementary LED based lighting fixture companies. We are focused on acquiring specialized lighting companies for the architecture and interior design markets for both commercial and residential applications. Our creative lighting products will include both conventional fixtures and advanced solid-state technology that can integrate with digital controls and day-lighting to create energy efficiencies and a better visual environment. Our intent is to grow, innovate, and fully capture the rapidly growing lighting market opportunities associated with solid state lighting. There are no assurances we will be successful.

Key elements of our business growth strategy include:
 

· | LED Technology Leadership: As LED technology increases in the speed at which it is advancing, lighting fixture designs will have to adapt to that rate of change. Our Advisory Team intends to provide access to the best resources to apply LED technology for our subsidiaries. We also intend to provide buying contracts with LED component manufacturers to control cost while staying at the leading edge of the technology. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Access to Investment Capital: The change from conventional lighting technology to LED technology is expensive. The capital needed to understand and apply LED technology is more than most conventional lighting manufactures have or are willing to risk. We intend to provide the appropriate capital to develop and launch LED lighting fixtures through our subsidiaries. As of the date of this Report we do not have sufficient capital to meet this objective and there are no assurances we will obtain this capital in the future. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Best Practices Management Services: The business processes and staffing required to move to solid state lighting are different than those needed for conventional lighting technology. Our Advisory Team intends to provide assistance to our subsidiary teams to help them capitalize on these changes aggressively and cost effectively. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Market Appropriate Education: We believe that educating architects, designers, specifiers and end-users of the benefits of LED lighting is key to growing our market share by shifting their preference from more traditional lighting to LED lighting. There continue to be unique advances in LED engineering and, while no assurances can be provided, we believe the market is rapidly embracing the technology. We also believe our employees have the knowledge and ability to educate both our customer base and, if successful, the personnel in the companies we acquire. We expect that this will drive sales by driving the commercial market towards LED lighting. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Sales and Distribution Network: We maintain a network of over 60 third-party sales agencies across North America to represent our products. These agreements provide for exclusive rights to sell our lighting fixtures for a commission in specific counties as described in each agreement. If and when we successfully consummate acquisitions, each company that we acquire will have their own third-party sales agencies and distribution network. We are targeting acquisitions that will diversify our product portfolio. By carrying a broader selection of LED lighting products, we anticipate that we will be able to not just expand our existing network of sales agencies, but to also become more of a preferred provider of products to select sales agencies. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Expanding our LED Product Portfolio: As our goal is to serve our customers and create a quality experience in both product and service, we will continue to expand these categories and add necessary fixtures and light sources to increase our offering as an LED solution provider. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Developing and Protecting Our Intellectual Property: Securing and defending intellectual property by using the UL Listing process related to the design, manufacture and application of advanced lighting technology is expected to be a key element of our existing and future business. The strength of our intellectual property portfolio is intended to allow us to compete on the basis of our technology, which we believe will give us an advantage over many of our larger competitors. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Capitalizing on Opportunities in Our Target Markets: We believe there is a growing need for unique, advanced lighting solutions across our target markets. Our acquisition strategy is to expand into new production application market segments by focusing on companies with complementary products. Because we have access to the advanced products from our International partners, we expect to continue to introduce innovative advanced lighting products as we believe there exists significant opportunities to grow market share. By introducing new products and expanding sales of existing products we believe that we can significantly improve operational efficiency by reducing our cost of materials, components and manufacturing. Expanding our products and increasing our sales will also allow us to gain additional leverage from sales representatives within our distribution network.

The LED Lighting Industry
 
The global lighting industry generally is divided between three major market segments: commercial, industrial and residential. Within these three market segments exist two broad product categories: fixtures and light bulbs (referred to as lamps in the lighting industry). The fixtures category includes all apparatuses, luminaires and power/heat-control systems, while lamps consist of the devices that emit light. Conventional lamps typically include incandescent, fluorescent and high-intensity discharge (HID) products. For commercial applications, we believe that the more expensive and long lasting fluorescent and HID lamps and fixtures have had the largest market share. For industrial applications, metal halide and fluorescent have been the primary light source. For residential applications within the general illumination market, inexpensive incandescent bulbs and, to a lesser extent, compact fluorescent (CFL) lamps have been the common choice.
 
With rapid advancements in the performance, efficiency and cost of energy-efficient lighting, including LED-based solutions, conventional light sources, such as incandescent lamps, are beginning to be replaced by advanced technologies with lower operating costs over their useful lives. LED’s are semiconductor-based devices that generate light. The energy-efficient nature of LED technology makes it an environmentally friendly light source, and the compact size of LEDs has created new possibilities in lighting fixture and lamp design. Product selection is influenced by a number of factors, including overall cost, energy efficiency, product life, lumen output and other product features, as well as regulatory and environmental factors. We believe our unique advanced lighting solutions are well positioned to increasingly displace conventional lighting in each of our targeted markets.
 
In North America, lighting manufacturers typically sell products through manufacturer’s representatives, electrical supply representatives, or an internal sales force to electrical wholesale distributors. The distributors then market products to electrical contractors and other end-users. Representatives also have direct contact with lighting designers, electrical engineers, architects and general contractors that influence buying decisions. The manufacturer’s representatives often provide value-added services, such as product promotion or design and implementation assistance. The ability of smaller companies to compete against larger, more-established rivals is heavily rooted in their capacity to leverage their unique product portfolios and customer service to garner maximum productivity from each representative.


Historically, large global competitors focused almost exclusively on the general illumination market, because of their advantage in purchasing power, manufacturing volume and distribution efficiency, while smaller industry participants generally competed in niche markets primarily by offering specialized products and superior customer service to their regions. However, the evolution of advanced lighting solutions has enabled smaller companies to penetrate and compete in the larger general illumination market. One of these notable advanced lighting solutions is LED lighting.
 
Industry Trends
 
As the cost of LED’s decrease and their performance improves we expect that they will continue to compete more effectively in the general illumination market versus traditional lighting. High-brightness LEDs are the core, light-producing components within an LED lighting system. We believe the LED lighting industry is experiencing the following trends: 

· | Technological Innovations Expand LED Functionality: Since the introduction of the first visible LED in the 1960s, the technology has offered an increasingly wide variety of colored lighting, beginning with red and expanding to green, yellow and orange. Initial rudimentary applications included traffic lights, automotive brake lights and indicator lights. In the mid-1990s, LEDs became capable of emitting blue light. With the advent of blue LEDs, combined with phosphor technology, LEDs made another technological leap by emitting white light. This breakthrough enabled LEDs to compete with traditional lighting solutions for applications in commercial, industrial and residential markets. In an effort to lower energy consumption, lighting companies are focusing on increasing “lumens per watt.” Lumens per watt (often referred to as “efficacy”) is an industry standard that measures the amount of light emitted per watt of electrical power used, meaning the more lumens per watt, the more energy-efficient the product. Traditional incandescent lighting sources can produce between 10 and 35 lumens per watt, while fluorescent and HID light sources can produce output exceeding 100 lumens per watt. Today’s LEDs are currently performing well over 100 lumens per watt at the LED level, making them comparable to, and often better than, fluorescent and HID light sources. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

· | High Energy Costs Drive LED Adoption: As a result of high energy prices and the expectation that prices will continue to rise, businesses and consumers are increasingly adopting new technologies to reduce energy consumption. LED lighting technology is inherently more energy efficient and can result in more than 80% power savings over incandescent solutions. According to The Department of Energy, 22% of all energy consumption in the United States is from lighting applications. This combined rate represents approximately 35% of all energy consumption in commercial buildings as compared to approximately 15% for residential users and 5% for industrial companies. Despite safety issues and concerns, compact fluorescent (CFL) lamps are used for lighting energy conservation. However, recent technological advancements to LED lighting have made it more commercially viable in terms of brightness, efficiency, lamp life, safety and color-rendering (CRI). In addition, competitive pressures, declining LED costs and greater manufacturing efficiencies are driving down LED lamp prices. As a result of these gains and, while there can be no assurances, we believe LED adoption should continue to expand. In support of our belief, in the 2014 report issued by Freedonia, LED fixtures are expected to account for over half of all lighting fixture sales in 2018. Higher value fixtures will account for a dramatically greater share of fixture sales as more fixtures designed specifically for LEDs, advanced fluorescent lamps, and other longer lived, highly efficient light sources are introduced. For instance, sales of LED lighting fixtures are expected to nearly triple through 2018 to account for over half of total fixture sales, up from seven percent in 2008. In many cases, LED fixtures will replace existing fixtures designed for use with less efficient light sources as lamp stocks dwindle following phase out programs. Incandescent, halogen, and fluorescent fixtures will all register declining sales going forward. However, high intensity discharge (HID) fixtures, which are based on an older but relatively energy efficient technology, are expected to grow through 2018. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Legislative Influences Spur Market Adoption of Energy Efficient LED Lighting: LED Lighting has encouraged regulatory agencies to increase the demand for more energy efficiency. Federal law, under the Energy Efficiency Improvement Act of 2015, mandates that commercial buildings use less electricity. After HVAC, lighting consumes the second most electricity in buildings, so it provides a great opportunity to decrease electricity usage. Also, lighting can be more easily retrofitted than HVAC so existing buildings are also a major opportunity. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Competition
 
We currently face competition from traditional lighting companies that provide general lighting products, including incandescent, fluorescent, high intensity discharge (HID), metal halide (MH) and other traditional light sources. We also have competitors from specialized lighting companies that are engaged in providing LED lighting fixture products. In general, we intend to compete with both groups on the basis of design, innovation, and quality of light, maintenance costs, safety issues, energy consumption, price, product quality and brightness.
 
In the general illumination market, we compete with traditional lighting companies that include Acuity Brands Lighting, Inc., Eaton’s Cooper Lighting Business (a division of Eaton Corporation), Hubbell Lighting, Inc. (a division of Hubbell Incorporated), Juno Lighting Group (a division of Schneider Electric SA), GE Lighting and Philips Lighting (a division of Koninklijke Philips N.V.). Our LED products should tend to be alternatives to conventional lighting sources for applications within the commercial and residential markets. In these markets, we compete on the basis of unique designs, performance, energy savings, lamp life, and durability.
 
We believe that we will compete favorably in our markets, based on the following factors:
 

· | Breadth and diversity of high-quality LED product offerings; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Our expansive distribution network and developed relationships; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Innovative products at competitive price points; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | UL/CUL, DLC and Energy Star certifications; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Ability to offer multiple levels of products; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Value-engineered products producing a fast ROI; and 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Responsiveness to customers 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------

--

 
We expect our markets to remain competitive and to reflect rapid technological evolution and continuously evolving customer and regulatory requirements. Our ability to remain competitive depends in part upon our success in developing new and advanced LED lighting solutions and introducing these products at competitive prices on a timely basis.
 
Intellectual Property
 UL/CUL Listings
 
We have over 20 UL files, which include UL Listings for over 14,000 products for sale in the United States and Canada. UL is an independent safety testing laboratory. A UL Listing means that UL has tested representative samples of the product and determined that it meets UL’s requirements. These requirements are based primarily on UL’s published and nationally recognized standards for safety in the US and Canada. UL’s testing certifies the design, construction and assembly of the certified products. UL Listings do not expire as long as the product certified is not materially changed. Ownership of a UL Listing may also be transferred between companies. Most commercial customers in the lighting industry will only buy UL listed products.
Trademarks
 
We have one registered trademark, “Energie.”
 Employees
 
As of the date of this report we have five (5) full-time employees including our management, consisting of Harold Hansen, our President and Chief Executive Officer, Justin Kerns, our Chief Operating Officer, as well as one additional employee, a bookkeeper, in our Colorado location and one person in production management and a product/production engineer, who work out of our Michigan location. Richard Cole Dennard, our current Chief Financial Officer, works with us as an independent contractor. We also retain additional part and full time employees on a temporary basis as needed to meet production schedules. Depending upon our backlog, we usually employ between 2 and 14 people on a temporary basis. None of our employees are members of any union. We believe our relationship with our employees is good.


If we are able to obtain the necessary capital to implement our business plan and expand our operations, we expect to add additional employees in the areas of production, engineering, sales and acquisitions.
 
Government Regulation
 
We are not subject to any extraordinary governmental regulations.
