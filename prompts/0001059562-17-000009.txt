ITEM 1. | BUSINESS

General Overview
LMI Aerospace is a leading supplier of structural assemblies, kits and components, and design engineering services to the aerospace and defense markets.  We provide a broad array of manufacturing capabilities, as well as engineering and value-added services to the large commercial, corporate and regional, and military aircraft markets.  We also provide prototyping, testing and design capabilities to customers in support of new product development and in-service aircraft.  LMI Aerospace is a preferred supplier to aircraft original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”) and Tier 1 aerospace suppliers.  In addition to aerospace products, we produce components and assemblies for laser equipment used by semiconductor equipment manufacturers, electronic and electrical wire harnesses, cable assemblies, and mechanical sub-assemblies for the air and rail traffic control, medical equipment, telecommunications, and heavy equipment industries.
Founded in 1948 as a manufacturer of components for the large commercial aircraft market of the aerospace industry, LMI Aerospace became a publicly-held company in 1998.  Historically, our business was primarily dependent on the large commercial aircraft market, specifically with one principal customer.  In order to diversify our product and customer base, we implemented an acquisition and marketing strategy in the late 1990’s that has broadened the number of industries to which we sell our products and services and, within the aerospace industry, diversified our customer base to reduce our dependence on any one principal customer.
In July 2007, we expanded our product offering to include Engineering Services by acquiring San Diego, California-based D3 Technologies, Inc. (“D3”), a premier design and engineering services firm. In August 2012, we enhanced our Engineering Services platform by acquiring Kirkland, Washington-based TASS Inc. (“TASS”), a premier after-market engineering and support services firm.
In December 2012, we acquired Kansas City, Missouri-based Valent Aerostructures, LLC ("Valent"), a provider of complex, structural components, major sub-assemblies and machined parts for OEMs and Tier 1 airframe manufacturers in the aerospace and defense industries.  Valent provides significant content for several major commercial, business jet and military platforms including the Boeing 737, 747-8, 777, 787, V-22, F-15, F-18 and Gulfstream G650.  We believe the acquisition positioned LMI Aerospace as an industry leading aerostructures supplier with significant scale.  The resulting increased scale, complementary product offerings and project management capabilities of Valent have allowed us to offer our customers more diversified product and service offerings, deepen our customer relationships and obtain greater leverage of our manufacturing and supply chain 
5

network.  In addition, we believe Valent’s assembly and complex precision machining capabilities has allowed the Company to compete for larger and more complex assemblies and design-build projects.
Recent Developments
On February 16, 2017, the Company entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”) with Sonaca S.A., a limited liability company validly existing under the laws of Belgium (the “Parent”), Sonaca USA Inc., a Delaware corporation and direct, wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent (“Intermediate Co”), and Luminance Merger Sub, Inc., a Missouri corporation and an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of the Parent (the “Sub,” and collectively with Parent and Intermediate Co, the “Parent Entities”), relating to the proposed acquisition of the Company by Parent.
The Merger Agreement provides that, subject to the terms and conditions thereof, Sub will be merged with and into the Company (the “Transaction”) with the Company continuing as the surviving corporation in the Transaction (the “Surviving Corporation”). At the closing of the Transaction (the “Closing”) each outstanding share of common stock of the Company (other than shares owned by the Company or the Parent Entities, and shares whose holders seek appraisal and comply with all related statutory requirements of the General and Business Corporation Law of Missouri) will cease to be outstanding and will be converted into the right to receive $14.00 in cash per share, without interest and subject to any applicable tax withholding (the “Consideration”).
Shareholders of the Company will be asked to vote on the approval of the Merger Agreement at a special shareholders’ meeting that will be held on a date to be announced. The Closing is subject to the approval of the Merger Agreement by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least two-thirds of the outstanding shares of common stock of the Company (the “Shareholder Approval”).
In addition to the Shareholder Approval condition, consummation of the Transaction is subject to various other customary conditions, including (a) the expiration or termination of the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, (b) clearance by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States and by the Directorate of Defense Trade Controls under the International Traffic in Arms Regulations, (c) the absence of any order, injunction or law preventing or prohibiting the consummation of the Merger, (d) the accuracy of the representations and warranties contained in the Merger Agreement (subject to certain materiality qualifiers), (e) compliance with covenants and agreements in the Merger Agreement in all material respects, and (f) the absence of a material adverse effect on the Company.
The Merger Agreement contains certain termination rights for both the Company and the Parent Entities, and provides that, upon termination of the Merger Agreement by the Company or Parent upon specified conditions, the Company may be required to pay the Parent a termination fee of either $10 million or $15 million, depending upon the reason for and timing of the termination, and any costs of collection. In addition, subject to certain exceptions and limitations, either party may terminate the Merger Agreement if the Transaction is not consummated by August 16, 2017, subject to possible extension until September 29, 2017 to allow for the completion of certain regulatory approvals or if the Shareholder Approval has not yet been obtained.
The Merger Agreement also contains a “go-shop” provision that, in general, allows the Company to initiate, solicit and encourage, and engage in discussions or negotiations with respect to, an acquisition proposal for the 30-day period after execution of the Merger Agreement. The Company may continue discussions after the go-shop period with any party who made an acquisition proposal during the go-shop period that the Company determines in good faith is or could reasonably be expected to result in a superior proposal. Following the expiration of the go-shop period, the Company will be subject to a customary “no-shop” provision.
Our Strategy
The Company’s strategy highlights its vision, mission and goals with a focus on operational excellence.  The key goals of the Company are to substantially grow revenue by winning two significant, strategic work packages per year, drive debt leverage down to enable investment, deliver annual gross margin improvement and integrate our operations into value streams.  
In addition, our current strategy focuses on organic growth of all of our businesses coupled with the development of key strategic alliances to expand our overall market offerings. Our high speed and hard metal machining expertise, deepened program management skills and aftermarket support services have allowed us to pursue additional complex assembly and design-build opportunities to capitalize on our strengths.
We believe that OEMs and Tier 1 aerospace suppliers will continue to outsource the design and manufacturing of components, assemblies and sub-systems to fewer preferred suppliers who are capable of meeting increasing market demands for on-time delivery and quality in a cost effective manner.  Accordingly, we continue to focus on remaining well positioned to benefit from these trends by:

Manufacturing Process
Fabrication

We deliver broad fabrication capabilities ranging from a single-piece component to complex, multiple-quantity orders.  Our abilities include coordinate measuring machine inspection, tooling and engineering.  We can bend, stretch, draw, stamp, punch and cut a myriad of materials, including aluminum alloys, stainless steel, titanium and other metals in addition to non-metallic materials.  We organize our manufacturing facilities by value streams for a particular manufacturing process.  Depending on the component, we utilize either a forming process or a machining process.  Each value stream is staffed by a team of operators who are supported by a supervisor, lead operators and quality inspectors.  Throughout each stage of manufacturing and finishing processes, we collect, maintain and evaluate data, including customer design inputs, process scheduling, material inventory, labor, inspection results and completion and delivery dates.  Our information systems employ this data to provide accurate pricing and scheduling information to our customers as well as to establish production standards used to measure internal performance.

We use several different processes in manufacturing components, including:

• | fluid cell press;


• | sheet metal and extrusion stretch;


• | skin stretch;


• | stretch draw;


• | hot joggle;


• | machining and turning;


• | computer numerical control ("CNC") brake forming and turret punch; and


• | roll forming.

These processes shape or form aluminum, stainless steel or titanium sheet metal or other metals and non-metals and extrusion, known as a work piece, into components by applying pressure through impact, cutting, stretching or pressing, which causes the work piece to conform to a die.  The shapes may be simple with a single angle, bend or curve or may be complex with compound contours having multiple bends and angles.  Some processes incorporate heat to soften the metal prior to or during forming.

Machining
Our machining capabilities include high speed mills, routers, lathes and water jets.  We operate over 100 CNC machines with RPM’s up to 33,000 and component sizes up to 235 inches.  Our machining centers employ over 30 CNC programmers with proficiency in Catia, Unigraphics, Mastercam and Vericut.  We produce components using close-tolerance machining methods.  These methods involve the machining of various metals, such as stainless steel, aluminum, monel, inconnel, Kevlar, titanium and numerous varieties of steel.  We have the capability of machining aluminum and steel in both heat-treated and non-heat-treated conditions.
We machine parts through conventional and CNC machining methods from raw material and forgings.  In addition, complex machining of parts is accomplished through the use of engineered tools or programs to produce intricate and close tolerances with very restrictive finish requirements.  Each machining facility is also set up to complete turnkey research and development projects to better support customers’ engineering changes.
Value-Added Services

In addition to products, we offer various value-added services that are intended to result in both cost and time savings.  These services include:
12


• | finishing;

Newly acquired automation in robotic spray maskant application in chemical milling operations and laser scribe technology are being used to improve operating efficiencies and improve product quality. We deliver finished products that meet or exceed standards of our commercial, corporate and regional, and military aircraft customers.  We have received quality approvals from most major aircraft manufacturers in the United States and Canada. All of our processes are Nadcap accredited and certified to industry aerospace standards.
Assembly

We believe we are an industry leader in the assembly of detail components into large sub-assemblies or finished-assemblies.  We apply this critical manufacturing step to a range of products in the commercial and corporate and regional aircraft markets, as well as military aircraft, for both fixed-wing and rotor craft.  We implement key technologies, such as robotics drilling, auto-riveting and automation to drive competitiveness and enable high-rate production. The parts for assembly come from supply chain and LMI Aerospace’s fabrication and machining facilities.  Assembled products are delivered direct to our customers which include: The Boeing Company, Spirit AeroSystems, Lockheed Martin, Gulfstream Aerospace Corporation, and Triumph Group.
Kitting

In support of our customers’ lean initiatives and best practices, we offer kitting services to help streamline the flow of components to their assembly lines.  Our facility in Savannah, Georgia is designed to kit manufactured components and deliver to customer points of use in a just-in-time manner.  The location also serves as a warehousing and detail storage facility where finished goods may be stored and kitted to customer specifications upon demand. Savannah has FAA approval for Parts Manufacturer Approval on the Aviation Partners Boeing winglet and Go-Go in-flight entertainment systems programs.
Distribution

We deliver value-added services to our customers through our distribution center located in Tulsa, Oklahoma.  This facility is designed with high-density storage systems that support storage and direct shipping of products to our customers’ points of use as well as cut to size programs of raw material for our internal plants.  This warehousing and just-in-time delivery supports and conforms to our customers’ lean manufacturing processes.  Additionally, we own a fleet of paneled trucks that are utilized for transporting product from our machining/fabrication facilities to our processing facilities, to our assembly facilities and then to our customers.

We utilize technical staff, with significant experience, to support customers like The Boeing Company, Northrop Grumman Corporation, Gulfstream Aerospace, Bombardier, Toray Composites America, Inc., Cytec Industries Inc. and others with U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (“FAA”) certification programs, dynamic testing for full-scale wings, development of material allowables, completion of Quality Assurance testing and other testing services utilizing state-of-the-art Nadcap accredited (SAE 7101, ISO 17052, AC7122) facilities. 
13

Composite Manufacturing 
Our Everett, Washington facility is Nadcap accredited for Non-metallic manufacturing (AC7118), and is qualified to Sikorsky, Gulfstream and Boeing composites manufacturing specifications. Recent customer qualifications include Boeing BAC5578, BAC5317 and BDS D210 (Qualification of Sources for Composite Parts) for hardware found typically on Boeing commercial and military platforms. Additionally, we are now pursuing qualification to supply continuous Thermoplastic part manufacture for Boeing per BAC5348 and also for the overall aerospace industry.
 Integrated Testing Services

Our Composites Technical Center of Excellence integrates engineering expertise in composites development, design, and certification with our composites testing organization to provide turn-key solutions for testing requirements.  This coordination allows our customers to define their testing needs and have the engineering and testing of the required components provided as one integrated service.
 Engineering Tool Design, Fabrication and Repair

Our tooling organization provides tooling design, technical supervision of contract fabrication and repair services for a wide range of projects from components, small assembly and drill jigs to determinant assembly tooling and planning.  We maintain an approved supplier list for our tooling projects.  These suppliers have been audited and approved by our quality department and meet quality standards for conformance to customer specifications.
Prototyping and Manufacturing Producibility Design

We provide prototyping and manufacturing producibility services to commercial, corporate and regional and military aircraft customers.  These services include manufacturing and inspection planning as well as producibility assessments and prototype support. In addition, we enable part and tool rapid prototyping through additive manufacturing 3D printing. Tools and part simulations have greatly increased the speed to market on designs and functional solutions for customers.
Backlog

We consider backlog to be firm customer orders for future delivery. As a service provider, our Engineering Services segment does not typically utilize backlog to monitor its operations, other than the fixed price backlog for the MRJ and Embraer design-build projects.  Our Aerostructures segment’s backlog, together with our Engineering Services segment’s fixed price backlog, is displayed in the following table:

 | As of December 31,
 | 2016 | | 2015
 | ($ in millions) 
Aerostructures | $ | 389.2 | | | $ | 395.5
Engineering Services | 1.8 | | | 2.8 | 
Total | $ | 391.0 | | | $ | 398.3
Portion deliverable within 12 months | $ | 329.7 | | | $ | 322.9

Our customers often modify purchase orders to accelerate or delay delivery dates.  The level of unfilled orders at any given time during the year will be materially affected by our customers’ purchasing policies, the timing of our receipt of orders and the speed with which those orders are filled.  Moreover, sales during any period may include sales that are not part of the backlog at the end of the prior period.  See “Item 1A.  Risk Factors – Risks Related to the Company and Industry – We may not realize all of the sales expected from our existing backlog.”

Raw Materials and Procurement Practices

We manufacture the majority of our components from aerospace quality aluminum sheet metal, forgings and extrusion.  We also use steel, titanium, inconel, monel and other metals to support the balance of our components.  We purchase the majority of these materials and hardware through contracts we have negotiated with producers of aluminum products as well as some right to buy contracts with certain customers.  These contracts are designed to provide an adequate supply of material at predictable pricing levels.  If supply is not available through these agreements, we use a variety of mills and distributors to support our needs.  We believe that currently there are adequate alternative sources of supply.  

In line with our customers’ demands for more sophisticated and complex products, we have expanded the amount of assembled products we provide.  As a result, we have experienced a greater need to subcontract with capable third party suppliers for strategic components.  To meet this challenge, we established a procurement management process designed to develop strategic relationships with key suppliers and to manage the supply chain to ensure the timely delivery of quality components.  
For the year ended December 31, 2016, we purchased approximately 45.5% of raw materials and procured parts from six suppliers. 
Quality Assurance and Control

Our Aerospace Quality Systems, which apply to both of our segments, are consistently reviewed and updated to comply with the current requirements of ISO9001, AS9100 and NADCAP special processes quality requirements.  The ongoing review and updating of our processes have allowed our manufacturing facilities with third party ISO9001/AS9100 registrations to maintain those certifications.

Our quality systems include the quality review of work order masters and outside purchase orders to ensure that the flow-down of customer requirements is addressed.  The quality review of the work order master also ensures that the necessary inspection operations are properly located within the work order to verify and control the outcome of the fabrication processes.  We use an ongoing employee training program and lean manufacturing techniques to assist employees in becoming familiar with any changes in our procedures or special customer requirements.  We use an internal auditing program for each of the facilities to ensure that the training is effective and to ensure ongoing compliance with industry and customer- required standards.  The internal auditing is provided by quality engineers/auditors located throughout the organization.  In addition, we utilize a first part buy-off at each operation during the fabrication and machining processes as well as final inspection of parts to verify compliance with customer configuration requirements.

As part of our quality systems, we also use the AS9102 Rev A standard and associated forms to perform First Article Inspections.  Our quality organization maintains our Approved Supplier List (“ASL”) for all facilities.  This process includes reviewing surveys, performing on-site audits and monitoring customer ASLs to verify that suppliers are maintaining their customers’ direct approvals.

The deployment of our quality systems and the sharing of best practices is accomplished through a Quality Council composed of management from across the enterprise.  The process ensures efficient implementation of customer and industry requirements, as well as increased visibility for changes to the quality system.

In addition, our Engineering Services segment conducts quarterly management review meetings with the segment’s executive level team, analyzing internal processes and performance to ensure that we meet customer expectations with positive measurable results.  Suppliers of our Engineering Services segment are approved through our supplier rating system and are maintained in our ASL database.  Fabrication suppliers of our Engineering Services segment are reviewed on a continual basis with documented quality performance reviews and quality deliverable reviews.  Certification documentation is reviewed through preliminary design reviews and critical design reviews by our engineering department and is routed through our internal quality design verification group for verification and validation of data.  Engineering Services sites are required to go through a quality assurance internal audit program every year to ensure the effectiveness of our quality management system structure.  Final audit reports are reviewed by the segment’s executive level team, site director, and internal audit team to assess required process improvements.
This attention to quality systems and business processes, as well as our certifications, have allowed us to remain an approved supplier for many of the leading OEMs and Tier 1 suppliers such as Gulfstream Aerospace Corporation, The Boeing Company, Bombardier, Inc., United Technologies Corporation, Spirit AeroSystems, Lockheed Martin Aeronautics Company, Cessna Aircraft Company, Raytheon Company and others.

Sales and Marketing

Our Marketing and Business Development ("M&BD") team targets three market sectors: corporate and regional aircraft, large commercial aircraft, and military aircraft.  At each of our facilities, customer service representatives establish and maintain a business relationship between customers and our plants with a focus on customer satisfaction.

Awards of new work for the Aerostructures segment are generally processed by a request for quotation (“RFQ”).  Upon receipt, the RFQ is reviewed by a team consisting of M&BD, operations, program management, estimating, supply chain, engineering, facility management and other personnel, as required.  A bid decision is made if the team determines that the project fits our strategic goals and is within our manufacturing and supply chain management capabilities, and a proposal response is developed.  The majority of new programs are awarded on a competitive bid basis.  If the project engineering is evolving and the effort spans multiple facilities, a project manager and a support team are assigned.  The project team will coordinate customer requirements, schedules and manufacturing approach across the organization.  There are multiple levels of communication with our customers that include executive management, program management and operations for clarification of requirements and resolution of issues.
Awards of new work for the Engineering Services segment and for design-build programs generally begin with a customer inquiry in the form of a request for proposal or similar vehicle.  Upon receipt, the opportunity is logged, and a cross-functional bid/no-bid decision is facilitated by the M&BD team to assure alignment with Company strategy, capability and capacity.  In the event of a bid decision, the proposal response is developed and managed within the M&BD team with assistance from a proposal team consisting of representatives from operations, program management, quality engineering, tooling, estimating and other disciplines as required.  The M&BD team also facilitates the cross-functional execution of our business strategy as it pertains to marketing and business development.
The M&BD team also serves as the main focal point for sales and marketing activities relating to the Aerostructures, Engineering Services and design-build programs, working in conjunction with the program management and other Company personnel to ensure seamless customer service and integrated responses to customer inquiries.  This team’s main areas of responsibility include establishing and maintaining ongoing business relationships with our customer base, identifying new customer opportunities and managing responses to all proposal activity.

The Aerostructures operations and program management directly engage with existing customers and programs.  All internal organizations work together to maintain and expand new and existing customer relationships.
Competition

We believe the aerospace industry competes primarily with respect to quality, delivery, price and contractual terms. Our competitors in the aerospace industry consist of a large, fragmented group of companies, including certain business units or affiliates of our customers. We believe competition within the aerospace industry will increase as a result of further industry consolidation and increased opportunities for foreign sources due to their access to low-cost labor and increasing OEM industrial participation commitments.  In all of our market segments, some of our competitors, including business units affiliated with our customers, have financial, production and other resources that are substantially greater than ours. See “Item 1A.  Risk Factors – Risks Related to Our Industry – We may not be able to maintain or improve our competitive position because of the intense competition in the markets we serve.”
Governmental Regulations and Environmental Compliance

Our operations are subject to extensive and frequently changing federal, state and local laws and substantial regulation by government agencies, including the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”), the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (“OSHA”), the Federal Aviation Administration ("FAA") and the U.S. Department of Defense.  Among other matters, these agencies impose requirements that:

• | regulate the handling, transportation and disposal of hazardous materials generated or used by us during the normal course of our operations;

•govern the health and safety of our employees; and
•require that we meet standards and licensing requirements for aerospace components.

In addition, we may become liable for the costs of removal or remediation of hazardous substances released on or in our facilities without regard to whether we knew of, or caused, the release of such substances.  This extensive regulatory framework imposes significant compliance burdens and risks and, as a result, may substantially affect our operational costs.

Furthermore, we are subject to U.S. Export Regulations, including but not limited to the Export Administration Act (“EAR”) and the Arms Export Control Act (“AECA”) and the associated International Traffic in Arms Regulations (“ITAR”), as well as other federal regulations promulgated by various departments within the U.S. government.  See “Item 1A - Risk Factors - Risks Related to Our Industry - Compliance with and changes in environmental, health and safety laws and other laws that regulate the operation of our business and industry standards could increase the cost of production and expose us to regulatory claims.”
In the quarter ended June 30, 2015, Ozark Mountain Technologies, LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company (“OMT”), settled allegations of low pH wastewater releases by its facility between 2009 and 2013.  As part of a plea agreement, OMT pled guilty to one count of negligently violating the Clean Water Act and paid a criminal fine of $0.7 million.  In the quarter ended June 30, 2015, OMT settled allegations made by the Attorney General of the State of Missouri of pollution of state waters, violation of pretreatment regulations and violation of water quality standards claimed to have occurred in 2011 and in July 2015, paid civil penalties of $0.2 million. The fine and civil penalties paid in connection with both settlements were equal to the loss contingencies recorded by the Company at December 31, 2014.
In the third quarter of 2015, the Company resolved a lawsuit (the “Tech Lawsuit”) filed by the former owners of Valent Aerostructures, LLC (“Valent”) and affiliates of such owners (collectively, “Tech Investments”) against the Company for declaratory judgment on various matters resulting from the acquisition of Valent by the Company in December 2012, including the environmental charges against OMT. On November 5, 2015, the parties to the Tech Lawsuit executed the definitive settlement documents.  As a result of the settlement: (a) the Tech Lawsuit was dismissed with prejudice on January 12, 2016, (b) $3.1 million of the funds that remained in escrow from the sale were disbursed to the Company and the remaining amount of escrow funds was retained by Tech Investments, (c) Tech Investments assumed an approximate $1.2 million payment obligation of the Company to a predecessor owner of OMT that remained under a purchase agreement the Company acquired as part of the Company’s acquisition of Valent; (d) the locked-up shares representing partial consideration for the purchase price paid by the Company were released to Tech Investments; and (e) all parties entered into a mutual release of certain claims and disputes. The settlement also resulted in the Company assuming other liabilities of $0.5 million, collecting a previously recorded receivable of $0.4 million and recording other expenses of $0.1 million. The net impact of the settlement resulted in a gain of $3.3 million in the third quarter of 2015, which was recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations.

Foreign Operations

The Company has a manufacturing facility in Mexico and small engineering offices in England and Sri Lanka.  The Company's foreign sales were not greater than 10% of its total sales in 2016, 2015 or 2014.  The amounts of revenue, profitability and identifiable assets attributable to foreign sales activity were not material when compared with revenue, profitability and identifiable assets attributed to United States domestic operations during 2016, 2015 or 2014.  The Company is not subject to any significant foreign currency risks since significantly all sales are made in United States dollars.  See “Item 1A - Risk Factors – Risks Related to Our Company – Risks associated with foreign operations could adversely impact us.”
