Town Square Bank
 
General
 
Town Square Bank (the “Bank” or “Town Square”) is a federal savings association headquartered in Ashland, Kentucky. Town Square was originally chartered in 1889. Town Square’s business consists primarily of accepting savings accounts, checking accounts and certificates of deposits from the general public and investing those deposits, together with funds generated from operations and borrowings, in first lien one- to four-family mortgage loans, commercial and multi-family real estate loans, commercial and industrial loans, consumer loans, consisting primarily of automobile loans and home equity loans and lines of credit, and construction loans. Town Square also purchases investment securities consisting primarily of mortgage-backed securities issued by United States Government agencies and government-sponsored enterprises, and obligations of state and political subdivisions. Town Square offers a variety of deposit accounts, including savings accounts, NOW and demand accounts, certificates of deposits, money market accounts and retirement accounts. Town Square provides financial services to individuals, families and businesses through our banking offices located in and around Ashland, Nicholasville and Mt. Sterling, Kentucky.
 
Town Square’s executive offices are located at 1500 Carter Avenue, Ashland, Kentucky 41101. Its telephone number at this address is (606) 324-7196, and its website address is http://www.townsquarebank.com. Information on this website is not and should not be considered to be part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
 
Market Area
 
Our primary lending markets are in Boyd, Greenup, Lawrence, Jessamine, Montgomery, Fayette and Campbell Counties in Kentucky, and Lawrence, Scioto, Hamilton, Butler, Warren and Clermont Counties in Ohio. Our retail deposit market includes the areas surrounding our nine offices in northeastern Kentucky, including our main office in Ashland and our branch offices in Ashland, Flatwoods, Greenup, Louisa, South Shore, Cannonsburg, Nicholasville and Mt. Sterling. We also operate an automated teller machine at each of our offices and have a loan production office in the Cincinnati, Ohio.
 
Our market area includes both rural and urban communities. The economic base in our lending market was in the past primarily industrial and reliant upon a small number of large employers, particularly in the steel and petroleum industries. A decline in these segments of the local economy has resulted in slow economic growth and population loss over the last several decades. However, during recent years, a diversification of our employment base into services including healthcare has offset to some extent the adverse impact of the decline of our industrial base. We have further diversified our employment base with opening of our Cincinnati, Ohio loan production office.

Competition
 
We compete with national financial institutions, as well as numerous state chartered banking institutions of comparable or larger size and resources, smaller community banking organizations and a variety of nonbank competitors. We compete for deposits with other commercial banks, savings associations and credit unions and with the issuers of commercial paper and other securities, such as shares in money market mutual funds. In making loans, we compete with other banks, savings associations, consumer finance companies, credit unions, leasing companies and other lenders. Many of the institutions against whom we compete are national and regional banks that are significantly larger than us and, therefore, have significantly greater resources and the ability to achieve economies of scale by offering a broader range of products and services at more competitive prices than we can offer. We expect competition to increase in the future as a result of legislative, regulatory and technological changes and the continuing trend of consolidation in the financial services industry. To effectively compete, we seek to emphasize community orientation, local and timely decision making and superior customer service.
Lending Activities
 
Our principal lending activity has been the origination of first lien one- to four-family residential mortgage loans and, to a lesser extent, commercial and multi-family real estate loans, consumer loans, consisting primarily of automobile loans, home equity loans and lines of credit, and construction loans. In order to diversify our loan portfolio, we recently increased our emphasis on commercial business loans, commercial real estate loans and consumer loans.
 
We sell substantially all of our fixed-rate residential mortgages to the Federal Home Loan Bank of Cincinnati (“FHLB–Cincinnati”) with servicing retained. Total proceeds from mortgages sold under this program was approximately $6.5 million and $8.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. In 2014 we began a secondary market referral program to additional secondary market outlets with no servicing retained. The sale of our fixed-rate residential mortgage originations to the FHLB–Cincinnati along with referrals to other secondary market outlets and our increased originations of nonresidential loans, which generally have shorter terms than one- to four-family residential loans, assist in managing the interest rate risk associated with our portfolio of long-term fixed-rate one- to four-family residential loans.

One- to Four-Family Residential Real Estate Lending. A significant portion of our loan portfolio includes the origination of one- to four-family residential mortgage loans. At December 31, 2017, $170.8 million, or 51.2% of our total loan portfolio, consisted of loans secured by one- to four-family residences compared to $177.8 million, or 51.3% of our total loan portfolio at December 31, 2016.
 
Historically, we have originated both fixed-rate and adjustable-rate one- to four-family mortgage loans. At December 31, 2017, 22.8% of our total one- to four-family mortgage loans were fixed-rate loans and 77.2% were adjustable-rate loans.
 
Our fixed-rate one- to four-family residential mortgage loans are generally underwritten according to secondary market standards (e.g., Freddie Mac guidelines), and we refer to loans that conform to such guidelines as “conforming loans.” We generally originate both fixed- and adjustable-rate mortgage loans in amounts up to the maximum conforming loan limits as established by the Federal Housing Finance Agency, which as of December 31, 2017 was generally $424,100 for single-family homes in our market area. We also originate adjustable rate loans above the lending limit for conforming loans, which are referred to as “jumbo loans.” The majority of our residential loans are secured by properties located in our market area.
 
We generally limit the loan-to-value ratios of our mortgage loans to 80% of the sales price or appraised value, whichever is lower. Loans with certain credit enhancements, such as private mortgage insurance, may be made with loan-to-value ratios up to 95%. Our fixed-rate one- to four-family mortgage loans typically have terms of 15 or 30 years.

Although we have offered adjustable-rate loans for many years, beginning in fiscal 2010 we began to increase our emphasis on such loans, subject to demand for such loans in a lower interest rate environment, and to increase the sale of fixed-rate mortgage loans that we originate, in order to enhance the interest rate sensitivity of our loan portfolio. Our owner-occupied adjustable-rate one- to four-family residential mortgage loans generally have fixed rates for initial terms of five years, and adjust annually thereafter at a margin (generally of 3.5% for owner-occupied properties) over the weekly average yield on U.S. Treasury securities adjusted to a constant maturity of one year. The maximum amount by which the interest rate may be increased or decreased is generally 2% per adjustment period and the lifetime interest rate cap is generally 6% over the initial interest rate of the loan. Our adjustable-rate loans carry terms to maturity of up to 30 years.
 
Although adjustable-rate mortgage loans may reduce to an extent our vulnerability to changes in market interest rates because, as interest rates increase, they periodically reprice and the required payments due from the borrower also increase (subject to rate caps), and the ability of the borrower to repay the loan and the marketability of the underlying collateral may be adversely affected. Upward adjustments of the contractual interest rate are also limited by the maximum periodic and lifetime rate adjustments permitted by our loan documents. Moreover, the interest rates on most of our adjustable-rate loans generally do not adjust for five years after origination. As a result, the effectiveness of adjustable-rate mortgage loans in compensating for changes in general interest rates may be limited during periods of rapidly rising interest rates.
 
We do not offer “interest only” mortgage loans on one- to four-family residential properties (where the borrower pays interest for an initial period, after which the loan converts to a fully amortizing loan). We also do not offer loans that provide for negative amortization of principal, such as “Option ARM” loans, where the borrower can pay less than the interest owed on the loan, resulting in an increased principal balance during the life of the loan. We do not offer “subprime loans” (i.e., loans that generally target borrowers with weakened credit histories typically characterized by payment delinquencies, previous charge-offs, judgments, bankruptcies, or borrowers with questionable repayment capacity as evidenced by low credit scores or high debt-burden ratios), or “Alt-A” loans (i.e., loans that generally target borrowers with better credit scores who borrow with alternative documentation such as little or no verification of income).
 
Until fiscal 2010, we generally retained in our portfolio all of the loans that we originated. In July 2010, as part of our interest rate risk management strategy, we initiated a secondary market program focused on reducing the origination of fixed-rate residential mortgage loans for our portfolio and selling some or all of our fixed rate mortgage originations in the FHLB–Cincinnati Mortgage Purchase Program, with servicing retained. For the year ended December 31, 2017, we sold approximately $6.5 million in fixed-rate mortgage loans to the FHLB–Cincinnati. We expect that loans sold under this program will continue to increase.
 
Based on our continued implementation of a secondary market program for new fixed rate loan originations, we expect that adjustable-rate one- to four-family residential mortgage loans will decrease in our loan portfolio over the next three years. Anticipated increases to interest rates may have a negative impact to new loan originations. Additionally, the Bank has placed increased emphasis on fixed rate loans originated and sold in the secondary market. Currently, substantially all fixed rate one- to four- family residential mortgage loans we originate are sold in the secondary market, and we retain substantially all adjustable-rate one- to four-family residential mortgage loans we originate.
 
Consumer Lending and Home Equity Loans and Lines of Credit. At December 31, 2017, $10.7 million, or 3.2% of our total loan portfolio, consisted of home equity loans and lines of credit, and $17.8 million, or 5.3% of our total loan portfolio consisted of motor vehicles and other consumer loans, compared to $10.7 million, or 3.1% of our total loan portfolio, and $18.5 million, or 5.3% of our total loan portfolio, respectively, at December 31, 2016. In order to reduce the term of our loans and enhance the yields thereof, we intend to increase our consumer loans and home equity loans and lines of credit over the next three years.
 
Currently, our consumer loans include, among other loans, new and used automobile and truck loans, recreational vehicle loans and personal loans.

Consumer loans may entail greater credit risk than residential mortgage loans, particularly in the case of consumer loans that are unsecured or that are secured by rapidly depreciable assets, such as automobiles. In addition, consumer loan collections are dependent on the borrower’s continuing financial stability, and thus are more likely to be affected by adverse personal circumstances. Furthermore, the application of various federal and state laws, including bankruptcy and insolvency laws, may limit the amount that can be recovered on such loans. In determining whether to make a consumer loan, we consider the value of collateral, and the borrower’s residence, employment history, annual income and debt service ratio which, including all mortgage payments and the credit line payment, generally may not exceed 40% of gross monthly income without prior approval of Town Square’s credit committee or senior officer with appropriate lending authority.
 
We offer home equity loans and lines of credit secured by a first or second mortgage on residential property (principal dwelling, condominium, etc.). Home equity loans and lines of credit are made with fixed or adjustable rates, and with combined loan-to-value ratios up to 85% on an owner-occupied principal residence and up to 80% on a second home, condominium or vacation home. On a limited basis, loan-to-value ratios may exceed 90% of appraised value if approved by Town Square’s credit committee or senior officer with appropriate lending authority.
 
Home equity loans and lines of credit may entail greater credit risk than one- to four-family residential mortgage loans, as they typically involve higher loan-to-value ratios and are typically second in priority behind first mortgages on the property. Therefore, any decline in real estate values may have a more detrimental effect on our home equity loans and lines of credit than on our one- to four-family residential mortgage loans.
 
Commercial Real Estate and Multi-Family Loans. At December 31, 2017, our commercial real estate loans totaled $84.3 million and our multi-family loans totaled $6.5 million compared to $83.2 million and $6.8 million, respectively, at December 31, 2016. Subject to market conditions, we intend to continue to increase the proportion of these nonresidential real estate loans in our portfolio over the next three years.
 
Maturities for our commercial real estate and multi-family loans generally do not exceed 15 years, although exceptions may be made for terms of up to 20 years. Rates are generally adjustable based upon the weekly average yield on U.S. treasury securities adjusted to a constant maturity of five year or another floating index. The maximum loan-to-value ratio is 80% on our owner-occupied commercial real estate loans. The maximum loan-to-value ratio on one- to four-family residential rental properties, and office or retail non-owner-occupied commercial real estate or rental properties with greater than five units is 75%. We generally require a first mortgage on all commercial real estate loans, as well as a debt service coverage ratio of 1.25:1.
 
Set forth below is information regarding our commercial real estate loans at December 31, 2017.

Commercial and multi-family real estate loans generally carry higher interest rates and have shorter terms than one- to four-family residential mortgage loans. Multi-family and commercial real estate loans, however, entail greater credit risks compared to one- to four-family residential mortgage loans because they typically involve larger loan balances concentrated with single borrowers or groups of related borrowers. In addition, the payment of loans secured by income-producing properties typically depends on the successful operation of the property, as repayment of the loan generally is dependent, in large part, on sufficient income from the property to cover operating expenses and debt service. Changes in economic conditions that are not in the control of the borrower or lender could affect the value of the collateral for the loan or the future cash flow of the property. Additionally, any decline in real estate values may be more pronounced for commercial and multi-family real estate than residential properties.
 
Commercial Business Loans. Our portfolio of commercial business loans decreased to $33.7 million, or 10.1% of our total loan portfolio at December 31, 2017 from $38.7 million, or 11.2% of our total loan portfolio at December 31, 2016. Our commercial business loans generally consist of regular lines of credit and revolving lines of credit to businesses to finance short-term working capital needs like accounts receivable and inventory. These loans are generally priced on an adjustable-rate basis and may be secured or unsecured. We generally obtain personal guarantees with all commercial business loans. Business assets such as accounts receivable, inventory and equipment, or real estate may be used to secure lines of credit. Our revolving lines of credit typically have a maximum term of 12 months.
 
We also originate commercial term loans to fund long-term borrowing needs such as purchasing equipment, property improvements or other fixed asset needs. We fix the maturity of a term loan to correspond to the useful life of any equipment purchased up to seven years. Term loans can be secured with a variety of collateral, including business assets such as accounts receivable and inventory or intermediate and long-term assets such as equipment, commercial vehicles or real estate.
 
Unlike one- to four-family residential real estate loans, which we generally originate on the basis of the borrower’s ability to make repayment from his or her employment and other income, and which are secured by real property whose value tends to be more easily ascertainable, we typically originate commercial loans (including real estate as well as non-real estate loans) on the basis of the borrower’s ability to make repayment from the cash flow of the borrower’s business or rental income produced by the property. As a result, the availability of funds for the repayment of commercial loans may be substantially dependent on the success of the business or rental property itself and the general economic environment. Therefore, commercial loans that we originate have greater credit risk than one- to four-family residential real estate loans or consumer loans. In addition, commercial loans generally result in larger outstanding balances to single borrowers, or related groups of borrowers, and also generally require substantially greater evaluation and oversight efforts.
 
Construction and Land Loans. At December 31, 2017, $10 million, or 3.0% of our total loan portfolio consisted of construction and land loans, compared to $11 million, or 3.2% of our total loan portfolio at December 31, 2016. We make construction loans to individuals for the construction of their primary residences. These loans generally have maximum terms of 12 months, and upon completion of construction convert to conventional amortizing mortgage loans. These construction loans have higher risk based interest rates and terms. During the construction phase, the borrower generally pays interest only. The maximum loan-to-value ratio of our owner-occupied construction loans is generally 100% of construction costs or 80% of the completed-appraised-value, whichever is less.
 
Residential construction loans are generally underwritten pursuant to the same guidelines used for originating permanent residential mortgage loans. These loans generally have initial maximum terms of nine months, although the term may be extended to up to 21 months. The loans generally carry variable rates of interest. The maximum loan-to-value ratio of these construction loans is generally 90% of construction costs or 80% of the completed-appraised-value, whichever is less. We also make loans for the construction of commercial and multi-family buildings.
 
In addition, we make loans secured by unimproved land to complement our construction and non-residential lending activities. These loans have terms of up to 15 years, and maximum loan-to-value ratios of 65%.

To the extent our construction loans are not made to owner-occupants of single-family homes, they are more vulnerable to changes in economic conditions and the concentration of credit with a limited number of borrowers. Further, the nature of these loans is such that they are more difficult to evaluate and monitor. Our risk of loss on a construction or land loan is dependent largely upon the accuracy of the initial estimate of the property’s value upon completion of the project and the estimated cost (including interest) of the project. If the estimate of value proves to be inaccurate, we may be confronted, at or prior to the maturity of the loan, with a project with a value which is insufficient to assure full repayment and/or the possibility of having to make substantial investments to complete and sell the project. Because defaults in repayment may not occur during the construction period, it may be difficult to identify problem loans at an early stage.

Originations, Sales and Servicing. Lending activities are conducted solely by our salaried loan personnel. All loans originated by us are underwritten pursuant to our policies and procedures. We originate both fixed-rate and adjustable-rate loans. Our ability to originate fixed or adjustable-rate loans is dependent upon relative customer demand for such loans, which is affected by current and expected future levels of market interest rates. We originate real estate and other loans through our loan officers, marketing efforts, our customer base, walk-in customers and referrals from real estate brokers, builders and attorneys.
 
We sell certain of our fixed rate one- to four-family mortgage loan originations in the FHLB-Cincinnati Mortgage Purchase Program. We have also undertaken a review of our existing loan portfolio to identify customers who may qualify and benefit from this product. Loans are sold to the FHLB-Cincinnati without recourse, except for limited circumstances including failure of the mortgage to meet FHLB–Cincinnati guidelines or our breach of any representation and warranty in the sales transaction.
 
In addition to the representations and warranties described above, Town Square provides credit enhancements to the FHLB-Cincinnati by sharing losses with other members of the program in an aggregated pool.  A Fixed Lender Risk Account (“LRA”) has been established and is maintained by the FHLB-Cincinnati on behalf of Town Square and other members selling mortgages to the FHLB-Cincinnati.  The LRA amount is established as a percentage applied to the sum of the initial unpaid principal balance of each mortgage in the Aggregated Pool at the time of the purchase of the mortgage as determined by the FHLB-Cincinnati and is funded by the deduction from the proceeds of sale of each mortgage in the Aggregated Pool to the FHLB-Cincinnati. Town Square had on deposit with the FHLB-Cincinnati $976,000 at December 31, 2017 and $923,000 at December 31, 2016 in these LRA’s.  These accounts are held by the FHLB-Cincinnati and Town Square bears the risk of receiving less than 100% of its LRA contribution in the event of losses, either by Town Square or other members selling mortgages in the aggregated pool.  Any losses will be deducted first from the individual LRA contribution of the institution that sold the mortgage of which the loss was incurred. If losses incurred in the aggregated pool are greater than the member’s LRA contribution, such losses will be deducted from the LRA contribution of other members selling mortgages in that aggregated pool.  Any portion of the LRA not used to pay losses will be released over a thirty year period and will not start until the end of five years after the initial fill-up period.  Town Square had approximately $7,000 of the LRA amounts released during the year ended December 31, 2017.  Unless Town Square is required to buy back a loan because it did not meet the criteria under the representations and warranties to be covered as part of the aggregated pool, the credit risk is limited to the amount provided in the LRA.
 
All of the loans sold during the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 were subject to these representations and warranties. As of December 31, 2017, there have been no required repurchases of loans sold, there have been no recourse claims, nor does Town Square believe it has incurred any such losses. Therefore, no liabilities have been accrued for loans sold at December 31, 2017 or 2016.
 
Loan servicing includes collecting and remitting loan payments, accounting for principal and interest, contacting delinquent borrowers, supervising foreclosures and property dispositions in the event of un-remedied defaults, making certain insurance and tax payments on behalf of the borrowers and generally administering the loans. We retain a portion of the interest paid by the borrower on the loans we service as consideration for our servicing activities. For the years ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, we received loan servicing fees of $111,000 and $102,000, respectively. As of December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, the principal balance of loans serviced for the FHLB-Cincinnati totaled $44.8 million and $42.6 million, respectively.
 
We currently purchase whole loans or interests in loans from third parties, which includes loans to health care professionals and motor vehicle loans.

Delinquencies and Non-Performing Assets
 
Delinquency Procedures. When a borrower fails to make their required monthly payment on or before the late payment date, a notice is generated stating the amount of the payment and applicable late charge(s) that are due. An attempt is also made at this time to contact the borrower by telephone regarding their late payment. Collection procedures provide that if no response or payment is received from the borrower, additional collections efforts will be taken through the generation of a 30-day right to cure or demand letter. Contact with the borrower regarding establishment of payment arrangements to satisfy their delinquency will be coordinated through the lending officer and collections department. If, at this point, no response is received from the borrower, further accelerated collection efforts such as the pursuit of legal action, repossession or foreclosure may be initiated. If any of these actions are pursued, all further communication with the borrower will be directed to the collections area.
 
When we acquire real estate as a result of foreclosure or by deed in lieu of foreclosure, the real estate is classified as foreclosed real estate and held in the other real estate owned (OREO) asset account until it is sold. The real estate is appraised and recorded at estimated fair value after acquisition, less estimated costs to sell, and any write-down resulting from the acquisition, is charged to the allowance for loan losses. Subsequent decreases in the value of the property are charged to expense. After acquisition, all costs in maintaining the property are expensed as incurred. Costs relating to the development and improvement of the property, however, are capitalized to the extent of estimated fair value, less estimated costs to sell.

Classified Assets. Federal regulations provide for the classification of loans and other assets, such as debt and equity securities considered by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (“OCC”) to be of lesser quality, as “substandard,” “doubtful” or “loss.” An asset is considered “substandard” if it is inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged, if any. “Substandard” assets include those characterized by the “distinct possibility” that the insured institution will sustain “some loss” if the deficiencies are not corrected. Assets classified as “doubtful” have all of the weaknesses inherent in those classified “substandard,” with the added characteristic that the weaknesses present make “collection or liquidation in full,” on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions, and values, “highly questionable and improbable.” Assets classified as “loss” are those considered “uncollectible” and of such little value that their continuance as assets without the establishment of a specific loss reserve is not warranted. Assets that do not currently expose the insured institution to sufficient risk to warrant classification in one of the aforementioned categories but possess weaknesses are designated as “special mention” by our management.

--

 

When an insured institution classifies problem assets as either substandard or doubtful, it may establish general allowances in an amount deemed prudent by management to cover probable incurred losses. General allowances represent loss allowances which have been established to cover probable incurred losses associated with lending activities, but which, unlike specific allowances, have not been allocated to particular problem assets. When an insured institution classifies a problem asset as “loss,” it is required either to establish a specific allowance for losses equal to 100% of that portion of the asset so classified or to charge-off such amount. An institution’s determination as to the classification of its assets and the amount of its valuation allowances is subject to review by the regulatory authorities, which may require the establishment of additional general or specific loss allowances.
 
In connection with the filing of our periodic reports with the OCC and in accordance with our classification of assets policy, we regularly review the problem loans in our portfolio to determine whether any loans require classification in accordance with applicable regulations.
 
On the basis of this review of our assets, our classified and special mention assets at the dates indicated were as set forth below. Nonaccrual loans and loans past due 90 days still on accrual include both smaller balance homogeneous loans that are collectively evaluated for impairment and individually classified impaired loans. Thus, the homogenous pools are not considered for classification or special mention status. At December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, all loans classified as substandard were comprised of loans that were individually evaluated for impairment and loans that were deemed to be impaired were subsequently adjusted and are carried at fair value.

Doubtful assets | | - | | | - 
Loss assets | | - | | | - 
Total classified assets | $ | 23,325 | | $ | 18,574

 
Non-Performing Assets. We generally cease accruing interest on our loans when contractual payments of principal or interest have become 90 days past due or management has serious doubts about further collectability of principal or interest, even though the loan is currently performing. A loan may remain on accrual status if it is in the process of collection and is either guaranteed or well secured. When a loan is placed on nonaccrual status, unpaid interest credited to income is reversed. Funds received on nonaccrual loans generally are applied against principal. Generally, loans are restored to accrual status when the obligation is brought current, has performed in accordance with the contractual terms for a reasonable period of time and the ultimate collectability of the total contractual principal and interest is no longer in doubt.

There were no loans that are not disclosed above under “-Classified Assets” and “-Non Performing Assets” where there is information about possible credit problems of borrowers that caused us serious doubts about the ability of the borrowers to comply with present loan repayment terms and that may result in disclosure of such loans in the future.
 
Allowance for Loan Losses
 
Analysis and Determination of the Allowance for Loan Losses. Our allowance for loan losses is the amount considered necessary to reflect probable incurred losses in our loan portfolio. We evaluate the need to establish allowances against losses on loans on a quarterly basis. When additional allowances are necessary, a provision for loan losses is charged to earnings.
 
Our methodology for assessing the appropriateness of the allowance for loan losses consists of two key elements: (i) specific allowances for identified problem loans; and (ii) a general valuation allowance on the remainder of the loan portfolio. Although we determine the amount of each element of the allowance separately, the entire allowance for loan losses is available for the entire portfolio.
 
Specific Allowances for Identified Problem Loans. We establish a specific allowance when loans are determined to be impaired. Loss is measured by determining the present value of expected future cash flows or, for collateral-dependent loans, the fair value of the collateral adjusted for market conditions and selling expenses. Factors in identifying a specific problem loan include: (i) the strength of the customer’s personal or business cash flows; (ii) the availability of other sources of repayment; (iii) the amount due or past due; (iv) the type and value of collateral; (v) the strength of our collateral position; (vi) the estimated cost to sell the collateral; and (vii) the borrower’s effort to cure the delinquency. In addition, for loans secured by real estate, we consider the extent of any past due and unpaid property taxes applicable to the property serving as collateral on the mortgage.
 
General Valuation Allowance on the Remainder of the Loan Portfolio. We establish a general allowance for loans that are not classified as impaired to recognize the inherent losses associated with lending activities, but which, unlike specific allowances, has not been allocated to particular problem assets. This general valuation allowance is determined by segregating the loans by loan category and assigning allowance percentages based on our historical loss experience, delinquency trends and management’s evaluation of the collectability of the loan portfolio. The allowance may be adjusted for significant factors that, in management’s judgment, affect the collectability of the portfolio as of the evaluation date. These significant factors may include changes in lending policies and procedures, changes in existing general economic and business conditions affecting our primary market area, credit quality trends, collateral value, loan volumes and concentrations, seasoning of the loan portfolio, recent loss experience in particular segments of the portfolio, duration of the current business cycle and bank regulatory examination results. The applied loss factors are re-evaluated on a quarterly basis.
 
In addition, as an integral part of their examination process, the OCC will periodically review our allowance for loan losses, and they may require that we recognize additions to the allowance based on their judgments of information available to them at the time of their examination.

The allowance for loan losses was $4.7 million, or 1.40% of total loans at December 31, 2017 compared to $2.3 million, or 0.68% of total loans, at December 31, 2016. Provision of $3.5 million was recorded for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $1.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. We had net charge-offs of $1.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $758,000 for the year ended December 31, 2016. Total non-performing loans were $6.4 million at December 31, 2017 compared to $4.7 million at December 31, 2016. At December 31, 2017 we had specific allocations of the allowance related to impaired loans of $1.9 million. In comparison, we had specific allocation of $30,000 for the year ended December 31, 2016. As a percentage of non-performing loans, the allowance for loan losses was 73.62% at December 31, 2017 compared to 50.10% at December 31, 2016. The increase in the provision and resulting allowance for loan losses for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016 is attributable to an increase in substandard loans combined with an increase in charge-offs for the year ended December 31, 2017.
 
Although we believe that we use the best information available to establish the allowance for loan losses, future adjustments to the allowance for loan losses may be necessary and results of operations could be adversely affected if circumstances differ substantially from the assumptions used in making the determinations. Furthermore, while we believe we have established our allowance for loan losses in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, regulators, in reviewing our loan portfolio, may require us to increase our allowance for loan losses. In addition, because future events affecting borrowers and collateral cannot be predicted with certainty, the existing allowance for loan losses may not be adequate and increases may be necessary if the quality of our loans deteriorates as a result of the factors discussed above. Any material increase in the allowance for loan losses may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.
 
Investment Activities
 
General. The goals of our investment policy are to provide and maintain liquidity to meet deposit withdrawal and loan funding needs, to help manage our interest rate risk, and to generate a favorable return on idle funds within the context of our interest rate and credit risk objectives.
 
Our Board of Directors is responsible for monitoring compliance with our investment policy. The investment policy is reviewed annually by management and any changes to the policy are recommended to and subject to the approval of the Board of Directors. A minimum of two members of the Asset/Liability committee may purchase investments based on the investment policy guidelines and submit the purchase to the full Board of Directors at the next scheduled meeting.
 
Our current investment policy permits investments in securities issued by the United States Government and its agencies or government sponsored enterprises, including residential mortgage-backed securities, collateralized mortgage obligations, municipalities, school boards and fully insured certificates of deposit. We maintain investment securities concentration limits as a percentage of the investment portfolio that we periodically amend based on market conditions and changes in our assets. Current concentration percentage restrictions limit U.S. Government sponsored enterprises to 75%, U.S. Government agency structured notes to 30%, mortgage-backed securities to 75%, collateralized mortgage obligations to 40%, certificates of deposit to 10% and municipal bonds to 40% or 80% of bank capital. Our investment policy also permits investment in corporate securities limited to 10% of the investment portfolio or 20% of capital and investment in FHLB-Cincinnati stock.
 
At December 31, 2017, we did not have an investment in the securities of any single non-government issuer that exceeded 10% of shareholders’ equity.
 
Our current investment policy does not permit investment in complex securities and derivatives as defined in federal banking regulations and other high-risk securities. Our current policy does not permit hedging activities, such as engaging in futures, options or swap transactions, or investing in high-risk mortgage derivatives, such as collateralized mortgage obligation residual interests, real estate mortgage investment conduit residual interests or stripped mortgage-backed securities.
 
At December 31, 2017, none of the collateral underlying our securities portfolio was considered subprime or Alt-A and we did not hold any common or preferred stock issued by Freddie Mac or Fannie Mae as of that date.
 
State and Political Subdivision Debt Securities. We have purchased primarily bank-qualified and rated general obligation and revenue bonds of certain state and political subdivisions, which provide interest income that is mostly exempt from federal income taxation. All purchases are approved by Town Square’s Board of Directors and are reviewed each quarter. At December 31, 2017, the majority of our state and political subdivision portfolio consisted of revenue bonds issued by the Commonwealth of Kentucky, although we have diversified by investing in securities issued by other states.
U.S. Government and Federal Agency Obligations. We may invest in U.S. Government and federal agency securities. While these securities generally provide lower yields than other investments in our securities investment portfolio, we maintain these investments, to the extent appropriate, for liquidity purposes, as collateral for borrowings and for prepayment protection.
Residential Mortgage-Backed Securities. Residential mortgage-backed securities are securities issued in the secondary market that are collateralized by pools of mortgages. We also invest in mortgage-backed securities commonly referred to as “pass-through” certificates. The principal and interest of the loans underlying these certificates “pass through” to investors, net of certain costs, including servicing and guarantee fees. We invest primarily in residential mortgage-backed securities backed by one- to four-family mortgages. The issuers of such securities pool and resell the participation interests in the form of securities to investors such as Town Square. The interest rate of the security is lower than the interest rates of the underlying loans to allow for payment of servicing and guaranty fees. Most of our mortgage-backed securities are either backed by Ginnie Mae, a United States Government agency, or government-sponsored enterprises, such as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.

Residential mortgage-backed securities issued by United States Government agencies and government-sponsored enterprises are more liquid than individual mortgage loans because there is an active trading market for such securities. In addition, residential mortgage-backed securities may be used to collateralize our borrowings. Investments in residential mortgage-backed securities involve a risk that actual payments will be greater or less than the prepayment rate estimated at the time of purchase, which may require adjustments to the amortization of any premium or accretion of any discount relating to such interests, thereby affecting the net yield on our securities. Current prepayment speeds determine whether prepayment estimates require modification that could cause amortization or accretion adjustments.
 
Federal Home Loan Bank Stock. We held common stock of the FHLB-Cincinnati in connection with our borrowing activities totaling $3.0 million at December 31, 2017 and 2016. The common stock of the FHLB-Cincinnati is carried at cost and classified as restricted equity securities.
Company-Owned Life Insurance. We invest in company-owned life insurance to provide us with a funding source for our benefit plan obligations. Company-owned life insurance also generally provides us non-interest income that is non-taxable. Federal regulations generally limit our investment in bank-owned life insurance to 25% of our Tier 1 capital plus our allowance for loan losses. At December 31, 2017 and 2016, we had invested $7.3 million and $7.1 million, respectively, in company-owned life insurance.
Securities Portfolio Composition. The following table sets forth the composition of our securities portfolio at the dates indicated.

Sources of Funds
 
General. Deposits have traditionally been our primary source of funds for use in lending and investment activities. We also use borrowings, primarily FHLB-Cincinnati advances, to supplement cash flow needs, to lengthen the maturities of liabilities for interest rate risk purposes and to manage the cost of funds. In addition, we receive funds from scheduled loan payments, investment maturities, loan prepayments, retained earnings, income on earning assets and the sale of assets from time to time. While scheduled loan payments and income on earning assets are relatively stable sources of funds, deposit inflows and outflows can vary widely and are influenced by prevailing interest rates, market conditions and levels of competition.
Deposits. Our deposits are generated primarily from within our primary market area although we have utilized national market deposit programs from time to time. We offer a selection of deposit accounts, including statement savings accounts, NOW accounts, business checking, certificates of deposit, money market accounts and retirement accounts. Deposit account terms vary, with the principal differences being the minimum balance required, the amount of time the funds must remain on deposit and the interest rate. We have not accepted brokered deposits in the past, although we have the authority to do so.
 
Interest rates, maturity terms, service fees and withdrawal penalties are established on a periodic basis. Deposit rates and terms are based primarily on current operating strategies and market rates, liquidity requirements, rates paid by competitors and growth goals. We rely upon personalized customer service, long-standing relationships with customers, convenient offices and ATM locations and the favorable image of Town Square in the community to attract and retain deposits. We have also expanded our products to include debit cards, on-line banking services and mobile banking services for the convenience of our customers.
 
The flow of deposits is influenced significantly by general economic conditions, changes in interest rates and competition. Our ability to gather deposits is impacted by the competitive market in which we operate, which includes numerous financial institutions of varying sizes offering a wide range of products. We may use promotional rates to meet asset/liability and market segment goals.
 
The variety of rates and terms on the deposit accounts we offer allows us to be competitive in obtaining funds and responding to changes in consumer demand. Based on our experience, we believe that NOW and demand deposits may be somewhat more stable sources of funding than certificates of deposits.
 
The following table sets forth the distribution of total deposits by account type, at the dates indicated.

Borrowings. Our borrowings currently consist primarily of advances from the FHLB-Cincinnati. We obtain advances from the FHLB-Cincinnati upon the security of our capital stock in the FHLB-Cincinnati and certain of our mortgage loans. Such advances may be made pursuant to several different credit programs, each of which has its own interest rate and range of maturities. To the extent such borrowings have different terms to repricing than our deposits, they can change our interest rate risk profile.
 
From time to time during recent years, we have utilized short-term borrowings to fund loan demand. To a limited extent, we have also used borrowings where market conditions permit us to purchase securities and make loans of a similar duration in order to increase our net interest income by the amount of the spread between the asset yield and the borrowing cost. Finally, from time to time, we have obtained advances with longer terms for asset liability management.

SUPERVISION AND REGULATION
 
General. The federal system of regulation and supervision establishes a comprehensive framework of activities in which Town Square may engage and is intended primarily for the protection of depositors and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation’s deposit insurance fund. Town Square is periodically examined by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, or OCC, to ensure that it satisfies applicable standards with respect to its capital adequacy, assets, management, earnings, liquidity and sensitivity to market interest rates. Town Square also is regulated to a lesser extent by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, or Federal Reserve Board, which governs the reserves to be maintained against deposits and other matters. In addition, Town Square is a member of and owns stock in the FHLB-Cincinnati, which is one of the eleven regional banks in the Federal Home Loan Bank System. Town Square’s relationship with its depositors and borrowers also is regulated to a great extent by federal law and, to a much lesser extent, state law, including in matters concerning the ownership of deposit accounts and the form and content of Town Square’s loan documents.
 
As a savings and loan holding company, Poage Bankshares is subject to examination and supervision by, and is required to file certain reports with, the Federal Reserve Board. Poage Bankshares is also subject to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission under the federal securities laws.

Set forth below are certain material regulatory requirements that are applicable to Town Square and Poage Bankshares. This description of statutes and regulations is not intended to be a complete description of such statutes and regulations and their effects on Town Square and Poage Bankshares. Any change in these laws or regulations, whether by Congress or the applicable regulatory agencies, could have a material adverse impact on Poage Bankshares, Town Square and their operations.
 
Dodd-Frank Act
 
The Dodd-Frank Act made significant changes to the regulatory structure for depository institutions and their holding companies. However, the Dodd-Frank Act’s changes go well beyond that and affect the lending, investments and other operations of all depository institutions. The Dodd-Frank Act required the Federal Reserve Board to set minimum capital levels for both bank holding companies and savings and loan holding companies that are as stringent as those required for the insured depository subsidiaries, and the components of Tier 1 capital for holding companies were restricted to capital instruments that were then currently considered to be Tier 1 capital for insured depository institutions. The legislation also established a floor for capital of insured depository institutions that cannot be lower than the standards in effect upon passage, and directed the federal banking regulators to implement new leverage and capital requirements that take into account off-balance sheet activities and other risks, including risks relating to securitized products and derivatives.
 
The Dodd-Frank Act also created a new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau with broad powers to supervise and enforce consumer protection laws. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has broad rule-making authority for a wide range of consumer protection laws that apply to all banks and savings institutions such as Town Square, including the authority to prohibit “unfair, deceptive or abusive” acts and practices. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has examination and enforcement authority over all banks and savings institutions with more than $10 billion in assets. Banks and savings institutions with $10 billion or less in assets, such as Town Square, will continue to be examined for compliance by their applicable bank regulators. The new legislation also weakens the federal preemption available for national banks and federal savings associations, and gives state attorneys general the ability to enforce applicable federal consumer protection laws.

The Dodd-Frank Act also broadened the base for FDIC insurance assessments. Assessments are now based on the average consolidated total assets less tangible equity capital of a financial institution. The legislation also permanently increased the maximum amount of deposit insurance for banks, savings institutions and credit unions to $250,000 per depositor, retroactive to January 1, 2008. The Dodd-Frank Act increased stockholder influence over boards of directors by requiring companies to give stockholders a non-binding vote on executive compensation and so-called “golden parachute” payments, and authorizing the Securities and Exchange Commission to promulgate rules that would allow stockholders to nominate and solicit votes for their own candidates using a company’s own proxy materials. The legislation also directs the Federal Reserve Board to promulgate rules prohibiting excessive compensation paid to bank holding company executives, regardless of whether the company is publicly traded or not. The Dodd-Frank Act provided for originators of certain securitized loans to return a percentage of the risk for the transferred loan, directed the Federal Reserve Board to regulate pricing of certain debit card interchange fees and contained a number of reforms related to mortgage origination.
 
The Dodd-Frank Act also required the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to issue regulations requiring lenders to make a reasonable good faith determination as to a prospective borrower’s ability to repay a residential mortgage loan. The final “Ability to Repay” rules, which were effective January 10, 2014, establish a “qualified mortgage” safe harbor for loans whose terms and features are deemed to make the loan less risky. 
 
The Dodd-Frank Act has increased regulatory burden and compliance, operating and interest expense for Town Square and Poage Bankshares.
 
Federal Banking Regulation
 
Business Activities. A federal savings and loan association derives its lending and investment powers from the Home Owners’ Loan Act, as amended, and the regulations of the OCC. Under these laws and regulations, Town Square may invest in mortgage loans secured by residential and commercial real estate, commercial business and consumer loans, certain types of debt securities and certain other assets, subject to applicable limits. Town Square also may establish subsidiaries that may engage in activities not otherwise permissible for Town Square, including real estate investment and securities and insurance brokerage. The Dodd-Frank Act authorized depository institutions to commence paying interest on business checking accounts, effective July 21, 2011.
 
Capital Requirements. Federal regulations require FDIC-insured depository institutions to meet several minimum capital standards: a common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-based assets ratio of 4.5%, a Tier 1 capital to risk-based assets ratio of 6.0%, a total capital to risk-based assets of 8%, and a 4% Tier 1 capital to total assets leverage ratio. The existing capital requirements were effective January 1, 2015 and are the result of a final rule implementing regulatory amendments based on recommendations of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and certain requirements of the Dodd-Frank Act.
 
For purposes of the regulatory capital requirements, common equity Tier 1 capital is generally defined as common shareholders’ equity and retained earnings. Tier 1 capital is generally defined as common equity Tier 1 and additional Tier 1 capital. Additional Tier 1 capital includes certain noncumulative perpetual preferred stock and related surplus and minority interests in equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries. Total capital includes Tier 1 capital (common equity Tier 1 capital plus additional Tier 1 capital) and Tier 2 capital. Tier 2 capital is comprised of capital instruments and related surplus, meeting specified requirements, and may include cumulative preferred stock and long-term perpetual preferred stock, mandatory convertible securities, intermediate preferred stock and subordinated debt. Also included in Tier 2 capital is the allowance for loan and lease losses limited to a maximum of 1.25% of risk-weighted assets and, for institutions that made such an election regarding the treatment of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (“AOCI”), up to 45% of net unrealized gains on available-for-sale equity securities with readily determinable fair market values. Institutions that have not exercised the AOCI opt-out have AOCI incorporated into common equity Tier 1 capital (including unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale-securities). We have exercised the AOCI opt-out. Calculation of all types of regulatory capital is subject to deductions and adjustments specified in the regulations.
 
In determining the amount of risk-weighted assets for purposes of calculating risk-based capital ratios, all assets, including certain off-balance sheet assets (e.g., recourse obligations, direct credit substitutes, residual interests) are multiplied by a risk weight factor assigned by the regulations based on the risks believed inherent in the type of asset. Higher levels of capital are required for asset categories believed to present greater risk. For example, a risk weight of 0% is assigned to cash and U.S. government securities, a risk weight of 50% is generally assigned to prudently underwritten first lien one- to four-family residential mortgages, a risk weight of 100% is assigned to commercial and consumer loans, a risk weight of 150% is assigned to certain past due loans and a risk weight of between 0% to 600% is assigned to permissible equity interests, depending on certain specified factors.
 
In addition to establishing the minimum regulatory capital requirements, the regulations limit capital distributions and certain discretionary bonus payments to management if the institution does not hold a “capital conservation buffer” consisting of 2.5% of common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted asset above the amount necessary to meet its minimum risk-based capital requirements. The capital conservation buffer requirement is being phased in beginning January 1, 2016 at 0.625% of risk-weighted assets and increasing each year until fully implemented at 2.5% on January 1, 2019. When fully implemented, the capital conservation buffer will be 2.5% of risk weighted assets over and above the regulatory minimum capital ratios for Common Equity Tier 1 Capital (CET1) to risk weighted assets, Tier 1 Capital to risk weighted assets, and Total Capital to risk weighted assets.  The consequences of not meeting the capital conservation buffer thresholds include restrictions on the payment of dividends, restrictions on the payment of discretionary bonuses, and restrictions on the repurchasing of common shares by the Company. Town Square Bank’s capital conservation buffer at December 31, 2017 was 11.1% compared to the capital conservation buffer requirement of 1.25% and at December 31, 2016 was 13.01%, compared to the capital conservation buffer requirement of 0.625%.

In assessing an institution’s capital adequacy, the OCC takes into consideration, not only these numeric factors, but qualitative factors as well, and has the authority to establish higher capital requirements for individual institutions when deemed necessary.
 
As of December 31, 2017, the capital of the Town Square exceeded all required regulatory guidelines.
 
Loans-to-One Borrower. Generally, a federal savings and loan association may not make a loan or extend credit to a single or related group of borrowers in excess of 15% of unimpaired capital and surplus. An additional amount may be loaned, equal to 10% of unimpaired capital and surplus, if the loan is secured by readily marketable collateral, which generally does not include real estate. As of December 31, 2017, Town Square was in compliance with its loans-to-one borrower limitations.
 
Qualified Thrift Lender Test. As a federal savings and loan association, Town Square must satisfy the qualified thrift lender, or “QTL,” test. Under the QTL test, Town Square must maintain at least 65% of its “portfolio assets” in “qualified thrift investments” (primarily residential mortgages and related investments, including mortgage-backed securities) in at least nine months of the most recent 12-month period. “Portfolio assets” generally means total assets of a savings institution, less the sum of specified liquid assets up to 20% of total assets, goodwill and other intangible assets, and the value of property used in the conduct of the savings bank’s business.
 
A federal savings and loan association that fails the QTL test must either convert to a commercial bank charter or operate under specified restrictions set forth in the Home Owners’ Loan Act. The Dodd-Frank Act made noncompliance with the QTL test potentially subject to agency enforcement action for a violation of law. At December 31, 2017, Town Square satisfied the QTL test with approximately 83.16% of its portfolio assets in qualified thrift investments.
 
Capital Distributions. Federal regulations govern capital distributions by a savings and loan association, which include cash dividends, stock repurchases and other transactions charged to the savings and loan association’s capital account. A federal savings and loan association must file an application for approval of a capital distribution if:

> | the total capital distributions for the applicable calendar year exceed the sum of the savings and loan association’s net income for that year to date plus the savings and loan association’s retained net income for the preceding two years;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


> | the savings and loan association would not be at least adequately capitalized following the distribution;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


> | the distribution would violate any applicable statute, regulation, agreement or written regulatory condition; or
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


> | the savings and loan association is not eligible for expedited treatment of its filings.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Even if an application is not otherwise required, every savings and loan association that is a subsidiary of a holding company must still file a notice with the Federal Reserve Board at least 30 days before the Board of Directors declares a dividend or approves a capital distribution.
 
A notice or application for capital distribution may be disapproved if:
 

> | the savings and loan association would be undercapitalized following the distribution;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


> | the proposed capital distribution raises safety and soundness concerns; or
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------


> | the capital distribution would violate a prohibition contained in any statute, regulation or regulatory condition.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
In addition, the Federal Deposit Insurance Act provides that an insured depository institution may not make any capital distribution if, after making such distribution, the institution would fail to meet any applicable regulatory capital requirement. A federal savings and loan association also may not make a capital distribution that would reduce its regulatory capital below the amount required for the liquidation account established in connection with its conversion to stock form. In addition, beginning in 2016, Town Square’s ability to pay dividends will be limited if Town Square does not have the capital conservation buffer required by the new capital rules, which may limit the ability of Poage Bankshares to pay dividends to its stockholders.
 
Liquidity. A federal savings and loan association is required to maintain a sufficient amount of liquid assets to ensure its safe and sound operation. On June 16, 2016, Poage Bankshares, Inc. executed a $2.0 million commercial line of credit secured with Town Square Bank common stock, with an unaffiliated lender. The initial variable interest rate on the line of credit is 4.00% with an interest rate equal to the Wall Street Prime plus 0.50%. The line of credit matures June 16, 2018. The line of credit will be used for general working capital purposes. At December 31, 2017, we have $2.0 million available on the line of credit.

Community Reinvestment Act and Fair Lending Laws. All federal savings associations have a responsibility under the Community Reinvestment Act and related regulations of the OCC to help meet the credit needs of their communities, including low- and moderate-income borrowers. In connection with its examination of a federal savings and loan association, the OCC is required to assess the institution’s record of compliance with the Community Reinvestment Act. A savings and loan association’s failure to comply with the provisions of the Community Reinvestment Act could, at a minimum, result in denial of certain corporate applications such as branches or mergers, or in restrictions on its activities. In addition, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and the Fair Housing Act prohibit lenders from discriminating in their lending practices on the basis of characteristics specified in those statutes. The failure to comply with the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and the Fair Housing Act could result in enforcement actions by the OCC, as well as other federal regulatory agencies and the Department of Justice. The Community Reinvestment Act requires all Federal Deposit Insurance-insured institutions to publicly disclose their rating. Town Square received a “satisfactory” Community Reinvestment Act rating in its most recent federal examination.
Transactions with Related Parties. A federal savings and loan association’s authority to engage in transactions with its affiliates is limited by OCC regulations, by Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act and Regulation W promulgated by the Federal Reserve Board. An affiliate is generally a company that controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with an insured depository institution such as Town Square. Poage Bankshares is an affiliate of Town Square. In general, transactions between an insured depository institution and its affiliates are subject to certain quantitative and collateral requirements. In addition, OCC regulations prohibit a savings and loan association from lending to any of its affiliates that are engaged in activities that are not permissible for bank holding companies and from purchasing the securities of any affiliate, other than a subsidiary. Finally, transactions with affiliates must be consistent with safe and sound banking practices, not involve low-quality assets and be on terms that are as favorable to the institution as comparable transactions with non-affiliates. The OCC requires federal savings associations to maintain detailed records of all transactions with affiliates.
 
Town Square’s authority to extend credit to its directors, executive officers and 10% shareholders, as well as to entities controlled by such persons, is currently governed by the requirements of Sections 22(g) and 22(h) of the Federal Reserve Act and Regulation O of the Federal Reserve Board. Among other things, these provisions require that extensions of credit to insiders:
 

(i) | be made on terms that are substantially the same as, and follow credit underwriting procedures that are not less stringent than, those prevailing for comparable transactions with unaffiliated persons and that do not involve more than the normal risk of repayment or present other unfavorable features, and
----+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(ii) | not exceed certain limitations on the amount of credit extended to such persons, individually and in the aggregate, which limits are based, in part, on the amount of Town Square’s capital.
-----+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
In addition, extensions of credit in excess of certain limits must be approved by Town Square’s Board of Directors. Extensions of credit to executive officers are subject to additional limits based on the type of credit extension involved. As of December 31, 2017, Town Square is in compliance with these credit limitations.
 
Enforcement. The OCC has primary enforcement responsibility over federal savings associations and has the authority to bring enforcement action against all “institution-affiliated parties,” including directors, officers, stockholders, attorneys, appraisers and accountants who knowingly or recklessly participate in wrongful action likely to have an adverse effect on the savings and loan association. Formal enforcement action by the OCC may range from the issuance of a capital directive or cease and desist order to removal of officers and/or directors of the institution, and the appointment of a receiver or conservator. Civil money penalties cover a wide range of violations and actions, and range up to $25,000 per day, unless a finding of reckless disregard is made, in which case penalties may be as high as $1 million per day. The FDIC also has the authority to terminate deposit insurance or to recommend to the OCC that enforcement action be taken with respect to a particular savings institution. If such action is not taken, the FDIC has authority to take action under specified circumstances.
 
Standards for Safety and Soundness. Federal law requires each federal banking agency to prescribe certain standards for all insured depository institutions. These standards relate to, among other things, internal controls, information systems and audit systems, loan documentation, credit underwriting, interest rate risk exposure, asset growth, compensation, and other operational and managerial standards as the agency deems appropriate. Interagency guidelines set forth the safety and soundness standards that the federal banking agencies use to identify and address problems at insured depository institutions before capital becomes impaired. The guidelines address internal controls and information systems, internal audit systems, credit underwriting, loan documentation, interest rate risk exposure, asset growth, compensation, fees and benefits. If the appropriate federal banking agency determines that an institution fails to meet any standard prescribed by the guidelines, the agency may require the institution to submit to the agency an acceptable plan to achieve compliance with the standard. If an institution fails to meet these standards, the appropriate federal banking agency may require the institution to implement an acceptable compliance plan. Failure to implement such a plan can result in further enforcement action, including the issuance of a cease and desist order or the imposition of civil money penalties.
 
Prompt Corrective Action Regulations. Under prompt corrective action regulations, the OCC is authorized and, under certain circumstances, required to take supervisory actions against undercapitalized savings and loan associations. For this purpose, a federal savings and loan association is placed in one of the following five categories based on the savings association’s capital:

> | well-capitalized (at least 5% leverage capital, 6.5% common equity Tier 1, 8% Tier 1 risk-based capital and 10% total risk-based capital);
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


26
--


> | adequately capitalized (at least 4% leverage capital, 4.5% common equity Tier 1, 6% Tier 1 risk-based capital and 8% total risk-based capital);
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


> | undercapitalized (less than 4% leverage capital, 4.5% common equity Tier 1, 4% Tier 1 risk-based capital or 8% total risk-based capital);
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


> | significantly undercapitalized (less than 3% leverage capital, 3% common equity Tier 1, 4% Tier 1 risk-based capital or 6% total risk-based capital); and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


> | critically undercapitalized (less than 2% tangible capital).
--+-------------------------------------------------------------

 
Generally, the OCC is required to appoint a receiver or conservator for a savings bank that is “critically undercapitalized” within specific time frames. The regulations also provide that a capital restoration plan must be filed with the OCC within 45 days of the date a savings and loan association receives notice that it is “undercapitalized,” “significantly undercapitalized” or “critically undercapitalized.” Any holding company for a savings and loan association that is required to submit a capital restoration plan must guarantee the lesser of an amount equal to 5% of the association’s assets at the time it was notified or deemed to be undercapitalized by the OCC, or the amount necessary to restore the savings and loan association to adequately capitalized status. This guarantee remains in place until the OCC notifies the saving and loan association that it has maintained adequately capitalized status for each of four consecutive calendar quarters, and the OCC has the authority to require payment and collect payment under the guarantee. Failure by a holding company to provide the required guarantee will result in certain operating restrictions on the savings and loan association, such as restrictions on the ability to declare and pay dividends, pay executive compensation and management fees, and increase assets or expand operations. The OCC may also take any one of a number of discretionary supervisory actions against undercapitalized associations, including the issuance of a capital directive and the replacement of senior executive officers and directors.
 
At December 31, 2017, Town Square met the criteria for being considered “well-capitalized.”
 
Insurance of Deposit Accounts. Deposit accounts in Town Square are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation generally up to a maximum of $250,000 per separately insured depositor and up to a maximum of $250,000 for self-directed retirement accounts. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation charges the insured financial institutions premiums to maintain the Deposit Insurance Fund.
 
Under the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation’s current risk-based assessment system, insured institutions are assigned to one of four risk categories based on supervisory evaluations, regulatory capital levels and certain other risk factors. Assessments are based on an individual institution’s category, with the institutions perceived as riskiest paying higher assessments.
 
In February 2011, the FDIC published a final rule under the Dodd-Frank Act to reform the deposit insurance assessment system. The rule redefined the assessment base used for calculating deposit insurance assessments effective April 1, 2011. Under the new rule, assessments are based on an institution’s average consolidated total assets minus average tangible equity instead of total deposits. The proposed rule revised the assessment rate schedule to establish assessments ranging from 2.5 to 45 basis points.
 
The FDIC has authority to increase insurance assessments. Any significant increases would have an adverse effect on the operating expenses and results of operations of Town Square. Management cannot predict what assessment rates will be in the future.
 
In addition to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation assessments, the Financing Corporation (“FICO”) is authorized to impose and collect, with the approval of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, assessments for anticipated payments, issuance costs and custodial fees on bonds issued by the FICO in the 1980s to recapitalize the former Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation. For the quarter ended December 31, 2017, the annualized FICO assessment rate equaled 0.44 basis points. The FICO assessment is based on total assets less tangible capital. The fourth quarter 2017 FICO assessment rate is 0.11 basis points. The bonds issued by the FICO mature from 2017 through 2019.
 
Insurance of deposits may be terminated by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation upon a finding that an institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations or has violated any applicable law, regulation, rule, order or condition imposed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. We do not currently know of any practice, condition or violation that may lead to termination of our deposit insurance.
 
Prohibitions Against Tying Arrangements. FDIC insured savings and loan associations are prohibited, subject to some exceptions, from extending credit to or offering any other service, or fixing or varying the consideration for such extension of credit or service, on the condition that the customer obtain some additional service from the institution or its affiliates or not obtain services of a competitor of the institution.
Federal Home Loan Bank System. Town Square is a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank System, which consists of 11 regional Federal Home Loan Banks. The Federal Home Loan Bank System provides a central credit facility primarily for member institutions as well as other entities involved in home mortgage lending. As a member of the FHLB-Cincinnati, Town Square is required to acquire and hold shares of capital stock in the FHLB-Cincinnati. As of December 31, 2017, Town Square was in compliance with this requirement.

Federal Reserve System. Federal Reserve Board regulations require banks to maintain reserves against their transaction accounts (primarily Negotiable Order of Withdrawal (NOW) and regular checking accounts). The regulations generally provide that reserves be maintained against aggregate transaction accounts. For 2017: a 3% reserve ratio was assessed on net transaction accounts up to and including $110.0 million; a 10% reserve ratio was assessed above $110.0 million. The first $15.5 million of otherwise reservable balances (subject to adjustments by the Federal Reserve Board) were exempt from the reserve requirements. The amounts are adjusted annually and, for 2018, establish a 3% reserve ratio for aggregate transaction accounts up to $122.3 million, a 10% ratio above $122.3 million, and an exemption of $16.0 million.

Other Regulations
 
Interest and other charges collected or contracted for by Town Square are subject to state usury laws and federal laws concerning interest rates. Town Square’s operations are also subject to federal laws applicable to credit transactions, such as the:

> | Truth-In-Lending Act, governing disclosures of credit terms to consumer borrowers;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


> | Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, requiring that borrowers for mortgage loans for one- to four-family residential real estate receive various disclosures, including good faith estimates of settlement costs, lender servicing and escrow account practices, and prohibiting certain practices that increase the cost of settlement services;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


> | Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, requiring financial institutions to provide information to enable the public and public officials to determine whether a financial institution is fulfilling its obligation to help meet the housing needs of the community it serves;

> | the Biggert-Waters Flood Insurance Reform Act of 2012; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------


> | rules and regulations of the various federal agencies charged with the responsibility of implementing such federal laws.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
In addition, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau issues regulations and standards under these federal consumer protection laws that affect our consumer businesses. These include regulations setting “ability to repay” and “qualified mortgage” standards for residential mortgage loans and mortgage loan servicing and originator compensation standards. Town Square devotes significant compliance, legal and operational resources to compliance with consumer protection regulations and standards.
 
The operations of Town Square also are subject to the:
 

> | Right to Financial Privacy Act, which imposes a duty to maintain confidentiality of consumer financial records and prescribes procedures for complying with administrative subpoenas of financial records;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


> | Electronic Funds Transfer Act and Regulation E promulgated thereunder, which govern automatic deposits to and withdrawals from deposit accounts and customers’ rights and liabilities arising from the use of automated teller machines and other electronic banking services;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


> | Check Clearing for the 21st Century Act (also known as “Check 21”), which gives “substitute checks,” such as digital check images and copies made from that image, the same legal standing as the original paper check;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


> | The USA PATRIOT Act, which requires savings and loan associations operating to, among other things, establish broadened anti-money laundering compliance programs, due diligence policies and controls to ensure the detection and reporting of money laundering. Such required compliance programs are intended to supplement existing compliance requirements, also applicable to financial institutions, under the Bank Secrecy Act and the Office of Foreign Assets Control regulations; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


> | The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, which places limitations on the sharing of consumer financial information by financial institutions with unaffiliated third parties. Specifically, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act requires all financial institutions offering financial products or services to retail customers to provide such customers with the financial institution’s privacy policy and provide such customers the opportunity to “opt out” of the sharing of certain personal financial information with unaffiliated third parties.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


> | The Volcker Rule, which attempts to reduce risk and banking system instability by restricting U.S. banks from investing in or engaging in proprietary trading and speculation and imposing a strict framework to justify exemptions for underwriting, market making and hedging activities. U.S. banks will be restricted from investing in funds with collateral comprised of less than 100% loans that are not registered with the SEC and from engaging in hedging activities that do not hedge a specific identified risk. The Company does not believe the Volcker Rule will have a significant effect on operations.

Holding Company Regulation
 
General. Poage Bankshares is a non-diversified savings and loan holding company within the meaning of the Home Owners’ Loan Act. As such, Poage Bankshares is registered with the Federal Reserve Board and subject to Federal Reserve Board regulations, examinations, supervision and reporting requirements. In addition, the Federal Reserve Board has enforcement authority over Poage Bankshares and its subsidiaries. Among other things, this authority permits the Federal Reserve Board to restrict or prohibit activities that are determined to be a serious risk to the subsidiary savings institution.
Permissible Activities. Under present law, the business activities of Poage Bankshares are generally limited to those activities permissible for financial holding companies under Section 4(k) of the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended, or for multiple savings and loan holding companies. A financial holding company may engage in activities that are financial in nature, including underwriting equity securities and insurance as well as activities that are incidental to financial activities or complementary to a financial activity. A multiple savings and loan holding company is generally limited to activities permissible for bank holding companies under Section 4(c)(8) of the Bank Holding Company Act, subject to the prior approval of the Federal Reserve Board, and certain additional activities authorized by Federal Reserve Board regulations.
 
Federal law prohibits a savings and loan holding company, including Poage Bankshares, directly or indirectly, or through one or more subsidiaries, from acquiring more than 5% of another savings institution or holding company thereof, without prior written approval of the Federal Reserve Board. It also prohibits the acquisition or retention of, with certain exceptions, more than 5% of a nonsubsidiary company engaged in activities that are not closely related to banking or financial in nature, or acquiring or retaining control of an institution that is not federally insured. In evaluating applications by holding companies to acquire savings institutions, the Federal Reserve Board must consider the financial and managerial resources, future prospects of the company and institution involved, the effect of the acquisition on the risk to the federal deposit insurance fund, the convenience and needs of the community and competitive factors.
 
The Federal Reserve Board is prohibited from approving any acquisition that would result in a multiple savings and loan holding company controlling savings institutions in more than one state, subject to two exceptions:
 

(i) | the approval of interstate supervisory acquisitions by savings and loan holding companies; and
----+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(ii) | the acquisition of a savings institution in another state if the laws of the state of the target savings institution specifically permit such acquisition.
-----+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
The states vary in the extent to which they permit interstate savings and loan holding company acquisitions.
 
Capital. When it reaches $1 billion in total assets, Poage Bankshares, Inc. will be subject to the Federal Reserve Board’s capital adequacy regulations for savings and loan holding companies (on a consolidated basis). These capital standards have historically been similar to, though less stringent than, those of the OCC for Town Square. The Dodd-Frank Act, however, required the Federal Reserve Board to establish, for all savings and loan holding companies with total assets of $500 million or more ( a final rule issued by the Federal Reserve Board has increased this threshold to $1 billion in assets), minimum consolidated capital requirements that are as stringent as those required for the insured depository subsidiaries. Under regulations recently enacted by the Federal Reserve Board and effective January 1, 2015, all such savings and loan holding companies will be subject to regulatory capital requirements that are the same as the new capital requirements for Town Square. These new capital requirements include provisions that, when applicable, might limit the ability of Poage Bankshares, Inc. to pay dividends to its stockholders or repurchase its shares. See “—Federal Banking Regulation—New Capital Rule.” Poage Bankshares, Inc. has conducted a pro forma analysis of the application of these new capital requirements as of December 31, 2017, and has determined that it meets all of these new requirements, including the full 2.5% capital conservation buffer, and would be well-capitalized, if these new requirements had been in effect on that date. 
Source of Strength. The Dodd-Frank Act extended the “source of strength” doctrine to savings and loan holding companies. The Federal Reserve Board has issued regulations requiring that all savings and loan holding companies serve as a source of managerial and financial strength to their subsidiary savings associations by providing capital, liquidity and other support in times of financial stress.

Dividends. The Federal Reserve Board has issued a policy statement regarding the payment of dividends by bank holding companies that it has made applicable to savings and loan holding companies as well. In general, the policy provides that dividends should be paid only out of current earnings and only if the prospective rate of earnings retention by the holding company appears consistent with the organization’s capital needs, asset quality and overall financial condition. Regulatory guidance provides for prior regulatory review of capital distributions in certain circumstances such as where the company’s net income for the past four quarters, net of dividends previously paid over that period, is insufficient to fully fund the dividend or the company’s overall rate of earnings retention is inconsistent with the company’s capital needs and overall financial condition. The ability of a holding company to pay dividends may be restricted if a subsidiary bank becomes undercapitalized. The policy statement also states that a savings and loan holding company should inform the Federal Reserve Board supervisory staff prior to redeeming or repurchasing common stock or perpetual preferred stock if the savings and loan holding company is experiencing financial weaknesses or if the repurchase or redemption would result in a net reduction, as of the end of a quarter, in the amount of such equity instruments outstanding compared with the beginning of the quarter in which the redemption or repurchase occurred. These regulatory policies could affect the ability of Poage Bankshares to pay dividends or otherwise engage in capital distributions.
Acquisition. Under the Federal Change in Bank Control Act, a notice must be submitted to the Federal Reserve Board if any person (including a company), or group acting in concert, seeks to acquire direct or indirect “control” of a savings and loan holding company. Under certain circumstances, a change of control may occur, and prior notice is required, upon the acquisition of 10% or more of the company’s outstanding voting stock, unless the Federal Reserve Board has found that the acquisition will not result in control of the company. A change in control definitively occurs upon the acquisition of 25% or more of the company’s outstanding voting stock. Under the Change in Bank Control Act, the Federal Reserve Board generally has 60 days from the filing of a complete notice to act, taking into consideration certain factors, including the financial and managerial resources of the acquirer and the competitive effects of the acquisition.
