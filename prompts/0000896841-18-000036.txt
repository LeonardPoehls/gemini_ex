ITEM 1. | BUSINESS

OVERVIEW
We develop, market, sell, and support software, hardware and integrated solutions for video and audio content creation, management and distribution. We do this by providing an open and efficient platform for digital media, along with a comprehensive set of tools and workflow solutions. Digital media are video, audio or graphic elements in which the image, sound or picture is recorded and stored as digital values, as opposed to analog or tape-based signals. Our solutions are used in production and post-production facilities; film studios; network, affiliate, independent and cable television stations; recording studios; live-sound performance venues; advertising agencies; government and educational institutions; corporate communications departments; and by independent video and audio creative professionals, as well as aspiring professionals. Projects produced using our tools, platform and ecosystem include feature films, television programming, live events, news broadcasts, sports productions, commercials, music, video and other digital media content.
Our mission is to enable our clients to create, connect and collaborate through continuous innovation of an open media ecosystem, powerful common platform and tools. Our clients rely on Avid to create the most prestigious and award-winning feature films, music recordings, television shows, live concerts, sporting events and news broadcasts. Avid has been honored for technological innovation with 15 Emmy Awards, one Grammy Award, two Oscars and the first ever America Cinema Editors Technical Excellence Award. Our creative tools and workflow solutions were used in all 2018 Oscar nominated films for Best Film Editing, Best Sound Editing, Best Sound Mixing, and Best Original Score and used in the winner of Best Picture. 
RECENT EVENTS
On February 25, 2018, our Board of Directors voted to terminate the employment of Louis Hernandez Jr., Chief Executive Officer, effective immediately. As a result of this termination under his employment agreement, Mr. Hernandez is no longer our Chief Executive Officer and resigned from his position on our Board of Directors. In connection with Mr. Hernandez’s termination, the Board appointed Jeff Rosica, who has been serving as our President, as our Chief Executive Officer, effective immediately. Mr. Rosica joined Avid as Senior Vice President of Worldwide Field Operations in January 2013. In January 2016, Mr. Rosica was appointed Senior Vice President, Chief Sales and Marketing Officer and in December 2016, he was appointed President of the Company. From early 2002 until joining Avid, Mr. Rosica served in various capacities with Grass Valley, LLC, a broadcast equipment supplier, most recently as Executive Vice President, Chief Sales and Marketing Officer. Prior to that, Mr. Rosica was Vice President and General Manager of Phillips Broadcast from 1996. Also in connection with Mr. Hernandez’s resignation from his position on our Board of Directors, the Board has appointed Nancy Hawthorne as our new chair.
CORPORATE STRATEGY
Technology has enabled almost every aspect of how we live to become increasingly digitized, and acceleration of digitization is having a tremendous impact on the media industry and altering the industry value chain. Today’s consumers are empowered to create and consume content on-demand, anywhere, anytime. Organizations in the media industry are under pressure to connect and automate the entire creation-to-consumption workflow, and are facing a number of challenges, including:

• | Increasing rate of content creation – many organizations are feeling intense pressure to create more and more content, increasingly tailored for audience niches, while also facing greater competition from nimble players. At the same time, access to creative tools is wider today than ever before, giving more people the ability to tell their stories.


• | Exponential growth of distribution platforms – the economic models of new distribution platforms are often not fully matured or realized. Many organizations need to embrace new opportunities while also maximizing heritage business. 

1


• | Continued increase in content consumption – there has been a tremendous increase in viewership in the last decade, but it is spread across many outlets and channels, and while there is this increase in viewership, it is dwarfed by an increase in competitive content. In addition, with growing audience fragmentation, compelling content, brand equity and relevance is even more critical today.


• | Media technology budgets – today’s economic realities are placing pressure on media technology budgets, while content output must increase exponentially to deliver on the market requirements. Content creators and distributors have to do a lot more, with essentially flat budgets.

We believe our strategic understanding and technological expertise uniquely position us to effectively help organizations in the media industry navigate through this period of unprecedented change. Our products and solutions allow our customers to (i) create high-quality, engaging and immersive content, (ii) distribute to more outlets and devices, (iii) maximize and protect the value of media assets, and (iv) create operational and capital efficiency. Our unique position across the media industry includes:

• | the comprehensive tools and solutions to create, distribute and optimize media, with proven end-to-end solutions that are precisely designed to optimize content production and media workflow efficiencies;


• | the open, integrated and efficient platform designed for media, providing an ecosystem that future-proofs and protects technology investments;


• | flexible deployment models, licensing options and commercial structures, including on premises, public or private cloud, or hybrid deployments; perpetual, subscription or enterprise licensing; and flexible commercial models, all adaptable to the individual needs of each client; and


• | a preeminent client and user community that helps shape our collective future, including the industry’s most inspirational and award-winning thought leaders, innovators and storytellers that keep our community at the forefront of creative techniques and workflow best practices.

Our strategy for connecting creative professionals and media organizations with audiences in a powerful, efficient, collaborative, and profitable way leverages our Avid MediaCentral Platform - the open, extensible, and customizable foundation that streamlines and simplifies content workflows by integrating all Avid or third-party products and services that run on top of it. The platform provides secure and protected access, and enables the faster and easier creation and delivery of content through a set of modular application suites and new public and private marketplaces, that together, represent an open, integrated and flexible media production and distribution environment for the media industry. Our Avid Advantage Support Plans reinforce our strategy by offering a new standard in service, support and education to enable our customers to derive more efficiency from their Avid investment. In addition, the Avid Customer Association, or ACA, was established as the world’s most innovative and influential media technology community representing thousands of organizations and over 20,000 professionals from all levels of the industry. The ACA fosters collaboration between Avid, its customers and other industry colleagues to help shape our product offerings as well as providing a means to shape our industry together.
The set of modular application suites and public and private marketplaces on the Avid MediaCentral Platform are summarized below:

• | Artist Suite encompasses all of our audio and video creative tools for editing, mixing, and live sound production. Products and tools in the Artist Suite can be deployed on premise, cloud-enabled, or through a hybrid approach. Users can collaborate to access, edit, and share the same media, and collaborate with others as if they were all in the same facility.


• | Media Suite offers solutions to securely manage, distribute, and re-purpose assets. The solutions will be based on a new metadata tracking system, where metadata will be generated algorithmically and provide a greater level of detail, making it possible to take a flexible and adaptable view of assets at any stage of the lifecycle.


• | Studio Suite comprises in-studio tools for on-air program and viewership enhancement, including 3D real-time graphics, replay servers, sports enhancements and virtual studios.


• | Storage Suite refers to all of our products and tools used to capture, store, and deliver media, including online storage, nearline storage, and ingest/playout servers. These products and tools work in close concert with the Media Suite’s tagging and asset management.

2


• | Marketplaces provide an easy and secure way for the content creators to share or publish their products or elements. The marketplaces are designed for collaboration and distribution among individuals and enterprises.

Another key element of our strategy is our transition to a subscription or recurring revenue based model. We started offering cloud-based subscription licensing options for some of our products and solutions in 2014, and had approximately 94,000 paying cloud-enabled subscribers at the end of 2017, a 54% increase from the end of 2016. These licensing options offer choices in pricing and deployment to suit our customers’ needs and are expected to increase recurring revenue on a longer- term basis. However, during our transition to a recurring revenue model, we expect that our revenue, deferred revenue and cash flow from operations will be adversely affected as an increasing portion of our total revenue is recognized ratably rather than up front, and as new product offerings are sold at a wider variety of price points.
A key component of our strategy has been to implement programs to reduce costs, increase operational efficiencies, align talent and enhance our business, including the cost efficiency program started in February 2016. The cost efficiency program encompassed a series of measures intended to allow us to operate in a leaner, more directed cost structure. These measures included reductions in our workforce, consolidation of facilities, transfers of certain business processes to lower cost regions and reductions in other third-party services costs. The cost efficiency program was substantially completed in 2017.

Our award-winning Media Composer product line is used to edit video content, including television programming, commercials and films. Our cloud-enabled solutions including Media Composer enable broadcast news, sports, reality television and film professionals to acquire, access, edit and finish stories anytime, from everywhere. Leveraging an integrated, yet open, end-to-end architecture, this solution gives contributors the ability to craft stories where and while they are happening and speed them to delivery, while maintaining connectivity with the central production operation. We released Media Composer updates through subscription and perpetual license offerings and with resolution flexibility and independence, which allows users to manage and edit high-resolution media content with ease. In 2017, we released additional Media Composer product updates and upgrades to extend the production capabilities and demonstrate our continuing commitment to provide tools that allow for improved creativity and productivity of the professional editor.
Our Avid Artist I/O interfaces for Media Composer offer extensive HD and high-resolution format support across three interfaces-Avid Artist | DNxIQ, Avid Artist | DNxIV, and Avid Artist | DNxIP.

Revenues from our professional video creative tools accounted for 6%, 9% and 10% of our net revenues for 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
Media Management Solutions
We offer ingest, storage, asset management, editing, content transformation, virtual and augmented reality graphics, and distribution of content solutions for broadcast news, sports, and entertainment customers, enabling them to engage audiences 
4

across multiple platforms. In 2017, we announced cloud availability of MediaCentral, Avid’s next-generation media production suite extending from the Avid MediaCentral platform. The MediaCentral platform easily scales from simple to the sophisticated workflows. Built on a customizable cloud native microservices architecture, MediaCentral platform features a cloud-based user experience that runs on any device, workflow modules for editorial, production, news, graphics, and asset management, with apps to enhance and scale any of those modules, and a wide array of media services and partner connectors. Every user is connected in a completely integrated workflow environment, and gains a unified view into all their media with flexible deployment options for on premises, hybrid or cloud (public/private) environments. 
As part of the delivery of the Avid MediaCentral platform, we announced an Editorial Management module for smaller creative teams that provides the same robust media management capabilities used by the largest media enterprises in the industry. Integrated within Media Composer via a panel, Editorial Management connects directly to Avid NEXIS storage to provide easy access to media with hyper-search functionality. Editorial Management also extends collaboration capabilities for the assistant editor in an easy to use web interface by allowing Media Composer bin creation, logging and search capabilities, greatly expanding the efficiency of creative teams.
Revenues from media management solutions accounted for 3%, 4% and 7% of our total net revenues in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
Broadcast Graphics 
Since acquiring Orad Hi-Tech Systems Ltd., or Orad, in June 2015, we have continued to integrate the graphics portfolio deeper in to our platform creating greater accessibility, efficiency at scale to enable the delivery of content with graphics faster. In 2017, we rebranded the Orad line-up under the Maestro brand which offers customers comprehensive solutions for integrating virtual sets, augmented reality, and video wall control into existing workflows, ideal for any type of production needs in news, sports, entertainment, and in studio productions. Maestro features a core platform that includes a powerful render engine and featured design tool called Maestro | Designer that drives a line up of applications that are designed to address the specific challenges broadcasters face when automating the integration of statistics and graphics for the creation of an engaging broadcast. By adding graphics capabilities across the entire product line, we enable journalists and producers to add graphics remotely to news stories or enhance any story with innovative stats drive augmented reality graphics for presenting data in new and compelling ways. 
Also in 2017, we announced our cloud service offerings for news and asset management. We partnered with Microsoft to deliver Azure certified solutions to support end-to-end hybrid and cloud deployments of news workflows. This includes announcing virtualized versions of those same offerings enabling broadcasters to migrate to more traditional IT infrastructures leveraging IP technology to integrate disparate systems within a broadcast environment. 
We have re-imagined the next-generation newsroom, based around a story-centric workflow including multiple Avid solutions and new feature enhancements for modern newsroom management and news production. Our next-generation newsroom builds on the openness and integration of the MediaCentral Platform. Content can be pushed across a variety of platforms as the story evolves, including on-air, online, social media platforms, and on mobile devices. Audiences can get up-to-the-minute information and contribute to live broadcasts allowing broadcasters to leverage user generated content helping further establish a critical direct relationship with the audience.

Customers can improve allocation of creative resources and support changing project needs with an open, shared storage platform that includes file system technology on lower cost hardware, support for third-party applications and streamlined administration to create more content at an affordable price.
In 2016, we released the new Avid NEXIS family, the industry’s first and only software-defined storage platform specifically designed for storing and managing media. Avid NEXIS enables fully virtualized storage so media organizations can adjust storage capacity mid-project, without disrupting workflows. Powered by our MediaCentral Platform, Avid NEXIS delivers media storage flexibility, scalability, and control for both Avid-based and third-party workflows. It has been designed to serve 
5

small production teams as powerfully as large media enterprises and is the only storage platform built with the flexibility to grow with customers at every stage of their business.
In 2017, Avid announced and shipped the FastServe video server product line to assist broadcasters in making the move to UHD and IP based workflows with a new, modular architecture that enables the flexibility and reliability that broadcasters demand. The Avid FastServe family integrates with the MediaCentral platform, empowering creative teams to deliver content fast for news, sports, entertainment, and other media productions. Its 10GbE interface offers direct connection to Avid NEXIS storage, enabling real-time ingest, editing, and playout-even while media is being captured.

Pro Tools solutions are offered at a range of price points and are used by professionals in music, film, television, radio, game, Internet and other media production environments. 
Throughout 2017, we released multiple feature-rich updates for Pro Tools that deliver solutions for both music creation and audio post production.  These updates range from delivering customer requested MIDI enhancements and improvements to collaboration, to creating new integrated Dolby Atmos workflows and mixing for Virtual Reality content. Pro Tools 12.7 introduced Soundbase, an intelligent loop browser, as a way to influence music creativity. Along with the addition of 2GB of free Loopmasters loops, music creators can more easily find the sounds they need to bring their musical ideas to life. In version 12.8, Pro Tools | HD introduced integration with Dolby Atmos, the emerging new standard in immersive audio for film, television, and music. This integration, which was developed in close partnership with Dolby, delivers object-based, immersive mixing workflow and has been adopted by top professionals in the audio post community. Stemming from this improvement to immersive workflows, Pro Tools | HD 12.8.2 introduced support for third order Ambisonics, a popular format in virtual reality gaming development, and now includes the Facebook 360 Spatial Workstation.

COMPETITION
Our customer markets are highly competitive and subject to rapid change and declining average selling prices.  The competitive landscape is fragmented with a large number of companies providing various types of products and services in different markets and geographic areas.  We provide integrated solutions that compete based on total workflow value, 
7

features, quality, service, and flexibility of pricing and deployment options.  Companies with which we compete in some contexts may also act as our partners in other contexts, such as large enterprise customer environments.
Certain companies that compete with us across some of our products and solutions are listed below by the market relevant to Avid in which they compete predominantly:

• | Broadcast and Media: Belden Inc. (Grass Valley), ChyronHego Corporation, Dalet S.A., Dell Technologies Inc. (EMC Isilon), EVS Corporation, Harmonic Inc., Quantum Corporation, Ross Video Limited, and Vizrt Ltd., among others. 


• | Audio and Video Post and Professional: Ableton AG, Adobe Systems Incorporated, Apple Inc., AudioTonix Limited, Blackmagic Design Pty Ltd, PreSonus Audio Electronics, Inc., and Yamaha Corporation, among others. 

Some of our principal competitors are substantially larger than we are and have greater financial, technical, marketing and other resources than us. For a discussion of these and other risks associated with our competitors, see “Risk Factors” in Item 1A of this Form 10-K.
OPERATIONS
Sales and Services Channels 
We market and sell our products and solutions through a combination of direct, indirect and digital sales channels. Our direct sales channel consists of internal sales representatives serving select customers and markets. Our indirect sales channels include global networks of independent distributors, value-added resellers, dealers and retailers. Our digital sales channel is represented by the online Avid Marketplace.
We have significant international operations with offices in 22 countries and the ability to reach over 170 countries through a combination of our direct sales force and resellers. Sales to customers outside the United States accounted for 62%, 64% and 63%, of our total net revenues in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Additional information about the geographic breakdown of our revenues and long-lived assets can be found in Note P to our Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K. For additional information about risks associated with our international operations, see “Risk Factors” in Item 1A of this Form 10-K.
We generally ship our products shortly after the receipt of an order. However, a high percentage of our revenues has historically been generated in the third month of each fiscal quarter and concentrated in the latter part of that month. Orders that may exist at the end of a quarter and have not been shipped are not recognized as revenues in that quarter and are included in revenue backlog.
Certain orders included in revenue backlog may be reduced, canceled or deferred by our customers. Our revenue backlog, as we define it, consists of firm orders received and includes both (i) orders where the customer has paid in advance of our performance obligations being fulfilled and (ii) orders for future product deliveries or services that have not yet been invoiced by us. The expected timing of the conversion of revenue backlog into revenue is based on current estimates and could change based on a number of factors, including (i) the timing of delivery of products and services, (ii) customer cancellations or change orders, (iii) changes in the estimated period of time Implied Maintenance Release post contract service, or PCS, is provided to customers, or (iv) changes in accounting standards or policies. Implied Maintenance Release PCS, as we define it, is the implicit obligation to make software updates available to customers over a period of time, representing implied post-contract customer support, and is deemed to be a deliverable in each arrangement and accounted for as a separate element. As there is no industry standard definition of revenue backlog, our reported revenue backlog may not be comparable with other companies. Additional information on our revenue backlog can be found in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”
We provide customer care services directly through regional in-house and contracted support centers and major-market field service representatives and indirectly through dealers, value-added resellers and authorized third-party service providers. Depending on the solution, customers may choose from a variety of support offerings, including telephone and online technical support, on-site assistance, hardware replacement and extended warranty, and software upgrades. In addition to 
8

customer care services, we offer a broad array of professional services, including installation, integration, planning and consulting services, and customer training.
Manufacturing and Suppliers 
Our manufacturing operations consist primarily of a network of contract manufacturers around the globe to manufacture many of our products, components and subassemblies, and Original Equipment Manufacturers, or OEMs, from whom we purchase finished assemblies. Our products undergo testing and quality assurance at the final assembly stage. In addition to our external manufacturing operations, we also have an internal manufacturing operation consist primarily of configuring into complete systems the products, board sets, subassemblies and components purchased from third parties, and final assembly and testing of some board sets, software, related hardware components and complete systems.  We depend on sole-source suppliers for certain key hardware product components and finished goods, including some critical items. Although we have procedures in place to mitigate the risks associated with our sole-sourced suppliers, we cannot be certain that we will be able to obtain sole-sourced components or finished goods from alternative suppliers or that we will be able to do so on commercially reasonable terms without a material impact on our results of operations or financial position. For the risks associated with our use of contractors and sole-source vendors, see “Risk Factors” in Item 1A of this Form 10-K.
Our company-operated manufacturing facilities, primarily for final assembly and testing of certain products, are located in Kfar Saba, Israel, and Dublin, Ireland. Our contract manufacturers and OEMs manufacture our products at a relatively limited number of different facilities located throughout the world and, in most cases, the manufacturing of each of our products is concentrated in one or a few locations. An interruption in manufacturing capabilities at any of these facilities, as a result of equipment failure or other reasons, could reduce, delay or prevent the production of our products. Because some of our manufacturing or our contract manufacturers’ operations are located outside of the United States, including in Israel, Ireland, China, Mexico and Thailand, those manufacturing operations are also subject to additional challenges and risks associated with international operations. For these and other risks associated with our manufacturing operations, see “Risk Factors” in Item 1A of this Form 10-K.
Research and Development
We are committed to delivering best-in-class digital media content-creation solutions that are designed for the unique needs, skills and sophistication levels of our target customer markets as well as a generic media platform for the media industry to host our own as well as our partner solutions. Having helped establish the digital media technology industry, we are building on a 25+ year heritage of innovation and leadership in developing content-creation solutions and platforms. We have research and development, or R&D, operations around the globe. Our R&D efforts are focused on the development of digital media content-creation, distribution and monetization tools as well as the media platform. These tools operate primarily on the Mac and on Windows platforms, whereas the media platform primarily operates on Linux platforms. Our R&D efforts also include highly optimized media storage solutions, standards-based media transfer and media asset management tools, as well as ingest and playout solutions to cover the entire workflow. In addition to our internal R&D efforts, we outsource a significant portion of certain R&D projects to an internationally based partner in Kiev, Ukraine. Our R&D expenditures for 2017, 2016 and 2015 were $68.2 million, $81.6 million and $95.9 million, respectively, which represented 16%, 16% and 19% of our total net revenues, respectively. For the risks associated with our use of partners for R&D projects, see “Risk Factors” in Item 1A of this Form 10-K.

We regard our software and hardware as proprietary and protect our proprietary interests under the laws of patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets, as well as through contractual provisions.
We have obtained patents and have registered copyrights, trademarks and service marks in the United States and in many foreign countries. At February 8, 2018, we held 125 U.S. patents, with expiration dates through 2037, and had 14 patent applications pending with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. We have also registered or applied to register various

trademarks and service marks in the United States and a number of foreign countries, including Avid, Avid Everywhere, MediaCentral, Media Composer, Pro Tools and Sibelius. As a technology company, we regard our patents, copyrights, trademarks, service marks and trade secrets as being among our most valuable assets, together with the innovative skills, technical competence and marketing abilities of our personnel.
Our software is licensed to end users pursuant to shrink-wrap, embedded, click-through or signed license agreements. Our products generally contain features to guard against unauthorized use. Policing unauthorized use of computer software is difficult, and software piracy is a persistent problem for us, as it is for the software industry in general. Although we attempt to protect our intellectual property rights through patents, trademarks, copyrights, licensing arrangements, maintaining certain technology as trade secrets and other measures, there can be no assurance that any patent, trademark, copyright or other intellectual property rights owned by us will not be invalidated, circumvented or challenged, that such intellectual property rights will provide competitive advantages to us, or that any of our pending or future patent applications will be issued with the claims, or the scope of the claims, sought by us, if at all. Others may develop technologies that are similar or superior to our technology, duplicate our technology or design around the patents that we own. In addition, effective patent, copyright and trade secret protection may be unavailable or limited in countries in which we do business or may do business in the future. For these and other risks associated with the protection of our intellectual property, see “Risk Factors” in Item 1A of this Form 10-K.
