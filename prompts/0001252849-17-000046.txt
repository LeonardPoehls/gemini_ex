Real Estate Investment Objectives
Columbia Property Trust seeks to invest in and manage a commercial real estate portfolio that provides the size, quality, and market specialization needed to deliver both income and long-term growth, as measured in the total return to our shareholders. Our primary strategic objective is to generate long-term shareholder returns from a combination of steadily growing cash flows and appreciation in our net asset values, through the acquisition and ownership of high-quality office buildings located principally in high-barrier-to-entry markets. Our value creation and growth strategies are founded in the following:
Targeted Market Strategy 
Our portfolio consists of a combination of multi- and single-tenant office properties located primarily in Central Business Districts ("CBD"). We focus our acquisition efforts in select primary markets with strong fundamentals and liquidity, including CBD and urban in-fill locations. We believe that the major U.S. office markets provide a greater propensity for producing increasing net income and property values over time. We maintain a long-term goal of increasing our market concentrations in order to leverage our scale, efficiency, and market knowledge.
New Investment Targets 
We look to acquire strategic and premier office assets with quality tenants in our target markets, with an emphasis on value-added opportunities. We pursue high-quality assets that are competitive within the top tier of their markets or can be repositioned as such. Our asset selection criteria include the property's location attributes, physical quality, tenant/lease characteristics, competitive positioning, and pricing level in comparison to long-term, normalized value or replacement cost.
Strong and Flexible Balance Sheet 
We are committed to maintaining an investment-grade balance sheet with a strong liquidity profile and proven access to capital. Our leverage level and other credit metrics provide the financial flexibility to pursue new acquisitions and other growth opportunities that will further our long-term performance objectives.
Capital Recycling 
We consistently evaluate our existing portfolio to identify assets in which the value has been optimized and/or those that are considered nonstrategic, based on their market location or investment characteristics. The goal of our disposition efforts is to harvest capital from these mature and nonstrategic assets, and redeploy it into properties in our target markets to maximize growth in net operating income and long-term value.
Proactive Asset Management 
We believe our team is well equipped to deliver operating results in all facets of the management process. Our leasing efforts are founded in understanding the varied and complex needs of tenants in the marketplace today. We pursue meeting those needs

through new and renewal leases, as well as lease restructures that further our long-term goals. We are committed to prudent capital investment in our assets to ensure their competitive positioning and status, and rigorously pursue efficient operations and cost containment at the property level.

Segment Information
As of December 31, 2016, our reportable segments are determined based on the geographic markets in which we have significant investments. We consider geographic location when evaluating our portfolio composition and in assessing the ongoing operations and performance of our properties. See Note 15, Segment Information, to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
Employees
As of December 31, 2016, we employed 90 people.
Competition
Leasing real estate is highly competitive in the current market. As a result, we experience competition for high-quality tenants from owners and managers of competing projects. Therefore, we may experience delays in re-leasing vacant space; or we may have to provide rent concessions, incur charges for tenant improvements, or offer other inducements to enable us to timely lease vacant space, all of which may have an adverse impact on our results of operations. In addition, we are in competition with other potential buyers for the acquisition of the same properties, which may result in an increase in the amount we must pay to purchase a property. Further, at the time we elect to dispose of our properties, we will also be in competition with sellers of similar properties to locate suitable purchasers. 
Concentration of Credit Risk
We are dependent upon the ability of our current tenants to pay their contractual rent amounts as they become due. The inability of a tenant to pay future rental amounts would have a negative impact on our results of operations. We are not aware of any reason why our current tenants will not be able to pay their contractual rental amounts as they become due in all material respects. Situations preventing our tenants from paying contractual rents could result in a material adverse impact on our results of operations. Based on our 2016 annualized lease revenue, no single tenant accounts for more than 8% of our portfolio.
