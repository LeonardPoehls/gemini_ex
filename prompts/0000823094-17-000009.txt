ITEM 1: DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS
Company Overview
Sotheby's is a global art business, offering our clients opportunities to connect with and transact in the world's most extraordinary objects. Auctioneers since 1744, today we offer a variety of innovative art-related services, including the brokerage of private art sales, private jewelry sales through Sotheby's Diamonds, exclusive private selling exhibitions at our S|2 galleries, art-related financing, and art advisory services, as well as retail wine locations in New York and Hong Kong.
As successor to a business that began in 1744, Sotheby's is the oldest company listed on the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE") (symbol: BID) and is the only publicly traded investment opportunity in the art market. Sotheby's is incorporated in Delaware.
Business Organization
Our operations are organized under two segments: the Agency segment and the Finance segment, which does business as and is referred to in this report as Sotheby’s Financial Services (“SFS”). The Agency segment earns commissions by matching buyers and sellers of authenticated fine art, decorative art, jewelry, wine and collectibles (collectively, "art" or "works of art" or "artwork" or "property") through the auction or private sale process. To a much lesser extent, Agency segment activities also include the sale of artworks that are principally acquired as a consequence of the auction process, as well as the activities of RM Sotheby's, an equity investee that operates as an auction house for investment-quality automobiles (see Note 5 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). SFS earns interest income through art-related financing activities by making loans that are secured by works of art. Art Agency, Partners (“AAP”), through which we offer art advisory services, provides clients strategic guidance on collection identity and development, acquisitions, and short and long-term planning. Our advisory services are classified within All Other for segment reporting purposes, along with our retail wine business and brand licensing activities. See Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding our segment reporting.
Agency Segment
Through our Agency segment, we accept property on consignment, stimulate buyer interest through professional marketing techniques, and match sellers (also known as consignors) to buyers through the auction or private sale process. Prior to offering a work of art for sale, we perform due diligence activities to authenticate and determine the ownership history of the property being sold. See “Converting Consignment Opportunities” below for further information regarding the consignment process.
Following an auction or private sale, we invoice the buyer for the purchase price of the property (including any commission owed by the buyer), collect payment from the buyer, and remit to the consignor the net sale proceeds after deducting our commissions, expenses and applicable taxes and royalties. As compensation for our auction services, we earn a commission from both the buyer ("buyer's premium") and, to a lesser extent, the seller ("seller's commission") (collectively, "auction commission revenue"), both of which are calculated as a percentage of the hammer price of the property sold at auction. In 2016, 2015, and 2014, auction commission revenues accounted for approximately 75%, 75%, and 81%, respectively, of our consolidated revenues. Private sale commission revenues are earned through the direct brokering of purchases and sales of art. Private sales are initiated either by a client wishing to sell property with Sotheby's acting as its exclusive agent in the transaction, or by a prospective buyer who is interested in purchasing a certain work of art privately. In 2016, 2015, and 2014, private sale commission revenues accounted for approximately 7%, 6%, and 6%, respectively, of our consolidated revenues.
Under the standard terms and conditions of our auction and private sales, we are not obligated to pay the consignor for property that has not been paid for by the buyer. If a buyer defaults on payment, the sale may be cancelled, and the property will be returned to the consignor. Alternatively, the consignor may reoffer the property at one of our future auctions or negotiate a private sale with us acting as their agent. In certain instances and subject to management approval under our internal corporate governance policy, we may pay the net sale proceeds to the consignor before payment is collected from the buyer and/or we may allow the buyer to take possession of the property before making payment. In situations when the buyer takes possession of the property before making payment, we are liable to the seller for the net sale proceeds whether or not the buyer makes payment.

From time-to-time in the ordinary course of our business, we will guarantee to a consignor a minimum sale price in connection with the sale of property at auction (an "auction guarantee"). If the property offered under the auction guarantee sells above the minimum guaranteed price, we are generally entitled to a share of the excess proceeds (the "overage"). In the event that the property sells for less than the minimum guaranteed price, we must perform under the auction guarantee by funding the difference between the sale price at auction and the amount of the auction guarantee (the "shortfall"). If any item of property offered under the auction guarantee does not sell, the amount of the auction guarantee must be paid, but we take ownership of the unsold property and may recover the amount paid through its future sale. 
We may reduce our financial exposure under auction guarantees through contractual risk and reward sharing arrangements. Such auction guarantee risk and reward sharing arrangements include irrevocable bids and partner sharing arrangements. In exchange for accepting a share of the financial exposure under the auction guarantee, our counterparties to these arrangements are generally entitled to receive a share of our auction commission if the property sells and/or a share of the overage, if any.
Auction guarantees are an important financial incentive which may significantly influence an art collector's decision on whether and how to sell their property. As such, auction guarantees provide us the opportunity to secure highly sought-after consignments, often well in advance of a specific selling season. When we evaluate the performance of our portfolio of auction guarantees, we take into consideration the overall revenues earned on the transaction, which includes our auction commission revenues, as well as any overage or shortfall. 
 See "Auction Commission Margin" under Part II, Item 7, "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations," for a complete discussion of the factors impacting auction commission margin, as well as a discussion of the overall financial performance of the Agency segment for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014. See Note 4 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about auction and private sale receivables. See Note 19 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about auction guarantees.
Sotheby's Financial Services
SFS is an art financing company that is uniquely positioned as a niche lender with the ability to tailor attractive financing packages for clients who wish to obtain immediate access to liquidity from their art assets. SFS deploys a combination of art expertise, skill in international law and finance, and access to capital to provide art collectors and dealers with financing secured by their works of art, allowing them to unlock the value in their collections. A considerable number of traditional lending sources offer conventional loans at a lower cost to borrowers than the average cost of loans offered by SFS and many traditional lenders offer borrowers a variety of integrated financial services such as wealth management. Few lenders, however, are willing to accept works of art as sole collateral for loans, as they do not have access to market information allowing them to effectively appraise collateral during the life of a loan, nor do they have the wherewithal to efficiently monetize loan collateral. Through a combination of our art expertise and skills in international law and finance, we have the ability to tailor attractive financing packages for clients who wish to obtain immediate access to liquidity from their art assets.
SFS makes term loans secured by artworks that are not presently intended for sale, allowing us to establish or enhance mutually beneficial relationships with art collectors. Term loans may also generate future auction or private sale consignments and/or purchases. In certain situations, term loans are made to refinance receivables generated by the auction and private sale purchases of our clients. Term loans normally have initial maturities of up to two years and typically carry a variable market rate of interest. To a much lesser extent, SFS also makes consignor advances secured by artworks that are contractually committed, in the near term, to be offered for sale through our Agency segment. Consignor advances allow sellers to receive funds upon consignment for an auction or private sale that will occur up to one year in the future and normally have short-term maturities. 
Prior to 2014, the lending activities of SFS were funded primarily by the operating cash flows of our Agency segment, with the ability to supplement those cash flows with revolving credit facility borrowings. In January 2014, in order to reduce our cost of capital and enhance returns, we established a separate capital structure for SFS through which client loans are predominantly funded with borrowings drawn from a dedicated revolving credit facility. To a lesser extent, cash balances are also used to fund a portion of the loans made by SFS, as appropriate. The establishment of a dedicated revolving credit facility for SFS has allowed us to finance approximately 84% of the loan portfolio with debt as of December 31, 2016 and has contributed to a 42% increase in the client loan portfolio when compared to December 31, 2013 and a higher level of profitability for the segment.

The repayment of secured loans can be adversely impacted by a decline in the art market in general or in the value of the collateral, which is concentrated within certain collecting categories. In addition, in situations when there are competing claims on the collateral and/or when a borrower becomes subject to bankruptcy or insolvency laws, our ability to realize on our collateral may be limited or delayed.
We aim to mitigate the risk associated with potential devaluation in our collateral by targeting a 50% loan-to-value ("LTV") ratio (i.e., the principal loan amount divided by the low auction estimate of the collateral). However, loans may also be made with LTV ratios between 51% and 60%, and in rare circumstances, loans may be made at an initial LTV ratio higher than 60%. The dedicated revolving credit facility for SFS permits borrowings on the portion of any loan that does not exceed a 60% LTV ratio.
The LTV ratio of certain loans may increase above our 50% target due to a decrease in the low auction estimate of the collateral. The revaluation of term loan collateral is performed by our specialists on an annual basis or more frequently if there is a material change in the circumstances related to the loan, the value of the collateral, the disposal plans for the collateral, or if an event of default occurs.
See "Sotheby's Financial Services" under Part II, Item 7, "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations," for information on the financial performance of SFS for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014. See Note 4 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information about the SFS loan portfolio. See Note 9 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information about the SFS revolving credit facility.
The Art Market
The global art market is influenced over time by the overall strength and stability of the global economy, the financial markets of various countries, geopolitical conditions, and world events, all of which may impact the willingness of potential buyers and sellers to purchase and sell art. In addition, the amount and quality of art consigned for sale is influenced by other factors not within our control, and many consignments become available only as a result of the death or financial or marital difficulties of the owner (see "Converting Consignment Opportunities" below). These factors cause the supply and demand for works of art to be unpredictable and may lead to significant variability in our revenues from period to period.
Seasonality
The global art auction market has two principal selling seasons, which generally occur in the second and fourth quarters of the year. In the aggregate, second and fourth quarter Net Auction Sales1 represented 82%, 78%, and 79% of our total annual Net Auction Sales in 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively, with auction commission revenues comprising approximately 75%, 75%, and 81% of our total revenues in each of these years. Accordingly, our financial results are seasonal, with peak revenues and operating income generally occurring in the second and fourth quarters. Consequently, first and third quarter results have historically reflected lower revenues when compared to the second and fourth quarters and, typically, a net loss due to the fixed nature of many of our operating expenses. 
In quarterly reporting periods, the comparison of our results between reporting periods can be significantly influenced by a number of factors, such as changes in the timing of when certain auctions occur, the level of non-recurring single-owner auction sale events, the level and timing of individually negotiated private sale transactions, and changes in certain accounting estimates that rely upon forecasted results such as variable incentive and share-based compensation expense and our estimated annual effective income tax rate. Accordingly, when evaluating our performance, we believe that investors should also consider results for six and twelve month periods, which better reflect the business cycle of the global art auction market. See Note 29 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for our quarterly results for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015.

Competition
Artworks are sold primarily through the major auction houses, numerous art dealers, smaller auction houses, and also directly between private collectors. In recent years, a growing number of art dealers and private collectors now buy and sell artworks at art fairs such as the The European Fine Art Fair ("TEFAF"), Art Basel, and the Frieze art fairs. 
Competition in the global art market is intense. A fundamental challenge facing any auctioneer or art dealer is the sourcing of high quality and valuable property for sale either as agent or as principal. Our primary competitor in the global art market is Christie's, a privately owned auction house. To a lesser extent, we also face competition from a variety of art dealers across all collecting categories, as well as smaller auction houses such as Bonhams and Phillips and certain regional auction houses. In the Chinese art market, we compete with Beijing Poly International Auction Co. Ltd., China Guardian Auctions Co. Ltd. and Beijing Hanhai Auction Co. Ltd.
In 2016, 2015, and 2014, Sotheby's and Christie's together totaled approximately $8.7 billion, $12.3 billion, and $12.9 billion, respectively, of Aggregate Auction Sales2, of which we accounted for $4.2 billion (49%), $5.9 billion (48%), and $6.1 billion (47%), respectively.
It is not possible to measure with any particular accuracy the entire global art market or to reach definitive conclusions regarding overall competition because privately owned art dealers and auction houses frequently do not publicly report annual totals for art sales, revenues, or profits, and the amounts reported may not be verifiable. However, the most recent TEFAF Art Market Report estimates that global art sales totaled approximately $64 billion in 2015 with private sales by dealers and other agents accounting for 53% of the market and public auctions accounting for 47%.
Converting Consignment Opportunities
The ability to source high quality and valuable property for consignment is highly dependent on the meaningful institutional and personal relationships we have with our clients, which sometimes span generations. As these relationships develop over time, we provide our clients with strategic guidance on collection identity, development and acquisition, and then help them navigate the financial, logistical and personal considerations involved with deciding to sell their valued artworks. A client's decision to sell their art may be part of their long-term financial planning process or could occur suddenly as a result of a sudden change in circumstances. Over time, the principal reasons that art collectors sell have become known as the "four D's": (i) Death; (ii) Debt; (iii) Divorce; and (iv) Discretion (e.g., change in collecting preferences, redecorating a residence, and market strength). These reasons each represent a potential opportunity for consignment, but the timing of when they may arise is unpredictable and not within our control. As a result, it is difficult to predict with any certainty the supply of high quality and valuable property available for consignment in advance of peak selling seasons.
The more valuable the property, the more likely it is that an owner looking to sell their artwork will consider more than one option and will solicit proposals from more than one potential purchaser or agent. Traditionally, the primary options available to a seller of art have been:
•Sale or consignment to an art dealer;
•Sale or consignment to an auction house;
•Private sale to a collector or museum; or
•Consignment to an internet based service for certain categories of property (in particular, collectibles).

A complex array of factors may influence a seller's decision to favor one of these options over the others, and may include any or all of the following considerations:
•The level and breadth of expertise of the art dealer or auction house with respect to the property; 
•The extent of the prior relationship, if any, between the art dealer or auction house and its staff and the seller; 

• | The reputation and historic level of achievement by the art dealer or auction house in attaining high sale prices in the property's specialized category;


• | Recommendations by third parties consulted by the seller;


• | The client's desire for privacy;


• | The level of pre-sale estimates;


• | The desirability of a public auction in order to achieve the maximum possible price;


• | The amount of cash offered by an art dealer, auction house or other purchaser to purchase the property outright, which is greatly influenced by the amount and cost of capital resources available to such parties;


• | The availability and terms of financial incentives offered by auction houses, including auction guarantees, short-term financing, and auction commission sharing arrangements;


• | The commission charged by art dealers or auction houses to sell a work on consignment;


• | The cost, style, and extent of pre-sale marketing and promotion to be undertaken by an art dealer or auction house; and


• | The availability and extent of related services, such as tax or insurance appraisals.

Regulation of the Art Market
Regulation of the art market varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. In many jurisdictions, we are subject to laws and regulations, including, but not limited to, import and export regulations, cultural property regulations, data protection and privacy laws, anti-money laundering laws, antitrust laws, copyright and resale royalty laws, laws and regulations involving sales, use, value-added and other indirect taxes, and regulations related to the use of real estate. In addition, we are subject to local auction regulations, such as New York City Auction Regulations Subchapter M of Title 6 §§ 2-121-2-125, et. seq. Such regulations currently do not impose a material impediment to our business, but do affect the art market generally. A material adverse change in such regulations, such as the American Royalties Too Act of 2014 introduced in the U.S. Congress, which would impose a 5% resale royalty (with a cap of $35,000) on sales of art through large auction houses, could affect our business. Additionally, export and import laws and cultural property ownership laws could affect the availability of certain kinds of property for sale at our principal auction locations, increase the cost of moving property to such locations, or expose us to legal claims or government inquiries. We have a Compliance Department which, amongst other activities, develops and updates compliance policies, and audits, monitors, and provides training to our employees on compliance with many of these laws and regulations.
Our Strategic Priorities
We are focused on four key strategic priorities: (i) the development and implementation of a compelling growth strategy; (ii) embracing technology more effectively, both internally and through client-facing products; (iii) the efficient allocation of capital; and (iv) the attraction, development, and retention of talent. Throughout 2016, we have made significant progress against each of these priorities.
In January 2016, we acquired AAP, a firm that provides a range of art-related services, in exchange for initial cash consideration of $50 million and earn-out consideration of $35 million. The purpose of this acquisition is to grow auction and private sale revenues by enhancing our relationships with art collectors and by improving our position in the fine art market, particularly in Impressionist, Modern and Contemporary Art. Also, as a result of this acquisition, we have added a new revenue stream by integrating AAP's existing art advisory business, providing a new avenue for growth. See Note 3 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the acquisition of AAP.

In July 2016, we acquired The Mei Moses Art Indices, which is now known as Sotheby's Mei Moses. Widely recognized as the preeminent measure of the state of the art market, the indices use repeat sales (i.e., the sale of the same object at different points in time) to track changes in value. Through this acquisition, we have unique access to an analytic tool and data that provide objective and verifiable information to complement the world-class expertise of our art specialists.
In November 2016, we acquired Orion Analytical, a materials analysis and consulting firm that utilizes state-of-the-art technical and scientific methods in the examination of art, cultural property, wine and other objects. With this acquisition, we have established a scientific research department led by Orion Analytical's founder, Jamie Martin, the leading scientist in the field of materials analysis, enhancing our world-class expertise and provenance research capabilities. Bringing scientific expertise in-house mirrors a trend seen in the world’s great museums and distinguishes us in the marketplace as we help make the art market a safer place to transact.
In addition to these acquisitions, we have also appointed several new executives and client service professionals, enhancing our business development and private sale capabilities, as well as our advisory business. 
In the world of technology, in 2016, we launched and refined a new generation of mobile applications across several major platforms including iPhone, iPad, Apple TV, Android, Amazon Fire TV, and Samsung Smart TV. These applications enable our clients to live-stream our auctions, review auction results and experience audio tours of our exhibitions. Additionally, throughout the year, digital participation in our auctions continued to grow. For the year ended December 31, 2016, online sales, which includes sales to on-line bidders during our live auctions, as well as on-line only auctions, totaled $155 million, a 20% increase when compared to the prior year.
Lastly, we have continued to refine our capital allocation framework to facilitate the efficient use of capital for our shareholders. This framework takes a comprehensive look at the totality of our capital needs, including the liquidity required to support our recurring business and working capital needs, capital required for the pursuit of growth opportunities, and an appropriate level of capital reserved to mitigate the risk of a cyclical downturn in the global art market. Importantly, this framework also considers the risks associated with our use of auction guarantees and their potential impact on our liquidity. Additionally, in conjunction with our capital allocation framework, we have stress tested our business model under the different market conditions of the last decade in order to determine cash-basis break-even levels at significantly lower levels of Net Auction Sales. 
Guided by this framework, in 2016, we have returned approximately $360 million to shareholders through our common stock repurchase program. To date, over a three-year period, we have repurchased 17.4 million shares of our common stock, returning $510 million to our shareholders and reducing our outstanding share count by 23%. See Note 14 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on our share repurchase program.
Brand Licensing Activities
Prior to 2004, we were engaged in the marketing and brokerage of luxury residential real estate sales through Sotheby's International Realty ("SIR"). In 2004, we sold SIR to a subsidiary of Realogy Corporation ("Realogy"), formerly Cendant Corporation. In conjunction with the sale, we entered into an agreement with Realogy to license the SIR trademark and certain related trademarks for an initial 50-year term with a 50-year renewal option (the "Realogy License Agreement"). The Realogy License Agreement is applicable worldwide.
The Realogy License Agreement provides for an ongoing license fee during its term based on the volume of commerce transacted under the licensed trademarks. In 2016, 2015, and 2014, we earned $9.1 million, $8.1 million, and $7.2 million, respectively, in license fee revenue related to the Realogy License Agreement.
We also license the Sotheby's name for use in connection with the art auction business in Australia, and art education services in the U.S. and the U.K. We will consider additional opportunities to license the Sotheby's brand in businesses where appropriate.
