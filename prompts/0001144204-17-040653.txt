Item 1. Business
Overview
 
Our Company
 
During the past year, our management, at the direction of the Board of Directors, has evaluated, considered, and brought forward various opportunities to acquire producing oil fields; however, to date, an oil field meeting the criteria acceptable to the Board of Directors (which criteria include among other things, low general and administrative costs, ability to generate cash flow and ability to fully utilize the Plasma Pulse Technology (“PPT”)) has not been found. At this point, the Board is reevaluating its business plan and strategy and has reduced operating expenses, including staffing, in order to preserve capital, while the Board evaluates its options including the possible sale of our technology and PPT assets, forming a special committee to investigate a possible share buyback of the majority shareholder, Ervington Investments, and/or a possible dissolution of the Company.
 
In July 2015, when we closed the final tranche of our private placement of the sale of our Series C Preferred Stock and raised an additional $9,750,000, we shifted our operational focus from being a direct provider of well services based upon PPT to actively seeking to acquire producing oil fields to generate revenues and the development of untapped hydrocarbon reserves . As a result, in August 2015, our board of directors and shareholders approved through the formation of a joint venture, the exclusive sublicense to our majority owned subsidiary Novas Energy North America, LLC (“NENA”) of our rights to use certain plasma pulse technology that we had licensed from Novas Energy Group Limited (the “Licensor”) pursuant to the terms of an exclusive license agreement (the “License Agreement”), for treatment of vertical wells in the United States (hereafter, the “Licensed Plasma Pulse Technology”). We retained the right to use the Licensed Plasma Pulse Technology for treatment of our own assets located in the United States as well as treatment of assets outside of the United States. The Licensed Plasma Pulse Technology refers to the process and apparatus of Licensor for its plasma pulse technology as covered by Licensor’s patent rights. Although we were indirectly engaged in the oil recovery business through NENA and directly through our treatment of oil wells in Mexico, it was not our foundational business strategy. In October 2016, we terminated the joint venture due to its failure to meet certain milestones, including its generation of minimal revenue. We intend to terminate our agreement with our Mexican partner in the near future.
 
We have financed our operations primarily from sales of our securities, both debt and equity, and to a lesser extent revenue from operations and we expect to continue to obtain required capital in a similar manner. We have incurred an accumulated deficit of $18,512,441 through December 31, 2016 and there can be no assurance that we will be able to achieve profitability.

Recent Events
 
On October 4, 2016, Novas Energy USA, Inc. (“Novas USA”), our wholly owned subsidiary, delivered a notice to its joint venture partner, Technovita Technologies USA, Inc. (“Technovita”) electing to dissolve its joint venture with Technovita (the “Joint Venture”), effective November 1, 2016, pursuant to Section 11.1(b) of the Operating Agreement of Novas Energy North America, LLC (“NENA”), dated October 22, 2015 (the “Operating Agreement”), by and among Novas USA and Technovita.
 
Section 11.1(b) of the Operating Agreement provides that the Joint Venture may be dissolved upon the election of Novas USA in the event the Joint Venture fails to satisfy any Year 1 Key Performance Indicator by an amount greater than five percent (5%) of the applicable metric (the “Year 1 Milestone”). The Joint Venture has not achieved the Year 1 Milestone. For the purposes of the Operating Agreement, the Year 1 Key Performance Indicators are defined as: during a continuous twelve (12) month period commencing upon September 1, 2015 each of: (1) sales from activities in the United States of greater than or equal to $2,829,000; (2) sales from activities in Canada of greater than or equal to $2,829,000; (3) EBITDA from activities in the United States of greater than or equal to $524,000; and (4) EBITDA from activities in Canada of greater than or equal to $524,000. In fact, NENA has not generated more than nominal revenue. Upon a dissolution, all intellectual property assets of the Joint Venture, including any improvements to Technology (as defined in the Operating Agreement) is to be distributed to Technovita solely for use in Canada, its territories and its possessions and Novas USA solely for use in the United States and its territories.
 
Pursuant to the Operating Agreement, Novas USA had entered into a sublicense agreement (the “Novas Sublicense Agreement”) with NENA and Novas Energy Group Limited for NENA to be the exclusive provider of Plasma Pulse Technology for treatment of vertical wells to third parties in the United States. The Sublicense Agreement was terminated upon termination of the Joint Venture. The Operating Agreement also provided, among other things, that Novas USA would contribute an aggregate of $1,200,000 to the capital of the Joint Venture for its 60% interest in the Joint Venture. Novas USA has contributed $900,000 to the Joint Venture to date and believes that it has valid defenses to any claim that may be made that it contribute additional funds.
 
On July 19, 2016, we received a notice from the Licensor purporting to effectively terminate the License Agreement for non-payment of required royalties, asserting, among other things, that as of June 30, 2016, Novas owed Licensor a pro rata amount of $1,458,333 for the Licensed Plasma Pulse Technology for the United States and Mexico, of which $1,000,000 was alleged to be in arrears. Novas has recently been contacted by the Licensor with a request for settlement discussions; however there can be no assurance that such discussions will occur or what the outcome of any such discussions will be. We and Novas believe that there is no legal basis for Licensor to terminate the License Agreement and further intend to vigorously defend against any attempt by Licensor to enforce a termination of the License Agreement. Further, we believe that Licensor has failed to materially perform its obligations under the License Agreement, and we believe that such failures on Licensor’s part may impact what, if any, payments are due under the License Agreement by Novas to Licensor.
 
We believe that it is evident from the plain language of the Sublicense Agreement, and the fact that we transferred to NENA substantially all of its rights for the use of Licensed Plasma Pulse Technology in the United States of America, that the Sublicense Agreement replaced and superseded the royalty fees due under the License Agreement for the use of the Licensed Plasma Pulse Technology in the Licensed Territory. We also believe that we have developed our own plasma-pulse technology not based on or otherwise an infringement to, the Licensed Plasma Pulse Technology, although the Licensor has not accepted our claim. Going forward, if we decide to continue to treat oil wells, our intent is to deploy our own plasma-pulse technology in lieu of the Licensed Plasma Pulse Technology, however, if we were to seek to continue to use the Licensed Plasma Pulse Technology, by reason of the termination of the Sublicense Agreement, effective November 1, 2016, we would be required to pay royalties to Licensor.

History
 
Pledge Petroleum Corp (“Pledge”). (f/k/a Propell Technologies Group, Inc.) is a Delaware corporation originally formed on January 29, 2008 as CA Photo Acquisition Corp. On April 10, 2008 Crystal Magic, Inc. (“CMI”), a Florida Corporation, merged with an acquisition subsidiary of Pledge, and we issued an aggregate of 108,000 shares to the former shareholders of CMI. On May 6, 2008, we acquired both Mountain Capital, LLC (d/b/a Arrow Media Solutions) (“AMS”) and Auleron 2005, LLC (d/b/a Auleron Technologies) (“AUL”) and made each a wholly owned subsidiary and issued a total of 41,987 shares of our Common Stock to the members of Mountain Capital, LLC and a total of 2,721 shares of our Common Stock to the members of AUL (the shares referenced above are in pre-split amounts, that is prior to our 50-to-1 reverse split in August 2012). In 2010 AUL and AMS were dissolved. In September 2010, CMI’s assets were foreclosed upon by its largest creditor and these assets were liquidated and effective December 31, 2013, we disposed of our interest in CMI for nominal consideration.
 
In 2013, we closed a Share Exchange Agreement with the shareholders of Novas, under which we acquired all of the outstanding equity securities of Novas in exchange for 100,000,000 shares of our common stock. Novas had entered into a license for use of the Licensed Plasma Pulse Technology licensed from Licensor for use in the United States and Mexico. Prior to the closing of the second tranche of the Series C Preferred Stock private placement and the sublicense with NENA, our focus had been on the provision of production enhancement services.
 
On February 19, 2015, we entered into a Series C Preferred Stock Purchase Agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”) with Ervington Investment Limited, an entity organized under the laws of the Republic of Cyprus which is wholly owned by Norma Investments Limited, which in turn is wholly owned by Harmony Trust Settlement (“Ervington”), and closed the first tranche of a private placement offering under the Purchase Agreement, raising $5,000,000 in gross proceeds from the sale of 1,525,424 shares of our Series C Preferred Stock (“Series C Preferred Stock”) at a purchase price of $3.277777778 per share.. On June 30, 2015, Ervington closed the second tranche of a private placement offering under the purchase agreement raising an additional $9,750,000 in gross proceeds from the sale of 2,974,576 shares of our Series C Preferred Stock at a purchase price of $3.277777778. We agreed to use the proceeds for the acquisition, enhancement and maintenance of an oil field and the use of our Plasma Pulse Technology thereon.
 
On October 22, 2015, Novas entered into an operating agreement with Technovita Technologies USA, Inc. (“Technovita”) (the “Joint Venture Agreement”) through a newly formed Delaware limited liability company, NENA, whereby Novas agreed to contribute $1,200,000 ($600,000 to be delivered on the effective date (October 22, 2015) of the Joint Venture Agreement, $300,000 on November 1, 2015 and $300,000 on the two month anniversary of the Effective Date) to the capital of NENA for 60% of the membership interests of NENA and Technovita agreed to contribute an aggregate of $800,000 to the capital of NENA for 40% of the membership interests of NENA. In October 2015, Novas entered into a sublicense agreement (the “Novas Sublicense Agreement”) with NENA and the Licensor pursuant to which NENA was granted the right, subject to certain exceptions to be the exclusive provider of the Plasma Pulse Technology for treatment of vertical wells to third parties in the United States. Subject to certain exceptions and pursuant to the terms of Sublicense Agreements (the “Technovita Sublicense Agreement”) that was entered into between Technovita, NENA and Licensor, NENA is the exclusive provider of the Plasma Pulse Technology for treatment of vertical wells to third parties in Canada. Both Novas and Technovita will retain the right to deploy the Plasma Pulse Technology on vertical wells owned by Novas or Technovita in the United States or Canada, respectively. On October 4, 2016, Novas Energy USA, Inc. (“Novas USA”), a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, delivered a notice to Technovita Technologies USA, Inc. (“Technovita”) electing to dissolve its joint venture with Technovita (the “Joint Venture”), effective November 1, 2016, pursuant to Section 11.1(b) of the Operating Agreement of Novas Energy North America, LLC (“NENA”), dated October 22, 2015 (the “Operating Agreement”), by and among Novas USA and Technovita.
 
On July 6, 2012, we filed a Certificate of Designations, Rights and Preferences with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware designating 5,000,000 preferred shares as Series A-1 Preferred Stock. On August 17, 2012, we filed an amendment to our Certificate of Incorporation, which increased the number of shares of our authorized Common Stock to 500,000,000 shares, effectuated a 50:1 reverse split of the number of shares of our outstanding common stock and changed our name to Propell Technologies Group, Inc. On February 4, 2013, we acquired all of the outstanding shares of Novas and Novas became our wholly owned subsidiary. Effective December 31, 2013, we disposed of our e-commerce line of business. On March 14, 2014, we filed a Certificate of Designations, Rights and Preferences with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware designating 500,000 preferred shares as Series B Preferred Stock. On February 17, 2015, we filed a Certificate of Designations, Rights and Preferences with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware designating 4,500,000 preferred shares as Series C Preferred Stock.
 
On February 16, 2017, the board of directors resolved that the Company change its name to Pledge Petroleum Corp and on February 17, 2017, the “Company filed a Certificate of Amendment to the Certificate of Incorporation with the Secretary of State of Delaware to change the name of the Company to Pledge Petroleum Corp.

Plasma Pulse Technology
 
On January 30, 2013, Novas entered into the exclusive, perpetual royalty bearing License Agreement with the Licensor, which was amended in March 2014 and further amended on December 23, 2014, that granted Novas the right to practice, develop, use, market and commercialize the proprietary process of the Licensor, which consists of a specially designed apparatus and certain proprietary technology, methods and processes that may be applied to enhance the production of hydrocarbon deposits using metallic plasma-generated, directed, non-linear, wide-band and elastic oscillations at resonance frequencies. The amended License Agreement provides Novas with the right to practice the licensed process and to utilize the Plasma Pulse Technology to provide services to third parties and for ourselves as well, and to sublicense the Plasma Pulse Technology in the United States and Mexico. The amended License Agreement also provides Novas with the right to design and have manufactured the apparatus and to make modifications and improvements to the Plasma Pulse Technology provided that the Licensor is provided a non-exclusive license to any such improvements and modifications and any patent rights of Novas related to the Plasma Pulse Technology. The process utilizes a down-hole tool that is lowered into vertical wellbores to the perforated oil producing zone. When initiated, the tool delivers metallic plasma- generated, directed, non-linear, wide-band elastic oscillations at resonance frequencies to enhance oil production using the tool developed by the Licensor and enhanced by Novas. The Plasma Pulse Technology is suitable for oil wells as deep as 12,000 feet. By optimizing production efficiency combined with the resulting increased oil production we expect to extend the economic life of mature oil fields and to recover previously unrecoverable oil efficiently. Most of our tools only work in vertical wells with a minimum of 5 ½-inch casings and not in horizontal wells. We developed U.S. made tools to treat 4 ½-inch cased wells.
 
Numerous companies have utilized the Plasma Pulse Technology that Novas has licensed in the treatment and stimulation of oil wells throughout the Russian Federation, China, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and Czech Republic. The tool and subsequent well treatment have been credited with increasing oil production and injector well fluid flow in over 150 wells outside of the United States in Russia and China. It does so without any chemicals associated with hydraulic fracturing and therefore is deemed to be environmentally friendly. The treatment was created to clear the well drainage area of sedimentation clogging at the perforation zone.
 
Our Industry
 
According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), the United States produced an estimated 3.25 billion barrels of crude oil in 2016, a decrease of about 5% from the estimated 3.4 billion barrels produced in 2015. Previous to 2016, annual crude oil production in the United States had increased for seven consecutive years.
 
According to U.S. Crude Oil and Natural Gas Proved Reserves, 2015, released by the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) in December 2016, U.S. crude oil proved reserves decreased between year end 2014 and year end 2015 from 39.9 billion barrels to 35.2 billion barrels, an 11.8% decrease and the average price of oil dropped 47% in 2015 compared to 2014. U.S production of crude oil and lease condensate increased in 2015 for the seventh consecutive year by 7% from 2014.
 
Texas has the largest proved reserves of any state but also the largest decline, a net decrease of $1 billion barrels of crude oil and lease condensate proved reserves from 2014 to 2015. North Dakota has the second largest proved reserves, mostly from the Bakken Shale, and the second largest decline in 2015, a net decrease of 838 million barrels of crude oil and lease condensate proved reserves.

Intellectual Property
 
We license the “Plasma-Pulse Technology” from the Licensor, pursuant to the terms of an exclusive perpetual royalty bearing license we entered into in January 2013, which was amended in March 2014 and further amended on December 23, 2014. The amended license agreement provides us with the exclusive right to develop, use, market and commercialize the Plasma Pulse Technology for ourselves and/or third parties, sublicense and provide related services to third parties in the United States and Mexico including all of its states, districts, territories, possessions and protectorates. The amended license agreement also provides Novas with the right to design and have manufactured the apparatus and to make modifications and improvements to the Plasma Pulse Technology provided that the Licensor is provided a non-exclusive license to any such improvements and modifications and any patent rights of Novas related to the Plasma Pulse Technology. The license is limited to the United States and Mexico. It also provides that we will pay the Licensor royalties equal to seven and a half percent (7.5%) of Net Service Sales (as defined in the second amendment to the license agreement) and Sublicensing Consideration (as defined in the second amendment to the license agreement) and provides for a minimum royalty payment of $500,000 per year from United States operations and $500,000 per year from Mexican operations; however, no minimum royalty payment is due prior to the three-year anniversary of the license agreement for revenue derived from the United States operations and no minimum royalty is due prior to December 31, 2015 for revenue derived from Mexico. Under certain circumstances, we have the right to make additional cash payments to cover certain royalty payment deficiencies. All royalty payments made by us as well as sublicensing revenue paid by us to Licensor are credited towards the minimum royalty payment. Royalties based on revenue derived from operations in one territory can be used to satisfy obligations for minimum royalty payments in the other territory. If the minimum royalty is not timely paid with respect to one of the two territories, the Licensor has the right to terminate the license with respect to that territory and if the minimum royalty payment for both territories is not paid, to terminate the license agreement. The Licensor is responsible for the cost of filing prosecuting and maintaining the patents and we are responsible for costs of obtaining marketing approvals. The Licensor has the right to terminate the license agreement upon our breach or default. If the Licensor dissolves, becomes insolvent or engages in or is the subject of any other bankruptcy proceeding then the Plasma Pulse Technology and patent rights in the United States shall become our property.
 
On July 19, 2016, we received a notice from the Licensor purporting to effectively terminate the License Agreement for non-payment of required royalties, asserting, among other things, that as of June 30, 2016, Novas owed Licensor a pro rata amount of $1,458,333 for the Licensed Plasma Pulse Technology for the United States and Mexico, of which $1,000,000 was alleged to be in arrears. Novas has recently been contacted by the Licensor with a request for settlement discussions; however there can be no assurance that such discussions will occur or what the outcome of any such discussions will be. We and Novas believe that there is no legal basis for Licensor to terminate the License Agreement and intend to vigorously defend against any attempt by Licensor to enforce a termination of the License Agreement. Further, we believe that Licensor has failed to materially perform its obligations under the License Agreement, and we believe that such failures on Licensor’s part may impact what, if any, payments are due under the License Agreement by Novas to Licensor.
 
We believe that it is evident from the plain language of the Sublicense Agreement, and the fact that we transferred to NENA substantially all of its rights for the use of Licensed Plasma Pulse Technology in the United States of America, that the Sublicense Agreement replaced and superseded the royalty fees due under the License Agreement for the use of the Licensed Plasma Pulse Technology in the Licensed Territory. We also believe that we have developed our own plasma-pulse technology not based on or otherwise an infringement to, the Licensed Plasma Pulse Technology, although the Licensor has not accepted our claim. Going forward, if we decide to continue to treat oil wells, our intent is to deploy our own plasma-pulse technology in lieu of the Licensed Plasma Pulse Technology, however, if we were to seek to continue to use the Licensed Plasma Pulse Technology, by reason of the termination of the Sublicense Agreement, effective November 1, 2016, we would be required to pay royalties to Licensor.
 
We have a provisional patent application pending with the United States Patent and Trademark Office (the “USPTO”) filed on August 5, 2016 and directed to our own plasma-pulse technology in lieu of the Licensed Plasma Pulse Technology. One of the listed co-inventors of the patent application, a former contractor (the “Contractor”), currently refuses to execute a confirmatory assignment agreement confirming that he assigned all rights, title and interest to us for publically recording with the USPTO. While the Contractor’s consulting agreement states that we own all of the intellectual property he development relating to the pulse tool, we are currently negotiating an assignment agreement with the Contractor to remove any doubt that we exclusively own the intellectual property. There can be no assurance that the Contractor will assign his rights to us or that additional action, such as litigation, may be required to settle the matter. There can also be no assurance that the pending patent application will result in the issuance of patents, that patents issued to us will not be challenged or circumvented by competitors, or that these patents will be found to be valid or sufficiently broad to protect our technology or provide us with a competitive advantage.
 
To maintain our proprietary position, we also rely on trade secrets and proprietary technological experience to protect proprietary manufacturing processes, technology, and know-how relating to our business.  We rely, in part, on confidentiality agreements with our marketing partners, employees, advisors, vendors and consultants to protect our trade secrets and proprietary technological expertise. In addition, we also seek to maintain our trade secrets through maintenance of the physical security of the premises where our trade secrets are located.  There can be no assurance that these agreements will not be breached, that we will have adequate remedies for any breach, that others will not independently develop equivalent proprietary information or that third parties will not otherwise gain access to our trade secrets and proprietary knowledge.
 
There has been and continues to be substantial litigation regarding intellectual property rights. If a third party asserts a claim against us, we may be forced to expend significant time and money defending such actions and an adverse determination in any patent litigation could subject us to significant liabilities to third parties, require us to redesign our tools, require us to seek licenses from third parties, and, if licenses are not available, prevent us from manufacturing, selling or using our system. Additionally, we plan to enforce our intellectual property rights vigorously and may find it necessary to initiate litigation to enforce our patent rights or to protect our trade secrets or know-how. Patent litigation can be costly and time consuming and there can be no assurance that the outcome will be favorable to us.

Regulation
 

(a) | General
----+--------

 Exploration and production operations are subject to various types of regulation at the federal, state and local levels. This regulation includes requiring permits to drill wells, maintaining bonding requirements to drill or operate wells, and regulating the location of wells, the method of drilling and casing wells, the surface use and restoration of properties on which wells are drilled, and the plugging and abandoning of wells. Our operations are also subject to various conservation laws and regulations.
 
Typically, oil enhancements such as hydraulic fracturing operations have historically been overseen by state regulators as part of their oil and gas regulatory programs; however, the EPA has asserted federal regulatory authority over certain hydraulic fracturing activities involving diesel under the Safe Drinking Water Act and has released draft permitting guidance for hydraulic fracturing activities that use diesel in fracturing fluids in those states where EPA is the permitting authority. As a result, we may be subject to additional permitting requirements for our operations. These permitting requirements and restrictions could result in delays in operations at well sites as well as increased costs to make wells productive. In addition, legislation introduced in Congress provides for federal regulation of hydraulic fracturing under the Safe Drinking Water Act and require the public disclosure of certain information regarding the chemical makeup of hydraulic fracturing fluids.
 
The EPA has published rules that establish air emission control requirements for natural gas and NGL production, processing and transportation activities, including New Source Performance Standards to address emissions of sulfur dioxide and volatile organic compounds, and National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAPS) to address hazardous air pollutants frequently associated with gas production and processing activities. Among other things, these rules require the reduction of volatile organic compound emissions from natural gas wells through the use of reduced emission completions or "green completions" on all hydraulically fractured wells constructed or refractured after January 1, 2015. The NESHAPS rules also include maximum achievable control technology (MACT) standards for "small" glycol dehydrators that are located at major sources of hazardous air pollutants and modifications to the leak detection standards for valves. Compliance with the EPA’s rules and requirements, especially any new green completion requirements, may require modifications to certain of our operations, including the installation of new equipment to control emissions at the well site that could result in significant costs, including increased capital expenditures and operating costs, and could adversely impact our business.
 
In addition to these federal legislative and regulatory proposals, some states and certain local governments have adopted, and others are considering adopting, regulations that could restrict hydraulic fracturing in certain circumstances, including requirements regarding chemical disclosure, casing and cementing of wells, withdrawal of water for use in high-volume hydraulic fracturing of horizontal wells, baseline testing of nearby water wells, and restrictions on the type of additives that may be used in hydraulic fracturing operations. Any such new regulations may require modifications to certain of our operations, including the installation of new equipment to control emissions at the well site that could result in significant costs, including increased capital expenditures and operating costs, and could further adversely impact our business and ability to market and deploy effectively the Licensed Plasma Pulse Technology in the areas effected by such regulations.
 

(b) | OSHA and Other Laws and Regulations.
----+-------------------------------------

 We are subject to the requirements of the federal Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSHA), and comparable state laws. The OSHA hazard communication standard, the EPA community right-to-know regulations under the Title III of CERCLA and similar state laws require that we organize and/or disclose information about hazardous materials used or produced in our operations. Also, pursuant to OSHA, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration has established a variety of standards related to workplace exposure to hazardous substances and employee health and safety.
 

(c) | Oil Pollution Act.
----+-------------------

 The Federal Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (OPA) and resulting regulations impose a variety of obligations on responsible parties related to the prevention of oil spills and liability for damages resulting from such spills in waters of the United States. The term "waters of the United States" has been broadly defined to include inland water bodies, including wetlands and intermittent streams. The OPA assigns joint and several strict liability to each responsible party for oil removal costs and a variety of public and private damages. We believe that we substantially comply with the Oil Pollution Act and related federal regulations.
 

(d) | Clean Water Act.
----+-----------------

 The Federal Water Pollution Control Act (Clean Water Act) and resulting regulations, which are primarily implemented through a system of permits, also govern the discharge of certain contaminants into waters of the United States. Sanctions for failure to comply strictly with the Clean Water Act are generally resolved by payment of fines and correction of any identified deficiencies. However, regulatory agencies could require us to cease construction or operation of certain facilities or to cease hauling wastewaters to facilities owned by others that are the source of water discharges. We believe that we substantially comply with the Clean Water Act and related federal and state regulations.
 
Competition
 
Competition in the oil industry is intense. We will compete with other technologies such as gas injection, polymer flooding, microbial injection and thermal methods. As a new technology, we will compete with many of the other technologies that have been proven to be economically successful in enhancing oil production in the United States. We also actively compete against other oil companies with substantial financial and other resources.
