Item 1                          Description of Business
 
Royale Energy Funds, Inc. (“Royale” or the “Company”) is an independent oil and natural gas producer incorporated under the laws of California.  Royale’s principal lines of business are the production and sale of natural gas, acquisition of oil and gas lease interests and proved reserves, drilling of both exploratory and development wells, and sales of fractional working interests in wells to be drilled by Royale.  Royale was incorporated in California in 1986 and began operations in 1988.   On December 31, 2017, Royale had 11 full time employees.
 
Merger with Matrix Oil Management Corporation
 
On March 7, 2018, Royale Energy Holdings, Inc. (“New Royale”), Royale, and Matrix Oil Management Corporation (“Matrix”) and its affiliates were notified by the California Secretary of State of the filing and acceptance of agreements of merger by the California Secretary of State, to complete the previously announced merger between the companies (the “Merger”).  In the Merger, Royale was merged into a newly formed subsidiary of New Royale, and Matrix was merged into a second newly formed subsidiary of New Royale pursuant to the Amended and Restated Agreement and Plan of Merger among Royale, New Royale, Royale Merger Sub, Inc., (“Royale Merger Sub”), Matrix Merger Sub, Inc., (“Matrix Merger Sub”) and Matrix (the “Merger Agreement”).  Additionally, in connection with the merger, all limited partnership interest of two limited partnership affiliates of Matrix (Matrix Permian Investments, LP, and Matrix Las Cienegas Limited Partnership), were exchanged for New Royale common stock using conversion ratios according to the relative values of each partnership.  All Class A limited partnership interests of another Matrix affiliate, Matrix Investments, LP (“Matrix Investments”) were exchanged for New Royale Common stock using conversion ratios according to the relative value of the Class A limited partnership interests, and $20,124,000 of Matrix Investments preferred limited partnership interests were converted into 2,012,400 shares of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock of New Royale.  Another Matrix affiliate, Matrix Oil Corporation (“Matrix Operator”), was acquired by New Royale by exchanging New Royale common stock for the outstanding common stock of Matrix Oil Corporation using a conversion ratio according to the relative value of the Matrix Oil Corporation common stock.  Matrix, Matrix Oil Corporation and the three limited partnership affiliates of Matrix called the “Matrix Entities.”
 
The Merger had been previously approved by the respective holders of all outstanding capital stock of Royale, Matrix, New Royale, Matrix Merger Sub and Royale Merger Sub on November 16, 2017, as previously reported in our Current Report on Form 8-K dated November 16, 2017.  The Merger and related transactions are described in detail in our Current Report on Form 8-K dated March 7, 2018, and in New Royale’s Current Report on Form 8-K dated March 7, 2018 (SEC File No. 000-55912).
 
As a result of the Merger, Royale became a wholly owned subsidiary of New Royale, and each outstanding share common stock of Royale at the time of the Merger was converted into one share of common stock of New Royale.  The common stock of New Royale is traded on the Over-The-Counter QB (OTCQB) Market System (symbol ROYL).
 
In this Annual Report, “Royale” and the “Company” refer to Royale Energy Funds, Inc., the California corporation formerly known as Royale Energy, Inc.  In connection with the Merger, the California Articles of Incorporation of Royale Energy, Inc., was amended to change the name of the Company to Royale Energy Funds, Inc.  This Annual Report describes the business and affairs of Royale, prior to the Merger, for the year ended December 31, 2017.
 
Royale Energy Funds, Inc.
 
Royale owns wells and leases located mainly in the Sacramento Basin and San Joaquin Basin in California as well as in Utah, Texas, Oklahoma, and Louisiana.  Royale usually sells a portion of the working interest in each well it drills or participates in to third party investors and retains a portion of the prospect for its own account.  Selling part of the working interest to others allows Royale to reduce its drilling risk by owning a diversified inventory of properties with less of its own funds invested in each drilling prospect, than if Royale owned all the working interest and paid all drilling and development costs of each prospect itself.  Royale generally sells working interests in its prospects to accredited investors in exempt securities offerings.  The prospects are bundled into multi-well investments, which permit the third party investors to diversify their investments by investing in several wells at once instead of investing in single well prospects.

During its fiscal year ended December 31, 2017, Royale continued to explore and develop natural gas properties with a concentration in California.  Additionally, we own proved developed producing and non-producing reserves of oil and natural gas in Utah, Texas, Oklahoma and Louisiana, as well as holding an overriding royalty interest in a discovery in Alaska.  In 2017, Royale drilled three natural gas wells in northern California, two of which were commercially productive, and participated in the drilling of an additional oil well in the Sansinena field in Los Angeles County, which was commercially productive.  Royale’s estimated total reserves were approximately 2.1 and 2.1 BCFE (billion cubic feet equivalent) at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.  According to the reserve reports furnished by Netherland, Sewell & Associates, Inc., Royale’s independent petroleum engineers, the undiscounted net reserve value of its proved developed and undeveloped reserves was approximately $3.4 million at December 31, 2017, based on the natural gas average PG&E city-gate spot price of $3.26 per MCF.  Netherland, Sewell & Associates, Inc. supplied reserve value estimates for the Company’s California, Texas, Oklahoma, Utah and Louisiana properties.  
 
Of course, net reserve value does not represent the fair market value of our reserves on that date, and we cannot be sure what return we will eventually receive on our reserves.  Net reserve value of proved developed and undeveloped reserves was calculated by subtracting estimated future development costs, future production costs and other operating expenses from estimated net future cash flows from our developed and undeveloped reserves.
 
Our standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows at December 31, 2017, was estimated to be $1,644,688.  This figure was calculated by subtracting our estimated future income tax expense from the net reserve value of proved developed and undeveloped reserves, and by further applying a 10% annual discount for estimated timing of cash flows.  A detailed calculation of our standardized measure of discounted future net cash flow is contained in Supplemental Information about Oil and Gas Producing Activities – Changes in Standardized Measure of Discounted Future Net Cash Flow from Proved Reserve Quantities, page F-24.
 
Royale reported a gain on turnkey drilling in connection with the drilling of wells on a “turnkey contract” basis in the amount of $1,487,824 and $460,210 for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
 
In addition to Royale’s own staff, Royale hires independent contractors to drill, test, complete and equip the wells that it drills.  Approximately 55.0% of Royale’s total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2017, came from sales of oil and natural gas from production of its wells in the amount of $554,235.  In 2016, this amount was $538,631, which represented 44.4% of Royale’s total revenues.
 
Plan of Business
 
Royale acquires interests in oil and natural gas reserves and sponsors private joint ventures.  Royale believes that its stockholders are better served by diversification of its investments among individual drilling prospects.  Through its sale of joint ventures, Royale can acquire interests and develop oil and natural gas properties with greater diversification of risk and still receive an interest in the revenues and reserves produced from these properties.  By selling some of its working interest in most projects, Royale decreases the amount of its investment in the projects and diversifies its oil and gas property holdings, to reduce the risk of concentrating a large amount of its capital in a few projects that may not be successful.
 
After acquiring the leases or lease participation, Royale drills or participates in the drilling of development and exploratory oil and natural gas wells on its property.  Royale pays its proportionate share of the actual cost of drilling, testing, and completing the project to the extent that it retains all or any portion of the working interest.
 
Royale also may sell fractional working interests in undeveloped wells to finance part of the drilling cost. A drilling contract that calls for a company to drill a well, for a fixed price, to a specified depth or geological formation is called a “turnkey contract.” When Royale sells fractional working interests in unproved property to raise capital to drill oil and natural gas wells, generally it agrees to drill these wells on a turnkey contract basis, so that the holders of the fractional interests prepay a fixed amount for the drilling and completion of a specified number of wells.  Under a turnkey contract, Royale may record a gain if total funds received to drill a well were more than the actual cost to drill those wells including costs incurred on behalf of the participants and costs incurred for its own account.
 
Although Royale’s operating agreements do not usually address whether investors have a right to participate in subsequent wells in the same area of interest as a proposed well, it is the Company’s policy to offer to investors in a successful well the right to participate in subsequent wells at the same percentage level as their working interest investment in the prior successful well.
 
Our policy for turnkey drilling agreements is to recognize a gain on turnkey drilling programs after our obligations have been fulfilled, and a gain is only recorded when funds received from participants are in excess of all costs Royale incurs during the drilling programs (e.g., lease acquisition, exploration and development costs), including costs incurred on behalf of participants and costs incurred for its own account.  See Note 1 to our Financial Statements, at page F-8.

Once drilling has commenced, it is generally completed within 10-30 days.  See Note 1 to Royale’s Financial Statements, at page F-8.  Royale maintains internal records of the expenditure of each investor’s funds for drilling projects.
 
Royale generally operates the wells it completes.  As operator, it receives fees set by industry standards from the owners of fractional interests in the wells and from expense reimbursements.  For the year ended December 31, 2017, Royale earned gross revenues from operation of the wells in the amount of $197,020 representing 19.6% of its total revenues for the year.  In 2016, the amount was $406,560, which represented about 33.5% of total revenues.  At December 31, 2017, Royale operated 24 natural gas wells in California. Royale also has non-operating interests in seven oil and gas wells in California, three natural gas wells in Utah, four oil and gas wells in Texas, two in Oklahoma and one in Louisiana.
 
Royale currently sells most of its California natural gas production through PG&E pipelines to independent customers on a monthly contract basis, while some gas is delivered through privately owned pipelines to independent customers. Since many users are willing to make such purchase arrangements, the loss of any one customer would not affect our overall sales operations.
 
All oil and natural gas properties are depleting assets in which production naturally decreases over time as the finite amount of existing reserves are produced and sold.  It is Royale’s business as an oil and natural gas exploration and production company to continually search for new development properties.  The Company’s success will ultimately depend on its ability to continue locating and developing new oil and natural gas resources.  Natural gas demand and the prices paid for gas are seasonal. In recent years, natural gas demand and prices in Northern California have fluctuated unpredictably throughout the year.
 
In 2017, Royale had one wholly owned subsidiary, Royale DWI Investors, LLC, a California limited liability company, to hold legal title to certain oil and gas working interests which Royale owns for the benefit of its working interest investors. 
 
Competition, Markets and Regulation
 
Competition
 
The exploration and production of oil and natural gas is an intensely competitive industry.  The sale of interests in oil and gas projects, like those Royale sells, is also very competitive.  Royale encounters competition from other oil and natural gas producers, as well as from other entities that invest in oil and gas for their own account or for others, and many of these companies are substantially larger than Royale.
Markets
 
Market factors affect the quantities of oil and natural gas production and the price Royale can obtain for the production from its oil and natural gas properties.  Such factors include: the extent of domestic production; the level of imports of foreign oil and natural gas; the general level of market demand on a regional, national and worldwide basis; domestic and foreign economic conditions that determine levels of industrial production; political events in foreign oil-producing regions; and variations in governmental regulations including environmental, energy conservation, and tax laws or the imposition of new regulatory requirements upon the oil and natural gas industry.
Regulation
 
Federal and state laws and regulations affect, to some degree, the production, transportation, and sale of oil and natural gas from Royale’s operations.  States in which Royale operates have statutory provisions regulating the production and sale of oil and natural gas, including provisions regarding deliverability.  These statutes, along with the regulations interpreting the statutes, generally are intended to prevent waste of oil and natural gas, and to protect correlative rights to produce oil and natural gas by assigning allowable rates of production to each well or proration unit.
 
The exploration, development, production and processing of oil and natural gas are subject to various federal and state laws and regulations to protect the environment.  Various federal and state agencies are considering, and some have adopted, other laws and regulations regarding environmental controls that could increase the cost of doing business.  These laws and regulations may require: the acquisition of permits by operators before drilling commences; the prohibition of drilling activities on certain lands lying within wilderness areas or where pollution arises; and the imposition of substantial liabilities for pollution resulting from drilling operations, particularly operations in offshore waters or on submerged lands.  The cost of oil and natural gas development and production also may increase because of the cost of compliance with such legislation and regulations, together with any penalties resulting from failing to comply with the legislation and regulations.  Ultimately, Royale may bear some of these costs.

Presently, Royale does not anticipate that compliance with federal, state and local environmental regulations will have a material adverse effect on capital expenditures, earnings, or its competitive position in the oil and natural gas industry; however, changes in the laws, rules or regulations, or the interpretation thereof, could have a materially adverse effect on Royale’s financial condition or results of operation.
 
Royale has filed quarterly, yearly and other reports with the Securities Exchange Commission, and New Royale will continue filing these reports as Royale’s successor in interest.  You may obtain a copy of any materials filed by Royale with the SEC at 100 F Street, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20549, by calling 1-800-SEC-0300.  The SEC also maintains an Internet site that contains reports, proxy and information statements, and other information regarding issuers that file electronically with the SEC at http://www.sec.gov.  Royale also provides access to its SEC reports and other public announcements on its website, http://www.royl.com.

Critical Accounting Policies
 
Revenue Recognition
 
Royale’s primary business is oil and gas production.  Natural gas flows from the wells into gathering line systems, which are equipped occasionally with compressor systems, which in turn flow into metered transportation and customer pipelines.  Monthly, price data and daily production are used to invoice customers for amounts due to Royale and other working interest owners.  Royale operates most of its own wells and receives industry standard operator fees.
 
Royale generally sells crude oil and natural gas under short-term agreements at prevailing market prices. Revenues are recognized when the products are delivered, which occurs when the customer has taken title and has assumed the risks and rewards of ownership, prices are fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured.
 
Revenues from the production of oil and natural gas properties in which the Royale has an interest with other producers are recognized on the basis of Royale’s net working interest. Differences between actual production and net working interest volumes are not significant.
 
Royale’s financial statements include its pro rata ownership of wells.  Royale usually sells a portion of the working interest in each well it drills or participates in to third party investors and retains a portion of the prospect for its own account.  Royale generally retains about a 50% working interest.  All results, successful or not, are included at its pro rata ownership amounts: revenue, expenses, assets, and liabilities as defined in FASB ASC 932-323-25 and 932-360.

Oil and Gas Property and Equipment
 
Depreciation, depletion and amortization, based on cost less estimated salvage value of the asset, are primarily determined under either the unit-of-production method or the straight-line method, which is based on estimated asset service life taking obsolescence into consideration.  Maintenance and repairs, including planned major maintenance, are expensed as incurred.  Major renewals and improvements are capitalized and the assets replaced are retired.
 
The project construction phase commences with the development of the detailed engineering design and ends when the constructed assets are ready for their intended use.  Interest costs, to the extent they are incurred to finance expenditures during the construction phase, are included in property, plant and equipment and are depreciated over the service life of the related assets.
 
Royale uses the “successful efforts” method to account for its exploration and production activities.  Under this method, Royale accumulates its proportionate share of costs on a well-by-well basis with certain exploratory expenditures and exploratory dry holes being expensed as incurred, and capitalizes expenditures for productive wells.  Royale amortizes the costs of productive wells under the unit-of-production method.
 
Royale carries, as an asset, exploratory well costs when the well has found a sufficient quantity of reserves to justify its completion as a producing well and where Royale is making sufficient progress assessing the reserves and the economic and operating viability of the project.  Exploratory well costs not meeting these criteria are charged to expense. Other exploratory expenditures, including geophysical costs and annual lease rentals, are expensed as incurred.
 
Acquisition costs of proved properties are amortized using a unit-of-production method, computed on the basis of total proved oil and gas reserves.
 
Capitalized exploratory drilling and development costs associated with productive depletable extractive properties are amortized using unit-of-production rates based on the amount of proved developed reserves of oil and gas that are estimated to be recoverable from existing facilities using current operating methods.  Under the unit-of-production method, oil and gas volumes are considered produced once they have been measured through meters at custody transfer or sales transaction points at the outlet valve on the lease or field storage tank.
 
Production costs are expensed as incurred. Production involves lifting the oil and gas to the surface and gathering, treating, field processing and field storage of the oil and gas. The production function normally terminates at the outlet valve on the lease or field production storage tank. Production costs are those incurred to operate and maintain Royale’s wells and related equipment and facilities. They become part of the cost of oil and gas produced. These costs, sometimes referred to as lifting costs, include such items as labor costs to operate the wells and related equipment; repair and maintenance costs on the wells and equipment; materials, supplies and energy costs required to operate the wells and related equipment; and administrative expenses related to the production activity. Proved oil and gas properties held and used by Royale are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable.
 
Royale estimates the future undiscounted cash flows of the affected properties to judge the recoverability of carrying amounts. Cash flows used in impairment evaluations are developed using annually updated evaluation assumptions for crude oil commodity prices.  Annual volumes are based on field production profiles, which are also updated annually. Prices for natural gas and other products are based on assumptions developed annually for evaluation purposes.
 
Impairment analyses are generally based on proved reserves.  An asset group would be impaired if the undiscounted cash flows were less than its carrying value.  Impairments are measured by the amount the carrying value exceeds fair value. During 2017 and 2016, impairment losses of $289,775 and $2,071,849, respectively, were recorded on various capitalized lease and land costs where the carrying value exceeded the fair value or where the leases were no longer viable.
 
Significant unproved properties are assessed for impairment individually, and valuation allowances against the capitalized costs are recorded based on the estimated economic chance of success and the length of time that Royale expects to hold the properties.  The valuation allowances are reviewed at least annually.
 
Upon the sale or retirement of a complete field of a proved property, Royale eliminates the cost from its books, and the resultant gain or loss is recorded to Royale’s Statement of Operations.  Upon the sale of an entire interest in an unproved property where the property has been assessed for impairment individually, a gain or loss is recognized in Royale’s Statement of Operations.  If a partial interest in an unproved property is sold, any funds received are accounted for as a recovery of the cost in the interest retained with any excess funds recognized as a gain. Should Royale’s turnkey drilling agreements include unproved property, total drilling costs incurred to satisfy its obligations are recovered by the total funds received under the agreements.  Any excess funds are recorded as a Gain on Turnkey Drilling Programs, and any costs not recovered are capitalized and accounted for under the “successful efforts” method.

Table of Contents

Royale sponsors turnkey drilling agreement arrangements in unproved properties as a pooling of assets in a joint undertaking, whereby proceeds from participants are reported as Deferred Drilling Obligations, and then reduced as costs to complete its obligations are incurred with any excess booked against its property account to reduce any basis in its own interest.  Gains on Turnkey Drilling Programs represent funds received from turnkey drilling participants in excess of all costs Royale incurs during the drilling programs (e.g., lease acquisition, exploration and development costs), including costs incurred on behalf of participants and costs incurred for its own account; and are recognized only upon making this determination after Royale’s obligations have been fulfilled.
 
The contracts require the participants pay Royale the full contract price upon execution of the agreement.   Royale completes the drilling activities typically between 10 and 30 days after drilling begins.  The participant retains an undivided or proportional beneficial interest in the property, and is also responsible for its proportionate share of operating costs.  Royale retains legal title to the lease.  The participants purchase a working interest directly in the well bore.
 
In these working interest arrangements, the participants are responsible for sharing in the risk of development, but also sharing in a proportional interest in rights to revenues and proportional liability for the cost of operations after drilling is completed.
 
Since the participant’s interest in the prospect is limited to the well, and not the lease, the investor does not have a legal right to participate in additional wells drilled within the same lease.  However, it is the Company’s policy to offer to participants in a successful well the right to participate in subsequent wells at the same percentage level as their working interest investment in the prior successful well with similar turnkey drilling agreement terms.
 
A certain portion of the turnkey drilling participant’s funds received are non-refundable.    The company records a liability for all funds invested as deferred drilling obligations until each individual well is complete.  Occasionally, drilling is delayed for various reasons such as weather, permitting, drilling rig availability and/or contractual obligations.  At December 31, 2017 and 2016, Royale had deferred drilling obligations of $5,891,898 and $7,894,001 respectively.
 
If Royale is unable to drill the wells, and a suitable replacement well is not found, Royale would retain the non-refundable portion of the contract and return the remaining funds to the participant.  Included in cash and cash equivalents are amounts for use in completion of turnkey drilling programs in progress. 
 
Losses on properties sold are recognized when incurred or when the properties are held for sale and the fair value of the properties is less than the carrying value.
 
Estimates
 
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.  The most significant estimates pertain to proved oil, plant products and gas reserve volumes and the future development costs.  Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Deferred Income Taxes
 
Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects, calculated at currently enacted rates, of (a) future deductible/taxable amounts attributable to events that have been recognized on a cumulative basis in the financial statements or income tax returns, and (b) operating loss and tax credit carry forwards.  All available evidence, both positive and negative, must be considered to determine whether, based on the weight of that evidence, a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets is needed.  The Company uses information about the Company’s financial position and its results of operations for the current and preceding years.
 
The Company must use its judgment in considering the relative impact of negative and positive evidence. The weight given to the potential effect of negative and positive evidence is commensurate with the extent to which it can be objectively verified. The more negative evidence that exists, the more positive evidence is necessary and the more difficult it is to support a conclusion that a valuation allowance is not needed for some portion or all of the deferred tax asset. A cumulative loss in recent years is a significant piece of negative evidence that is difficult to overcome.
 
Future realization of a tax benefit sometimes will be expected for a portion, but not all, of a deferred tax asset, and the dividing line between the two portions may be unclear. In those circumstances, application of judgment based on a careful assessment of all available evidence is required to determine the portion of a deferred tax asset for which it is more likely than not a tax benefit will not be realized.

Going Concern
 
 At December 31, 2017, the Company has an accumulated deficit of $48,205,690, a working capital deficiency of $7,752,695 and a stockholders’ deficit of $6,940,241. As a result, our financial statements include a “going concern qualification” reflecting substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern. See Note 1 to our audited financial statements.  We have merged with Matrix to increase efficiency and reduce costs to both companies, thereby allowing a return to positive cash flow.  We are exploring commitments to provide additional financing, but there is no guarantee that we will be able to secure additional financing on acceptable terms, or at all, if needed to fully fund our 2018 drilling budget and to support future operations.
Results of Operations for the Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2017, as Compared to the Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2016
 
 For the year ended December 31, 2017, we recorded a net loss of $2,427,169, compared to net loss of $4,144,462 during 2016.  Total revenues from operations in 2017 were $
1,007,379, a decrease of $206,460, or 17.0% from the total revenues of $1,213,839 in 2016, due to lower lease operating overhead receipts due mainly to the sale of our Victor Ranch field interests in 2016.  Total expenses for operations in 2017 were $4,836,429, a decrease of $1,669,287, or 25.7%, from the total expenses of $6,505,716 in 2016, mainly due to the impairment loss in 2016 due to termination of our remaining Alaska leases.
 
In 2017, revenues from oil and gas production increased by 2.9% to $554,235 from $538,631 in 2016. This increase was due to higher natural gas commodity prices received in 2017.  The net sales volume of natural gas for the year ended December 31, 2017, was approximately 190,111 MCF with an average price of $2.89 per MCF, versus 232,539 MCF with an average price of $2.31 per MCF for 2016.  This represents a decrease in net sales volume of 42,428 MCF or 18.2%.  This decrease in production volume was mainly due to the natural declines in our wells, and the sale of our Victor Ranch field interests which had an effective date of September 1, 2016.  Additionally in 2017, our operated wells were temporarily offline in November and December 2017 due to new pipeline equipment requirements by Pacific Gas & Electric.  The net sales volume for oil and condensate (natural gas liquids) production was approximately 102 barrels with an average price of $46.07 per barrel for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to 193 barrels at an average price of $12.11 per barrel, which was lower due to the inclusion of oil byproducts in the barrel count, for the year in 2016.  This represents a decrease in net sales volume of 91 barrels, or 47.2%, also due to the natural declines on existing oil and condensate wells.  Northern and central California accounted for approximately 91% of the Company’s successful natural gas production in 2017.
 
Oil and natural gas lease operating expenses decreased by $158,604, or 26.7% to $435,637 for the year ended December 31, 2017, from $594,241 for the year in 2016.  This decrease was due to the sale of our Victor Ranch field interests in 2016 which reduced overhead, pumping and compression costs during 2017.  When measuring lease operating costs on a production or lifting cost basis, in 2017, the $435,637 equates to a $2.28 per MCFE lifting cost versus a $2.54 per MCFE lifting cost in 2016, a 10.2% decrease, due to lower production volumes in 2017.
 
At December 31, 2017, Royale had a deferred drilling obligation of $5,891,898.  During 2017, we disposed of $
5,934,604 of obligations relating to 2016, 
upon completing the drilling of three developmental natural gas wells and participating in the drilling of an additional developmental oil well, while incurring expenses of $4,446,780.  This resulted in a gain of $1,487,824.  During 2016, we disposed of $4,502,026 of obligations relating to 2015, upon completing the drilling of three wells, two exploratory and one developmental, while incurring expenses of $4,041,816, resulting in a gain of $460,210.    Royale expects to dispose of approximately $2.3 million of its deferred drilling obligation in the first six months of 2018 with $2.1 million of its deferred drilling obligation disposed of by the end of 2018.
 
During the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, we recorded gains of $73,325 and $341,751, respectively, on the settlement of accounts payable.  During the years in 2017 and 2016, we also recorded write downs of $16,375 and $19,151, respectively, on certain oil and gas well equipment that were either no longer useable or written down to their current market value.  During 2016, we recorded a gain of $284,419 on the sale of interests in our Victor Ranch field wells and leases.  During 2016, we also recorded a gain of $198,975 on the sale of our Company owned office building located in El Cajon, California.  In 2016, we recorded a loss on disposal of assets of $23,781, on fixed assets that were no longer viable. 
 
Impairment losses of $289,775 and $2,071,849 were recorded in 2017 and 2016, respectively.  We periodically review our proved properties for impairment on a field-by-field basis and charge impairments of value to the expense.  In 2017, the impairments were on various capitalized leases that were no longer viable.  In 2016, $2,025,546 of 
the impairment loss was due to termination of our remaining Alaska leases which were not renewed due to nonpayment of the delay rental payments.  Also in 2016, $46,303 of the impairment loss was due to capitalized lease and land costs on a Texas lease that was no longer viable.

Bad debt expense for 2017 and 2016 were $164,145 and $0, respectively.  The expenses in 2017 arose from identified uncollectable receivables relating to our oil and natural gas properties either plugged and abandoned or scheduled for plugging and abandonment and our year-end oil and natural gas reserve values.  We periodically review our accounts receivable from working interest owners to determine whether collection of any of these charges appears doubtful.  By contract, the Company may not collect some charges from its Direct Working Interest owners for certain wells that ceased production or had been sold during the year, to the extent that these charges exceed production revenue.
 
The aggregate of supervisory fees and other income was $453,144 for the year ended December 31, 2017, a decrease of $222,064 or 32.9% from $675,208 during the year in 2016.  This decrease was due to lower operations and drilling overhead and pipeline fees due to lower production volumes during the period in 2017 mainly due to the sale of our Victor Ranch field interests in 2016.  Supervisory fees are charged in accordance with the Council for Petroleum Accountants Societies (COPAS) policy for reimbursement of expenses associated with the joint accounting for billing, revenue disbursement, and payment of taxes and royalties.  These charges are reevaluated each year and adjusted up or down as deemed appropriate by a published report to the industry by Ernst & Young, LLP, Certified Public Accountants.  Supervisory fees decreased $209,540 or 51.5%, to $197,020 in 2017 from $406,560 in 2016.
 
Depreciation, depletion and amortization expense decreased to $116,017 from $283,874 a decrease of $167,857 or 59.1% for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to 2016.  The depletion rate is calculated using production as a percentage of reserves.  This decrease in depreciation expense was due to a lower depletion rate as reserve volumes were higher at the end of 2017 and a lower asset base due to the sale of our Victor Ranch field interests and our office building in 2016.
 
 General and administrative expenses decreased by $608,872 or 23.3%, to $2,005,630 for the year ended December 31, 2017, from $2,614,502 for the year in 2016.  This decrease was primarily due to reductions in outside consulting services in 2017.  Legal and accounting expense increased to $1,540,190 for the year, compared to $627,577 for 2016, a $912,613 or 145.4% increase.  The increase in 2017 was mainly due to legal and accounting expenses related to the Matrix merger and the legal settlement discussed previously in Item 3.
 
Marketing expense for the year ended December 31, 2017, decreased $25,862 or 8.8%, to $
268,660, compared to $294,522 for the year in 2016.  Marketing expense varies from period to period according to the number of marketing events attended by personnel and their associated costs.
 
During 2017, interest expense increased to $159,268 from $114,159 in 2016, a $45,109 or 39.5% increase.  This increase resulted from interest accrued on its convertible promissory notes issued in August 2016.  Further details concerning Royale’s notes payable can be found in Capital Resources and Liquidity, below.
 
In 2017 and 2016, we did not have an income tax expense due to the use of a percentage depletion carryover valuation allowance created from the current and past operations resulting in an effective tax rate less than the normal federal rate of 34% plus the relevant state rates (mostly California, 8.8%).  
 
Capital Resources and Liquidity
 
 At December 31, 2017, Royale had current assets totaling $4,358,082 and current liabilities totaling $12,110,777, a $7,752,695 working capital deficit.  We had cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2017 of $3,338,693 compared to $4,994,598 at December 31, 2016.
 
Ordinarily, we fund our operations and cash needs from our available credit and cash flows generated from operations.  We believe that consummation of the Merger will enable the combined companies to meet their liquidity demands.  However, because the Merger results in different liquidity needs than Royale had before the Merger, there is doubt as to the ability to meet liquidity demands through cash flow or ongoing operations.  In that event, the Company will seek alternative capital sources through additional sales of equity or debt securities, or the sale of property.
 
At December 31, 2017, our other receivables, which consist of receivables from direct working interest investors and industry partners, totaled $764,015, compared to $676,647 at December 31, 2016, a $87,368 or 12.9% increase.  This increase was mainly due to receivables from investors for workovers on a non-operated well.  Royale’s revenue receivable at the end of 2017 was $106,007, a decrease of $197,521 or 65.1%, compared to $303,528 at the end of 2016, due to lower oil and gas production volumes when compared to year end 2016 due to our operated wells being offline in November and December 2017.  At December 31, 2017, our accounts payable and accrued expenses totaled 
$4,638,879, an increase of $2,169,634 or 87.9% over the accounts payable at the end of 2016 of $2,469,245, mainly due to year end drilling activities, merger related trade accounts payable and non-operated workover costs.

In July 2016, we received a cash investment of $1,580,000 from two investors to purchase convertible promissory notes with principal amounts of $1,280,000 and $300,000, with a conversion price of $0.40 per share, with warrants to purchase one share of common stock for every three shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the notes.  The notes originally matured on August 2, 2017, one year from the date of issuance, and carried a 10% interest rate, with a default rate of 25%.  Shortly before completion of the Merger, the $300,000 note was converted into 750,000 shares of Royale common stock, and Royale agreed to a cash settlement with the holder of the $1,280,000 note for $1,900,000.  See Item 3, Defaults upon Senior Securities.
 
In December of 2013, Royale purchased an office building for $2,000,000, of which $500,000 was paid in cash on the date of purchase, and $1,500,000 was borrowed from AmericanWest Bank, with a note secured by the property being purchased.  The note carried an interest rate of 5.75% until paid in full. In February 2016, Royale entered into a purchase and sale agreement for the sale of the office building for $2.5 million.  In June 2016, the sale of the building was completed which resulted in a gain of $198,975 and the related principal and interest payments were paid in full.
 
We have not engaged in hedging activities or use derivative instruments to manage market risks.

Operating Activities.  For the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, cash used by operating activities totaled $1,199,439 and $3,271,631, respectively.  This $2,072,192 or 63.3% decrease in cash used was mainly due to higher accounts payable and accrued expenses mainly related to both drilling activities at year end 2017 and merger related costs during 2017.   During the year in 2016, executive management and directors received 2,335,461 compensatory shares of the Company’s common stock valued at $645,986.
Investing Activities.  Net cash used by investing activities totaled $456,466 for the year ended December 31, 2017.  Net cash provided by investing activities totaled $3,208,378 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016.  This $3,664,844 difference in net cash can be attributed to the sale of our office building and the proceeds received of approximately $936,000, along with $350,000 received from the sale of our interests in the Victor Ranch leases  Additionally, our turnkey drilling expenditures were higher in 2017, where we drilled three natural gas wells and participated in the drilling of an additional oil well, while in 2016 we drilled three natural gas wells. 
Financing Activities.  No net cash was provided or used in financing activities during the year in 2017.  Net cash provided by financing activities totaled $1,294,032 in 2016.  During the year in 2016, $1,580,000 was provided by the Cash Advances from Pending Transactions, mentioned earlier and $1,446,853 was used for principal payments on the Company’s note payable in the sale of its office building.  Also in 2016, we issued 3,027,070 restricted common shares and 789,658 additional warrants and received cash proceeds of $1,160,885 under private placement stock sales.  In 2016, cash used from financing activities were added to working capital and used for ordinary operating expenses.   
Changes in Reserve Estimates
 
During 2017, our overall proved developed and undeveloped reserves increased by 4% and our previously estimated proved developed and undeveloped reserve quantities were revised upward by approximately .31 million cubic feet of natural gas.  This upward revision reflected higher than previously estimated proved producing and non-producing natural gas reserves at eight California wells and one Utah well.  See Supplemental Information about Oil and Gas Producing Activities (Unaudited), page F-23. 
 
During 2016, our overall proved developed and undeveloped reserves decreased by 19% and our previously estimated proved developed and undeveloped reserve quantities were revised upward by approximately .07 million cubic feet of natural gas.  This upward revision reflected higher than previously estimated proved producing and non-producing natural gas reserves at eight California wells and one Louisiana well.  See Supplemental Information about Oil and Gas Producing Activities (Unaudited), page F-23.
