Item 1. | Business

General
We are an independent crude oil and natural gas company with properties in the North, South and East regions of the United States. The North region consists of properties north of Kansas and west of the Mississippi River and includes North Dakota Bakken, Montana Bakken, and the Red River units. The South region includes all properties south of Nebraska and west of the Mississippi River including various plays in the SCOOP (South Central Oklahoma Oil Province) and STACK (Sooner Trend Anadarko Canadian Kingfisher) areas of Oklahoma. The East region is primarily comprised of undeveloped leasehold acreage east of the Mississippi River with no significant drilling or production operations. 
We were formed in 1967 to explore for, develop and produce crude oil and natural gas properties. Through the 1980s, our activities and growth remained focused primarily in Oklahoma. In the 1980s, we expanded our activity into the North region. The North region comprised approximately 59% of our crude oil and natural gas production and approximately 69% of our crude oil and natural gas revenues for the year ended December 31, 2017. The Company’s principal producing properties in the North region are located in the Bakken field of North Dakota and Montana. Approximately 50% of our estimated proved reserves as of December 31, 2017 are located in the North region. In recent years, we have significantly expanded our operations in our South region with our increased activity in the SCOOP and STACK plays. The South region comprised approximately 41% of our crude oil and natural gas production, 31% of our crude oil and natural gas revenues, and 50% of our estimated proved reserves as of and for the year ended December 31, 2017.
We focus our exploration activities in large new or developing crude oil and natural gas plays that provide us the opportunity to acquire undeveloped acreage positions for future drilling operations. We have been successful in targeting large repeatable resource plays where three dimensional seismic, horizontal drilling, geosteering technologies, advanced completion technologies (e.g., fracture stimulation) and enhanced recovery technologies allow us to develop and produce crude oil and natural gas reserves from unconventional formations. As a result of these efforts, we have grown substantially through the drill bit. 
As of December 31, 2017, our estimated proved reserves were 1,331 MMBoe, with estimated proved developed reserves of 602 MMBoe, or 45% of our total estimated proved reserves. Crude oil represents approximately 48% of our estimated proved reserves as of December 31, 2017. The standardized measure of our discounted future net cash flows totaled approximately $10.5 billion at December 31, 2017.
For 2017, we generated crude oil and natural gas revenues of $2.98 billion and operating cash flows of $2.08 billion. Crude oil accounted for approximately 57% of our total production and approximately 78% of our crude oil and natural gas revenues for 2017. Production averaged 242,637 Boe per day for 2017, a 12% increase compared to average production of 216,912 Boe per day for 2016. Average daily production for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 increased 37% to 286,985 Boe per day compared to 209,861 Boe per day for the quarter ended December 31, 2016 due to increased drilling and completion activities.
The table below summarizes our total estimated proved reserves, PV-10 (non-GAAP) and net producing wells as of December 31, 2017, average daily production for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 and the reserve-to-production index in our principal operating areas. The PV-10 values shown below are not intended to represent the fair market value of our crude oil and natural gas properties. There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of crude oil and natural gas reserves. See Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors and “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates” in Part II, Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of this report for further discussion of uncertainties inherent in the reserve estimates.

(1) | PV-10 is a non-GAAP financial measure and generally differs from Standardized Measure, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, because it does not include the effects of income taxes on future net revenues of approximately $1.4 billion. Neither PV-10 nor Standardized Measure represents an estimate of the fair market value of our crude oil and natural gas properties. We and others in the crude oil and natural gas industry use PV-10 as a measure to compare the relative size and value of proved reserves held by companies without regard to the specific income tax characteristics of such entities. See Part II, Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Non-GAAP Financial Measures for further discussion.


(2) | The Annualized Reserve/Production Index is the number of years that estimated proved reserves would last assuming current production continued at the same rate. This index is calculated by dividing annualized fourth quarter 2017 production into estimated proved reserve volumes as of December 31, 2017.

Business Environment and Outlook
Our industry has been significantly impacted by lower commodity prices in recent years. The downward pressure on prices experienced in 2015 and 2016 showed signs of easing in 2017. Commodity prices remained volatile during the year, but generally increased on average in 2017 relative to 2016 in response to improving domestic and global supply and demand fundamentals and other factors. Crude oil prices in particular showed significant signs of improvement in late 2017 and early 2018, with West Texas Intermediate crude oil benchmark prices reaching a three-year high of $66 per barrel in January 2018. Crude oil prices remain volatile and it is uncertain whether the increase in market prices experienced in recent months will be sustained. 
Continental marked its 50th anniversary in the oil and gas business in 2017. Our leadership team has significant experience with operating in challenging commodity price environments. With our portfolio of high quality assets, we are well-positioned to manage the ongoing challenges and price volatility facing our industry. 
For 2018, our primary business strategies will focus on: 

• | Balancing strong production growth with free cash flow generation;


• | Enhancing cash flows and return on capital employed through improvements in operating efficiencies, technical innovations, and optimized completion methods;


• | Continuing to exercise disciplined capital spending to maintain financial flexibility and ample liquidity; and


• | Improving debt metrics by further reducing outstanding debt using available operating cash flows or proceeds from asset dispositions or joint development arrangements.

Based on an expectation for higher operating cash flows in 2018 in response to improvement in crude oil prices in late 2017 and early 2018, we have increased our planned non-acquisition capital spending for 2018 to $2.3 billion compared to $2.0 billion spent in 2017, with approximately 78% of our 2018 drilling and completion budget focusing on oil-weighted areas in 
2

the North Dakota Bakken and SCOOP Springer plays. We expect to fund our budgeted spending using cash flows from operations. We may adjust our pace of drilling and development as 2018 market conditions evolve. 
For 2018, we plan to operate an average of approximately 21 drilling rigs and 10 completion crews for the year. We expect to spend approximately 52% of our 2018 capital expenditures budget on drilling and completion activities in North Dakota Bakken, 20% in SCOOP, and 14% in STACK. The remaining 14% of our 2018 budget will target other capital expenditures such as leasing and renewals, work-overs, and facilities. See the section below titled Summary of Crude Oil and Natural Gas Properties and Projects for further discussion of our 2018 plans. 
Our Business Strategy
Despite ongoing volatility and uncertainty in commodity prices, our business strategy continues to be focused on increasing shareholder value by finding and developing crude oil and natural gas reserves at costs that provide attractive rates of return. The principal elements of this strategy include:
Growing and sustaining a premier portfolio of assets focused on balancing production growth with free cash flow generation. We hold a portfolio of leasehold acreage, drilling opportunities and uncompleted wells in certain premier U.S. resource plays with varying access to crude oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquids. We pursue opportunities to develop our existing properties as well as explore for new resource plays where significant reserves may be economically developed. Our capital programs are designed to allocate investments to projects that provide opportunities to deliver strong production growth while generating cash flows in excess of operating and capital requirements, to work down our large inventory of uncompleted wells, to convert our undeveloped acreage to acreage held by production, and to improve hydrocarbon recoveries and rates of return on capital employed. While our operations have historically focused on the exploration and development of crude oil, we also allocate significant capital to natural gas areas that provide attractive rates of return. 
Enhance cash flows and return on capital employed through costs reductions, operating efficiencies, technical innovations, and optimized completions. We continue to manage through the current commodity price environment by focusing on improving operating efficiencies and reducing costs. Our key operating areas are characterized by large acreage positions in select unconventional resource plays with multiple stacked geologic formations that provide repeatable drilling opportunities and resource potential. We operate a significant portion of our wells and leasehold acreage and believe the concentration of our operated assets allows us to leverage our technical expertise and manage the development of our properties to achieve cost reductions through operating efficiencies and economies of scale. 
We continued to achieve efficiency gains in various aspects of our business in 2017, including additional reductions in spud-to-total depth drilling times and average days to drill horizontal laterals, which has led to reductions in drilling costs in our core areas. In addition to lowering our drilling costs, we also work to enhance cash flows through the use of optimized completion technologies that help improve recoveries and rates of return. These efforts have had a positive impact on the efficiency of our capital deployed in recent years, resulting in significant improvement in the quantity of reserves found and developed per dollar invested. 
Maintaining financial flexibility and a strong balance sheet. Maintaining a strong balance sheet, ample liquidity, and financial flexibility are key components of our business strategy. In 2017, we reduced our total debt by $226 million, or 3%, from $6.58 billion at year-end 2016 to $6.35 billion at year-end 2017. We are actively targeting further debt reduction using available cash flows from operations or proceeds from potential sales of non-strategic assets and joint development opportunities and will continue our focus on preserving financial flexibility and ample liquidity as we manage the risks facing our industry. 
Focusing on organic growth through disciplined capital investments. Although we consider various growth opportunities, including property acquisitions, our primary focus is on organic growth through leasing and drilling in our core areas where we can exploit our extensive inventory of repeatable drilling opportunities to achieve attractive rates of return. From January 1, 2015 through December 31, 2017, our proved reserve additions through extensions and discoveries were 743 MMBoe compared with insignificant proved reserve acquisitions during that same period.
Our Business Strengths
We have a number of strengths we believe will help us successfully execute our business strategy, including the following:
Large Acreage Inventory. We held approximately 598,400 net undeveloped acres and 1.19 million net developed acres under lease as of December 31, 2017 concentrated in certain premier U.S. resource plays. We are among the largest leaseholders in the Bakken, SCOOP and STACK plays. Being an early entrant in these plays has allowed us to capture significant acreage positions in core parts of the plays.

Expertise with Horizontal Drilling and Optimized Completion Methods. We have substantial experience with horizontal drilling and optimized completion methods and continue to be among industry leaders in the use of new drilling and completion technologies. We continue to improve drilling and completion efficiencies through the use of multi-well pad drilling in our operating areas. Further, we are among industry leaders in drilling long lateral lengths. We have also been among industry leaders in testing and utilizing optimized completion technologies involving various combinations of fluid types, proppant types and volumes, and stimulation stage spacing to determine optimal methods for improving recoveries and rates of return. We continually refine our drilling and completion techniques in an effort to deliver improved results across our properties. 
Control Operations Over a Substantial Portion of Our Assets and Investments. As of December 31, 2017, we operated properties comprising 89% of our total proved reserves. By controlling a significant portion of our operations, we are able to more effectively manage the cost and timing of exploration and development of our properties, including the drilling and completion methods used.
Experienced Management Team. Our senior management team has extensive expertise in the oil and gas industry. Our Chief Executive Officer, Harold G. Hamm, began his career in the oil and gas industry in 1967. Our 9 senior officers have an average of 38 years of oil and gas industry experience.
Financial Position and Liquidity. Currently we have a revolving credit facility with lender commitments totaling $2.75 billion that matures in May 2019. We had approximately $2.65 billion of available borrowing capacity under our credit facility at January 31, 2018 after considering outstanding borrowings and letters of credit. 
Our credit facility is unsecured and does not have a borrowing base requirement that is subject to periodic redetermination based on changes in commodity prices and proved reserves. Additionally, downgrades or other negative rating actions with respect to our credit rating do not trigger a reduction in our current credit facility commitments, nor do such actions trigger a security requirement or change in covenants. Downgrades of our credit rating will, however, trigger increases in our credit facility’s interest rates and commitment fees paid on unused borrowing availability under certain circumstances.

Crude Oil and Natural Gas Operations
Proved Reserves
Proved reserves are those quantities of crude oil and natural gas, which, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from a given date forward, from known reservoirs, and under existing economic conditions, operating methods, and government regulations prior to the time at which contracts providing the right to operate expire, unless evidence indicates renewal is reasonably certain. In connection with the estimation of proved reserves, the term “reasonable certainty” implies a high degree of confidence that the quantities of crude oil and/or natural gas actually recovered will equal or exceed the estimate. To achieve reasonable certainty, our internal reserve engineers and Ryder Scott Company, L.P (“Ryder Scott”), our independent reserve engineers, employed technologies that have been demonstrated to yield results with consistency and repeatability. The technologies and economic data used in the estimation of our proved reserves include, but are not limited to, well logs, geologic maps including isopach and structure maps, analogy and statistical analysis, and available downhole, production, seismic, and well test data.
The following table sets forth estimated proved crude oil and natural gas reserves information by reserve category as of December 31, 2017. The standardized measure of our discounted future net cash flows totaled approximately $10.5 billion at December 31, 2017. Our reserve estimates as of December 31, 2017 are based primarily on a reserve report prepared by Ryder Scott. In preparing its report, Ryder Scott evaluated properties representing approximately 96% of our PV-10 and 96% of our total proved reserves as of December 31, 2017. Our internal technical staff evaluated the remaining properties. A copy of Ryder Scott’s summary report is included as an exhibit to this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
Our estimated proved reserves and related future net revenues, Standardized Measure and PV-10 at December 31, 2017 were determined using the 12-month unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month commodity prices for the period of January 2017 through December 2017, without giving effect to derivative transactions, and were held constant throughout the lives of the properties. These prices were $51.34 per Bbl for crude oil and $2.98 per MMBtu for natural gas ($47.03 per Bbl for crude oil and $3.00 per Mcf for natural gas adjusted for location and quality differentials).

Revisions of previous estimates. Revisions represent changes in previous reserve estimates, either upward or downward, resulting from new information normally obtained from development drilling and production history or resulting from a change in economic factors, such as commodity prices and differentials, operating costs, or development costs. 
Given the significant volatility in commodity prices in recent years, and given the uncertainty regarding the timing, magnitude and duration of any price recovery, maintaining a strong balance sheet, ample liquidity, and financial flexibility has become an increasingly important component of our long-term business strategy. In light of our strategy to preserve financial flexibility and minimize the incurrence of new debt, we maintained a disciplined spending approach in 2017 and continued to refine our capital program to focus on areas that provide the greatest opportunities to achieve operating efficiencies and cost reductions, to convert undeveloped acreage to acreage held by production, and to improve hydrocarbon recoveries, cash flows and rates of return using optimized completions. As part of this effort, we shifted a portion of our 2017 spending away from the SCOOP and Bakken plays to areas in the emerging STACK play that offered more advantageous opportunities and rates of return in the 2017 commodity price environment. This shift in strategy coupled with our increased emphasis on balancing capital spending with cash flows altered the timing and extent of our previous development plans in certain areas and resulted in the removal of 41 MMBo and 290 Bcf (totaling 89 MMBoe) of PUD reserves no longer scheduled to be developed within five years from the date of initial booking. These removals do not represent the elimination of recoverable hydrocarbons physically in place. In some instances the removed reserves may be developed in the future in the event of further improvement in commodity prices and an expansion of our capital expenditure budget.
Commodity prices increased on average in 2017 relative to 2016 in response to improving domestic and global supply and demand fundamentals and other factors. The 12-month average first-day-of-the-month price for crude oil increased 20% from $42.75 per Bbl for 2016 to $51.34 per Bbl for 2017, while the 12-month average first-day-of-the-month price for natural gas increased 20% from $2.49 per MMBtu for 2016 to $2.98 per MMBtu for 2017. These changes increased the economic lives of 
6

certain producing properties and caused certain previously uneconomic projects to become economic, which had a favorable impact on the Company’s proved reserve estimates, resulting in upward revisions of 29 MMBo and 78 Bcf (totaling 42 MMBoe) in 2017. 
Additionally, changes in anticipated production performance on certain properties resulted in 59 MMBo of downward revisions to crude oil reserves and 173 Bcf of upward revisions to natural gas reserves (netting to 30 MMBoe of downward revisions) in 2017. Further, changes in ownership interests, operating costs, and other factors during the year resulted in 7 MMBo of downward revisions to crude oil reserves and 11 Bcf of upward revisions to natural gas reserves (netting to 5 MMBoe of downward revisions) in 2017.
Extensions, discoveries and other additions. These are additions to our proved reserves that result from (i) extension of the proved acreage of previously discovered reservoirs through additional drilling in periods subsequent to discovery and (ii) discovery of new fields with proved reserves or of new reservoirs of proved reserves in old fields. Extensions, discoveries and other additions for each of the three years reflected in the table above were primarily due to increases in proved reserves associated with our successful drilling and completion activities in the Bakken, SCOOP and STACK areas. Proved reserve additions from our drilling activities in the Bakken totaled 148 MMBoe, 73 MMBoe and 96 MMBoe for 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively, while reserve additions in SCOOP totaled 53 MMBoe, 97 MMBoe and 93 MMBoe for 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Additionally, extensions and discoveries were impacted by successful drilling and completion results in the STACK play, resulting in proved reserve additions of 39 MMBoe, 79 MMBoe and 57 MMBoe in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. See the subsequent section titled Summary of Crude Oil and Natural Gas Properties and Projects for a discussion of our 2017 drilling activities. We expect a significant portion of future reserve additions will continue to come from our major development projects in the Bakken, SCOOP and STACK areas. 
Sales of minerals in place. These are reductions to proved reserves resulting from the disposition of properties during a period. See Part II, Item 8. Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—Note 14. Property Dispositions for further discussion of notable dispositions. We may continue to seek opportunities to sell non-strategic properties if and when we have the ability to dispose of such assets at favorable terms.
Purchases of minerals in place. These are additions to proved reserves resulting from the acquisition of properties during a period. We have had no significant acquisitions in the past three years. However, we may participate as a buyer of properties when and if we have the ability to increase our position in strategic plays at favorable terms.
Proved Undeveloped Reserves
All of our PUD reserves at December 31, 2017 are located in the Bakken, SCOOP, and STACK plays, our most active development areas, with those plays comprising 43%, 45%, and 12%, respectively, of our total PUD reserves at year-end 2017. The following table provides information regarding changes in our PUD reserves for the year ended December 31, 2017. Our PUD reserves at December 31, 2017 include 70 MMBoe of reserves associated with wells where drilling has occurred but the wells have not been completed or are completed but not producing ("DUC wells"). Our DUC wells are classified as PUD reserves when relatively major expenditures are required to complete and produce from the wells. 
 | Crude Oil(MBbls) | | Natural Gas(MMcf) | | Total(MBoe)

Proved undeveloped reserves at December 31, 2017 | 322,242 | | | 2,441,120 | | 729,094 | 

Revisions of previous estimates. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we removed 165 gross (123 net) PUD locations, which resulted in the removal of 41 MMBo and 290 Bcf (totaling 89 MMBoe) of PUD reserves, of which 31 MMBo and 66 Bcf (totaling 42 MMBoe) was related to our Bakken properties and 10 MMBo and 218 Bcf (totaling 46 MMBoe) was related to our SCOOP properties. These removals were due to the aforementioned refinement of our drilling program to place emphasis on areas that provide the greatest opportunities to achieve operating efficiencies and cost reductions, to convert undeveloped acreage to acreage held by production, and to improve hydrocarbon recoveries, cash flows and rates of return using optimized completions. These and other aforementioned factors altered the timing and extent of our previous development plans in certain 
7

areas and resulted in the removal of PUD reserves no longer scheduled to be developed within five years of the date of initial booking. 
Additionally, increases in average crude oil and natural gas prices in 2017 caused certain previously uneconomic projects to become economic, which resulted in upward PUD reserve revisions of 8 MMBo and 22 Bcf (totaling 11 MMBoe) in 2017. Further, changes in anticipated production performance on producing properties having offsetting PUD locations resulted in 43 MMBo of downward revisions to crude oil PUD reserves and 134 Bcf of upward revisions to natural gas PUD reserves (netting to 20 MMBoe of downward revisions) in 2017. Finally, changes in ownership interests, operating costs, and other factors during the year resulted in 3 MMBo of upward revisions to crude oil PUD reserves and 3 Bcf of upward revisions to natural gas PUD reserves (totaling 3 MMBoe of upward revisions) in 2017.
Extensions and discoveries. Extensions and discoveries were primarily due to increases in PUD reserves associated with our successful drilling activity in the Bakken, SCOOP and STACK areas. PUD reserve additions in the Bakken totaled 86 MMBo and 216 Bcf (totaling 122 MMBoe) in 2017, while SCOOP PUD reserve additions totaled 13 MMBo and 193 Bcf (totaling 45 MMBoe), and STACK PUD reserve additions totaled 2 MMBo and 83 Bcf (totaling 16 MMBoe). See the subsequent section titled Summary of Crude Oil and Natural Gas Properties and Projects for a discussion of our 2017 drilling activities in these areas. 
Conversion to proved developed reserves. In 2017, we developed approximately 17% of our PUD locations and 14% of our PUD reserves booked as of December 31, 2016 through the drilling and completion of 300 gross (146 net) development wells at a capital cost of approximately $762 million incurred in 2017. PUD conversions in North Dakota Bakken totaled 49 MMBo and 106 Bcf (totaling 66 MMBoe) in 2017, while STACK PUD conversions totaled 4 MMBo and 130 Bcf (totaling 26 MMBoe) and SCOOP PUD conversions totaled 2 MMBo and 81 Bcf (totaling 15 MMBoe).
Given the continued volatility in crude oil prices during the year, we chose not to significantly advance the development of our oil-weighted properties in the SCOOP play in 2017, instead choosing to defer development capital in that play to future periods when prices become more stable and sustainable. Additionally, we deferred certain well completion activities in North Dakota Bakken in 2017 and our inventory of DUC wells that built up in that play in 2016 was not reduced to the extent originally planned for the year. These factors adversely impacted our conversion of PUD reserves to proved developed reserves in 2017. 
At December 31, 2016, we had 95 MMBoe of PUD reserves associated with 279 gross (145 net) operated and non-operated DUC locations at that date. A portion of those locations, representing 18 MMBoe of PUD reserves, were not completed in 2017 and are not reflected as having been converted to proved developed reserves during the year and continue to be reflected as PUD locations at December 31, 2017. If the year-end 2016 DUC wells had been fully completed and converted to proved developed locations in 2017, our 2017 PUD reserve conversion rate of 14% would have been 17%. 
Our inventory of DUC wells classified as PUDs total 278 gross (105 net) operated and non-operated locations at December 31, 2017, representing 70 MMBoe, or 10%, of our PUD reserves. The following table summarizes 2017 activity associated with DUC wells that are classified as PUD reserves. 
 | DUC Wells
 | Gross | | Net | | PUD Reserves(MBoe)

Development plans. We have acquired substantial leasehold positions in the Bakken, SCOOP and STACK plays. Our drilling programs to date in those areas have focused on proving our undeveloped leasehold acreage through strategic drilling, thereby increasing the amount of leasehold acreage in the secondary term of the lease with no further drilling obligations (i.e., categorized as held by production) and resulting in a reduced amount of leasehold acreage in the primary term of the lease. While we may opportunistically drill strategic exploratory wells, a substantial portion of our future capital expenditures will be focused on developing our PUD locations, including our drilled but not completed locations. The costs to drill our uncompleted wells were incurred prior to December 31, 2017 and only the remaining completion costs are included in future development plans. 
8

Estimated future development costs relating to the development of PUD reserves are projected to be approximately $1.0 billion in 2018 (44% of total capital budget), $1.5 billion in 2019, $1.7 billion in 2020, $1.5 billion in 2021, and $0.7 billion in 2022. These capital expenditure projections are reflective of the current commodity price environment and have been established based on an expectation of drilling and completion costs, available cash flows, and borrowing capacity. Development of our existing PUD reserves at December 31, 2017, including those associated with DUC wells, is expected to occur within five years of the date of initial booking of the PUDs. PUD reserves not expected to be developed within five years of initial booking because of changes in business strategy, depressed commodity prices, or for other reasons have been removed from our reserves at December 31, 2017. We had no PUD reserves at December 31, 2017 that remain undeveloped beyond five years from the date of initial booking.

Proved Reserve, Standardized Measure, and PV-10 Sensitivities
Our year-end 2017 proved reserve, Standardized Measure, and PV-10 estimates were prepared using 2017 average first-day-of-the-month prices of $51.34 per Bbl for crude oil and $2.98 per MMBtu for natural gas ($47.03 per Bbl for crude oil and $3.00 per Mcf for natural gas adjusted for location and quality differentials). Actual future prices may be materially higher or lower than those used in our year-end estimates. 
Provided below are sensitivities illustrating the potential impact on our estimated proved reserves, Standardized Measure, and PV-10 at December 31, 2017 under different commodity price scenarios for crude oil and natural gas. In these sensitivities, all factors other than the commodity price assumption have been held constant for each well. These sensitivities demonstrate the impact that changing commodity prices may have on estimated proved reserves, Standardized Measure, and PV-10 and there is no assurance these outcomes will be realized.
The crude oil price sensitivities provided below show the impact on proved reserves, Standardized Measure, and PV-10 under various crude oil price scenarios, with natural gas prices being held constant at the 2017 average first-day-of-the-month price of $2.98 per MMBtu.

As of December 31, 2017, there were 475 gross (179 net) operated and non-operated wells that have been spud and are in the process of drilling, completing or waiting on completion. 
Summary of Crude Oil and Natural Gas Properties and Projects
In the following discussion, we review our budgeted number of wells and capital expenditures for 2018 in our key operating areas. Our 2018 capital budget has been set based on an expectation of available cash flows in order to minimize the incurrence of new debt. If cash flows are materially impacted by a decline in commodity prices, we have the ability to reduce our capital expenditures or utilize the availability of our revolving credit facility if needed to fund our operations. Conversely, higher cash flows resulting from an increase in commodity prices could result in increased capital expenditures.
The following table provides information regarding well counts and 2018 budgeted capital expenditures by operating area.

North Region 
Our properties in the North region represented 50% of our total proved reserves as of December 31, 2017 and 61% of our average daily Boe production for the fourth quarter of 2017. Our average daily production from such properties was 175,563 Boe per day for the fourth quarter of 2017, an increase of 48% from the comparable 2016 period due to increased drilling and completion activities in 2017. Our principal producing properties in the North region are primarily located in the Bakken field.
Bakken Field
The Bakken field of North Dakota and Montana is one of the premier crude oil resource plays in the United States. We are a leading producer, leasehold owner and operator in the Bakken. As of December 31, 2017, we controlled one of the largest leasehold positions in the Bakken with approximately 1.3 million gross (801,500 net) acres under lease. 
Our total Bakken production averaged 165,598 Boe per day for the fourth quarter of 2017, up 58% from the 2016 fourth quarter. For the year ended December 31, 2017, our average daily Bakken production increased 12% over 2016. We increased our drilling and well completion activities in the Bakken in 2017, particularly in the second half of the year, in response to stabilization and improvement in crude oil prices. In 2017, we participated in the drilling and completion of 370 gross (145 net) wells in the Bakken compared to 192 gross (38 net) wells completed in 2016. Our 2017 activities in the Bakken focused on development of de-risked, higher rate-of-return areas in core parts of North Dakota and the testing of various optimized completion methods aimed at improving crude oil recoveries and rates of return. 
Our Bakken properties represented 48% of our total proved reserves at December 31, 2017 and 58% of our average daily Boe production for the 2017 fourth quarter. Our total proved Bakken field reserves as of December 31, 2017 were 636 MMBoe, an increase of 7% compared to December 31, 2016 due to reserves added from our drilling program, continued improvement in recoveries driven by advances in optimized completion designs, and upward reserve revisions prompted by higher commodity prices in 2017. Our inventory of proved undeveloped drilling locations in the Bakken totaled 1,252 gross (656 net) wells as of December 31, 2017.
In response to the stabilization and improvement in crude oil prices in late 2017 and early 2018 we plan to increase our activities in North Dakota Bakken in 2018 relative to 2017. In 2018, we plan to invest approximately $1.19 billion in the play, which includes $413 million for the completion and initiation of production on operated Bakken wells that were drilled but not completed as of year-end 2017. We plan to operate, on average, six rigs in North Dakota Bakken throughout 2018, an increase from four rigs as of December 31, 2017. Additionally, we plan to use, on average, six to seven well completion crews in North Dakota Bakken throughout 2018, consistent with our current activity levels. Our 2018 drilling and completion activities will focus on core parts of North Dakota Bakken that provide opportunities to improve capital efficiency, reduce finding and development costs, and improve recoveries and rates of return. 
South Region
Our properties in the South region represented 50% of our total proved reserves as of December 31, 2017 and 39% of our average daily Boe production for the fourth quarter of 2017. For the 2017 fourth quarter, our average daily production from such properties was 111,422 Boe per day, an increase of 22% from the comparable period in 2016. Our principal producing properties in the South region are located in the SCOOP and STACK areas of Oklahoma. 
SCOOP
The SCOOP play currently extends across Garvin, Grady, Stephens, Carter, McClain and Love counties in Oklahoma and contains crude oil and condensate-rich fairways as delineated by numerous industry wells. We are a leading producer, leasehold owner and operator in the SCOOP play. As of December 31, 2017, we controlled one of the largest leasehold positions in SCOOP with approximately 491,100 gross (276,900 net) acres under lease. 
Our SCOOP leasehold has the potential to contain hydrocarbons from a variety of conventional and unconventional reservoirs overlying and underlying the Woodford formation in Oklahoma. In recent years, our drilling activities have resulted in the vertical expansion of our SCOOP Woodford position with discoveries of the SCOOP Springer and Sycamore formations, which are located directly above the Woodford formation. Located in the heart of our SCOOP acreage, our Springer and Sycamore positions supplement our Woodford leasehold and expand our resource potential and inventory in the play. 
We engaged in limited drilling and completion activities in SCOOP in 2017, choosing instead to allocate capital to other areas that offered more advantageous opportunities and rates of return. Our 2017 activities in SCOOP focused on continued vertical and horizontal expansion of the productive extent and hydrocarbon content of the play and working to determine optimum well spacing, well patterns, and completion methods for future development. 
14

SCOOP represented 37% of our total proved reserves as of December 31, 2017 and 22% of our average daily Boe production for the fourth quarter of 2017. Production in SCOOP averaged 62,242 Boe per day during the fourth quarter of 2017, down 2% compared to the 2016 fourth quarter. For the year ended December 31, 2017, average daily production in SCOOP decreased 7% compared to 2016, reflecting natural declines in production and limited drilling and completion activities in 2017. We participated in the drilling and completion of 77 gross (20 net) wells in SCOOP during 2017 compared to 72 gross (28 net) wells in 2016. Proved reserves in SCOOP totaled 492 MMBoe as of December 31, 2017, an increase of 4% compared to December 31, 2016 due to reserves added from our drilling program, continued improvement in recoveries driven by advances in optimized completion designs, and upward reserve revisions prompted by higher commodity prices in 2017. Our inventory of proved undeveloped drilling locations in SCOOP totaled 336 gross (230 net) wells as of December 31, 2017.
In 2018, we plan to invest approximately $465 million to drill, complete and initiate production on 160 gross (44 net) operated and non-operated wells in the SCOOP play. We plan to average approximately seven operated rigs and one completion crew in SCOOP throughout 2018, an increase from five rigs as of December 31, 2017. Our 2018 drilling program will continue to focus on expanding the known productive extent of the SCOOP Woodford, Springer and Sycamore formations, while focusing on areas that provide opportunities for converting undeveloped acreage to acreage held by production, increasing capital efficiency, reducing finding and development costs, and improving rates of return. 
STACK
STACK is a significant resource play located in the Anadarko Basin of Oklahoma characterized by stacked geologic formations with major targets in the Meramec, Osage and Woodford formations. As of December 31, 2017, we controlled one of the largest leasehold positions in STACK with approximately 389,400 gross (212,400 net) acres under lease. A significant portion of our STACK acreage is located in over-pressured portions of Blaine, Dewey and Custer counties of Oklahoma where we believe the reservoirs are typically thicker and deliver superior production rates relative to normal-pressured areas of the STACK petroleum system. 
Building on early success achieved from our initial STACK drilling activities in mid-2015, we significantly increased our leasing and drilling activities in the play in 2016 and 2017. Our 2017 activities focused on pilot density drilling to expand our understanding of the productive extent and hydrocarbon content of the play and to help determine optimum well spacing, well patterns, and completion methods for future development. 
Through our 2016 and 2017 activities in STACK, we have successfully tested productive zones in the play, applied optimized completions to improve recoveries, demonstrated repeatability of results, reduced drilling times, reduced well costs, and de-risked a sizeable portion of our acreage in the play. Due to the success of these efforts, STACK has become another significant growth platform for us and is expected to be an important contributor to our long-term growth. To facilitate future development of our STACK acreage, we continue to increase our water recycling and distribution capabilities in the play. Additionally, we continue to increase our access to gathering and takeaway capacity to handle crude oil and natural gas production expected from future development of the play. 
Our STACK properties represented 13% of our total proved reserves as of December 31, 2017 and 17% of our average daily Boe production for the fourth quarter of 2017. Production in STACK increased to an average rate of 47,914 Boe per day during the fourth quarter of 2017, up 96% over the 2016 fourth quarter due to additional drilling and completion activity resulting from our drilling program. For the year ended December 31, 2017, average daily production in STACK grew 113% over 2016. We participated in the drilling and completion of 160 gross (49 net) wells in STACK during 2017 compared to 97 gross (26 net) wells in 2016. Proved reserves increased 4% year-over-year to 167 MMBoe as of December 31, 2017 due to reserves added from our drilling program, continued improvement in recoveries driven by advances in optimized completion designs, and upward reserve revisions prompted by higher commodity prices in 2017. Our inventory of proved undeveloped drilling locations in STACK totaled 195 gross (90 net) wells as of December 31, 2017.
In 2018, we plan to invest approximately $317 million to drill, complete and initiate production on 180 gross (37 net) operated and non-operated wells in STACK. We plan to average approximately eight operated rigs in STACK throughout 2018 compared to nine rigs as of December 31, 2017. Additionally, we plan to use, on average, three completion crews in STACK throughout 2018 compared to five crews as of December 31, 2017. Our 2018 activities will focus on delineating and de-risking our acreage, expanding the known productive extent of the play through the completion of new density test projects, monitoring production from optimized completions, and continued refinement of our geologic and economic models in the area.

Title to Properties
As is customary in the crude oil and natural gas industry, upon initiation of acquiring oil and gas leases covering fee mineral interests on undeveloped lands which do not have associated proved reserves, contract landmen conduct a title examination of courthouse records and production databases to determine fee mineral ownership and availability. Title, lease forms, and final terms are reviewed and approved by Company landmen prior to consummation. 
For acquisitions from third parties, whether lands are producing crude oil and natural gas or non-producing, Company and contract landmen perform title examinations at applicable courthouses, obtain physical well site inspections, and examine the seller’s internal records (land, legal, operational, production, environmental, well, marketing and accounting) upon execution of a mutually acceptable purchase and sale agreement. We may also procure an acquisition title opinion from outside legal counsel on higher value properties. 
17

Prior to the commencement of drilling operations, we procure an original title opinion, or supplement an existing title opinion, from outside legal counsel and perform curative work to satisfy requirements pertaining to material title defects, if any. We will not approve commencement of drilling operations until we have cured material title defects pertaining to the Company’s interest. 
We have procured title opinions and cured material defects as to Company interests on substantially all of our producing properties and believe we have at least defensible title to our producing properties in accordance with standards generally accepted in the crude oil and natural gas industry. Our crude oil and natural gas properties are subject to customary royalty and leasehold burdens which do not materially interfere with the use of the properties or affect our carrying value of such properties.
Marketing and Major Customers
Most of our operated crude oil production is sold to either crude oil refining companies or midstream marketing companies at major market centers. Other operated production not sold at major market centers is sold at the lease. In the Bakken, SCOOP and STACK areas we have significant volumes of production directly connected to pipeline gathering systems, with the remaining balance of production being primarily transported by truck. Additionally in the Bakken, a portion of our production is sold to counterparties that are connected to rail delivery systems. Where directly marketed crude oil is transported by truck, it is delivered to a point on a pipeline system for further delivery, or is delivered directly to a refinery. Where crude oil is sold at the lease the sale is complete at that point. Our share of crude oil production from non-operated properties is marketed at the discretion of the operators. 
The majority of our operated natural gas production is sold at our lease locations to midstream purchasers under term contracts. These contracts include multi-year term agreements, many with acreage dedication. Some of our contracts allow us the flexibility to accept, as partial payment for our sale of gas in the field, an “in-kind” volume of processed gas at the tailgate of the midstream purchaser’s processing plant. When we elect to do so, we transport this processed gas to a downstream market where it is sold. Sales at these downstream markets are mostly under monthly interruptible packaged volume deals, short term seasonal packages, and long term multi-year contracts. We continue to develop relationships and have the potential to enter into additional contracts with end-use customers, including utilities, industrial users, and liquefied natural gas exporters, for sale of gas we elect to take in-kind in lieu of cash for our leasehold sales. Our share of natural gas production from non-operated properties is generally marketed at the discretion of the operators. 
Our marketing of crude oil and natural gas can be affected by factors beyond our control, the effects of which cannot be accurately predicted. For a description of some of these factors, see Part I, Item 1A. Risk factors—Our business depends on crude oil and natural gas transportation, processing and refining facilities, most of which are owned by third parties.
For the year ended December 31, 2017, sales to BP p.l.c. and affiliates and Phillips 66 and affiliates accounted for approximately 11% and 11%, respectively, of our total crude oil and natural gas revenues. No other purchaser accounted for more than 10% of our total crude oil and natural gas revenues for 2017. The loss of any single purchaser will not have a material adverse effect on our operations, as crude oil and natural gas are fungible products with well-established markets and numerous purchasers in various regions.
Competition
We operate in a highly competitive environment for acquiring properties, marketing crude oil and natural gas and securing trained personnel. Also, there is substantial competition for capital available for investment in the crude oil and natural gas industry. Our competitors vary within the regions in which we operate, and some of our competitors may possess and employ financial, technical and personnel resources greater than ours, which can be particularly important in the areas in which we operate. Those companies may be able to pay more for productive crude oil and natural gas properties and exploratory prospects and to evaluate, bid for and purchase a greater number of properties and prospects than our financial or personnel resources permit. Our ability to acquire additional prospects and to find and develop reserves in the future will depend on our ability to evaluate and select suitable properties and to consummate transactions economically in a highly competitive environment. In addition, as a result of the significant decrease in commodity prices in recent years, the number of providers of materials and services has decreased in the regions where we operate. As a result, the likelihood of experiencing competition and shortages of materials and services may be further increased in connection with any period of commodity price recovery.

Regulation of the Crude Oil and Natural Gas Industry
Our operations are conducted onshore almost entirely in the United States. The crude oil and natural gas industry in the United States is subject to various types of regulation at the federal, state and local levels. Laws, rules, regulations, policies, and interpretations affecting our industry have been and are pervasive with the imposition of new or increased requirements on us and other industry participants. These laws, regulations and other requirements often carry substantial penalties for failure to comply and may have a significant effect on the exploration, development, production or sale of crude oil and natural gas and increase the cost of doing business and affect profitability. In addition, because public policy changes affecting the crude oil and natural gas industry are commonplace and because laws, rules and regulations may be enacted, amended or reinterpreted, we are unable to predict the future cost or impact of complying with such laws, rules and regulations. We do not expect any future legislative or regulatory initiatives will affect us in a manner materially different than they would affect our similarly situated competitors.
The following is a discussion of significant laws, rules and regulations, as amended from time to time, that may affect us in the areas in which we operate.
Regulation of sales and transportation of crude oil and natural gas liquids
Sales of crude oil and natural gas liquids (“NGLs”) or condensate in the United States are not currently subject to price controls and are made at negotiated prices. Nevertheless, the U.S. Congress could enact price controls in the future. Beginning in the 1970s, the United States regulated the exportation of petroleum and petroleum products, which restricted the markets for these commodities and affected sales prices. However, in December 2015 the U.S. Congress passed a legislative bill eliminating the export restrictions beginning in January 2016. 
With regard to our physical sales of crude oil and any derivative instruments relating to crude oil, we are required to comply with anti-market manipulation laws and related regulations enforced by the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (“CFTC”). See the discussion below of “Other Federal Laws and Regulations Affecting Our Industry—FTC and CFTC Market Manipulation Rules.” If we violate the anti-market manipulation laws and regulations, we could be subject to substantial penalties and related third-party damage claims by, among others, sellers, royalty owners and taxing authorities.
Our sales of crude oil are affected by the availability, terms and costs of transportation. The transportation of crude oil and NGLs, as well as other liquid products, is subject to rate and access regulation. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (“FERC”) regulates interstate crude oil and NGL pipeline transportation rates under the Interstate Commerce Act and the Energy Policy Act of 1992 and the rules and regulations promulgated under those laws. In general, pipeline rates must be just and reasonable and must not be unduly discriminatory or confer any undue preference upon any shipper. Oil and other liquid pipeline rates are often cost-based, although some pipeline charges today are based on historical rates adjusted for inflation and other factors, and other charges may result from settlement rates agreed to by all shippers or market-based rates, which are permitted in certain circumstances. FERC or interested persons may challenge existing or changed rates or services. Intrastate crude oil and NGL pipeline transportation rates may be subject to regulation by state regulatory commissions. The basis for intrastate pipeline regulation, and the degree of regulatory oversight and scrutiny given to intrastate crude oil pipeline rates, varies from state to state. As the interstate and intrastate transportation rates we pay are generally applicable to all comparable shippers, the regulation of intrastate transportation rates will not affect us in a way that materially differs from the effect on our similarly situated competitors.
Further, interstate pipelines and intrastate common carrier pipelines must provide service on an equitable basis and offer service to all similarly situated shippers requesting service on the same terms and under the same rates. When such pipelines operate at full capacity we are subject to proration provisions, which are described in the pipelines’ published tariffs. We generally will have access to crude oil pipeline transportation services to the same extent as our similarly situated competitors.
We transport operated crude oil production from our North region to market centers using primarily a combination of pipeline and rail transportation facilities owned and operated by third parties. Approximately 6% of such production was shipped by rail in December 2017, with the remainder being shipped primarily by pipeline. The U.S. Department of Transportation’s (“U.S. DOT”) Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (“PHMSA”) establishes safety regulations relating to transportation of crude oil by rail and pipeline. Third party rail operators are subject to the regulatory jurisdiction of the Surface Transportation Board of the U.S. DOT, the Federal Railroad Administration (“FRA”), the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration ("OSHA"), and other federal regulatory agencies. Additionally, various state and local agencies have jurisdiction over disposal of hazardous waste and regulate movement of hazardous materials if not preempted by federal law.
In 2008, the U.S. Congress passed the Rail Safety and Improvement Act, which implemented regulations governing different areas related to railroad safety. Subsequently, the FRA and PHMSA have taken several actions related to the transport of crude 
19

oil, including but not limited to: issuing an order requiring testing, classification and handling of crude oil as a hazardous material; requiring expanded hazardous material route planning for railroads to avoid populated and other sensitive areas; issuing safety advisories, alerts, emergency orders and regulatory updates; conducting special unannounced inspections; issuing rules to enhance tank car standards for certain trains carrying crude oil and ethanol; and reaching agreement with the railroad industry on a series of voluntary actions it can take to improve safety. In May 2014 the U.S. DOT issued an order requiring all railroads operating trains containing large amounts of Bakken crude oil to notify state emergency response commissions about the operation of such trains through their states. The order requires each railroad operating trains containing more than 1,000,000 gallons of Bakken crude oil, or approximately 35 tank cars, in a particular state to provide the state with notification regarding the volumes of Bakken crude oil being transported, frequencies of anticipated train traffic and the route through which Bakken crude oil will be transported.  Also in May 2014, the FRA and PHMSA issued a safety advisory to the rail industry strongly recommending the use of tank cars with the highest level of integrity in their fleet when transporting Bakken crude oil. In May 2015, PHMSA published a final rule which requires, among other things, enhanced tank car standards for new and existing tank cars, a classification and testing program for crude oil, and a requirement that older DOT-111 tank cars be retrofitted to comply with new tank car design standards in accordance with a specified timeline beginning as early as January 1, 2018. However, in December 2017 PHMSA announced it would initiate a rulemaking to rescind the May 2015 rule's requirements regarding electronically controlled pneumatic brakes. In August 2016, PHMSA released a final rule mandating a phase-out schedule for all DOT-111 tank cars used to transport Class 3 flammable liquids between 2018 and 2029. Separately, in July 2016 PHMSA proposed a new rule to expand the applicability of comprehensive oil spill response plans so that any railroad transporting a single train carrying 20 or more loaded tank cars of liquid petroleum oil in a continuous block or a single train carrying 35 or more loaded tank cars of liquid petroleum oil throughout the train must have a current, comprehensive, written plan. Issuance of the final rule remains pending.
We do not own or operate rail transportation facilities or rail cars; however, regulations that impact the testing or rail transportation of crude oil could increase our costs of doing business and limit our ability to transport and sell our crude oil at market centers throughout the United States, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. We do not expect such regulations will affect us in a materially different way than similarly situated competitors.
In June 2016 the Protecting Our Infrastructure of Pipelines and Enhancing Safety Act (“PIPES Act”) was signed into law. The PIPES Act extends PHMSA’s safety authority through 2019 and includes provisions on advancing the safe transportation of energy commodities and other hazardous materials. The PIPES Act includes provisions aimed at increasing inspection requirements for certain underwater crude oil pipelines; improving protection of coastal areas by designating them as environmentally sensitive to pipeline failures; setting minimum safety standards for underground natural gas storage facilities, and promoting better use of data and technology to prevent damage and improve safety of pipeline systems, among other things. PHMSA published a final rule in January 2017 expanding integrity management and reporting requirements for certain hazardous liquid pipelines and gathering lines; however, implementation of the final rule was stayed following the change in U.S. Presidential Administrations. The final rule is expected to be published in the federal register during the first quarter of 2018. We do not expect such regulations will affect us in a materially different way than similarly situated competitors.
Pipeline regulations exist at the state level as well. In December 2014 the North Dakota Industrial Commission (“NDIC”) introduced rules designed to reduce the potential flammability of crude oil produced from the Bakken petroleum system (the Bakken, Three Forks, and Sanish Pool formations) before it is loaded and transported on railcars. The rules became effective in April 2015 and outline a series of standards for pressure and temperature for production facilities to follow in order to separate certain liquids and gases from the crude oil prior to transport. These rules do not affect us in a way that materially differs from our similarly situated competitors. 
Regulation of sales and transportation of natural gas
In 1989, the U.S. Congress enacted the Natural Gas Wellhead Decontrol Act, which removed all remaining price and non-price controls affecting wellhead sales of natural gas. The FERC, which has the authority under the Natural Gas Act (“NGA”) to regulate prices, terms, and conditions for the sale of natural gas for resale in interstate commerce, has issued blanket authorizations for all gas resellers subject to FERC regulation, except interstate pipelines, to resell natural gas at market prices. However, either the U.S. Congress or the FERC (with respect to the resale of gas in interstate commerce) could re-impose price controls in the future. The U.S. Department of Energy (“U.S. DOE”) regulates the terms and conditions for the exportation and importation of natural gas (including liquefied natural gas or “LNG”). U.S. law provides for very limited regulation of exports to and imports from any country that has entered into a Free Trade Agreement (“FTA”) with the United States providing for national treatment of trade in natural gas; however, the U.S. DOE’s regulation of imports and exports from and to countries without an FTA is more comprehensive. The FERC also regulates the construction and operation of import and export facilities, including LNG terminals. Regulation of imports and exports and related facilities may materially affect natural gas markets and sales prices.
20

The FERC regulates interstate natural gas transportation rates and service conditions under the NGA and the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978 (“NGPA”), which affects the marketing of natural gas we produce, as well as revenues we receive for sales of our natural gas. The FERC has endeavored to make natural gas transportation more accessible to natural gas buyers and sellers on an open and non-discriminatory basis. The FERC has stated open access policies are necessary to improve the competitive structure of the natural gas pipeline industry and to create a regulatory framework to put natural gas sellers into more direct contractual relations with natural gas buyers by, among other things, unbundling the sale of natural gas from the sale of transportation and storage services. The FERC has issued a series of orders to implement its open access policies. As a result, the interstate pipelines’ traditional role as wholesalers of natural gas has been eliminated and replaced by a structure under which pipelines provide transportation and storage services on an open access basis to others who buy and sell natural gas. Although the FERC’s orders do not directly regulate natural gas producers, they are intended to foster increased competition within all phases of the natural gas industry. We cannot provide any assurance the pro-competitive regulatory approach established by the FERC will continue. However, we do not believe any action taken by FERC will affect us in a materially different way than similarly situated natural gas producers.
With regard to our physical sales of natural gas and derivative instruments relating to natural gas, we are required to observe anti-market manipulation laws and related regulations enforced by the FERC and the CFTC. See the discussion below of “Other Federal Laws and Regulations Affecting Our Industry—FTC and CFTC Market Manipulation Rules.” If we violate the anti-market manipulation laws and regulations, we could be subject to substantial penalties and related third-party damage claims by, among others, sellers, royalty owners and taxing authorities. In addition, pursuant to various FERC orders, we may be required to submit reports to the FERC for some of our operations. See the discussion below of “Other Federal Laws and Regulations Affecting Our Industry—FERC Market Transparency and Reporting Rules.”
Gathering service, which occurs upstream of jurisdictional transmission services, is generally regulated by the states. Although its policies on gathering systems have varied in the past, the FERC has reclassified certain jurisdictional transmission facilities as non-jurisdictional gathering facilities, which has the potential to increase our costs of moving natural gas to point of sale locations. State regulation of natural gas gathering facilities generally includes various safety, environmental, and in some circumstances, equitable take requirements. Natural gas gathering may receive greater regulatory scrutiny at both the state and federal levels in the future. We cannot predict what effect, if any, such changes may have on us, but the natural gas industry could be required to incur additional capital expenditures and increased costs depending on future legislative and regulatory changes, including changes in the interpretation of existing requirements or programs to implement those requirements. We do not believe we would be affected by any such regulatory changes in a materially different way than our similarly situated competitors.
Intrastate natural gas transportation service is also subject to regulation by state regulatory agencies. Like the regulation of interstate transportation rates, the regulation of intrastate transportation rates affects the marketing of natural gas we produce, as well as the revenues we receive for sales of our natural gas. The basis for intrastate regulation of natural gas transportation and the degree of regulatory oversight and scrutiny given to intrastate natural gas pipeline rates and services varies from state to state. Insofar as such regulation within a particular state will generally affect all intrastate natural gas shippers on a comparable basis, the regulation of intrastate natural gas transportation in states in which we operate and ship natural gas on an intrastate basis will not affect us in a way that materially differs from our similarly situated competitors.
Regulation of production
The production of crude oil and natural gas is regulated by a wide range of federal, state and local statutes, rules, orders and regulations, which require, among other matters, permits for drilling operations, drilling bonds and reports concerning operations. Each of the states where we own and operate properties have regulations governing conservation, including provisions for the unitization or pooling of crude oil and natural gas properties, the establishment of maximum allowable rates of production from crude oil and natural gas wells, the regulation of well spacing, the plugging and abandonment of wells, and limitations or prohibitions on the venting or flaring of natural gas. These regulations limit the amount of crude oil and natural gas we can produce from our wells and the number of wells and locations we can drill, although we can and do apply for exceptions to such regulations or to have reductions in well spacing. Moreover, each state generally imposes a production, severance or excise tax on the production and sale of crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids within its jurisdiction.
The failure to comply with these rules and regulations can result in substantial penalties. Our similarly situated competitors are generally subject to the same statutes, regulatory requirements and restrictions.
21

Other federal laws and regulations affecting our industry
Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. In July 2010, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the “Dodd-Frank Act”) was enacted into law. The Dodd-Frank Act established federal oversight and regulation of the over-the-counter derivatives market and entities, such as us, that participate in that market. The Dodd-Frank Act requires the CFTC, the SEC, and other regulators to establish rules and regulations to implement the new legislation. Although the CFTC has issued final regulations to implement significant aspects of the legislation, others remain to be finalized or implemented and it is not possible at this time to predict when this will be accomplished. Additionally, certain aspects of the Dodd-Frank Act were repealed by the U.S. Congress in 2017. 
In November 2013 and December 2016, the CFTC proposed rules establishing position limits with respect to certain futures and option contracts and equivalent swaps, subject to exceptions for certain bona fide hedging. As these new position limit rules are not yet final, the impact of these provisions on us is uncertain at this time.
Pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, absent an exception, mandatory clearing is now required for all market participants. The CFTC has designated certain interest rate swaps and credit default swaps for mandatory clearing. The CFTC has not yet required the clearing of any other classes of swaps, including physical commodity swaps, and the trade execution requirement does not apply to swaps not subject to a clearing mandate. Although we expect to qualify for the end-user exception from the clearing requirement for our swaps entered into to hedge our commercial risks, the application of the mandatory clearing requirements to other market participants, such as swap dealers, along with changes to the markets for swaps as a result of the trade execution requirement, may change the cost and availability of the swaps we use for hedging. If any of our swaps do not qualify for the commercial end-user exception, or if the cost of entering into uncleared swaps becomes prohibitive, we may be required to clear such transactions or execute them on a derivatives contract market or swap execution facility. The ultimate effect of the proposed rules and any additional regulations on our business is uncertain.
In December 2015, the CFTC issued final rules establishing minimum margin requirements for uncleared swaps for swap dealers and major swap participants. The final rules do not impose margin requirements on commercial end users. Although we expect to qualify for the end-user exception from the margin requirements for swaps entered into to hedge our commercial risks, the application of such requirements to other market participants, such as swap dealers, may change the cost and availability of the swaps we use for hedging. If any of our current or future swaps do not qualify for the commercial end-user exception, the posting of collateral could reduce our liquidity and cash available for capital expenditures and could reduce our ability to manage commodity price volatility and the volatility in our cash flows. 
In addition to the CFTC’s swap regulations, certain foreign jurisdictions may adopt or implement laws and regulations relating to transactions in derivatives, including margin and central clearing requirements, which in each case may affect our counterparties and the derivatives markets generally. Other rules may alter the business practices of some of our counterparties and in some cases may cause them to stop transacting in or making markets in derivatives. Moreover, federal banking regulators are reevaluating the authorization under which banking entities subject to their authority may engage in physical commodities transactions.
Although we cannot predict the ultimate outcome of these rulemakings, they could result in increased costs and cash collateral requirements for the types of derivative instruments we use or otherwise limit our ability to manage our financial and commercial risks related to fluctuations in commodity prices. Additional effects of the regulations, including increased regulatory reporting and recordkeeping costs, increased regulatory capital requirements for our counterparties, and market dislocations or disruptions could have an adverse effect on our ability to hedge risks associated with our business.
Energy Policy Act of 2005. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 (“EPAct 2005”) included a comprehensive compilation of tax incentives, authorized appropriations for grants and guaranteed loans, and made significant changes to the statutory framework affecting the energy industry. For example, EPAct 2005 amended the NGA to add an anti-market manipulation provision making it unlawful for any entity to use any deceptive or manipulative device or contrivance in connection with the purchase or sale of natural gas or the purchase or sale of transportation services subject to regulation by the FERC, in contravention of rules prescribed by the FERC. In January 2006 the FERC issued rules implementing the anti-market manipulation provision of EPAct 2005. These anti-market manipulation rules apply to natural gas pipelines and storage companies which provide interstate services, as well as otherwise non-jurisdictional entities to the extent the activities are conducted “in connection with” natural gas sales, purchases or transportation subject to FERC jurisdiction, which now includes the annual reporting requirements described further below. The EPAct 2005 also provides the FERC with the power to assess civil penalties of up to $1,000,000 per day per violation for violations of the NGA and NGPA and disgorgement of profits associated with any violation. 
FERC Market Transparency and Reporting Rules. The FERC requires wholesale buyers and sellers of more than 2.2 million MMBtus of physical natural gas in the previous calendar year to report, on May 1 of each year, aggregate volumes of natural gas purchased or sold at wholesale in the prior calendar year to the extent such transactions utilize, contribute to, or may contribute to the formation of price indices. The FERC also requires market participants to indicate whether they report prices 
22

to any index publishers and, if so, whether their reporting complies with the FERC’s policy statement on price reporting. Failure to comply with these reporting requirements could subject us to enhanced civil penalty liability under the EPAct 2005.
FTC and CFTC Market Manipulation Rules. Wholesale sales of petroleum are subject to provisions of the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 (“EISA”) and regulations by the FTC. Under the EISA, the FTC issued its Petroleum Market Manipulation Rule (the “Rule”), which became effective in November 2009. The Rule prohibits fraudulent or deceptive conduct (including false or misleading statements of material fact) in connection with wholesale purchases or sales of crude oil or refined petroleum products. Under the EISA, the FTC has authority to request a court to impose fines of up to $1,000,000 per day per violation. The CFTC has also adopted anti-market manipulation regulations prohibiting, among other things, fraud and price manipulation in the commodity and futures markets. The CFTC may assess fines of up to the greater of $1,000,000 or triple the monetary gain for violations of these anti-market manipulation regulations. Knowing or willful violations of the Commodity Exchange Act is also a felony.
Additional proposals and proceedings potentially affecting the crude oil and natural gas industry are brought before the U.S. Congress, the FERC and the courts from time to time. We cannot predict the ultimate impact these or the above laws and regulations may have on our crude oil and natural gas operations. We do not believe we will be affected in a materially different way than our similarly situated competitors.
Environmental regulation
General. We are subject to stringent and complex federal, state, and local laws, rules and regulations governing environmental compliance, including the discharge of materials into the environment. These laws, rules and regulations may, among other things:

• | require the acquisition of various permits to conduct exploration, drilling and production operations;


• | restrict the types, quantities and concentration of various substances that can be released into the environment in connection with crude oil and natural gas drilling, production and transportation activities;


• | limit or prohibit drilling activities on certain lands lying within wilderness, wetlands and other protected areas including areas containing endangered species of plants and animals;


• | require remedial measures to mitigate pollution from former and ongoing operations, such as requirements to close pits and plug abandoned wells; and


• | impose substantial liabilities for pollution resulting from drilling and production operations.

These laws, rules and regulations may also restrict the rate of crude oil and natural gas production below a rate otherwise possible. The regulatory burden on the crude oil and natural gas industry increases the cost of doing business and affects profitability. Additionally, the U.S. Congress and federal and state agencies frequently revise environmental laws, rules and regulations, and any changes that result in more stringent and costly waste handling, disposal, cleanup and remediation requirements for the crude oil and natural gas industry could have a significant impact on our operating costs.
In March 2017, President Donald Trump issued an Executive Order titled “Promoting Energy Independence and Economic Growth” (the "March 2017 Executive Order") which states it is in the national interest of the United States to promote clean and safe development of energy resources, while at the same time avoiding regulatory burdens that unnecessarily encumber energy production, constrain economic growth, and prevent job creation. The March 2017 Executive Order requires, among other things, the executive department and agencies to review existing regulations that potentially burden the development or use of domestically produced energy resources (with particular attention to crude oil, natural gas, coal, and nuclear energy) and suspend, revise, or rescind those regulations that unduly burden the development of such resources beyond the degree necessary to protect the public interest or otherwise comply with the law. In response to the March 2017 Executive Order, certain energy and climate-related regulations proposed or enacted under previous presidential administrations have been, or are in the process of being, reviewed, suspended, revised, or rescinded, some of which are described further below. Numerous regulations impacting the crude oil and natural gas industry are not expected to be impacted by the March 2017 Executive Order and will continue to be in effect. Additionally, undoing previously existing environmental regulations will likely involve lengthy notice-and-comment rulemaking and the resulting decisions may then be subject to litigation by opposition groups. Thus, it could take several years before existing regulations are revised or rescinded. Although further regulation of our industry may stall at the federal level under the March 2017 Executive Order, certain states have pursued additional regulation of our operations and other states may do so as well.
Environmental laws, rules and regulations. Some of the existing environmental laws, rules and regulations we are subject to include: (i) regulations by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) and various state agencies regarding approved methods of disposal for certain hazardous and nonhazardous wastes; (ii) the federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, 
23

Compensation, and Liability Act and analogous state laws that may require the removal of previously disposed hazardous substances (including hazardous substances disposed of or released by prior owners or operators), the cleanup of property contamination (including groundwater contamination), and remedial lease restoration activities to prevent future contamination from prior operations; (iii) federal Department of Transportation safety laws and comparable state and local requirements; (iv) the federal Clean Air Act and comparable state and local requirements, which establish pollution control requirements for air emissions from our operations; (v) the federal Oil Pollution Act of 1990, which contains numerous requirements relating to the prevention of and response to oil spills into waters of the United States; (vi) the Federal Water Pollution Control Act, also known as the Clean Water Act, and analogous state laws which impose restrictions and strict controls with respect to the discharge of pollutants, including crude oil and other substances generated by our operations, into waters of the United States or state waters; (vii) the federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, which is the principal federal statute governing the treatment, storage and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes, and comparable state statutes; (viii) the federal Safe Drinking Water Act ("SDWA") and analogous state laws which impose requirements relating to our underground injection activities; (ix) the National Environmental Policy Act and comparable state statutes, which require government agencies, including the Department of Interior, to evaluate major agency actions having the potential to significantly impact the environment; (x) the federal Endangered Species Act and comparable state statutes, which afford protections to certain plant and animal species; (xi) the federal Migratory Bird Treaty Act, which imposes certain restrictions for the protection of migratory birds; (xii) the federal Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act, which imposes certain restrictions for the protection of bald and golden eagles; (xiii) the federal Emergency Planning and Community Right to Know Act and comparable state statutes, which require that we organize and/or disclose information about hazardous materials stored, used or produced in our operations, and (xiv) state regulations and statutes governing the handling, treatment, storage and disposal of technologically enhanced naturally occurring radioactive material. Failure to comply with these laws, rules and regulations may result in the assessment of administrative, civil and criminal penalties, the imposition of corrective or remedial obligations, the occurrence of delays in the permitting or performance of projects, the issuance of orders enjoining performance of some or all of our operations, and potential litigation.
Air emissions and climate change. Federal, state and local laws and regulations have been and may be enacted to address concerns about the effects the emission of carbon dioxide, methane and other identified “greenhouse gases” may have on the environment and climate worldwide, generally referred to as “climate change.” For example, in October 2015 the EPA revised the National Ambient Air Quality Standard (“NAAQS”) for ozone from 75 to 70 parts per billion for both the 8-hour primary and secondary standards. The EPA published a final rule in November 2017 that issued area designations with respect to ground-level ozone for approximately 35% of the U.S. counties, including all of the counties in North Dakota and all of the counties except for Bryan County in Oklahoma, as either “attainment/unclassifiable” or “unclassifiable” and is expected to issue attainment or nonattainment designations for the remaining areas of the U.S. not addressed under the November 2017 rule in the first half of 2018. Additionally, state implementation of the revised NAAQS could result in stricter permitting requirements, delay or prohibit our ability to obtain such permits, and result in increased expenditures for pollution control equipment, the costs of which could be significant. The EPA has also adopted regulations under existing provisions of the federal Clean Air Act establishing, among other things, Prevention of Significant Deterioration (“PSD”) pre-construction and Title V operating permit reviews for certain large stationary sources. Moreover, the EPA’s source determination rule specifies that oil and gas production facilities are considered to be “adjacent” (and therefore aggregated for air permitting purposes) if they are on the same site or on sites that share equipment and are within ¼ mile of each other. This rule increases the potential for individual well facilities to be viewed collectively by the EPA as a single, large stationary source and, therefore, subject to PSD and/or Title V.  Regulations related to greenhouse gas emissions could adversely affect our operations and restrict or delay our ability to obtain air permits for new or modified sources. 
In addition, the EPA has adopted rules requiring the monitoring and reporting of greenhouse gas emissions from specified onshore and offshore oil and gas production sources in the United States on an annual basis, which include certain of our operations. New Source Performance Standard (“NSPS”) Subpart OOOO (“Quad O”) requires, among other things, the reduction of volatile organic compound (“VOC”) emissions from three subcategories of fractured and refractured oil and gas wells for which well completion operations are conducted: wildcat (exploratory) and delineation gas wells; low reservoir pressure non-wildcat and non-delineation gas wells; and all “other” fractured and refractured oil and gas wells. All three subcategories of wells must route flowback emissions to a gathering line or be captured and combusted using a combustion device such as a flare. However, the “other” fractured and refractured wells must use reduced emission completions or “green completions.” The rule also established specific new requirements regarding emissions from compressors, controllers, dehydrators, storage tanks and other production equipment. The rule is designed to limit emissions of VOCs, sulfur dioxide, and hazardous air pollutants from a variety of sources within natural gas processing plants, oil and natural gas production facilities, and natural gas transmission compressor stations. We have modified our operations and well equipment as needed to comply with these rules. Ongoing compliance with the rules is not expected to affect us in a way that materially differs from our similarly situated competitors.
24

In addition, in June 2016 the EPA finalized new regulations (NSPS Subpart OOOOa, commonly referred to as “Quad Oa”) setting methane emission standards for new and modified oil and gas production and natural gas processing and transmission facilities in an effort to reduce methane emissions from the oil and gas sector by up to 45% from 2012 levels by 2025 even though there was consensus at the time that oil and gas producers’ compliance with Quad O had already achieved reductions in methane emissions. 
However, in June 2017, the EPA proposed to stay certain portions of the NSPS Quad Oa rules described above for a period of two years while the rules are reconsidered in response to President Trump’s March 2017 Executive Order to reduce the burden of federal regulations that may hinder economic growth and energy development. The EPA has not yet published a final rule issuing the stay, and, as a result, the Quad Oa rules are currently in effect but future implementation of the Quad Oa rules is uncertain at this time. As part of its reconsideration, the EPA may issue revised rules, the timing and impact of which is uncertain. 
Additional regulation with respect to methane emissions occurred in November 2016 when the U.S. Department of Interior’s Bureau of Land Management (“BLM”) published a final rule commonly referred to as the “BLM Venting and Flaring Rule.” Similar to Quad Oa, the BLM Venting and Flaring Rule imposes requirements related to methane emissions from crude oil and natural gas sources. However, in response to President Trump’s March 2017 Executive Order, in December 2017 the BLM announced it was temporarily suspending or delaying certain requirements contained in its Venting and Flaring Rule until January 2019. That suspension is now being challenged in court and future implementation and impact of the rule remains uncertain. While additional federal regulation with respect to methane emissions appears unlikely in the near future, states may nevertheless pursue rules or enforcement actions designed to reduce methane emissions. To the extent new methane emission regulations—whether it is the BLM Venting and Flaring Rule, a prospective EPA rule targeting methane emissions from existing sources, or a state agency—impose reporting obligations on, or limit emissions of greenhouse gases from, our equipment and operations they could require us to incur costs to reduce emissions associated with our operations, but the impact of these measures is not expected to be material and will not affect us in a materially different way from our similarly situated competitors.
At an international level, in December 2015 a global climate agreement was reached in Paris at the 21st Conference of Parties organized by the United Nations under the Framework Convention on Climate Change. The agreement, which goes into effect in 2020, resulted in nearly 200 countries, originally including the United States, committing to work towards limiting global warming and agreeing to a monitoring and review process of greenhouse gas emissions. The agreement includes binding and non-binding elements and did not require ratification by the U.S. Congress. In June 2017, President Trump announced the United States will withdraw from and cease implementation of the Paris climate agreement, but indicated the U.S. may re-engage in the agreement if more favorable terms can be re-negotiated. In August 2017, the U.S. State Department officially informed the United Nations of the intent of the United States to withdraw from the Paris climate agreement. The exit process provided for under the Paris agreement could take up to four years. The United States’ adherence to the exit process is uncertain and the terms on which the United States may reenter the Paris agreement or a separately negotiated agreement are unclear. Although the U.S. has ceased its participation in the Paris agreement, the agreement nonetheless may result in increased political pressure on the United States to ensure continued compliance with enforcement measures under the Clean Air Act and may spur further initiatives aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions in the future.
While the U.S. Congress has from time to time considered legislation to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases, there has not been significant activity in the form of enacted legislation to reduce greenhouse gas emissions at the federal level in recent years. In the absence of such federal legislation, a number of state and regional efforts have emerged aimed at tracking and reducing greenhouse gas emissions by means of cap and trade programs that typically require major sources of greenhouse gas emissions, such as electric power plants, to acquire and surrender emission allowances in return for emitting those greenhouse gases. There has also been discussion of imposing a federal carbon tax on all fossil fuel production, though such a tax appears unlikely at this time. Although it is not possible to predict how such legislation or new regulations adopted to address greenhouse gas emissions will impact our business, any future laws and regulations imposing reporting obligations on, or limiting emissions of greenhouse gases from, our equipment and operations could require us to incur costs to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases associated with our operations. In addition, substantial limitations on greenhouse gas emissions could adversely affect the demand for the crude oil and natural gas we produce and lower the value of our reserves. Finally, some scientists have concluded increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases in the Earth’s atmosphere may produce climate changes having significant physical effects, such as increased frequency and severity of storms, droughts, floods and other climatic events. If any such effects from such causes were to occur, they could have an adverse effect on our exploration and production operations.
Both the EPA and the state of North Dakota pursued enforcement actions in 2016 against operators related to emissions generally and alleged noncompliance with the requirements of Quad O, Quad Oa, and relevant state regulations more specifically. One such enforcement action by the EPA against an operator resulted in a consent decree between the parties 
25

requiring the operator to incur costs associated with a civil penalty, emissions-related mitigation projects, and implementation of a robust leak detection and repair program applicable to all of the operator’s wells in North Dakota. 
Finally, the U.S. Department of Justice (“DOJ”) announced in 2016 it had partnered with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration to pursue a “Worker Endangerment Initiative” seeking to promote worker safety by pursuing not only worker safety claims in connection with worker safety incidents but also environmental claims. 
Environmental protection and natural gas flaring. We strive to operate in accordance with all applicable regulatory and legal requirements and have focused on continuously improving our environmental performance; however, at times circumstances may arise that adversely affect our compliance with applicable environmental requirements. We have established internal policies, procedures and processes regarding environmental matters for all employees, contractors, and vendors. In connection with our environmental initiatives, we work to identify and manage our environmental risks and the impact of our operations and continually improve our environmental compliance. However, we cannot guarantee our efforts will always be successful.
One of our environmental initiatives is the reduction of air emissions produced from our operations, particularly with respect to the flaring of natural gas from our operated well sites in the Bakken field of North Dakota. North Dakota statutes permit flaring of natural gas from a well that has not been connected to a gas gathering line for a period of one year from the date of a well’s first production. After one year, a producer is required to cap the well, connect it to a gas gathering line, find acceptable alternative uses for a percentage of the flared gas, or apply to the NDIC for a written exemption for any future flaring; otherwise, the producer is required to pay royalties and production taxes based on the volume and value of the gas flared from the unconnected well. While the NDIC ultimately determines the volume and value of any such gas flared and the applicable royalties and production taxes, the NDIC has thus far generally accepted our methods for calculating these amounts. Furthermore, the NDIC has generally accepted applications we have submitted to secure exemptions from the post-year flaring restrictions. Finally, NDIC rules for new drilling permit applications also require the submission of gas capture plans addressing measures taken by operators to capture and not flare produced gas, regardless of whether it has been or will be connected within the first year of production. Thus far, the NDIC has generally accepted our gas capture plans submitted with applications for drilling permits. The deadline to comply with the requirement to capture 85% of the natural gas produced from a field was November 1, 2016, and the target capture percentage increases to 88% beginning November 1, 2018 and 91% beginning November 1, 2020. Ongoing compliance with the NDIC’s flaring requirements or the imposition of any additional limitations on flaring could result in increased costs and have an adverse effect on our operations.
For the year ended December 31, 2017, we delivered approximately 90% of our operated natural gas production in the North Dakota Bakken field to market, flaring approximately 10% compared to 9% in 2016 and 13% in 2015. According to data published by the NDIC, our industry as a whole flared approximately 12% of produced natural gas volumes in the North Dakota Bakken field during 2017. We are a participant in the NDIC’s Flaring Reduction Task Force and are engaged in working with other task force members and the NDIC to develop action plans for mitigating natural gas flaring in the state. Flared natural gas volumes from our operated SCOOP and STACK properties in Oklahoma are negligible given the existence of established natural gas transportation infrastructure.
There are environmental and financial risks associated with natural gas flaring, and we attempt to manage these risks on an ongoing basis. We have taken numerous actions to reduce flaring from our operated well sites, such as coordinating our well completion operations to coincide with well connections to gathering systems in order to minimize flaring; however, we may not always be successful in these efforts. Our ultimate goal is to reduce natural gas flaring from our operated well sites as much as practicable. For example, in operating areas such as the Buffalo Red River units in South Dakota, the quality of the natural gas is not adequate to meet requirements for sale, so we employ processes to efficiently combust the gas in an effort to minimize impacts to the environment. Our levels of flaring are and will be dependent upon external factors such as investment from third parties in the development of gas gathering systems, state regulations, and the granting of reasonable right-of-way access by land owners. For example, over the past year insufficient takeaway capacity in North Dakota has created challenges for all operators and contributed to an increase in volumes of flared gas. Increased emissions from a multi-well pad facility or centralized production facilities due to flaring could require us to adhere to PSD or Title V permit requirements. We have filed several permits to construct major sources (i.e., facilities from which emissions of a criteria pollutant (e.g., carbon monoxide or volatile organic compounds) are expected to exceed 100 tons per year) relating to facilities where takeaway capacity is currently constrained and creating a potential to emit in excess of 100 tons per year. 
We have incurred in the past, and expect to incur in the future, capital and other expenditures related to environmental compliance. Such expenditures are included within our overall capital and operating budgets and are not separately itemized. Although we believe our continued compliance with existing requirements will not have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations, we cannot assure you the passage of more stringent laws or regulations in the future will not materially impact our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

Hydraulic fracturing. Hydraulic fracturing involves the injection of water, sand or other proppant and additives under pressure into rock formations to stimulate crude oil and natural gas production. In recent years there has been increased public concern regarding an alleged potential for hydraulic fracturing to adversely affect drinking water supplies and to induce seismic events. As a result, several federal and state agencies are studying the environmental risks with respect to hydraulic fracturing, and proposals have been made to enact separate federal, state and local legislation that would increase the regulatory burden imposed on hydraulic fracturing. 
At the federal level, the EPA has asserted federal regulatory authority pursuant to the federal Safe Drinking Water Act (“SDWA”) over certain hydraulic fracturing activities involving the use of diesel fuels and published permitting guidance in February 2014 related to such activities. In May 2014, the EPA issued an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking to collect data on chemicals used in hydraulic fracturing operations under Section 8 of the Toxic Substances Control Act. To date, no other action has been taken. In June 2016, the EPA finalized a regulation under the Clean Water Act prohibiting discharges to publicly owned treatment works of wastewater from onshore unconventional oil and gas extraction facilities. It has not been our practice to discharge wastewater to publicly owned treatment works, so the impact of this new regulation on us is not expected to be material. 
In December 2016 the EPA published a final study of the potential impacts of hydraulic fracturing activities on water resources. In its report, the EPA indicated it found evidence hydraulic fracturing activities can impact drinking water resources under some circumstances. The report identified certain conditions where impacts from hydraulic fracturing activities can potentially be more frequent or severe. These include water withdrawals for hydraulic fracturing in times or areas of low water availability; spills during the handling of hydraulic fracturing fluids, chemicals or produced water resulting in large volumes or high concentrations of chemicals reaching groundwater resources; injection of hydraulic fracturing fluids into wells with inadequate mechanical integrity thereby allowing gases or liquids to move to groundwater resources; injection of hydraulic fracturing fluids directly into groundwater resources; discharge of inadequately treated hydraulic fracturing wastewater to surface water; and disposal or storage of hydraulic fracturing wastewater in unlined pits thereby resulting in contamination of groundwater resources. In its final report, the EPA indicated it was not able to calculate or estimate the national frequency of impacts on drinking water resources from hydraulic fracturing activities or fully characterize the severity of impacts. Nonetheless, the results of the EPA’s study or similar governmental reviews could spur initiatives to regulate hydraulic fracturing under the SDWA or otherwise. 
In March 2015, the BLM issued final rules related to the regulation of hydraulic fracturing activities on federal lands, including requirements for chemical disclosure, well bore integrity and handling of flowback water. Several parties challenged the regulations and the U.S. District Court of Wyoming temporarily stayed implementation of the regulations. In June 2016, the U.S. District Court of Wyoming ruled the BLM lacked the statutory authority to promulgate the regulations. The U.S. Department of Interior appealed the decision. In December 2017, the BLM formally rescinded its March 2015 hydraulic fracturing rules, citing unjustified administrative burdens and compliance costs arising from a reassessment performed in response to President Trump's March 2017 Executive Order to reduce the burden of federal regulations that may hinder economic growth and energy development. In January 2018, litigation challenging the BLM's rescission of the March 2015 final rules was brought in federal court. As of December 31, 2017, we held approximately 65,500 net undeveloped acres on federal land, representing approximately 11% of our total net undeveloped acres. 
At the state level, several states in which we operate have adopted or are considering adopting legal requirements imposing more stringent permitting, disclosure and well construction requirements on hydraulic fracturing activities. Local governments also may seek to adopt ordinances within their jurisdictions regulating or prohibiting the time, place and manner of drilling activities or hydraulic fracturing activities. In certain areas of the United States, new drilling permits for hydraulic fracturing have been put on hold pending development of additional standards.
Regulators in states in which we operate are considering additional requirements related to seismicity and its potential association with hydraulic fracturing. For example, the Oklahoma Corporation Commission (the “OCC”) has promulgated guidance for operators of crude oil and gas wells in certain seismically-active areas of the SCOOP and STACK plays in Oklahoma. The OCC's guidance provides for seismic monitoring and for implementation of mitigation procedures, which may include a suspension of operations in the event of concurrent seismic events within a particular radius of operations of a magnitude exceeding 2.5 on the Richter scale. The OCC may update this guidance to impose a larger monitoring area and more stringent requirements for notification and suspension of operations. If seismic events exceeding the OCC guidance thresholds were to occur near our active stimulation operations on a frequent basis, they could have an adverse effect on our operations.
We voluntarily participate in FracFocus, a national publicly accessible Internet-based registry developed by the Ground Water Protection Council and the Interstate Oil and Gas Compact Commission. This registry, located at www.fracfocus.org, provides 
27

our industry with an avenue to voluntarily disclose additives used in the hydraulic fracturing process. The additives used in the hydraulic fracturing process on all wells we operate are disclosed on that website.
The adoption of any future federal, state or local laws, rules or implementing regulations imposing permitting or reporting obligations on, or otherwise limiting, hydraulic fracturing processes in areas in which we operate could make it more difficult and expensive to complete crude oil and natural gas wells in low-permeability formations, increase our costs of compliance and doing business, and delay, prevent or prohibit the development of natural resources from unconventional formations. Compliance, or the consequences of our failure to comply, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. At this time it is not possible to estimate the potential impact on our business if such federal or state legislation is enacted into law.
Waste water disposal. Underground injection wells are a predominant method for disposing of waste water from oil and gas activities. In response to seismic events near underground injection wells used for the disposal of oil and gas-related waste waters, federal and some state agencies are investigating whether such wells have caused increased seismic activity. Some states, including states in which we operate, have delayed permit approvals, mandated a reduction in injection volumes, or have shut down or imposed moratoria on the use of injection wells. Regulators in states in which we operate are considering additional requirements related to seismicity. For example, the OCC has adopted rules for operators of saltwater disposal wells in certain seismically-active areas in the Arbuckle formation of Oklahoma. These rules require, among other things, that disposal well operators conduct mechanical integrity testing or make certain demonstrations of such wells’ respective depths that, depending on the depth, could require plugging the well and/or the reduction of volumes disposed in such wells. Oklahoma has adopted a “traffic light” system wherein the OCC reviews new or existing disposal wells for proximity to faults, seismicity in the area and other factors in determining whether such wells should be permitted, permitted only with special restrictions, or not permitted. At the federal level, the EPA’s current regulatory requirements for such wells do not require the consideration of seismic impacts when issuing permits. We cannot predict the EPA’s future actions in this regard. The introduction of new environmental initiatives and regulations related to the disposal of wastes associated with the exploration, development or production of hydrocarbons, could limit or prohibit our ability to utilize underground injection wells. A lack of waste water disposal sites could cause us to delay, curtail or discontinue our exploration and development plans. Additionally, increased costs associated with the transportation and disposal of produced water, including the cost of complying with regulations concerning produced water disposal, may reduce our profitability. These costs are commonly incurred by all oil and gas producers and we do not believe the costs associated with the disposal of produced water will have a material adverse effect on our operations to any greater degree than other similarly situated competitors. In recent years we have increased our operation and use of water recycling and distribution facilities in Oklahoma that economically reuse stimulation water for both operational efficiencies and environmental benefits.
Employee Health and Safety. We are also subject to the requirements of the federal Occupational Safety and Health Act and comparable state statutes that regulate the protection of the health and safety of workers. In addition, the OSHA hazard communication standard, the EPA community right-to-know regulation under Title III of the federal superfund Amendment and Reauthorization Act and similar state statutes and regulations require that information be maintained about hazardous materials used or produced in operations and that this information be provided to employees, state and local governmental authorities and citizens.
Employees
As of December 31, 2017, we employed 1,127 people. Our future success will depend partially on our ability to attract, retain and motivate qualified personnel. We are not a party to any collective bargaining agreements and have not experienced any strikes or work stoppages. We consider our relations with our employees to be satisfactory. We utilize the services of independent contractors to perform various field and other services.
