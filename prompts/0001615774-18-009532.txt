Item 1. Business
Overview
 
Misonix, Inc. is a New York corporation based in Farmingdale, New York. We design, manufacture and market minimally invasive therapeutic ultrasonic medical devices. Our products enhance clinical outcomes and provide value to customers and patients. We believe that our current focus products have the ability to become standard of care and provide the Company with a growing revenue stream. 

● | BoneScalpel® Surgical System (“BoneScalpel”), which is used for surgical procedures involving the precise cutting and sculpting of bone while sparing soft tissue. BoneScapel is now recognized by many surgeons globally as a critical surgical tool enabling improved patient outcomes in the spinal arena. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | SonaStar® Surgical Aspirator (“SonaStar”), which is used to emulsify and remove soft and hard tumors, primarily in the neuro and general surgery field.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | SonicOne® Wound Cleansing and Debridement System (“SonicOne”), which offers tissue specific debridement and cleansing of wounds and burns for effective removal of devitalized tissue and fibrin deposits while sparing viable cells.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
These devices primarily serve the following clinical specialties: neurosurgery, orthopedic surgery, plastic surgery, wound care and maxillo-facial surgery.
 
In the United States, our products are marketed primarily through a hybrid sales approach. This includes direct sales representatives, managed by regional sales managers, along with independent distributors.
 
 Outside the United States, we sell our products to specialty distributors who purchase products from us to resell to their clinical customer bases. We sell to all major markets in the Americas, Europe, Middle East, Asia Pacific and Africa. 
 
Products
 
All Misonix disposables function with proprietary consoles which essentially convert electrical current into ultrasonic energy via piezo electric crystals in order for the relevant device to produce a therapeutic effect.
 
BoneScalpel
 
The BoneScalpel is a state of the art, ultrasonic bone cutting and sculpting system capable of making precise cuts with minimal necrosis, minimal burn artifact, minimal inflammation and minimal bone loss. The device is also capable of preserving surrounding soft tissue structures because of its unique ability to differentiate soft tissue from rigid bone. This device can make precise linear or curved cuts, on any plane, with precision not normally associated with powered instrumentation. The BoneScalpel offers the speed and convenience of a powered instrument without the dangers associated with conventional rotary devices. The effect on surrounding soft tissue is minimal due to the elastic and flexible structure of healthy tissue. This is a significant advantage in anatomical regions like the spine where patient safety is of primary concern. In addition, the linear motion of the blunt, tissue-impacting tips avoids accidental ‘trapping’ of soft tissue while largely eliminating the high speed spinning and tearing associated with rotary power instruments. The BoneScalpel allows surgeons to improve on existing surgical techniques by creating new approaches to bone cutting and sculpting and removal, leading to substantial time savings and increased operation efficiencies.

The expanded BoneScalpel product platform will allow entry into dynamic market segments like minimally invasive spine surgery and other bone cutting and sculpting needs.
 
SonaStar
 
 The SonaStar System provides powerful precise aspiration following the ultrasonic ablation of hard or soft tissue. The SonaStar has been used for a wide variety of surgical procedures applying both open and minimally invasive approaches, including neurosurgery and liver surgery. The SonaStar may also be used with OsteoSculpt ® probe tips, which enable the precise shaping or shaving of bony structures that prevent open access to partially or completely hidden soft tissue masses. 
 
SonicOne
 
The SonicOne Ultrasonic Cleansing and Debridement System is a highly innovative, tissue specific approach for the effective removal of devitalized or necrotic tissue and fibrin deposits while sparing viable, surrounding cellular structures. The tissue specific capability is, in part, due to the fact that healthy and viable tissue structures have a higher elasticity and flexibility than necrotic tissue and are more resistant to destruction from the impact effects of ultrasound. The ultrasonic debridement process separates devitalized tissue from viable tissue layers, allowing for a more defined treatment and, usually, a reduced pain sensation. We believe SonicOne establishes a new standard in wound and burn bed preparation, the essential first step in the healing process, while contributing to a faster patient healing.
 
License and Other Agreements
 
On October 19, 2017, the Company entered into a License and Exclusive Manufacturing Agreement (the “Agreement”) with Hunan Xing Hang Rui Kang Bio-technologies Co., Ltd., a Chinese corporation (the “Licensee”) under which Misonix has licensed certain manufacturing and distribution rights to its SonaStar product line in China, Hong Kong and Macau (the “Territory”) in exchange for payments totaling at least $11,000,000.
 
Pursuant to the Agreement, Licensee is obligated to pay the Company: (i) initial amounts consisting of upfront fees and stocking orders totaling $5,000,000, payable in five (5) equal monthly installments of $1,000,000 each; (ii) royalty payments from the sale of SonaStar products in the Territory, including minimum royalty payments of $2,000,000 per calendar year in each of 2019, 2020, and 2021; and (iii) reimbursement of technology transfer costs in an amount up to $1,000,000. The Agreement also provides that Misonix will supply SonaStar products to Licensee at agreed prices during the transition period prior to Licensee’s commencement of manufacturing.
 
During the year ended June 30, 2018, the Company delivered the licensed SonaStar technology to the Licensee, and recorded license revenue of $4,010,000. In addition, during the year ended June 30, 2018, the Company had delivered the contractually agreed number of SonaStar units to the Licensee and had recorded product revenue of $990,000. All of the $5 million of initial payments were collected as of March 31, 2018.
 
In October 1996, we entered into a license agreement with Medtronic Minimally Invasive Therapies (“MMIT”). The MMIT license covered the further development of our medical technology relating to vessel sealing products, which uses high frequency sound waves to coagulate and divide tissue for both open and laparoscopic surgery. We developed the AutoSonix product with MMIT under the agreement. As a result of this joint development, we co-own certain patents with MMIT and MMIT paid us a 5% royalty on end user sales. The MMIT license gives MMIT exclusive worldwide marketing and sales rights for this technology and device. Total royalties from sales of this device worldwide were approximately $525,000, $3,764,000 and $3,903,000 for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The royalty is recorded as “other income” in our financial statements. Our license agreement with MMIT expired in August 2017 and no further payments are due thereafter.
 
We sold our rights to the high intensity focused ultrasound technology to SonaCare Medical, LLC (“SonaCare”) in May 2010. We may receive up to approximately $5.8 million in payment for the sale. SonaCare will pay us 7% of the gross revenues received from its sales of the (i) prostate product in Europe and (ii) kidney and liver products worldwide, until we have received payments of $3 million, and thereafter 5% of the gross revenues, up to an aggregate payment of $5.8 million, all subject to a minimum annual royalty of $250,000. Fiscal 2018 payments were $250,000 bringing cumulative payments through June 30, 2018 to $2,542,579.
