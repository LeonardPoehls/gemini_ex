ITEM 1.
DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS.

INTREORG was organized for the purpose of providing consulting and "back office" services to other companies. Our business plan is to become an integrated provider of Software as a Service (SaaS) applications, Stock Transfer Analytics ("STA") software application and consulting. Our target market is publicly traded, emerging growth companies. Our business plan is to engage customers using our proprietary STA software to help with compliance, fund raising and investor relations. We believe this will lead to additional opportunities to provide consulting services and/or SaaS for these companies.
 
Since inception we have been evaluating different models to carry out our business plan and develop the services and software we seek to offer to our customers. We have conducted years of test marketing of various software reporting and compliance tools. Over the years, between the trials of a new business and the slowing economy, we experienced managerial and employee turnover and have not always been able to afford to carry out our plans. However, we continued to maintain our SEC reporting and work on finding products and services that meets our criteria. We believe we have finally established the right business model, products and services, and management group to begin to implement our business plan.
 
Publicly traded companies, have an unfulfilled need to track and analyze market data of trading in the entity's own stock. This creates a market opportunity for INTREORG to provide accurate and timely reporting on stock movement data. Due to the dynamic and ever-changing nature of the market, executives of public traded companies should be evaluating their stock movement information for compliance, fund raising and investor relations purposes. Collecting and compiling this information has proven to be challenging for companies and has resulted in public companies transition toward electronic monitoring and management of their stock sales and purchases to gain better insight and control. The ultimate goal for all public companies is the ability to accurately gauge the movement of shares in the market, validate compliance, track those movements "over time", and analyze this data to accurately report information to their executive teams. There are numerous challenges associated with this goal and to facilitate a solution is a very complex and data intensive process but necessary for successful financial advantage. INTREORG has created a proprietary data delivery software tool that provides data mining, reporting and a technical understanding to be able to help our clients. Our software can provide information that can be used for:
 

Compliance 
 o
Identify Large Shareholder Liquidations 
 o
Related Accounts 
 o
Notify Counsel of unreported Insider transactions 
 o
Illegal Distribution of Unregistered Shares 
 
Fund Raising 
 o
Pricing & Timing for Capital Raises 
 o
Investor Sources 
 
Investor Relations 
 o
Investor Demographics 
 o
IR Effectiveness 
 
Our software tool provides a sophisticated analysis track and report changes in share movements to our clients. INTREORG Systems Inc. provides SaaS and consulting service for publicly traded companies using their proprietary Stock Transfer Analytics (STA) software. The company is built on the knowledge and experience of over five decades of capital markets exposure. INTREORG's services play a vital role in helping companies understand broker-dealer, clearing firm and shareholder position movements and how they impact a company's market value.
Market Trading Analysis for Publicly Traded Companies.
 
We have been exploring consulting services for publicly traded companies focusing on data and information regarding their shareholder base and trading activities. There have been preliminary meetings with possible vendors, clients and data providers, but no formal or definitive agreements (other than those described herein) have been executed as of the date of this filing. Since January 1, 2011, we have focused on obtaining the licensing for software from PISA (as further described below), which is crucial for providing the consulting services we intend to offer and for researching the viability of pricing structures within the industry.

Stock Transfer Analytics " STA" software application
 
"Stock Transfer Analytics" refers to a process of analyzing data sources about a public company's shareholders and shareholdings to generate new knowledge and gain insights about otherwise vague or difficult-to-understand aspects of a public company's public stock. We believe that the knowledge and insights which may be gained from Stock Transfer Analytics will be valuable to the financial management of public companies, and would be particularly useful to CEOs, CFOs, corporate counsel, and investor relations (IR) professionals as they monitor their corporate status.
 
Stock Transfer Analytics Services
 
The Stock Transfer Analytics software can be used as the enabling technology of a financial services consultancy, or as the technology driven fee-for-access web site. Specific services include:
 

Stock inventory modeling; 
 
Monitoring for Regulation FD (Fair Disclosure) compliance: When an issuer, or person acting on its behalf, discloses material nonpublic information to certain enumerated persons (in general, securities market professionals and holders of the issuer's securities who may well trade on the basis of the information), the issuer must make public disclosure of that information; during the normal course of data-mining, Regulation FD issues may be identified so long as insiders and persons possessing material, non-public information are made known to the issuer. If any such compliance issue is found, the client company of the software would be immediately notified via electronic communication detailing the individual and the transaction believed to constitute the compliance issue. 
 
Enforce lock-ups; and, 
 
Improved investor relations. 
 
On October 30, 2012, we executed an Intellectual Property License and Consulting Agreement (the "PISA Agreement") with Public Issuer Stock Analytics, LLC ("PISA") that provides us the exclusive right to market and sell services associated with certain proprietary intellectual property owned by PISA. PISA further agreed to act as a consultant to us, providing the actual services associated with the certain proprietary intellectual property. The term of the PISA Agreement is for three years. Under the PISA Agreement, PISA is entitled to the following compensation: 250,000 shares of Common Stock when the PISA Agreement was executed; 20,000 shares per month based on the closing price of our Common Stock on the last business day of each respective month (the "Share Royalty"); and 1%, 2% or 3% of gross sales, due on a quarterly basis , up and until the second anniversary, third anniversary or termination of the agreement, respectively (the "Gross Sales Royalty"). If no gross sales exist for a given period, PISA's only compensation for such period shall be the Share Royalty. The Gross Sales Royalty may be paid in cash or restricted shares of Common Stock; if paid in Common Stock, such stock shall be issued based on the market close on the last business day of each month in each quarter as such market close is found in Bloomberg. 
 
Our ability to fully implement our business plan is dependent both on implementing the licensing agreement with the related party as well as raising sufficient capital to fund the further development of our company. Going forward, we expect that our efforts will be focused on parallel courses to achieve both of these goals. While we have raised funds in private offerings, there are no assurances, that we will be able to raise all necessary capital; and without access to funding we will be unable to pursue other aspects of our business development.
 
Information Based Sales and Marketing Efforts.
 
We have developed a set of metrics that we believe permits us to assess each client's needs and its potential profitability based on such company's publicly available intonation. Accordingly, we intend to focus our sales and marketing efforts on companies with readily available public information, such as those who file reports with the SEC. We believe that this approach will allow us to focus our sales and marketing efforts on a legitimate group of potential clients and reduce wasted sales and marketing expenses.
 
We expect to finalize our marketing strategies and hire and train either in house marketing personnel or engage independent contractors who have expertise in our target markets, at such time as we begin offering our products and services, which we anticipate will occur within the next 6 months to a year, to provide additional capital and resources. Until such time, our marketing strategy will remain as in-person client development meetings with the management teams of public companies.

We currently maintain a master service agreement with one client, which provides a good example of the services we can provide to our clients. For instance, pursuant to the terms of the agreement, we will create a dynamic database that logically aggregates, compiles, and rationalizes all disparate and available broker-dealer and shareholder data from known reporting entities and all available relevant sources, including but not limited to, The Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation (DTCC), Cede & Co., Company's Transfer Agent and Broadridge Financial Solutions, Inc. This is the first step in turning static reporting entity, broker-dealer and shareholder data into a useful and dynamic archival/historic repository.
 
In addition to the services described above, our consulting team will be available to provide trusted advisor related consulting services to the client in conjunction with the software they are using.
 
Competition
 
Once we begin our operations, we will be engaged in a highly competitive industry and competing with many companies, a number of which are larger, better capitalized, more established and have greater access to resources necessary to produce a competitive advantage. Our competitors will include large, international companies as well as regional and local companies that provide computer software programs. Although we may compete with other entities that provide some of the services we provide, we do not believe that there is any other entity that currently provides the entire suite of services and software that we intend to provide to our clients. We believe that most competitors provide some of the services we intend to provide as separate stand-alone services and that our ability to combine these services with our software will enhance the demand for our offerings.
 
Because of all the inherent limitations with any new organization, there are no assurances that we will ever be able to effectively compete in our target business. However, once we obtain additional financing and are able to execute our business goals, we believe our core values as described above will provide us with competitive strengths.
 
Customers
 
Over the past two fiscal years, we have signed one client - Rangeford Resources, Inc. ("Rangeford") - and use the Public Issuer Stock Analytics technology for our own shareholder base. Accordingly, the loss of this customer will have a material adverse effect on our business and operations. We currently intend that our clients will consist of smaller, emerging public companies that are trying to gain insight on their capitalization to better evaluate their status and the types of corporate actions they may pursue.
 
On October 30, 2012, we entered into a Master Services Agreement with Rangeford pursuant to which we will provide services relating to the Public Issuer Stock Analytics software for an annual fee of $30,000 (based on our license agreement with PISA, up to 3% of these fees will be paid to PISA for the first three years of the Rangeford Agreement). The term of the Agreement is one year, and thereafter the agreement renews automatically and remains "evergreen" for succeeding one-year terms, unless terminated according to the termination provisions in the agreement. (See, "Certain Relationships and Related Transactions," and "Director Independence")
 
Intellectual Property
 
We do not currently have any registered trademarks nor do we own any patents. However, we intend to apply for the appropriate protection if it becomes necessary.
Employees
 
As of December 31, 2017, we had one full time employee. Our executive officer provides certain services dedicated to current corporate and business development activities on an as needed, part-time basis.

ITEM l A.
RISK FACTORS.

Although we are not required to provide this information since we are a smaller reporting company, we are voluntarily providing such information in light of the risks associated with our company and our lack of revenue. Before you invest in our securities, you should be aware that there are various risks. You should consider carefully these risk factors, together with all of the other information included in this annual report before you decide to purchase our securities. If any of the following risks and uncertainties develop into actual events, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected.
OUR AUDITORS HAVE RAISED SUBSTANTIAL DOUBTS AS TO OUR ABILITY TO CONTINUE AS A GOING CONCERN.
 
Our financial statements have been prepared assuming we will continue as a going concern. Since inception we have experienced recurring losses from operations, which losses have resulted in accumulated deficit of $6,581,897 as of December 31, 2017. These factors, among others, raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Our financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. We anticipate that we will continue to incur losses in future periods until we begin reporting generating revenues. There are no assurances that we will be able to raise our revenues to a level which supports profitable operations and provides sufficient funds to pay our obligations. If we are unable to meet those obligations, we could be forced to cease operations in which event investors would lose their entire investment in our company.
WE HAVE NOMINAL REVENUES AND OUR ABILITY TO PAY OUR OPERATING EXPENSES IS DEPENDENT UPON ADVANCES FROM RELATED PARTIES.
 
For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017, we reported a net loss of $330,257. We had a working capital deficit of $3,181,089 at December 31, 2017. We have not yet begun generating revenue from our operations and are dependent upon a line of credit or other informal advances from a related party to pay our operating expenses and the continued development of our business plan. There are no assurances this related party will continue to advance funds to us that will satisfy our working capital needs until such time as we are able to raise additional capital or generate sufficient revenues to fund our operating expenses. While we seek ways to continue to operate by securing additional financing resources or alliances or other partnership agreements, we do not at this time have any commitments or agreements that provide for additional capital resources. Our financial condition and the going concern emphasis paragraph may also make it more difficult for us to maintain existing customer relationships and to initiate and secure new customer relationships.
IF WE ARE UNABLE TO FILE OUR OUTSTANDING DELINQUENT PERIODIC REPORTS, OUR REGISTRATION MAY BE REVOKED AND WE MAY BE SUBJECT TO A TRADING SUSPENSION.
 
Due to capital constraints, we were not able to file timely all of our periodic reports during the past three fiscal years; however, we have been working towards resolving that deficiency and will only be deficient with regards to our fiscal 2018 reports following the filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017. Although there can be no guarantee, we hope that by filing all the other delinquent reports we will prevent the SEC from initiating an administrative proceeding to revoke our registration under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "Exchange Act") pursuant to Section 12(j) of the Exchange Act. If the SEC initiates a 12(j) proceeding, our stock may be subject to a trading suspension pursuant to Section 12(k) of the Exchange Act. If the SEC initiates a 12(j) or 12(k) proceeding, it will significantly impair our ability to raise additional financings, could force us to expend significant financial resources to defend ourselves, could divert the attention of our management from our core business and could harm our reputation.
WE HAVE HISTORICALLY BEEN, AND MAY CONTINUE TO BE, HEAVILY RELIANT UPON FINANCING FROM RELATED PARTIES, WHICH PRESENTS POTENTIAL CONFLICTS OF INTEREST THAT MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.
 
We have historically obtained financing from related parties, including major shareholders, directors and officers, in the form of debt, debt guarantees and issuances of equity securities, to finance working capital growth. These related parties have the ability to exercise significant control over our financing decisions, which may present conflicts of interest regarding the choice of parties from whom we obtain financing, as well as the terms of financing. No assurance can be given that the terms of financing transactions with related parties are or will be as favorable as those that could be obtained in arms' length negotiations with third parties.

7



WE HAVE A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF DEBT WHICH COULD IMPACT OUR ABILITY TO CONTINUE TO IMPLEMENT OUR BUSINESS PLAN.
 
We have incurred indebtedness totaling $3,181,189 at December 31, 2017, which includes $544,608 in accounts payable, $535,839 in accounts payable to related parties, $800,656 in accrued interest and other liabilities, $453,290 in accrued contingencies, $521,000 in notes payable which are past due and a revolving line of credit with a related party with an outstanding balance as of December 31, 2017 of $325,796. We do not have adequate funds to satisfy the outstanding obligations. The outstanding notes provide that as a result of a default - failure to pay when due, the note holders could declare the notes immediately due and payable. Unless we are able to restructure some or all of this debt, and raise sufficient capital to fund our continued development, our current operations do not generate sufficient cash to pay these obligations, when due. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that we will be able to pay these or other obligations which we may incur in the future and it is unlikely we will be able to continue as a going concern.
WE HAVE LIMITED HISTORY AND WE CANNOT ASSURE YOU THAT OUR BUSINESS MODEL WILL BE SUCCESSFUL IN THE FUTURE OR THAT OUR OPERATIONS WILL BE PROFITABLE.
 
Our company was formed in 2003 but we have yet to begin generating revenues from our operations. Accordingly, investors do not have sufficient operating history upon which to evaluate our business model. There can be no assurances whatsoever that we will be able to successfully implement our business model, penetrate our target markets or attain a wide following for our services. We are subject to all the risks inherent in an early stage enterprise and our prospects must be considered in light of the numerous risks, expenses, delays, problems and difficulties frequently encountered in those businesses.
WE ARE DELINQUENT IN OUR TAX FILINGS.
 
We failed to file federal tax returns for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2009 through 2017 and they are open for review by the various tax jurisdictions. We are also required to file Franchise Tax Reports in Texas and we have filed all the required tax forms in Texas. We cannot assure you that we will not incur fines and penalties for failure to file such our federal tax returns.
THE COMPANY COMPETES WITH MANY LARGER, WELL CAPITALIZED COMPANIES
 
We face substantial competition in all areas of our operations from a variety of different competitors, many of which are larger and may have more financial resources. Such competitors primarily include Broadridge, Deloitte, KPMG Accenture etc. INTREORG also faces competition from many other types of service providers, including SHAREINTEL. Due to their size, many competitors may be able to achieve economies of scale and, as a result, may offer a broader range of products and services as well as better pricing for those products and services than we can. Our ability to compete successfully depends on a number of factors, including, among other things:
 

The ability to develop, maintain and build upon long-term customer relationships based on top quality service, high ethical standards and safe, sound assets; 
 
The ability to expand our market position; 
 
The rate at which we introduce new products and services relative to our competitors; 
 
Customer satisfaction with our level of service; 
 
Failure to perform in any of these areas could significantly weaken our competitive position, which could adversely affect our growth and profitability, which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
 
OUR SOLE OFFICER DOES NOT DEVOTE ALL OF HIS TIME TO OUR BUSINESS, WHICH MAY IMPACT OUR ABILITY TO CARRY OUT OUR BUSINESS IN THE MOST EFFICIENT MANNER
 
Our sole officer does not allocate his full time to our business thereby resulting in potential conflicts of interest in his determination as to how much time to devote to our affairs, and this conflict of interest could have a negative impact on our ability to implement our business plan.
 
Our sole officer devotes only approximately 50% of his time and attention to our business and he is engaged in other business endeavors which are unrelated to our company. If his other business affairs require him to devote more substantial amounts of time to such affairs, it could limit his ability to devote time to our affairs and could have a negative impact on our ability to implement our business plan. We cannot assure you that these potential conflicts of interest will be resolved in our favor.

8



WE WILL NEED ADDITIONAL FINANCING WHICH WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO OBTAIN ON ACCEPTABLE TERMS IF AT ALL
 
Our current operations are not sufficient to fund our operating expenses and we will need to raise additional working capital to continue to implement our business model, to provide funds for marketing to support our efforts to increase our revenues and for general overhead expenses, including those associated with our reporting obligations under Federal securities laws. Generally, small businesses such as ours for which there is a limited public market for their securities face significant difficulties in their efforts to raise equity capital. While to date we have relied upon the relationships of our executive officers and shareholders in our capital raising efforts, there are no assurances that these resources will continually be available to us or provide us with sufficient funding.
 
We do not have any commitments to provide additional capital and there are no assurances we will be able to raise capital upon terms which are favorable to our company. Even if we are able to raise capital, the structure of that capital raise could impact our company and our shareholders in a variety of ways. If we raise additional capital through the issuance of debt, this will result in interest expense. If we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity or convertible debt securities, the percentage ownership of our company held by existing shareholders will be reduced and those shareholders may experience significant dilution. In addition, new securities may contain certain rights, preferences or privileges that are senior to those of our common stock. We cannot assure you that we will be able to raise the working capital as needed in the future on terms acceptable to us, if at all. If we do not raise funds as needed, we may not be able to continue to implement our business plan and it is likely that you would lose your entire investment in our company.
 
WE RELY ON THIRD PARTY TECHNOLOGIES AND IF WE ARE UNABLE TO USE OR INTEGRATE THESE TECHNOLOGIES, OUR PRODUCT AND SERVICE DEVELOPMENT MAY BE DELAYED AND OUR OPERATING RESULTS NEGATIVELY IMPACTED.
 
We rely on certain software that we acquire from third parties, including software that is used to perform key functions. These third­ party software licenses may not continue to be available on commercially reasonable terms, and the software may not be appropriately supported, maintained or enhanced by the licensors or manufacturers. The loss of licenses or access to, or inability to support, maintain and enhance any such software could result in increased costs, or in delays or reductions in product shipments until equivalent products can be developed, identified, licensed and integrated, which would likely harm our business.
IF WE ARE DEEMED TO BE AN INVESTMENT COMPANY UNDER THE INVESTMENT COMPANY ACT, WE MAY BE REQUIRED TO INSTITUTE BURDENSOME COMPLIANCE REQUIREMENTS AND OUR ACTIVITIES MAY BE RESTRICTED, WHICH MAY MAKE IT DIFFICULT FOR US TO COMPLETE A BUSINESS COMBINATION.
 
The regulatory scope of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the "Investment Company Act"), which was enacted principally for the purpose of regulating vehicles for pooled investments in securities, extends generally to companies engaged primarily in the business of investing, reinvesting, owning, holding or trading in securities. The Investment Company Act may, however, also be deemed to be applicable to a company which does not intend to be characterized as an investment company but which, nevertheless, engages in activities which may be deemed to be within the definitional scope of certain provisions of the Investment Company Act. We do not believe that our principal activities will subject us to regulation under the Investment Company Act. However, because our business model provides for, and encourages, us to accept stock of our client companies rather than cash as compensation for our services, there can be no assurance that we will not be deemed to be an investment company. If we are deemed to be an investment company, we may become subject to certain restrictions relating to our activities, including restrictions on the nature of our investments and the issuance of securities, which may create difficulties for future financings. In addition, the Investment Company Act imposes certain requirements on companies deemed to be within its regulatory scope, including registration as an investment company, adoption of a specific form of corporate structure and compliance with certain burdensome reporting, record keeping, voting, proxy, disclosure and other rules and regulations. In the event we are characterized as an investment company, our inability to satisfy such regulatory requirements, whether on a timely basis or at all, would, under certain circumstances, have a material adverse effect on us. If we were deemed to be subject to the Investment Company Act, compliance with these additional regulatory burdens would require additional expenses for which we have not allotted funds and may hinder our ability to consummate a business combination.

WE DO NOT CARRY BUSINESS INTERRUPTION OR OTHER INSURANCE, SO WE HAVE TO BEAR LOSSES OURSELVES.
 
We are subject to risk inherent to our business, including equipment failure, theft, natural disasters, industrial accidents, labor disturbances, business interruptions, property damage, product liability, personal injury and death. We do not carry any business interruption insurance or third-party liability insurance or other insurance to cover risks associated with our business. As a result, if we suffer losses, damages or liabilities, including those caused by natural disasters or other events beyond our control and we are unable to make a claim again a third party, we will be required to bear all such losses from our own funds, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
OUR LIMITED ABILITY TO PROTECT OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY, AND THE POSSIBILITY THAT OUR TECHNOLOGY COULD INADVERTENTLY INFRINGE TECHNOLOGY OWNED BY OTHERS, MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO COMPETE.
 
We rely on a combination of trade secret laws and confidentiality procedures to protect the technological know-how that comprise much of our intellectual property. We protect our technological know-how pursuant to non-disclosure and non-competition provisions contained in our third-party agreements, and agreements with them to keep confidential all information relating to our customers, methods, business and trade secrets. Third parties are also required to acknowledge and recognize that all inventions, trade secrets, works of authorship, developments and other processes made by them during their service term with us are our property.
 
A successful challenge to the ownership of our intellectual property could materially damage our business prospects. Our competitors may assert that our technologies or products infringe on their patents or proprietary rights. We may be required to obtain from other licenses that may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. Problems with intellectual property rights could increase the cost of our products or delay or preclude our new product development and commercialization. If infringement claims against us are deemed valid, we may not be able to obtain appropriate licenses on acceptable terms or at all. Litigation could be costly and time­ consuming but may be necessary to defend against infringement claims.
 
WE RELY ON THE LICENSE FROM PISA TO PROVIDE SOME OF OUR KEY SERVICES; ANY DETERIORATION OF OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH PISA'S MANAGEMENT COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS OPERATIONS.
 
On October 30, 2012, we entered in to an Intellectual Property License and Consulting agreement with Public Issuer Stock Analytics, LLC ("PISA"), a related party, that provides us with the exclusive right to market and sell certain of PISA's proprietary intellectual property/software. The PISA software is crucial for us to provide the type of consulting services we intend to offer and for researching the viability of pricing structures within the industry. Although we have a good relationship with PISA's management, there is not guarantee that we will be able to renew the license when the term expires with substantially similar terms or at all.
WE LICENSE TECHNOLOGY FROM THIRD PARTIES. IF WE ARE UNABLE TO MAINTAIN THESE LICENSES, OUR OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION MAY BE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED.
 
We currently license technology from a related party, but intend to license additional technologies from other third parties in the future. The loss of, our ability to maintain, or changes in material terms of these licenses could result in increased cost or delayed sales of our software and services, or may cause us to remove features from our products or services. We anticipate that we will continue to license technology from third parties in the future. This technology may not continue to be available on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. The impairment of these third-party relationships, especially if this impairment were to occur in unison, could result in delays in the delivery of our software and services until equivalent technology, if available, is identified, licensed and integrated. This delay could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.

10



THE TECHNOLOGY UNDERLYING OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES JS COMPLEX AND MAY CONTAIN UNKNOWN DEFECTS THAT COULD HARM OUR REPUTATION, RESULT IN PRODUCT LIABILITY OR DECREASE MARKET ACCEPTANCE OF OUR PRODUCTS.
 
The technology underlying our products is complex and includes software that is internally developed, and software licensed from third parties. These products have, and will in the future, contain errors or defects, particularly when first introduced or when new versions or enhancements are released. We may not discover defects that affect our current or new applications or enhancements until after they are sold, and our insurance coverage may not be sufficient to cover our complete liability exposure. Any defects in our products and services could damage our reputation. 
 

Cause our customers to initiate product liability suits against us 
 

Increase our product development resources 
 

Cause customers to cancel orders or potential customers to purchase competitive products or services 
 

Delay release or market acceptance of our products, or otherwise adversely impact our relationships with our customers or 
 

Cause us to allocate valuable engineering resources to fix our existing products, which may cause us to allocate fewer resources toward developing new products, or toward adding features to our existing products. 
 
WE BEAR THE RISK OF LOSS OF MAJOR CLIENTS, NONPAYMENT FROM OUR CLIENTS AND THE POSSIBLE EFFECTS OF BANKRUPTCY FILINGS BY CLIENTS, WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.
 
We intend to focus our business strategy on serving large corporate customers. While our strategy is intended to enable us to increase our revenues and earnings from our major corporate customers, the strategy also exposes us to increased risks arising from the possible loss of major customer accounts. If a large client experiences financial difficulty or is otherwise unable to meet its obligations as they become due, our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. Given the difficult economic environment, there is an increased risk of clients failing to pay or delaying payment. Once we begin to service more clients, if there is a significant amount of uncollected accounts receivables or customer defaults it would have a material adverse effect on our earnings and financial condition. In addition, we would have charge backs on existing accounts receivable and invoices on future sales of accounts receivable generated by such clients under our accounts receivable purchase agreements.
IF A SUFFICIENT NUMBER OF CUSTOMERS DO NOT ACCEPT OUR PRODUCTS, OUR BUSINESS MAY NOT SUCCEED.
 
We cannot predict how the market for our products and services will develop, and part of our strategic challenge will be to convince enterprise customers of the productivity, improved analysis suitability and other benefits of our services. As of the date of this filing, we only have one customer. Our future revenue and revenue growth rates will depend in large part on our success in delivering these services effectively, creating market acceptance for these services and meeting customer's needs for new or enhanced services. If we fail to do so, our services will not achieve widespread market acceptance, and we may not generate sufficient revenue to offset our product development and selling and marketing costs, which will hurt our business.
WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO INNOVATE TO MEET THE NEEDS OF OUR TARGET MARKET.
 
Our future success will continue to depend upon our ability to develop new products, product enhancements or service offerings that address future needs of our target markets and to respond to these changing standards and practices. The success of new products, product enhancements or service offerings depend on several factors, including the timely completion, quality and market acceptance of the product, enhancement or service. Our revenue could be reduced if we do not capitalize on our current market leadership by timely developing innovative new products, product enhancements or service offerings that will increase the likelihood that our products and services will be accepted in preference to the products and services of our current and future competitors.

11



IF OUR MARKETING AND LEAD GENERATION EFFORTS ARE NOT SUCCESSFUL, OUR BUSINESS WILL BE HARMED.
 
We believe that continued marketing efforts will be critical to achieve widespread acceptance of our products. Our marketing campaigns may not be successful given the expense required. For example, failure to adequately generate and develop sales leads could cause our future revenue growth to decrease. In addition, our inability to generate and cultivate sales leads into large organizations, where there is the potential for significant use of our products, could have a material effect on our business. We may not be able to identify and secure the number of strategic sales leads necessary to help generate marketplace acceptance of our services. If our marketing or lead-generation efforts are not successful, our business and operating results will be harm. 
OUR ARTICLES OF INCORPORATION MAY DELAY OR PREVENT A TAKE-OVER WHICH MAY NOT BE IN THE BEST INTERESTS OF OUR STOCKHOLDERS.
 
Our Articles of Incorporation authorize the issuance of up to 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock with such rights and preferences as maybe determined from time to time by our board of directors. Our board of directors may, without shareholder approval, issue additional classes of preferred stock with dividends, liquidation, conversion, voting or other rights that could adversely affect the voting power or other rights of the holders of our common stock.
IF THE MATERIAL WEAKNESSES OR OTHER DEFICIENCIES IN OUR INTERNAL ACCOUNTING PROCEDURES ARE NOT REMEDIATED, WE WILL NOT COMPLY WITH THE RULES UNDER THE SARBANES-OXLEY ACT RELATED TO ACCOUNTING CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES OR OUR STOCK PRICE COULD DECLINE SIGNIFICANTLY.
 
Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act required annual management assessments of the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting commencing December 31, 2007. Our management concluded the financial statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the two-years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, fairly present in all material respects our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S.
 
Our management evaluated the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017 based on the control criteria established in a report entitled Internal Control - Integrated Framework, issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013). Based on this evaluation, our management concluded our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of December 31, 2017. During its evaluation, as of December 31, 2017 our management identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting and other deficiencies as described in our annual report on Form 10-K for the years then ended. As a result, our investors could lose confidence in us, which could result in a decline in our stock price.
 
We are taking steps to remediate our material weaknesses. However, if we fail to achieve and maintain the adequacy of our internal controls, we may not be able to ensure that we can conclude in the future that we have effective internal controls over financial reporting in accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Moreover, effective internal controls, particularly those related to revenue recognition, are necessary for us to produce reliable financial reports and are important to helping prevent financial fraud. If we cannot provide reliable financial reports or prevent fraud, our business and operating results could be harmed, investors could lose confidence in our reported financial information, and the trading price of our stock could decline significantly. In addition, we cannot be certain that additional material weaknesses or other significant deficiencies in our internal controls will not be discovered in the future.
 
Risks Relating to Our Securities
 
LACK OF LIQUIDITY
 
There is currently only a limited public market for the Company's Common Stock and there can be no assurance that a more robust trading market will develop further or be maintained in the future.
OUR COMMON STOCK IS A "PENNY STOCK" AND MAY BE DIFFICULT TO SELL.
 
The SEC has adopted regulations which generally define a "penny stock" to be an equity security that has a market price of less than
 $5.00 per share or an exercise price of less than $5.00 per share, subject to specific exemptions. The market price of our common stock is less than $5.00 per share and, therefore, it may be designated as a "penny stock" according to SEC rules. This designation requires any broker or dealer selling these securities to disclose certain information concerning the transaction, obtain a written agreement from the purchaser and determine that the purchaser is reasonably suitable to purchase the securities. These rules may restrict the ability of brokers or dealers to sell our common stock and may affect the ability of investors to sell their shares.

THE MARKET FOR PENNY STOCKS HAS EXPERIENCED NUMEROUS FRAUDS AND ABUSES WHICH COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT INVESTORS IN OUR STOCK.
 
Penny stocks are frequent targets of fraud or market manipulation. Patterns of fraud and abuse include:
 

Control of the market for the security by one or a few broker-dealers that are often related to the promoter or issuer; 
 
Manipulation of prices through prearranged matching of purchases and sales and false and misleading press releases; 
 
Boiler room" practices involving high pressure sales tactics and unrealistic price projections by inexperienced sales persons; 
 
Excessive and undisclosed bid-ask differentials and markups by selling broker-dealers; and 
 
Wholesale dumping of the same securities by promoters and broker-dealers after prices have been manipulated to a desired level, along with the inevitable collapse of those prices with consequent investor losses 
 
Our management is aware of the abuses that have occurred historically in the penny stock market.
 
OUR STOCK PRICE JS VOLATILE, WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT YOUR INVESTMENT.
 
Our stock price, like that of other computer software companies, is highly volatile. Our stock price may be affected by such factors as:
 

product development announcements by us or our competitors; 
 
regulatory matters; 
 
announcements in the software community; 
 
intellectual property and legal matters; and 
 
broader industry and market trends unrelated to our performance 
 
In addition, if our revenues or operating results in any period fail to meet the investment community's expectations, there could be an immediate adverse impact on our stock price.
OUR PUBLICLY FILED REPORTS ARE SUBJECT TO REVIEW BY THE SEC, AND ANY SIGNIFICANT CHANGES OR AMENDMENTS REQUIRED AS A RESULT OF ANY SUCH REVIEW MAY RESULT IN MATERIAL LIABILITY TO US AND MAY HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE IMPACT ON THE TRADING PRICE OF THE COMPANY'S COMMON STOCK.
 
The reports of publicly traded companies are subject to review by the SEC from time to time for the purpose of assisting companies in complying with applicable disclosure requirements, and the SEC is required to undertake a comprehensive review of a company's reports at least once every three years under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. SEC reviews may be initiated at any time. We could be required to modify, amend or reformulate information contained in prior filings as a result of an SEC review. Any modification, amendment or reformulation of information contained in such reports could be significant and result in material liability to us and have a material adverse impact on the trading price of the Company's common stock.
STOCKHOLDER OWNERSHIP INTEREST IN OUR COMPANY MAY BE DILUTED AS A RESULT OF FUTURE FINANCINGS OR ADDITIONAL ACQUISITIONS.
 
As previously stated, we need to raise additional capital to carry out our business plans. We may seek to raise these funds in public or private issuances of equity and such financings may take place in the near future or over the longer term. Sales of our securities offered through future equity offerings may result in substantial dilution to the interests of our current shareholders. The sale of a substantial number of securities to investors, or anticipation of such sales, could make it more difficult for us to sell equity or equity-related securities in the future at a time and at a price that we might otherwise wish to effect sales. In addition, we have issued shares of our common stock for various consulting services or license agreements in the past and may do so in the future, which may also result in substantial dilution to the interests of our current shareholders.

ITEM l B.
UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS.

Although this item is not applicable to smaller reporting companies like us, management believes it is important to disclose the following information to you. 
 
Due to capital constraints, we were not able to timely file all of our periodic reports during the past three fiscal years; however, we have been working towards resolving that deficiency. We informed the SEC that we shall file all outstanding delinquent reports on or before October 31, 2018. We hope that by filing all the other delinquent reports by such date and the outstanding 10-K soon thereafter, will prevent the SEC from initiating an administrative proceeding to revoke our registration under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "Exchange Act") pursuant to Section 12G) of the Exchange Act.
