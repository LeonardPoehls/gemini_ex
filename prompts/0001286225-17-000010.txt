Company Overview
RealPage, Inc., a Delaware corporation (together with its subsidiaries, the “Company” or “we” or “us”), is a technology leader to the real estate industry, helping owners, managers, and investors optimize both operational yields and investment returns. Our platform of data analytics and software solutions enables the real estate rental industry to manage property operations (such as marketing, pricing, screening, leasing, and accounting), identify opportunities through market intelligence, and obtain data-driven insight for better operational and financial decision-making. Our integrated, on demand platform provides a single point of access and a massive repository of real-time lease transaction data, including prospect, renter, and property data. By leveraging data as well as integrating and streamlining a wide range of complex processes and interactions among the apartment real estate ecosystem (owners, managers, prospects, renters, service providers, and investors), our platform helps our clients improve financial and operational performance and prudently place and harvest capital. 
As of December 31, 2016, over 11,000 clients used one or more of our on demand software solutions to help manage the operations of approximately 11.0 million multifamily, single family, and vacation rental units. Our clients include each of the ten largest multifamily property management companies in the United States, ranked as of January 1, 2016 by the National Multifamily Housing Council ("NMHC"), based on the number of units managed.
We sell our solutions through our direct sales organization. Our total revenues were approximately $568.1 million, $468.5 million, and $404.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively. In the same periods, we had operating income (loss) of approximately $31.2 million, $(11.6) million, and $(15.5) million, respectively, and net income (loss) of approximately $16.7 million, $(9.2) million, and $(10.3) million, respectively. 
Our company was formed in 1998 to acquire Rent Roll, Inc., which marketed and sold on premise property management systems for the conventional and affordable multifamily rental housing markets. In June 2001, we released OneSite, our first on demand property management system. Since 2002, we have expanded our platform of data analytics and software-enabled solutions to include property management, lease management, resident services, and asset optimization capabilities. In addition to the multifamily markets, we now serve the single family, senior living, student living, military housing, and vacation rental markets. In addition, since July 2002, we have completed 35 acquisitions of complementary technologies to supplement our internal product development and sales and marketing efforts and expand the scope of our solutions, the types of rental real estate properties served by our solutions, and our client base. We have accumulated a massive repository of lease transaction data through our experience serving the rental real estate industry and through acquisitions. By leveraging this data, we provide the analysis and actionable data necessary for investors to make informed capital allocation decisions. In connection with our expansion and acquisition activity, we have allocated greater resources to the development and infrastructure needs of developing and increasing sales of our platform of solutions. 
Industry Overview
The rental real estate market is large, growing, and complex.
The rental real estate market is large and characterized by challenging and location-specific operating requirements, diverse industry participants, significant mobility among renters, and a variety of property types, including single family and a wide range of multifamily property types, including conventional, affordable, privatized military, student, and senior housing. According to the U.S. Census Bureau American Housing Survey for the United States, there were 44.0 million rental real estate units in the United States in 2013. Based on U.S. Census Bureau data and our own estimates, we believe that the overall size of the U.S. rental real estate market, including rent, utilities, and insurance, exceeds $435.0 billion annually. We estimate that the total addressable market for our current data analytics and on demand software solutions is approximately $9.8 billion per year. This estimate assumes that each of the 44.0 million rental units in the United States has the potential to generate annually a range of approximately $140 in revenue per unit for single family units to approximately $370 in revenue per unit for conventional multifamily units. In addition, we estimate that the student and senior markets have the potential to generate annually approximately $690 in revenue per unit and affordable housing markets will generate annually approximately $160 in revenue per unit. We base this potential revenue assumption on our review of the purchasing patterns of our existing clients with respect to our data analytics and on demand software solutions, the solutions currently utilized by our existing clients, the number of units our clients manage with these solutions, and our current pricing for data analytics and on demand software solutions. 
The global vacation rental market is large and generally segmented by the type of property and seasonality. Based on our industry research, we estimate the total global vacation rental market to be approximately $130.0 billion annually. Professional vacation managers, representing roughly 2.0 million units, are responsible for approximately half of the total vacation rental transactions in the market and the other half of the total transactions relate to properties that are individually managed by the property owners. We estimate that the total addressable market for our vacation rental solutions is approximately $1.6 billion
2

per year. This estimate assumes that each of the 2.0 million units managed has the potential to generate annual revenue per unit of $810. We estimate the potential revenue assumptions based on our review of market industry research and realistic solution penetration rates, as well as related trends affecting the vacation rental market, including the analysis of vacancy rates and the average number of nights booked.
We believe there is increasing demand for solutions that bring efficiency and precision to the rental real estate industry, which has historically lacked the tools available to other investment classes. We leverage our massive pool of lease transaction data to provide our clients with analytical tools and actionable intelligence to inform the prudent allocation of capital. Precision data analytics and price optimization solutions represent a significant opportunity to increase yield from the approximate $3.0 trillion of apartment stock in the U.S., turning over at a rate of approximately $150.0 billion per year.
Rental real estate management spans both the renter life cycle and the operations of a property.
The renter life cycle can be separated into four key stages: prospect, applicant, residency or stay, and post-residency or post-stay. Each stage has unique requirements, and a property owner’s or manager’s ability to effectively address these requirements can significantly impact revenue and profitability.
In addition to managing the renter life cycle, property owners and managers must also manage the operations of their properties. Critical components of property operations include materials and service provider procurement; insurance and risk mitigation; utility and energy management; yield management; information technology and telecommunications management; accounting; expense tracking and management; document management; security; staff hiring and training; staff performance measurement and management; and marketing.
Managing the renter life cycle and the operations of a property involves several different constituents, including property owners and managers, prospects, renters, service providers, and investors. Property owners can include single-property owners, multi-property owners, national residential apartment syndicates that may own thousands of units through a variety of investment funds, and real estate investment trusts ("REITs"). Property managers often are responsible for a large number of properties that can range from single family units to multifamily apartment communities. Property owners and managers also need to manage a variety of service providers, including utilities, insurance providers, video, voice and data providers, and maintenance and capital goods suppliers. Managing these diverse relationships, combined with renter turnover, property turnover, as well as regulatory and compliance requirements, can make the operations of even a small portfolio of rental properties complex. Challenges are compounded for real estate portfolio managers responsible for a large number of geographically dispersed properties, which require overseeing potentially hundreds of thousands of individual rental processes.
Legacy information technology solutions designed to manage the rental real estate management process are inadequate.
During the 1970’s and 1980’s, the rental real estate industry was highly fragmented and regionally organized. During this period, the first property management systems and software solutions emerged to help property owners and managers with basic accounting and record keeping functions. These solutions provided limited functionality and scalability and often were not tailored to the specific needs of the rental real estate industry.
Beginning in the mid 1990’s, the rental real estate market began to consolidate and large, nationally focused and publicly financed companies emerged, which aggregated significant numbers of units. The rise of national real estate portfolio managers, many of them accountable to public shareholders, created a need for more sophisticated and scalable property management systems that included a centralized database and were designed to optimize and automate multiple business processes within the renter life cycle and property operations. Despite increasing market demands, the available solutions continued to be insufficient to fully address the complex requirements of the rental real estate industry, which moved beyond basic accounting and record keeping functions to also include value-added services, such as Internet marketing, applicant screening, billing solutions and analytics for pricing, and yield optimization. Additionally, the rise of national syndicates and REITs fueled the need for tools that provide increased visibility into the operational performance of portfolio properties and market analysis resources to maximize return on investment.
To address its complex and evolving requirements, the rental real estate industry has historically implemented a myriad of single point solutions; general purpose applications, such as Microsoft Excel; and/or internally developed solutions to manage their properties. These solutions can be expensive to implement and maintain; often lack integrated functionality to help rental real estate owners, managers, and investors maximize operational yields; and do not have dynamic reporting and analysis tools necessary to optimize investment returns or support capital allocation decisions. In addition, many professionals in the rental real estate industry still rely on paper or spreadsheet-based approaches, which are typically time intensive and prone to human error or internal mismanagement.
The rental real estate industry has relied upon print and Internet listing firms to attract leads required to fill available vacancies.

We believe these historical solutions are inadequate because they:

• | require significant customization to implement, which frequently inhibits upgrading to new versions or platforms in a timely manner;


• | require information technology ("IT") resources to support integration points between property management systems and disparate value-added services;


• | require IT resources to implement and maintain data security, data integrity, performance, and business continuity solutions;


• | lack scalability and flexibility to account for the expansion or contraction of a property portfolio;


• | lack material organic lease generation capability and do not track the cost of leads generated by each source;


• | lack effective spend management capabilities for controlling property management costs;


• | lack comprehensive analytics for pricing and yield optimization;


• | lack workflow level integration;


• | do not provide owners, managers, and investors with visibility into overall property performance; and


• | cannot be easily updated to meet new regulations and compliance requirements.

On demand software solutions are well suited to meet the rental real estate market's needs.
The ubiquitous nature of the Internet, widespread broadband adoption, and improved network reliability and security has enabled the deployment and delivery of business-critical applications online. The on demand delivery model is substantially more economical than traditional on premise software solutions that generally have higher deployment and support costs and require the client to purchase and maintain the associated servers, storage, networks, security, and disaster recovery solutions.
The RealPage Solution 
We provide a technology platform of data analytics and on demand software solutions that integrates and streamlines rental real estate management and property operations. Our platform provides the analytical and software solutions necessary to optimize operational yields and returns on investment, and contributes to a more efficient property management process and an improved experience for all of the constituents involved in the rental real estate ecosystem.
Benefits to our Clients
We believe the benefits of our solutions for our clients include the following:
Increased revenues:  Our data analytics and on demand software solutions enable our clients to increase their revenues and optimize operational yields by improving their sales and marketing effectiveness; pricing and occupancy; and collection of rental payments, utility expenses, late fees, and other charges. Additionally, our solutions enable our clients to realize new sources of revenue from complementary solutions and services.
Reduced operating costs:  Our data analytics and on demand software solutions help our clients reduce costs and optimize operational yields by streamlining and automating many ongoing property management functions; centralizing and controlling purchasing by on-site personnel; and transferring costs from the site to more efficient centrally managed operations. Our on demand delivery model also reduces a rental property's operating costs by eliminating the need to own and support the applications or associated hardware infrastructure. In addition, our integrated solutions consolidate the initial implementation and training costs and ongoing support associated with multiple applications. This is particularly important for rental real estate professionals who want to reduce enterprise-class IT infrastructure, support, and staff training.
Improved quality of service for renters and prospects:  Our solutions improve the level of service that rental real estate properties provide to renters and prospects by enabling certain types of transactions to be completed online; expediting the processing of rental applications, maintenance service requests, and payments; and increasing the frequency and quality of communication with their renters and prospects. This provides higher renter satisfaction and increased differentiation from competing properties that do not use our solutions while optimizing operational yields.
Streamlined and simplified property management business processes:  Our platform provides integrated solutions for managing a wide variety of property management processes that have traditionally been managed by separate manual or disaggregated applications. Our on demand software solutions utilize common authentication that enables data sharing and workflow automation of certain business processes, thereby eliminating redundant data entry and simplifying many recurring tasks. The efficiency of our solutions allows for optimization of operational yields.
Greater visibility into real estate investment portfolio:  Our portfolio management solutions are designed specifically for general partners, limited partners, property management professionals, and other real estate investment firms. These solutions allow stakeholders to quickly combine financial and operating metrics based upon portfolio attributes to evaluate performance, 
4

trends, and operations across a portfolio, as well as facilitate the assessment of potential asset management strategies. These solutions provide an unprecedented level of visibility into a real estate portfolio, including information down to the property level, and are designed to work with any property management system. Our portfolio management solutions provide stakeholders the critical information necessary to maximize investment returns and prudently allocate and harvest capital investment.
Ability to integrate third-party products and services:  Our open architecture and application framework facilitate the integration of third-party applications and services into our solutions. This enables our clients to conduct these business functions through the same system that they already use for many of their other tasks and to leverage the same repository of lease transaction data, including prospect, renter, and property data, that supports our solutions.
Increased visibility into property performance:  Our platform of data analytics and on demand software solutions enable rental real estate owners, managers, and investors to gain a comprehensive view of the operational and financial performance of each of their properties. Our solutions provide a library of standard reports, dashboards, scorecards, and alerts, and we also provide interfaces to several widely used report writers and business intelligence tools. We maintain a massive repository of real-time lease transaction data, subsets of which can be utilized to factor rental payment history into applicant screening processes and to create more accurate supply and demand models and statistically based price elasticity models to improve price optimization. This enables our clients to optimize both operational yields and investment returns.
Simple implementation and support:  Our platform of solutions includes pre-configured extensions that meet the specific needs of a variety of property types and can be easily tailored by our clients to meet more specific requirements of their properties and business processes. We strive to minimize the need for professional consulting services to implement our solutions and train personnel.
Improved scalability:  We host our solutions for our clients, thereby reducing or eliminating our clients’ costs associated with expanding or contracting IT infrastructure as their property portfolios evolve. We also bear the risk of technological obsolescence because we own and manage our data center infrastructure and are continually upgrading it to newer generations of technology without incremental cost to our clients.
Competitive Strengths of our Solutions
The competitive strengths of our solutions are as follows:
Integrated on demand software platform based on a repository of real-time lease transaction data:  Our solutions are delivered through an integrated on demand software platform that provides a single point of access via the Internet with a common repository of lease transaction data, including prospect, renter, and property data, which permits our solutions to access requested data through offline data transfer or in real-time.
Large and growing apartment real estate ecosystem:  At December 31, 2016, our client base of over 11,000 clients used one or more of our integrated data analytics or on demand software solutions to help manage the operations of approximately 11.0 million rental real estate units. Our solutions automate and streamline many of the recurring transactions and interactions among this large and expanding apartment real estate ecosystem, including prospect inquiries, applications, monthly rent payments, and service requests. As the number of constituents of the apartment real estate ecosystem increases, the volume of lease transaction date in our repository and its value to the constituents of the ecosystem grows.
Comprehensive platform of data analytics and on demand software solutions and services for the rental real estate industry:  Our platform of solutions and services provide a broad range of analytical and on demand capabilities for managing the renter life cycle and core operational processes for property management. This integrated, on demand platform enables our clients to optimize operational yields and investment returns.
Precision data analytics and price optimization tools based on in-depth lease transaction data:  The combination of our massive pool of lease transaction data, our expertise in apartment marketing dynamics, our data science team that can extract actionable insights, and our forecasting abilities creates a unique competitive advantage. Our statistical-based modeling and forecasting solutions provide our clients with granular, market-specific intelligence which facilitates the optimization of operational yields and returns on investment. Precision data analytics and price optimization solutions represent a significant opportunity to increase yields from the nearly $3.0 trillion of apartment stock in the U.S., turning over at a rate of $150.0 billion per year.
Open cloud computing architecture:  Our cloud computing architecture enables our solutions to interface with our clients’ existing systems and allows our clients to outsource the management of third-party business applications. This open architecture enables our clients to buy our solutions incrementally while continuing to use existing third-party solutions, allowing us to shorten sales cycles and increase adoption of our solutions within our target markets.
Deep rental real estate industry expertise:  We have been serving the rental real estate industry exclusively for over 18 years and our senior management team members have extensive experience in the rental real estate industry. We design our 
5

solutions based on our extensive expertise, insight into industry trends and developments, and property management best practices that help our clients simplify the challenges of owning and managing rental properties.
Experienced management team with strong integrating and operating track record:  We have a highly seasoned and effective management team with extensive expertise in the rental real estate industry.

We continue to attract and retain experienced management talent to support our growth.
Our Strategy
We intend to leverage our platform of solutions and industry presence to solidify our position as a technology leader to the real estate industry. The key elements of our strategy to accomplish this objective are as follows:
Acquire new clients:  We intend to actively pursue new client relationships with property management professionals and investors that do not currently use our solutions. In addition to marketing our property management solutions, we will seek to sell our software-enabled, value-added services to clients of other third-party property management systems by utilizing our open architecture to facilitate integration of our solutions with those systems.
Increase the adoption of the RealPage platform:  Many of our clients rely on our platform to manage their daily operations and track all of their critical prospect, renter, and property information. Additionally, some of our clients utilize our software-enabled, value-added services to complement third-party Enterprise Resource Planning ("ERP") systems. We have continually introduced new software-enabled, value-added services to complement our platform of solutions and marketed our on demand solutions to our clients who are utilizing third-party ERP systems. We believe that the penetration of our on demand software solutions to date has been modest and significant potential exists for additional on demand revenue from sales of these solutions to our client base. We have significant opportunities to further leverage the critical role that our solutions play in our clients’ operations by increasing the adoption of our platform of solutions and value-added services within our existing client base, and we intend to actively focus on up-selling and cross-selling our solutions to our clients.
Add new features and functionality to our rental real estate industry platform:  We believe that we offer the most comprehensive platform of data analytics and on demand software solutions for the rental real estate industry. Our platform enables our clients to control many aspects of the residential rental property management process. We are able to add new capabilities that further enhance our platform, and we intend to continue developing and introducing new solutions to sell to both new and existing clients. These solutions may include localized solutions to support our clients as they grow their international operations. We also intend to develop new relationships with third-party application providers that can use our open architecture to offer additional product and service capabilities to their clients through our platform.
Pursue acquisitions of complementary businesses, products, and technologies:  Since July 2002, we have completed 35 acquisitions that have enabled us to expand our platform, enter into new rental property markets, and expand our client base. We continue to selectively evaluate our capital allocation strategy to focus on the most efficient sources of capital available to us for the acquisition of businesses and technologies that may help us accomplish these and other strategic objectives.

On Demand Delivery Infrastructure
Our IT infrastructure operates four redundant 40 GBPS dedicated fiber links connecting data centers containing hundreds of servers and multiple storage area networks. This architecture makes it possible to expand the data center incrementally with little or no disruption as more users or additional applications are added. With approximately 6,750 virtual servers, 630 physical servers and 5.4 petabytes of data storage, we leverage this infrastructure and massive repository of lease transaction data to power our platform of solutions.
Our infrastructure is based on an open architecture that enables third-party applications to access OneSite and other hosted applications through our RealPage Exchange platform that provides access to more than 100 different public and private web services and extensible markup language ("XML") gateways that are used to import and export data through third-party application program interfaces ("APIs") and process hundreds of thousands of transactions per day. RealPage Exchange also interfaces with third-party property management systems as well as our platform solutions.
In addition, our system is designed to replicate data into a Universal Data Store ("UDS") each day. Access to UDS is enabled through an access layer called UDS Direct, which enables clients to build portfolio reports, dashboards and alerts using any Open Database Connectivity or Java Database Connectivity compliant report writer tool such as Microsoft Excel, Microsoft Access, Microsoft SQL Server Reporting Service or Crystal Reports. UDS is also transmitted to a number of our larger clients each night to feed portfolio reporting systems that they have built internally.
As of December 31, 2016, we employed approximately 160 employees who were responsible for maintaining data security, integrity, availability, performance and business continuity in our cloud computing facilities. We annually obtain a Service Organization Controls audit performed under Statements on Standards for Attestation Engagements No. 16 on a specified set of internal controls. Certain clients conduct separate business continuity audits of their own.
In addition to our production data centers, we manage a separate development and quality assurance testing facility used to control the pre-production testing required before each new release of our on demand software. We typically deploy new releases of the software underlying our on demand software solutions on a monthly or quarterly schedule depending on the solution.
Product Support
We offer product support services that provide our clients with assistance from our product support professionals by phone, web, or email in resolving issues with our solutions. We offer two product support options: Standard and Platinum Support. Standard Support includes product support during business hours Monday through Friday. Platinum Support includes

the features of Standard Support, with customized engagement that includes a designated senior product support liaison. We also sponsor the RealPage User Group to facilitate communications between us and our community of users. The RealPage User Group is governed by a steering committee of our clients, which consists of two elected positions and subcommittee chairs, each representing a RealPage product center or group of product centers.
Product Development
We devote a substantial portion of our resources to developing new solutions and enhancing existing solutions, conducting product and quality assurance testing, improving core technology, and strengthening our technological expertise in the rental real estate industry. We typically deploy new releases of the software underlying our on demand software solutions on a monthly or quarterly schedule depending on the solution. As of December 31, 2016, our product development group consisted of approximately 420 employees in the United States and 490 employees located in India, Canada, Spain and the Philippines. Product development expense totaled $73.6 million, $68.8 million and $64.4 million during the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively.
Sales and Marketing
We sell our rental real estate software and services through our direct sales organization. As of December 31, 2016, we employed approximately 430 sales representatives. We organize our sales force by geographic region, size of our prospective clients, and property type. This focus provides a higher level of service and understanding of our clients’ unique needs. Our typical sales cycle with a prospective client begins with the generation of a sales lead through Internet marketing, email campaigns, telemarketing efforts, trade shows, or other means of referral. The sales lead is followed by an assessment of the prospective client’s requirements, sales presentations, and product demonstrations. Our sales cycle can vary substantially from client to client but typically requires three to six months for larger clients and one to six weeks for smaller clients.
In addition to new client sales, we sell additional solutions and consulting services to our existing clients to help them more efficiently and effectively manage their properties as the rental real estate market evolves and competitive conditions change.
We generate qualified client leads, accelerate sales opportunities, and build brand awareness through our marketing programs. Our marketing programs target property management company executives, technology professionals, and senior business leaders. Our marketing team focuses on the unique needs of clients within our target markets. Our marketing programs include the following activities:

• | field marketing events for clients and prospects;


• | participation in, and sponsorship of, user conferences, trade shows, and industry events;


• | client programs, including client user meetings and our online client community;


• | online marketing activities, including online advertising and SEO, email campaigns, web campaigns, white papers, free product trials and demos, webcasts, case studies, and the use of social media, including blogging, Facebook, LinkedIn, and Twitter;


• | public relations;


• | use of our website to provide product and company information, as well as learning opportunities for potential clients; and


• | ongoing consumer email marketing campaigns that drive adoption of transactional products, such as online payments and renter's insurance, by residents on behalf of our property management clients.

We host an annual user conference where clients both participate in and lead various types of sessions and planned discussions designed to help accelerate business performance through the use of our integrated platform of solutions. The conference features a variety of client speakers, panelists, and presentations focused on businesses of all sizes. The event also brings together our clients, technology vendors, service providers, and other key participants in the rental real estate industry to exchange ideas and best practices for improving business performance. Attendees gain insight into our product plans and participate in interactive sessions that give them the opportunity to provide input into new features and functionality.
Strategic Relationships
We maintain relationships with a variety of technology vendors and service providers to enhance the capabilities of our integrated platform of solutions. This approach allows us to expand our platform and client base and to enter new markets. We have established the following types of strategic relationships:
11

Technology Vendors
We have relationships with a number of leading technology companies whose products we integrate into our platform or offer to complement our solutions. The cooperative relationships with our software and hardware technology partners allow us to build, optimize, and deliver a broad range of solutions to our clients.
Service Providers
We have relationships with a number of service providers that offer complementary services that integrate into our platform and address key requirements of rental property owners and managers, including credit card and ACH services, transaction processing capabilities, and insurance underwriting services.
Clients
We are committed to developing long-term client relationships and working closely with our clients to configure our solutions to meet the evolving needs of the rental real estate industry. Our clients include REITs, leading property management companies, fee managers, regionally based owner operators, vacation property owners, and service providers. As of December 31, 2016, we had over 11,000 clients who used one or more of our on demand software solutions to help manage the operations of approximately 11.0 million rental real estate units. Our clients include each of the ten largest multifamily property management companies in the United States, ranked as of January 1, 2016 by the NMHC, based on number of units managed. For the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, no one client accounted for more than 10% of our revenue. Revenues for our largest client were 5.7%, 4.6%, and 4.9% of total revenues for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively.
Intellectual Property
We rely on a combination of copyright, trademark, and trade secret laws, as well as confidentiality procedures and contractual restrictions, to establish and protect our proprietary rights. These laws, procedures, and restrictions provide only limited protection. We currently have no issued patents or pending patent applications. In the future, we may file patent applications, but patents may not be issued with respect to these patent applications, or if patents are issued, they may not provide us with any competitive advantages, may not be issued in a manner that gives us the protection that we seek, and may be successfully challenged by third parties.
We endeavor to enter into agreements with our employees and contractors and with parties with whom we do business in order to limit access to and disclosure of our proprietary information. We cannot be certain that the steps we have taken will prevent unauthorized use or reverse engineering of our technology. Moreover, others may independently develop technologies that are competitive with ours or that infringe on our intellectual property. The enforcement of our intellectual property rights also depends on any legal actions against these infringers being successful, but these actions may not be successful, even when our rights have been infringed.
Furthermore, effective patent, trademark, trade dress, copyright, and trade secret protection may not be available in every country in which our solutions are available over the Internet. In addition, the legal standards relating to the validity, enforceability, and scope of protection of intellectual property rights are uncertain and still evolving.
Employees
As of December 31, 2016, we had approximately 4,400 employees. We believe that our success is attributable in large part to our employees and an experienced management team, many members of which have years of industry experience in building, implementing, marketing, and selling property management solutions critical to business operations. Our future performance depends in part upon the continued service of our key sales, marketing, technical, and senior management personnel and our continuing ability to attract and retain highly qualified personnel. We believe we have a corporate culture that attracts highly qualified and motivated employees. We consider our current relationship with our employees to be good. Our employees are not represented by a labor union and are not subject to a collective bargaining agreement.
