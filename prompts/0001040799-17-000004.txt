Item 1 - Business
Overview
Four Oaks Bank & Trust Company (referred to herein as the “Bank”) was incorporated under the laws of the State of North Carolina in 1912. On February 5, 1997, the Bank formed Four Oaks Fincorp, Inc. (referred to herein as the “Company”; references herein to “we,” “us” and “our” refer to the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries, unless the context otherwise requires) for the purpose of serving as a holding company for the Bank. Our corporate offices and banking offices are located in eastern and central North Carolina. We have no significant assets other than cash, the capital stock of the Bank and its membership interest in Four Oaks Mortgage Services, L.L.C. (inactive).
In addition, we have an interest in Four Oaks Statutory Trust I, a wholly owned Delaware statutory business trust (the “Trust”), for the sole purpose of issuing trust preferred securities.  The Trust is not included in the consolidated financial statements of the Company.

The wealth management services listed above are made available through an arrangement with Lincoln Financial Services Corporation acting as a registered broker-dealer performing the brokerage services. The securities involved in these services are not deposits or other obligations of the Bank and are not insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”).
Residential mortgages are originated by Four Oaks Mortgage Company, a division of Four Oaks Bank & Trust Company. Upon closing, these loans, together with their servicing rights, are sold to mortgage loan investors under prearranged terms. 
Our market area is concentrated in eastern and central North Carolina.  From its headquarters located in Four Oaks and its fifteen other locations, the Bank serves a major portion of Johnston County, and parts of Wake, Harnett, Duplin, and Sampson counties. In Four Oaks, the main office is located at 6144 US 301 South. The Bank also operates a branch office in Clayton at 102 East Main Street, two in Smithfield at 128 North Second Street, and 403 South Brightleaf Boulevard, one in Garner at 200 Glen Road, one in Raleigh at 1408 Garner Station Boulevard, one in Benson at 200 East Church Street, one in Fuquay-Varina at 325 North Judd Parkway Northeast, one in Wallace at 406 East Main Street, one in Holly Springs at 201 West Center Street, one in Harrells at 590 Tomahawk Highway, one in Zebulon at 805 North Arendell Avenue, and one in Dunn at 115 Four Oaks Place. The Bank additionally operates a loan production office in Raleigh at 5909 Falls of Neuse Road and one in Apex at 1091 Investment Boulevard. 
Johnston County has a diverse economy and is not dependent on any one particular industry.  The leading industries in the area include retail trade, manufacturing, pharmaceuticals, government, services, construction, wholesale trade and agriculture. The majority of the Bank’s customers are individuals and small to medium-size businesses. The deposits and loans are well diversified with no material concentration in a single industry or group of related industries. There are no seasonal factors that would have any material adverse effect on the Bank’s business, and the Bank does not rely on foreign sources of funds or income.
On March 22, 2013, the Bank sold selected deposits and assets associated with two branches located in Rockingham and Southern Pines, North Carolina. The transaction was consummated pursuant to a definitive purchase and assumption agreement with First Bank of Troy, North Carolina, which was entered into on September 26, 2012. Under the terms of the purchase and assumption agreement, First Bank assumed the selected customer deposits of both branches offset by the purchase of (i) the aggregate net book value of the real property and related tangible personal property of the Rockingham, North Carolina branch as well as the cash on hand at the Rockingham and Southern Pines, North Carolina branches, (ii) the aggregate of certain loans for both branches, and (iii) a 1% premium of the deposits assumed.

On March 24, 2014, the Company entered into a securities purchase agreement (the “Securities Purchase Agreement”) with Kenneth R. Lehman (the “Standby Investor”) and, on June 18, 2014, the Company commenced its shareholder rights offering (the “Rights Offering”). On August 15, 2014, the Company concluded the Rights Offering and concurrent standby offering to the Standby Investor (the “Standby Offering”), in which the Company issued an aggregate of 4,800,000 shares of common stock at $5.00 per share for aggregate gross proceeds of $24.0 million (the maximum permissible pursuant to the terms of the Rights Offering and Standby Offering). During the third quarter of 2014, the Company identified problem assets and began the disposition process under the asset resolution plan (the "Asset Resolution Plan"), as required by the Securities Purchase Agreement. The Asset Resolution Plan was completed in the fourth quarter of 2015.
On March 8, 2017, the Company completed a one for five reverse stock split of the Company’s authorized, issued, and outstanding common stock, par value $1.00 per share (the “Reverse Stock Split”). The number of authorized shares of common stock was reduced from 80,000,000 to 16,000,000. At that time, every five shares of the Company’s issued and outstanding common stock were automatically combined into one issued and outstanding share of the Company’s common stock. No fractional shares were issued in connection with the Reverse Stock Split, and any fractional shares resulting from the Reverse Stock Split were rounded up to the nearest whole share. All share and share-related information presented in this Annual Report on Form 10-K have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the decreased number of shares resulting from the Reverse Stock Split. 
The following table sets forth certain of our financial data and ratios for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 derived from our audited financial statements and notes. This information should be read in conjunction with and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the more detailed audited financial statements and notes thereto included in this report:

 | 2016 | | 2015
 | (in thousands, except ratios)
Net income | $ | 6,858 | | | $ | 20,008 
Average equity capital accounts | $ | 63,879 | | | $ | 51,830 
Ratio of net income to average equity capital accounts | 10.7 | % | | 38.6 | %
Average daily total deposits | $ | 552,015 | | | $ | 570,759
Ratio of net income to average daily total deposits | 1.2 | % | | 3.5 | %
Average daily loans | $ | 483,741 | | | $ | 458,679
Ratio of average daily loans to average daily total deposits | 87.6 | % | | 80.4 | %

Employees
At December 31, 2016, we employed 175 full time employees and 6 part time employees.  Our employees are extremely important to our continued success and the Bank considers its relationship with its employees to be good.  Management continually seeks ways to improve upon their benefits and well being.
Competition
Commercial banking in North Carolina is extremely competitive due in large part to North Carolina’s early adoption of statewide branching. As a result, many commercial banks have branches located in several communities. The Bank competes in its market area with some of the largest banking organizations in the state and the country and other financial institutions, such as federally and state-chartered savings and loan institutions. At June 2016, we operated branches in Johnston, Wake, Sampson, Duplin, and Harnett counties, North Carolina. At that time in Johnston County, North Carolina, the Bank’s primary market, there were a total of 40 branches represented by 12 FDIC insured financial institutions. The Bank ranked second among the 12 banks with approximately $330 million or 21% of the Johnston County deposit market share. Many of the Bank’s competitors have broader geographic markets and higher lending limits than those of the Bank and are also able to provide more services and make greater use of media advertising.  In our market area, the Bank has significant competition for deposits and loans from other depository institutions and credit unions, as well as consumer finance companies, mortgage companies and other lenders engaged in the business of extending credit with varying degrees of regulatory restrictions. Additionally, credit unions have been permitted to expand their membership criteria and expand their loan services to include traditional bank services such as commercial lending creating a greater competitive disadvantage for tax-paying financial institutions.
The enactment of legislation authorizing interstate banking has caused great increases in the size and financial resources of some of the Bank’s competitors. See “Holding Company Regulation” below for a description of this legislation.  In addition, as a result of interstate banking, out-of-state commercial banks may acquire North Carolina banks and heighten the competition among banks in North Carolina.
5

Although the competition in its market areas is expected to continue to be significant, the Bank believes that it has certain competitive advantages that distinguish it from its competition such as: a strong local brand, its affiliation with the community, and its emphasis on providing specialized services to small and medium-sized businesses as well as professional and high net worth individuals. The Bank offers its customers modern, high-tech banking without forsaking community values such as prompt, friendly, and personalized service. Being responsive and sensitive to individualized needs helps the Bank to attract and retain customers.  To continue attracting new customers, the Bank also relies on goodwill and referrals from our shareholders and satisfied customers, as well as traditional media.  To enhance a positive image in the community and support one of the Bank's values, we participate in many local events, and our officers and directors serve on boards of local civic and charitable organizations.
Supervision and Regulation
Holding companies, banks and many of their non-bank affiliates are extensively regulated under both federal and state law. The following is a brief summary of certain statutes, rules, and regulations affecting us and the Bank. This summary is qualified in its entirety by reference to the particular statutory and regulatory provisions referred to below and are not intended to be an exhaustive description of the statutes or regulations applicable to the business of the Company or Bank. Supervision, regulation and examination of the Company and the Bank by bank regulatory agencies is intended primarily for the protection of the Bank’s depositors rather than the Company’s shareholders.
Holding Company Regulation
Overview
Four Oaks Fincorp, Inc. is a holding company registered with the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the "Federal Reserve") under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 (the “BHCA”). As such, we are subject to the supervision, examination and reporting requirements contained in the BHCA and the regulation of the Federal Reserve. The Bank is also subject to the BHCA. The BHCA requires that a bank holding company obtain the prior approval of the Federal Reserve before (i) acquiring direct or indirect ownership or control of more than five percent of the voting shares of any bank, (ii) taking any action that causes a bank to become a subsidiary of the bank holding company, (iii) acquiring all or substantially all of the assets of any bank or (iv) merging or consolidating with any other bank holding company.
The BHCA generally prohibits a bank holding company, with certain exceptions, from engaging in activities other than banking, or managing or controlling banks or other permissible subsidiaries, and from acquiring or retaining direct or indirect control of any company engaged in any activities other than those activities determined by the Federal Reserve to be closely related to banking, or managing or controlling banks, as to be a proper incident thereto. In determining whether a particular activity is permissible, the Federal Reserve must consider whether the performance of such an activity can reasonably be expected to produce benefits to the public, such as greater convenience, increased competition or gains in efficiency, that outweigh possible adverse effects, such as undue concentration of resources, decreased or unfair competition, conflicts of interest or unsound banking practices. For example, banking, operating a thrift institution, extending credit or servicing loans, leasing real or personal property, providing securities brokerage services, providing certain data processing services, acting as agent or broker in selling credit life insurance and certain other types of insurance underwriting activities have all been determined by regulations of the Federal Reserve to be permissible activities.
Pursuant to delegated authority, the FRB has authority to approve certain activities of holding companies within its district, including us, provided the nature of the activity has been approved by the Federal Reserve. Despite prior approval, the Federal Reserve has the power to order a holding company or its subsidiaries to terminate any activity or to terminate its ownership or control of any subsidiary when it believes that continuation of such activity or such ownership or control constitutes a serious risk to the financial safety, soundness or stability of any bank subsidiary of that bank holding company.
Effective December 2, 2009, we elected to become a bank holding company, and therefore we are not subject to the financial holding company regulatory framework under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (“GLBA”).  However, the additional customer privacy protections introduced by the GLBA do apply to us and the Bank. The GLBA’s privacy provisions require financial institutions to, among other things: (i) establish and annually disclose a privacy policy, (ii) give consumers the right to opt out of disclosures to nonaffiliated third parties, with certain exceptions, (iii) refuse to disclose consumer account information to third-party marketers and (iv) follow regulatory standards to protect the security and confidentiality of consumer information.
Pursuant to the GLBA’s rulemaking provisions, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, the FDIC, and the Office of Thrift Supervision adopted regulations, establishing standards for safeguarding customer information. Such regulations provide financial institutions guidance in establishing and implementing administrative, technical, and physical safeguards to protect the security, confidentiality, and integrity of customer information.

Mergers and Acquisitions
The Riegle-Neal Interstate Banking and Branching Efficiency Act of 1994 (the “IBBEA”) permits interstate acquisitions of banks and bank holding companies without geographic limitation, subject to any state requirement that the bank has been organized for a minimum period of time, not to exceed five years, and the requirement that the bank holding company, prior to or following the proposed acquisition, controls no more than 10% of the total amount of deposits of insured depository institutions in the U.S. and no more than 30% of such deposits in any state (or such lesser or greater amount set by state law).
In addition, the IBBEA permits a bank to merge with a bank in another state as long as neither of the states has opted out of the IBBEA prior to May 31, 1997.  In 1995, the State of North Carolina “opted in” to such legislation. In addition, a bank may establish and operate a de novo branch in a state in which the bank does not maintain a branch if that state expressly permits de novo interstate branching. As a result of North Carolina having opted-in, unrestricted interstate de novo branching is permitted in North Carolina.
Additional Restrictions and Oversight 
Subsidiary banks of a bank holding company are subject to certain restrictions imposed by the Federal Reserve on any extensions of credit to the bank holding company or any of its subsidiaries, investments in the stock or securities thereof and the acceptance of such stock or securities as collateral for loans to any borrower. A bank holding company and its subsidiaries are also prevented from engaging in certain tie-in arrangements in connection with any extension of credit, lease or sale of property or furnishing of services. An example of a prohibited tie-in would be any arrangement that would condition the provision or cost of services on a customer obtaining additional services from the bank holding company or any of its other subsidiaries.
The Federal Reserve may issue cease and desist orders against bank holding companies and non-bank subsidiaries to stop actions believed to present a serious threat to a subsidiary bank. The Federal Reserve also regulates certain debt obligations, changes in control of bank holding companies and capital requirements.
Under the provisions of North Carolina law, we are registered with and subject to supervision by the North Carolina Office of the Commissioner of Banks (the "NCCOB").
Dodd-Frank Act 
The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the "Dodd-Frank Act"), which was enacted on July 21, 2010, was intended primarily to overhaul the financial regulatory framework following the global financial crisis and impacts all financial institutions including our holding company and the Bank. The Dodd-Frank Act contains significant regulatory and compliance changes, including, among other things. 

• | enhanced authority over troubled and failing banks and their holding companies;


• | increased capital and liquidity requirements;


• | increased regulatory examination fees; and


• | specific provisions designed to improve supervision and safety and soundness by imposing restrictions and limitations on the scope and type of banking and financial activities.

In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act changes the framework for systemic risk oversight within the financial system that will be enforced by several federal regulatory agencies, including the Financial Stability Oversight Council, the Federal Reserve, the Office of Comptroller of the Currency, the FDIC, and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (the "CFPB"). The Dodd-Frank Act requires the various federal agencies to adopt a broad range of implementing rules and regulations and to prepare numerous studies and reports for the U.S. Congress. The federal agencies are given significant discretion in drafting the implementing rules and regulations, and consequently, many of the details and much of the impact of the Dodd-Frank Act are not yet known and may not be known for many months or years. However, a few changes pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act that may have an impact on us include, but are not limited to,

• | elimination of the federal law prohibition on the payment of interest on commercial demand deposit accounts;


• | expansion of the assessment base for determining deposit insurance premiums to include liabilities other than just deposits;


• | regulations regarding debit card fees;


• | heightened capital standards;


• | increased requirements and limitations with respect to transactions with affiliates and insiders; and


• | enhanced corporate governance and executive compensation requirements.

Consumer Financial Protection Bureau
The Dodd-Frank Act creates the CFPB, an independent federal agency that is granted broad rulemaking, supervisory and enforcement powers under various federal consumer financial protection laws, including the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, Truth in Lending Act, Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, Fair Credit Reporting Act, Fair Debt Collection Act, the Consumer Financial Privacy provisions of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act and certain other statutes. The CFPB has examination and primary enforcement authority with respect to depository institutions with $10 billion or more in assets. Smaller institutions are subject to rules promulgated by the CFPB but continue to be examined and supervised by federal banking regulators for consumer compliance purposes. The CFPB has authority to prevent unfair, deceptive or abusive practices in connection with the offering of consumer financial products.
Source of Strength Requirements 
Federal Reserve policy has historically required bank holding companies to act as a source of financial and managerial strength to their subsidiary banks. The Dodd-Frank Act codified this policy as a statutory requirement. Under this requirement, the Company is expected to commit resources to support the Bank, including at times when the Company may not be in a financial position to provide such resources, and, if the Bank becomes undercapitalized, the Company may be required to guarantee the Bank’s compliance with capital restoration plans filed with their bank regulators, subject to certain limits.
Ability-to-Repay and Qualified Mortgage Rule 
Pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, the CFPB issued a final rule on January 10, 2013 (effective on January 10, 2014), amending Regulation Z as implemented by the Truth in Lending Act, requiring creditors to make a reasonable and good faith determination, based on verified and documented information, that a consumer applying for a mortgage loan has a reasonable ability to repay the loan according to its terms. Creditors are required to determine consumers’ ability to repay in one of two ways. The first alternative requires the creditor to consider the following eight underwriting factors when making the credit decision: (i) current or reasonably expected income or assets; (ii) current employment status; (iii) the monthly payment on the covered transaction; (iv) the monthly payment on any simultaneous loan; (v) the monthly payment for mortgage-related obligations; (vi) current debt obligations, alimony, and child support; (vii) the monthly debt-to-income ratio or residual income; and (viii) credit history. Alternatively, the creditor can originate “qualified mortgages,” which are entitled to a presumption that the creditor making the loan satisfied the ability-to-repay requirements. In general, a “qualified mortgage” is a mortgage loan without negative amortization, interest-only payments, balloon payments, or terms exceeding 30 years. In addition, to be a qualified mortgage the points and fees paid by a consumer cannot exceed 3% of the total loan amount. Qualified mortgages that are “higher-priced” (e.g., subprime loans) garner a rebuttable presumption of compliance with the ability-to-repay rules, while qualified mortgages that are not “higher-priced” (e.g., prime loans) are given a safe harbor of compliance.
Bank Regulation
Overview
The Bank is subject to numerous state and federal statutes and regulations that affect its business, activities, and operations, and is supervised and examined by the NCCOB and the Federal Reserve. The Federal Reserve and the NCCOB regularly examine the operations of banks over which they exercise jurisdiction. They have the authority to approve or disapprove the establishment of branches, mergers, consolidations, and other similar corporate actions, and to prevent the continuance or development of unsafe or unsound banking practices and other violations of law. The Federal Reserve and the NCCOB regulate and monitor all areas of the operations of banks and their subsidiaries, including loans, mortgages, issuances of securities, capital adequacy, loss reserves, and compliance with the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 (the “CRA”), as well as other laws and regulations. Interest and certain other charges collected and contracted for by banks are also subject to state usury laws and certain federal laws concerning interest rates.
Insurance Assessments
The deposit accounts of the Bank are insured by the Deposit Insurance Fund (the “DIF”) of the FDIC up to a maximum of $250,000 per insured depositor. Any insured bank that is not operated in accordance with or does not conform to FDIC regulations, policies, and directives may be sanctioned for noncompliance. Civil and criminal proceedings may be instituted against any insured bank or any director, officer or employee of such bank for the violation of applicable laws and regulations, breaches of fiduciary duties or engaging in any unsafe or unsound practice. The FDIC has the authority to terminate insurance of accounts pursuant to procedures established for that purpose.
8

The Bank is subject to insurance assessments imposed by the FDIC. The FDIC imposes a risk-based deposit premium assessment system, which was amended pursuant to the Federal Deposit Insurance Reform Act of 2005 and further amended by the Dodd-Frank Act.
Under this system, as amended, the assessment rates for an insured depository institution vary according to the level of risk incurred in its activities. The FDIC's assessment rate calculator is based on a number of elements to measure the risk each institution poses to the DIF, and the assessment rate is applied to average consolidated total assets minus average tangible equity, as defined under the Dodd-Frank Act. The assessment rate schedule can change from time to time, at the discretion of the FDIC, subject to certain limits. The Dodd-Frank Act also changed the minimum designated reserve ratio of the DIF, requiring the fund reserve ratio to reach 1.35% by September 30, 2020 (rather than 1.15% by the end of 2016).
Anti-Money Laundering and OFAC Regulation
Governmental policies on financial institutions in recent years have been aimed at combating money laundering and terrorist financing. The Bank Secrecy Act of 1970 ("BSA") and subsequent laws and regulations require financial institutions to take steps to prevent the use of its systems from facilitating the flow of illegal or illicit money or terrorist funds. The USA Patriot Act of 2001 is intended to strengthen the ability of U.S. law enforcement and the intelligence community to work cohesively to combat money laundering and terrorist financing. Title III of the USA Patriot Act of 2001 contains the International Money Laundering Abatement and Financial Anti-Terrorism Act of 2001 (“IMLAFA”).  The anti-money laundering provisions of IMLAFA impose affirmative obligations on a broad range of financial institutions, including banks, brokers, and dealers.  Among other requirements, IMLAFA requires all financial institutions to establish anti-money laundering programs that include, at minimum, internal policies, procedures, and controls; specific designation of an anti-money laundering compliance officer; ongoing employee training programs; and an independent audit function to test the anti-money laundering program. IMLAFA requires financial institutions that establish, maintain, administer, or manage private banking accounts for non-United States persons or their representatives to establish appropriate, specific, and, where necessary, enhanced due diligence policies, procedures, and controls designed to detect and report money laundering. Additionally, IMLAFA provides for the Department of Treasury to issue minimum standards with respect to customer identification at the time new accounts are opened.  
Additional rules were finalized in 2016 and must be implemented by May 2018 that create expanded obligations regarding customer due diligence and the identification of beneficial owners of business entities. An institution subject to the BSA, such as the Bank, must provide anti-money laundering training to employees, designate an anti-money laundering compliance officer and annually audit the anti-money laundering program to assess its effectiveness. The United States has imposed economic sanctions that affect transactions with designated foreign countries, nationals and others. Based on their administration by the United States Department of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control ("OFAC"), these are typically known as the OFAC rules. Generally, the OFAC rules contain one or more of the following elements: (i) restrictions on trade with or investment in a sanctioned country, and (ii) blocking of assets in which the government or specially designated nationals of the sanctioned country have an interest, by prohibiting transfers of property subject to United States jurisdiction. Blocked assets cannot be paid out, withdrawn, set off or transferred in any manner without a license from OFAC. Failure of a financial institution to maintain and implement adequate BSA, IMLAFA and OFAC programs, or to comply with all the relevant laws and regulations, could have serious legal and reputational consequences for the institution and result in material fines and sanctions. 
As of the date of this filing, we believe that BSA, IMLAFA and OFAC rules have not had a material impact on the Bank’s operations. The Bank has established policies and procedures to ensure compliance with BSA, IMLAFA and OFAC, which are overseen, in part, by an Anti-Money Laundering Officer who was appointed by our Board of Directors.
Community Reinvestment Act
Banks are also subject to the CRA, which requires the appropriate federal bank regulatory agency, in connection with its examination of a bank, to assess such bank's record in meeting the credit needs of the community served by that bank, including low and moderate-income neighborhoods. Each institution is assigned one of the following four ratings of its record in meeting community credit needs: “outstanding,” “satisfactory,” “needs to improve” or “substantial noncompliance.” The regulatory agency's assessment of a bank's record is made available to the public and our most recent examination returned a rating of satisfactory. Further, such assessment is required of any bank which has applied to (i) charter a national bank, (ii) obtain deposit insurance coverage for a newly chartered institution, (iii) establish a new branch office that will accept deposits, (iv) relocate an office or (v) merge or consolidate with, or acquire the assets or assume the liabilities of, a federally regulated financial institution. In the case of a bank holding company applying for approval to acquire a bank or other bank holding company, the Federal Reserve will assess the record of each subsidiary bank of the applicant bank holding company, and such records may be the basis for denying the application.
9

In addition, the GLBA’s “CRA Sunshine Requirements” call for financial institutions to disclose publicly certain written agreements made in fulfillment of the CRA. Banks that are parties to such agreements also must report to federal regulators the amount and use of any funds expended under such agreements on an annual basis, along with such other information as regulators may require. This annual reporting requirement is effective for any agreements made after May 12, 2000.
Prompt Corrective Action
The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 (“FDICIA”) provides for, among other things, (i) publicly available annual financial condition and management reports for certain financial institutions, including audits by independent accountants, (ii) the establishment of uniform accounting standards by federal banking agencies, (iii) the establishment of a “prompt corrective action” system of regulatory supervision and intervention, based on capitalization levels, with greater scrutiny and restrictions placed on depository institutions with lower levels of capital, (iv) additional grounds for the appointment of a conservator or receiver and (v) restrictions or prohibitions on accepting brokered deposits, except for institutions which significantly exceed minimum capital requirements. FDICIA also provides for increased funding of the FDIC insurance funds and the implementation of risk-based premiums.
A central feature of FDICIA is the requirement that the federal banking agencies take “prompt corrective action” with respect to depository institutions that do not meet minimum capital requirements. Pursuant to FDICIA, the federal bank regulatory authorities have adopted regulations setting forth a five-tiered system for measuring the capital adequacy of the depository institutions that they supervise. Under these regulations, a depository institution is classified in one of the following capital categories: “well capitalized,” “adequately capitalized,” “undercapitalized,” “significantly undercapitalized,” or “critically undercapitalized.”  An institution may be deemed by the regulators to be in a capitalization category that is lower than is indicated by its actual capital position if, among other things, it receives an unsatisfactory examination rating with respect to asset quality, management, earnings or liquidity.  Institutions that fail to comply with capital or other standards are restricted in the scope of permissible activities and are subject to enforcement action by the federal banking agencies.
Written Agreement
In July 2015, the Bank entered into a Written Agreement (the "2015 Written Agreement") with the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond (the "FRB") replacing the Written Agreement the Company and the Bank entered into with the FRB and the NCCOB in May 2011. Under the terms of the 2015 Written Agreement, the Bank submitted and implemented the following plans:
•a written plan to assure ongoing board oversight of the Bank's management and operations; 
•a written program for the review of new products, services, or business lines; and

• | an enhanced written program for conducting appropriate levels of customer due diligence by the Bank.

In addition, the Bank agreed that within 30 days after the end of each calendar quarter following the date of the 2015 Written Agreement, it will submit to FRB written progress reports detailing the form and manner of all actions taken to secure compliance with the 2015 Written Agreement and the results thereof.
The Bank has made progress in improving each of these areas and believes it is currently in full compliance with the provisions of the agreement. 
Consumer Laws and Regulations
The Bank is also subject to certain consumer laws and regulations that are designed to protect consumers in transactions with banks. These laws include, among others, the Truth in Lending Act, the Truth in Savings Act, the Electronic Funds Transfer Act, the Expedited Funds Availability Act, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, the Fair Credit Reporting Act, the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, the Fair Housing Act and the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act. The laws and related regulations mandate certain disclosure requirements and regulate the manner in which financial institutions transact business with customers. The Bank must comply with the applicable provisions of these consumer protection laws and regulations as part of its ongoing customer relations. 
10

Transactions with Affiliates
Pursuant to Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act, Regulation W and Regulation O, the authority of the Bank to engage in transactions with related parties or “affiliates” or to make loans to insiders is limited. An affiliate of a bank is any company or entity which controls, is controlled by or is under common control with such bank. Loan transactions with an affiliate generally must be collateralized and certain transactions between the Bank and its affiliates, including the sale of assets, the payment of money or the provision of services, must be on terms and conditions that are substantially the same, or at least as favorable to the Bank, as those prevailing for comparable nonaffiliated transactions. In addition, the Bank generally may not purchase securities issued or underwritten by affiliates.
Loans to Directors, Executive Officers and Principal Shareholders 
State member banks also are subject to the restrictions contained in Section 22(h) of the Federal Reserve Act and Regulation O on loans to executive officers, directors and principal shareholders. Under Section 22(h), loans to a director, executive officer and to a greater than 10% shareholder of a bank and certain affiliated interests of such persons, may not exceed, together with all other outstanding loans to such person and affiliated interests, the institution’s loans-to-one-borrower limit and all loans to such persons may not exceed the institution’s unimpaired capital and unimpaired surplus. Section 22(h) also prohibits loans above amounts prescribed by the appropriate federal banking agency to directors, executive officers and greater than 10% shareholders of a depository institution, and their respective affiliates, unless such loan is approved in advance by a majority of the board of directors of the institution with any “interested” director not participating in the voting. Regulation O prescribes the loan amount (which includes all other outstanding loans to such person) as to which such prior board approval is required as being the greater of $25,000 or 5% of capital and surplus (or any loans aggregating $500,000 or more). Further, Section 22(h) requires that loans to directors, executive officers and principal shareholders generally be made on terms substantially the same as offered in comparable transactions to other persons. Section 22(h) also generally prohibits a depository institution from paying the overdrafts of any of its executive officers or directors.
Banks are also subject to the requirements and restrictions of Regulation O on loans to executive officers. Section 22(g) of the Federal Reserve Act requires approval by the board of directors of a depository institution for such extensions of credit and imposes reporting requirements for and additional restrictions on the type, amount and terms of credits to such officers. In addition, Section 106 of the BHCA prohibits extensions of credit to executive officers, directors, and greater than 10% shareholders of a depository institution by any other institution which has a correspondent banking relationship with the institution, unless such extension of credit is on substantially the same terms as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with other persons and does not involve more than the normal risk of repayment or present other unfavorable features.
Capital Requirements 
The Federal Reserve has established risk-based capital guidelines for bank holding companies and state member banks. The minimum standard for the ratio of capital to risk-weighted assets (including certain off balance sheet obligations, such as standby letters of credit) is 8%. At least half of this capital must consist of common equity, retained earnings and a limited amount of perpetual preferred stock and minority interests in the equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries, less goodwill items and certain other items (“Tier 1 capital”). The remainder (“Tier 2 capital”) may consist of mandatory convertible debt securities and a limited amount of other preferred stock, subordinated debt and loan loss reserves.
In addition, the Federal Reserve has established minimum leverage ratio guidelines for bank holding companies. These guidelines provide for a minimum leverage ratio of Tier 1 capital to adjusted average quarterly assets less certain amounts (“Leverage Ratio”) equal to 3% for bank holding companies that meet certain specified criteria, including having the highest regulatory rating. All other bank holding companies will generally be required to maintain a Leverage Ratio of between 4% and 5%.
The guidelines also provide that bank holding companies experiencing significant growth, whether through internal expansion or acquisitions, will be expected to maintain strong capital ratios well above the minimum supervisory levels without significant reliance on intangible assets. The same heightened requirements apply to bank holding companies with supervisory, financial, operational or managerial weaknesses, as well as to other banking institutions if warranted by particular circumstances or the institution's risk profile. Furthermore, the guidelines indicate that the Federal Reserve will continue to consider a “tangible Tier 1 Leverage Ratio” (deducting all intangibles) in evaluating proposals for expansion or new activity. The Federal Reserve has not advised us of any specific minimum Leverage Ratio or tangible Tier 1 Leverage Ratio applicable to us.

In early July 2013, the Federal Reserve approved revisions to their capital adequacy guidelines and prompt corrective action rules that implement the revised standards of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (“Basel III”) and address relevant provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act. Basel III and the regulations of the federal banking agencies require bank holding companies and banks to undertake significant activities to demonstrate compliance with the higher capital standards. These new minimum capital requirements, which became effective for the Company and the Bank on January 1, 2015, require a common equity Tier 1 risk-adjusted, Tier 1 risk-adjusted, total regulatory capital and leverage ratio of 4.5%, 6.0%, 8.0%, and 4.0%, respectively. The new capital standards also revise the definitions and components of regulatory capital and include other requirements that phase in over time. One of these requirements includes the implementation of a capital conservation buffer which will require banks to hold an additional 2.5% above the minimum capital thresholds or limitations will be placed on dividends, distributions, and executive compensation. The buffer was phased in beginning at 0.625% as of January 1, 2016, increasing each year and reaching the target 2.5% on January 1, 2019. We expect these changes to have little impact on the Company and Bank. 
As of December 31, 2016, the Company had common equity Tier 1 risk-adjusted, Tier 1 risk-adjusted, total regulatory capital and Tier 1 leverage capital of approximately 10.9%, 12.2%, 15.6% and 9.5%, respectively. At December 31, 2016, the Bank had common equity Tier 1 risk-adjusted, Tier 1 risk-adjusted, total regulatory capital and leverage capital of approximately 14.1%, 14.1%, 15.4% and 11.0%, respectively, of which all are materially greater than the minimum requirements to be considered well capitalized. 
Dividends
Under the North Carolina Business Corporation Act (the "NCBCA"), the Bank may not pay a dividend or distribution, if after giving it, the effect would be that the Bank would not be able to pay its debts as they become due in the usual course of business or its total assets would be less than its liabilities. North Carolina banking law requires that the Bank may not pay a dividend that would reduce its capital below the applicable required capital. The Federal Reserve also imposes limits on the Bank's payment of dividends. All dividends paid by the Bank are paid to the Company, the sole shareholder of the Bank. 
Additionally, under Basel III capital requirements, banking institutions with a ratio of common equity Tier 1 to risk-weighted assets above the minimum but below the conservation buffer will face constraints on dividends, equity repurchases, and compensation based on the amount of the shortfall. The amount of future dividends paid by the Bank will be determined based on a number of factors including capital position and capital adequacy, ongoing operations and profitability, the risk profile of the institution and general market conditions.
During 2016, we paid no cash dividends on our common stock. In general, our ability to pay cash dividends is dependent in part upon the amount of dividends paid to us by the Bank. No dividends were paid to us by the Bank during 2016. In the past, we have received cash dividends from the Bank and may continue to do so from time to time in the future as necessary for cash flow purposes. Also, applicable federal banking law contains additional limitations and restrictions on the payment of dividends by a bank holding company. Accordingly, shareholders receive dividends from us only to the extent that funds are available from our operations or the Bank. In addition, the Federal Reserve generally prohibits bank holding companies from paying dividends unless the prospective rate of earnings retention appears consistent with the bank holding company’s capital needs, asset quality and overall financial condition. 
Monetary Policy and Economic Controls
Both the Company and the Bank are directly affected by governmental policies and regulatory measures affecting the banking industry in general. Of primary importance is the Federal Reserve Board, whose actions directly affect the money supply which, in turn, affects banks’ lending abilities by increasing or decreasing the cost and availability of funds to banks. The Federal Reserve Board regulates the availability of bank credit in order to combat recession and curb inflationary pressures in the economy by open market operations in United States government securities, changes in the discount rate on member bank borrowings, changes in reserve requirements against bank deposits, and limitations on interest rates that banks may pay on time and savings deposits.
