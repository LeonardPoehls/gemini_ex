Item 1 Our Business
Overview
 
We strive to be an innovative energy solutions company that has previously pioneered the development of carbon/lead batteries. We have also developed the know-how and engineering expertise to integrate our advanced batteries into energy storage systems, renewable energy systems, off-grid applications, automotive and other applications. Our PbC batteries and battery components, which utilize activated carbon for the battery’s negative electrode, have application in a variety of energy storage systems.
 
In 2016, Axion changed its strategy and business model from a manufacturing and capital investment intensive lead-acid battery production and marketing company with an investigative interest in PbC carbon electrode technology to an asset-light PbC technology, research and development, intellectual property licensing and royalty streaming company.
 
Recognizing and reflecting this fundamental business model and market strategy change, Axion – in 2016 – significantly adjusted downward (to market value) the asset valuation of its property, plant and equipment as well as its inventories.
 
Despite continued exhaustive efforts by Axion’s management, no shareholder value enhancing opportunities have come to fruition. During 2016, Axion unsuccessfully explored multiple potential shareholder value enhancing opportunities with other similar worldwide businesses. In addition, in 2015 the Company unsuccessfully explored potential opportunities to enhance shareholder value.
 
The focus of these endeavors to enhance shareholder value was to identify potential joint venture or merger partners as well as sell and/or license Axion’s intellectual property and to monetize Axion’s $70+million net operating losses.
 
Only one potential business partner emerged as a result of these efforts – a tri-party non-binding letter of intent with Fengfan Co. Ltd., Baoding, China and LCB, Hong Kong, China - which was initially signed October 31, 2016 and subsequently revised and signed May 23, 2017.

Axion first issued a press release on November 1, 2016 announcing the signing of the $5 million non-binding tri-party letter of intent between Fengfan, Axion & LCB to exclusively license Axion’s intellectual property in the People’s Republic of China and initiate the joint development of further enhancements to Axion’s proprietary PbC technology.
 
The Company received from Fengfan an initial $250,000 cash payment on June 14, 2017 resulting from the revised tri-party letter of intent.

Axion Power Corporation, our wholly owned subsidiary, was formed in September 2003 to acquire and develop certain innovative battery technology. Since inception, Axion Power Corporation has been engaged in research and development of new technology for the production of our PbC advanced lead carbon batteries. On December 31, 2003, Axion Power Corporation engaged in a reverse acquisition with Tamboril Cigar Company, a public shell company whereby Axion Power Corporation became a wholly owned subsidiary of Tamboril, which changed its name to Axion Power International, Inc. Tamboril was originally incorporated in Delaware in January 1997 and operated a wholesale cigar business until December 1998, after which date it was an inactive public shell until the reverse acquisition and subsequent name change to Axion Power International, Inc.
 
The Energy Storage Industry
 
According to “Energy Storage Industry Gaining Momentum,” New York Times, October 25, 2015, “as energy policies, technologies and markets shift to encourage the growth of renewable power plants, rooftop solar and decentralized systems like microgrids, storage is gaining more investment and interest while regulators are moving to require its inclusion in renewable energy developments and wholesale electricity markets.” The article further states whether to smooth out variations in the output from wind and solar farms, feed power to the grid at times of peak demand or store it for use when renewable plants or the grid go down, utilities, islands and big institutions like the military are experimenting with different battery systems and chemistries. We strive to have our technology included in the handful of systems capable of consistently, competently and cost effectively providing solutions to meet these needs.
 
The energy storage industry has traditionally been based on battery, flywheel, capacitor, thermal, chemical systems, power to gas, gravity, pumped storage hydroelectricity, and compressed air systems, to provide a temporary or back-up source for energy. The major industries utilizing energy storage systems have been automotive for stop/start, hybrid and electric vehicle applications, heavy duty truck and rail for hybrid applications, renewable energy for storage and smoothing, and electrical utilities for back-up, energy smoothing and frequency regulation, robotic and auto guided vehicles, e-bikes and scooters and other emerging specialty uses.

During 2015 and 2016, our business objectives/goals were aimed at providing PbC batteries, electronics and energy storage systems to meet a variety of consumer and business needs. To achieve these objectives/goals, the overall business strategy included collaborative working relationships that could allow the following to occur:
 

● | Contract manufacture of batteries using our proprietary PbC electrodes thereby allowing us to solely focus on the PbC electrode manufacture. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Distribution of PbC batteries and product systems by established commercial organizations to allow shorter time to market. 
● | Licensing of PbC products to established companies for use in their systems design and sale to broaden the acceptance of the technology. 
● | Territorial intellectual property and applications licensing to facilitate global expansion and development of PbC uses beyond the capabilities of limited Axion resources. 
● | Fully transition the Axion business model to a PbC Technology Development/R&D Licensing, Royalty Streaming and PbC Battery Contract Manufacturing Company. 

 
As noted in Axion’s March 31, 2017 SEC Form 8K, Fengfan’s “missed commitments and delays have caused the Company significant financial hardship”. Without any further identifiable sources of capital and any follow through from our proposed Chinese partner, these objectives/goals have not been achieved into early 2018.
 
We have attempted to continue our work with the Chinese partner or to seek an alternative business solution. Since January 1, 2017, we have contacted and engaged in substantive discussions with over a dozen potential business partners for joint venture, outright purchase of the Company or other business combination transactions, and to date, other than our continued efforts to develop a viable PbC battery with Fengfan in China, we have met with no success in establishing an ongoing business development opportunity for our products.
 
Our Technology
 
Our proprietary PbC battery technology is a hybrid asymmetric energy storage device. This asymmetric design (lead positive and carbon negative) allows the battery to be charged faster and cycled longer compared to traditional lead-based battery chemistries. The performance gain can be attributed to the removal of the failure mechanism of lead–acid batteries. During charge and discharge, the positive electrode undergoes the same chemical reaction that occurs in a conventional lead–acid battery, i.e. lead dioxide reacts with acid and sulfate ions to form lead sulfate and water. However, in our proprietary carbon negative electrode the PbC battery does not undergo a chemical reaction. Instead, the high surface area of the activated carbon electrode stores protons from the acid on the carbon surface of the electrode.
 

With the inclusion of our non-Faradaic proprietary activated carbon negative electrode, the mechanism known as sulfation is eliminated. Therefore, our PbC battery maintains maximum charge acceptance, while conventional lead–acid batteries show significant charge acceptance decline early in use (a difference of up to 2 orders of magnitude).

By incorporating the proprietary PbC carbon negative electrode, our batteries offer a distinct advantage over lead–acid technology, when operated under partial state-of-charge conditions. In such applications, the energy storage device is rarely, if ever, provided the opportunity to become fully charged. The lack of reaching full charge for a lead-acid device results in constant and ever rising presence of lead sulfate crystals on the lead negative plate.
 
Initially, these small, high surface area crystals are easily dissolved. During repetitive cycling of a classic lead-acid battery, these crystals grow in size and are significantly more difficult to dissolve. This change limits the ability to charge, thereby decreasing the charge acceptance and increasing the charge time. This ultimately results in the rapid failure of lead-acid batteries. Our batteries completely replace the lead negative with proprietary activated carbon electrode creating a non-faradaic reaction. Due to the lack of this chemical reaction and no lead sulfate crystals, PbC battery charge acceptance does not degrade in partial state-of-charge operation.
 
Example of Lead-Acid Battery Failure
 

Our proprietary PbC technology is protected by 14 issued U.S. patents and other proprietary features and structures. In addition, there are a number of additional patent applications in process at any point in time. Presently, we have no obligation to pay any royalties or license fees with respect to the commercialization of the proprietary PbC technology.
 
Our proprietary carbon negative electrode assemblies are fabricated from readily available raw materials, using both proprietary and standard manufacturing processes and techniques. Our PbC batteries are assembled with the same equipment and methodology commonly used for manufacturing conventional lead-acid batteries. Our batteries use significantly less lead than standard lead-acid batteries with a comparable footprint and are significantly lighter (per our testing, in the order of magnitude of 30%). Moreover, the lead, plastics, and acid employed, are the same as lead-acid batteries, and can be routinely recycled at existing recycling facilities. Our PbC batteries exhibit a lower initial power and energy output to a conventional lead-acid battery. By pairing lead and carbon as the positive and negative electrodes, and technology displays an engineered optimization between lead-acid and super capacitor performance. Although the PbC battery sacrifices the high initial energy output of a lead-acid battery, it makes up for this disparity by its superior useful life cycle (20x longer cycle life). In terms of work, or “energy output over time,” the PbC technology provides significantly more life cycle value compared to other battery chemistries. The proprietary PbC battery is able to deliver a significant amount of work compared to other battery technologies that claim high energy density.
 
A unique performance characteristic of our carbon electrode technology is its innate ability to self-equalize the voltage of all energy storage components without a separate battery management system. In a series string all battery modules are forced to work in unison. If individual battery modules’ voltages are allowed to rise beyond the voltage of their counterparts, these modules will become subject to extreme overcharge and will likely fail. Conversely, if individual battery modules’ voltages are allowed to drop below the voltage of their counterparts, they will become subject to extreme over-discharging during operation and will likely fail. Ultimately, our PbC technology, when used in high energy series string applications (notably grid-tied energy storage systems) provides longer life, higher power, higher energy, fewer battery replacements, limited down-time and lower cost compared to lead-acid and lithium battery strings.

Development History
 
In February 2006, we commenced operations at our former Clover Lane facility in New Castle, PA. We utilized this space to manufacture our PbC and specialty lead-acid battery products and to continue to produce and test prototypes which incorporate our PbC technology. The Clover Lane plant allowed us to manufacture lead-acid batteries for sale under the Axion brand name; to manufacture for third parties under specific contract arrangements; or to manufacture prototypes of PbC batteries for testing by our customers. During 2015, we exited the manufacture and sale of Axion brand name lead-acid batteries and sold our legacy antique and racing car battery product lines. This sale was made in conjunction with our strategy to focus our future business solely on our PbC technology and product lines.
 
In November 2010, we expanded into our Green Ridge facility, which is less than ½ mile from our Clover Lane facility in New Castle, PA, to house offices, research & development, carbon electrode manufacturing and warehousing. A new robotic carbon electrode manufacturing line was installed at our Green Ridge Road facility which provided the manufacturing framework and capability for improvements in our quality, cost and ability to deliver our proprietary carbon electrodes. As part of our comprehensive 2015 restructuring efforts to reduce cash burn, we relocated our robotic manufacturing equipment, labs and offices to the Clover Lane facility from Green Ridge. This relocation was completed in the first half of 2016.
 
There are no manufacturing activities taking place, and there is no intention to resume manufacturing.
 
Recent Developments
 
Over the course of 2016, we took significant measures to cut costs, consistent with the Company’s change of strategy and business model.
 
The cost cutting measures included reduction in manufacturing personnel to a headcount of seven employees at year end 2016, a total write-off of finished goods & raw materials inventory, and a write-down to fair market value of the Company’s property and equipment.
 
At November 23, 2016, seven manufacturing employees were laid off, leaving seven office workers as of year-end 2016, who were subsequently laid off on January 13, 2017.
 
In May 2017, a revised non-binding tri-party letter of intent was renegotiated and signed on May 23, 2017. Axion received Fengfan’s specified $250,000 in “earnest money” payments on June 14, 2017. Since that time, we have tirelessly endeavored to communicate, negotiate, while during this time sending Axion engineering personnel to China to co-develop in China PbC batteries. Additionally, we shipped new PbC batteries and PbC electrodes for testing in China. Further, we developed a detailed and specific work plan for success in China with Fengfan. Axion’s concerted effort to enhance our business relationship with Fengfan, was consistent with the May 23rd tri-party letter of intent.
 
To provide a clear road map to guide our joint work with Fengfan, Axion developed an interim agreement to the tri-party letter of intent. On September 29, 2017 Axion delivered to Fengfan an engineering services agreement with a detailed statement of work. Axion conducted, over the September and October 2017 time period, at least 7 joint conference calls with Fengfan senior and engineering management. Nonetheless, Axion has yet to receive a substantive and affirmative response which would indicate Fengfan’s intent to move toward a definitive long term working relationship.
 
With the help of Axion’s other partner LCB, the Company began significant and detailed discussions with Fengfan management as to how best to accelerate the finalization of the $5 million formal joint venture Tri-Party letter of intent. Detailed discussions and negotiations proceeded well into the month of August 2017. As result and given Fengfan management’s expressed enthusiasm (at the time) to complete – timely - the $5 million tri-party letter of intent, Axion proposed to Fengfan in September 2017 a detailed engineering services agreement with a detailed statement of work to clearly shape the deliverables for the time period October 2017 through early 2018. This agreement was designed to provide an adjunct/interim step to the final definitive $5 million tri-party letter of intent.
 
This engineering services agreement specified two $250,000 payments (November 2017 and January 2018) to be made by Fengfan to Axion as part of the final definitive tri-party letter of intent. In Axion’s numerous discussions with Fengfan it was made clear that the final definitive tri-party letter of intent was to be completed in the 1st Quarter of 2018. In addition, this engineering services agreement expressly detailed several trips by Axion engineering staff to Baoding, China, plus reciprocal and collaborative trips to New Castle, PA by Fengfan’s engineers. Throughout September and October 2017, the Company held detailed weekly conference call discussions with Fengfan’s management and engineering staff as to their next steps in testing Axion’s PbC batteries and finalizing the tri-party letter of intent and executing the interim engineering services agreement.

After considerable and concerted direct conversations, with the help of LCB, during the months of October, November and December 2017, Axion has been unable to establish whether or not Fengfan management would perform consistent - with their frequent and multiple pledges - to execute the interim engineering services agreement and move to complete the final tri-party letter of intent.
 
As previously stated, throughout 2016, 2017 and early 2018, Axion - in addition with our work with Fengfan – the Company specifically initiated over two dozen other detailed and focused attempts to partner, sell, merge, reverse merge, and/or joint venture with other worldwide organizations. As of 2018, only Fengfan has revealed some level of interest in partnering with Axion, evidenced with their signing of the non-binding letter of intent (October 2016 and revised May 2017) and payment to Axion of $250,000 in June 2017.
 
To date, the Company has continued to explore other opportunities; however, nothing has come to fruition.
 
Axion was last advised, April 25, 2018, that Fengfan Executive Management will decide in July 2018 as to their intentions to proceed with Axion’s PbC battery joint development in China. These numerous delays, lack of action and disappointing behavior on behalf of Fengfan has caused considerable harm to Axion’s financial condition.
 
Our Sales and Marketing Strategy
 
Due to our inability to successfully market and sell our PbC product, and our inability to secure and preserve business opportunities, our sole remaining opportunity at this time is the joint venture potential with Fengfan. See discussions of our relationship and history with Fengfan, described elsewhere in this annual report.
Our Patents and Intellectual Property
 
We own 14 issued U.S. patents at the date of this report covering various aspects of our PbC technologies, and we typically have a number of patent applications in process at any point in time. There is no assurance that any of the pending patent applications will ultimately be granted. Our issued patents are:

● | U.S. Patent No. 9,251,969 (expires May 2032) – Process for the Manufacture of Carbon Sheet for an Electrode 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | U.S. Patent No. 6,466,429 (expires May 2021) - Electric double layer capacitor

● | U.S. Patent No. 8,347,468 (expires February 2031) – Method of Making a Current Collector 

 
Presently, we have no obligation to pay any royalties or license fees with respect to the commercialization of our PbC device technology, and we are not subject to any field of use restrictions. We believe our patents and patent applications, along with our trade secrets, know-how and other intellectual property are necessary to our success.
 
Our ability to compete effectively with other companies will depend on our ability to maintain and protect the PbC device intellectual property and technology. If we had the resources, we would plan to file additional patent applications in the future. However, the degree of protection offered by our existing patents or the likelihood that our future applications will be granted, or the degree of protection afforded by future patents, if granted, is uncertain. Competitors in both the United States and foreign countries, many of which have substantially greater resources and have made substantial investment in competing technologies, may have, or may apply for and obtain patents that may prevent, limit or interfere with our ability to make and sell products based on our PbC device technology. Competitors may also intentionally infringe on our patents. The prosecution and defense of patent litigation is both costly and time-consuming, even if the outcome is favorable to us. An adverse outcome in the defense of a patent infringement suit could subject us to significant liabilities to third parties and prevent us from using all or any portion of the technology covered by such a patent. Although third parties have not asserted any infringement claims against us to date, there is no assurance that third parties will not assert such claims in the future.
 
We also rely on trade secrets and know-how, and there is no assurance that others will not independently develop the same or similar technology or obtain unauthorized access to our trade secrets, know-how and other unpatented technology. To protect our rights in these areas, we require all employees, consultants, advisors and collaborators to enter into strict confidentiality agreements. These agreements may not provide meaningful protection for our unpatented technology in the event of an unauthorized use, misappropriation or disclosure. While we have attempted to protect the unpatented proprietary technology that we develop or acquire and will continue to attempt to protect future proprietary technology through patents, copyrights and trade secrets, we believe that our success will depend, to a large extent, upon continued innovation and technological expertise.
 
In general, the level of protection afforded by a patent is directly proportional to the ability of the patent owner to protect and enforce those rights through legal action. Since our financial resources are limited, and patent litigation can be both expensive and time consuming, there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully prosecute an infringement claim in the event that a competitor develops a technology or introduces a product that infringes on one or more of our patents or patent applications. There can be no assurance that our competitors will not independently develop other technologies that render our proposed products obsolete. In general, we believe the best protection of our proprietary technology will come from market position, technical innovation, speed-to-market, and product performance. There is no assurance that we will realize any benefit from our intellectual property rights.

Our Competition
 
Our PbC technology is competitive with technologies being developed by a number of new and established companies engaged in the manufacture of energy storage components, devices and systems. In addition, many universities, research institutions and other companies are developing advanced electrochemical energy storage technologies including:

● | symmetric supercapacitors; 
--+-------------------------------


● | asymmetric supercapacitors with organic electrolytes; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------


● | nickel metal hydride batteries; 
--+------------------------------------


● | lithium-ion batteries; 
--+---------------------------


● | other advanced lead-acid devices; and 
--+------------------------------------------


● | flow batteries. 
--+--------------------

 
Other business entities are developing advanced energy production technologies like fuel cells, solar cells and windmills which may use our products, or, in some cases, compete with our products. Since some of our competitors are developing technologies that may ultimately have costs similar to, or lower than, our projected costs, there can be no assurance we will be able to compete effectively.
 
Our competitors with more diversified product offerings may be better positioned to withstand changing market conditions. Some of our competitors own, partner with, or have longer term or stronger relationships with suppliers of raw materials and components, which could result in these competitors being able to obtain raw materials on a more favorable basis than us. It is possible that new competitors or alliances among existing competitors could emerge and rapidly acquire significant market share, which would harm our business.
 
The development of technology, equipment and manufacturing techniques and the operation of a facility for the automated production of rechargeable batteries require large capital expenditures. In order to minimize our capital investment in manufacturing facilities and establish strong brand name recognition for our products, our overall strategy is to negotiate strategic alliances and other production agreements with established battery manufacturers that want to add high-performance co-branded products to their existing product lines. There can be no assurance that our PbC platform technology business model will succeed in the battery industry.
 
Our Employees
 
As of December 31, 2015, we employed a full time staff of 16, including a six member scientific and engineering team, and five people who are involved principally in manufacturing. We are not subject to any collective bargaining agreements, and we believe we have a good relationship with our employees. On March 31, 2015, we accepted the resignation of Vani Dantam, Vice President of Sales and Marketing. Charles Trego resigned as our Chief Financial Officer on October 2, 2015 although he remains a director, and Danielle Baker, our Controller, was appointed as our Chief Accounting Officer.
 
As of December 31, 2016, we employed a full-time staff of 7, including a three-member scientific and engineering team, and four people involved with day to day operations. We are not subject to any collective bargaining agreements, and we believe we have a good relationship with our employees.
 
As of December 31, 2017, and July 12, 2018, as a result of our continued inability to secure a transaction with Fengfan or find other viable alternatives, we employed a skeleton staff of four people.
 
Description of Properties
 
On March 10, 2013, we exercised our option for a five-year renewal on our lease on existing space at our manufacturing plant located at 3601 Clover Lane in New Castle, Pennsylvania. The Clover Lane facility lease was terminated February 16, 2018 six weeks prior to the original scheduled termination date. We had utilized this space to manufacture our PbC and specialty lead-acid battery products and to continue to produce and test PbC prototypes. In 2016, with the Company’s restructuring plan, the PbC electrode robotic production line, was completely relocated to the Clover Lance facility along with labs and offices formerly housed in the Green Ridge facility.
