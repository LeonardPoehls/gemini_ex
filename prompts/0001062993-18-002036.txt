 Further information concerning the historical business of Nanotech, the business acquired by the Company in the Acquisition, is set forth below.
 Overview
 The Company is an early stage company and has only just begun to implement its business plan. The likelihood of success of the Company must be considered in light of the expenses, complications and delays frequently encountered in connection with the establishment and expansion of new business and the competitive environment in which the Company will operate. The Company's long-term viability, profitability and growth will depend upon successful commercialization of the Nanotech Products and the development and commercialization of new products and services relative to its business plan. As an early stage company, the Company has little or no relevant operating history upon which an evaluation of its performance can be made. Such performance must be considered in light of the risks, expenses and difficulties frequently encountered in establishing new products, services and markets. 
Business Model
 The Companys business model is based on a two-tier strategy, which includes direct sales and licensing. The Companys ultimate goal is to license its proprietary Green Polyurethane formulation to national and/or global coatings formulators and then focus on rolling out the commercialization of other Green Polyurethane applications such as adhesives and sealants. In order to achieve this, the Company is proving the validity of its products through direct sales and is therefore targeting large distributors and multiple client bases. The Company intends to focus within the Coatings, Adhesives, Sealants and Elastomers (C.A.S.E.) segment specifically for large industrial and commercial coatings applications where Green Polyurethane has a natural competitive advantage over other polyurethane ("PU") and epoxy coatings due to its superior chemical resistance and environmentally safe properties with reduced health risks. Some of the target applications for Green Polyurethane products include:

 | Industrial and commercial buildings; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 | Civil applications for tunnels and bridges; 
 | Private and public garages; 
 | Chemical and food processing plants; 
 | Warehouses; 
 | Monolithic floorings for civil, industrial and military engineering; 
 | Marine and Aeronautic applications; 
 | Industrial equipment for dairy and liquid fertilizer processing plants and delivery systems; 
 | Military facilities and equipment; and 
 | Protective coatings inside industrial and commercial pipes. 

 In addition to the above, the Companys business plan includes plans to:
 
 | Increase the number of contractors and applicators contacted; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 | Contact paint formulators and offer Green Polyurethane Binder for their proprietary formulations; and 
 | Establish distribution channels utilizing existing distribution hubs. 

Competitive Strengths
 The Company believes that its competitive strengths include the following:
 Product Advantage. Green Polyurethane is the first ever chemical platform based on modified hybrid polyurethane that is produced using pending patented proprietary methods which completely eliminate the use of toxic isocyanates resulting in a substitute for conventional polyurethane. This results in a product that is hundreds of times less toxic than conventional polyurethane and which has superior chemical and mechanical properties.
 -8-

2 Times Wear Resistance & Excellent Adhesion 
 
 | Wear resistance is 25-30 (mgs./1000 cycles) or 2 times better than most premium polyurethane coatings 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 | Adhesiveness - 10-30% higher (depends on substrate) 

High Gloss, Self-Priming - Achieve Any Thickness in One Coat 
 
 | Green Polyurethanes 100% solids, specific curing formulation can be applied with only one layer at any thickness in specific environments (some substrates in poor condition may need a primer) compared to conventional polyurethane brands which normally require 2 or 3 layers 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 | Does not require careful drying of substrates (compared to conventional polyurethane coatings) 

Increased Resistance to Chemical Degradation & Corrosion 
 
 | Maintains an extended period of corrosion protection, more reliability due to its non-porous coating structure, and better durability than conventional coatings 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 | Assures more effective protection against aggressive media 
 | Unlike conventional polyurethanes, Green Polyurethane is indifferent to moisture and does not require special moisture controlled conditions in the manufacturing process 

Safe & Easy curing in Cold, Hot or Sunny Conditions 
 
 | Hardens at ambient temperatures 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 | UV and low temperature curing applications available (36-77 ºF) (2-25 ºC) 

Increased Hydrolytic Stability 
 Maintains stability against chemical decomposition upon contact with water through an intramolecular hydrogen bond formed during its curing, thereby improving hydrolytic stability well above that of conventional polyurethanes making it virtually water proof.
Wider Range of Applications
 
 | There are circumstances where traditional polyurethanes cannot be used due to their decomposition toxicity during a fire event (reversion to isocyanate components). 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Tested Product and Technology. The Green Polyurethane technology has been tested, is proven, is commercial ready and currently in use. The Green Polyurethane technology has undergone rigorous testing by the Polymer Institute, GmbH, a well-recognized analytical firm for qualifying materials for use in the flooring industry and Assured Testing Services of Pennsylvania.
 Testing by the Polymer Institute and Assured Testing Services confirmed Green Polyurethanes claims in regard to its structural and chemical properties and its suitability for use in the flooring industry. In addition, floor coating samples were rigorously tested and were found to perform successfully in accordance with The American Society for Testing and Materials.
 The Company has also expanded its applications of the technology to include polyurethane foam for the textile industry, environmentally safe coatings spray foam insulation, polyurethane foam packaging, synthetic leather, sealants and adhesives. 
 -9-

Cost Savings. The Company can offer substantial savings to clients in the flooring installation industry due to the unique combination of multiple properties in one coating of Green Polyurethane paint. Typically, concrete floors are painted using a primer, base and topcoat, resulting in the need for three different types of coatings for one application, which can be time consuming and costly. By using the Green Polyurethane formulation the number of layers can be reduced to only one or two, as Green Polyurethane does not require a primer, has excellent stand-alone adhesion and, in most cases, would not require a top coat due to its excellent mechanical properties. In addition, its zero isocyanate, approximate zero volatile organic compound (VOC) safety features, allows it to be applied without the interruption of business due to public exposure, creating an additional 30-60% savings on application costs for customers. 
 Management Team. The Companys management team possesses a diverse set of industry skills and operating experience and a record of success in the scientific R&D, nanotechnology, management, marketing, sales and finance industries.
Growth Strategy
 The Companys business growth model includes a two-pronged strategy of direct sales and licensing. The Companys ultimate goal is to license its proprietary formulation to national or global coatings formulators. In order to achieve this it is proving the validity of its products through direct sales.
 The Company has developed marketing tools, brochures, one-sheets, and a user-friendly website to market its products directly to contractors and applicators of high end coatings and paint. The Company has also participated in high visibility trade shows to highlight the unique qualities of Green Polyurethane. From these trade shows, internet and direct marketing campaigns, the Company has attracted hundreds of prospective clients. Flooring applications done for some of these clients in Montreal, San Jose, Bergen County, New Jersey and New York have allowed the Company to prove that its product can live up to the high standards and safety features advertised.
 The Companys marketing and direct coating sales/application efforts have attracted over 50 established regional and global coatings distributors and formulators who are either testing samples of Green Polyurethane, applying for final pilot samples of the material prior to ordering commercial quantities or negotiating licensing contracts.
 The $3.5 billion European Union (EU) polyurethane coatings market (JCT CoatingsTech | November 1, 2007 | Challener, Cynthia) is of particular interest to the Company because of the high demand and the overhaul of the EUs chemical regulatory system. Registration, Evaluation & Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH) regulations were drafted in 1998 and finally adopted and put into force in June 2007. A major shift in this system will be placing a greater burden of proof on the industry that chemicals are safe. Substances of very high concern must be authorized under REACH and their use may be subject to restrictions. Isocyanates used in making polyurethane are highly toxic and require expensive worker safety and handling procedures. A general movement towards greener products combined with the REACH regulations has accelerated projected growth in the EU market for less toxic alternatives.
 In addition to the above, the Company plans to:
 
 | Increase the number of contractors and applicators contacted; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 | Contact paint formulators and offer Green Polyurethane® Binder for their proprietary formulations; 
 | Establish distribution channels utilizing existing distribution hubs; and 
 | Sub-license technology in certain geographic areas 

 The Company intends to work with GBK Gmbh Global Regulatory Compliance , a global regulatory compliance consultancy firm, first in the EU marketplace and then in other markets to educate targeted government agencies responsible for setting standards for hazardous chemicals used in coatings.
 -10-

Educating Regulatory Authorities. The Company intends to educate regulatory agencies of the existence of an alternative to hazardous isocyanate-based polyurethane. The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has shown strong interest in Green Polyurethane and has supported the efforts to manufacture and distribute Green Polyurethane products in the US and have suggested linking the Green Polyurethane technology to the EPAs new website for spray polyurethane foam.
 Maintain and Increase Cost and Operational Advantages. The Companys strategy is to avoid large capital investments in manufacturing and instead rent facilities and equipment from its strategic partners. Management estimates that the Company can outsource the manufacture of up to 20,000 tons per year.
Subsidiaries 
 Nanotech Industries International, Inc. (Nanotech) is a wholly owned subsidiary of Hybrid Coating Technologies Inc. (collectively the Company) and is the source of the Companys operations. 
Legislation and Government Incentives 
 Current global trends toward more environmentally sound products and new legislative restrictions on the use of hazardous materials and their chemical by-products pose formidable obstacles to polyurethane manufacturers. The EU has already begun to take action against isocyanates by passing recent legislation that banned the addition of any new manufacturing capacities of isocyanates. Governmental health agencies and workers unions throughout Europe are beginning to actively speak out against the dangers of isocyanates in the workplace in order to protect and lobby for workers safety. On September 2007 the president of Federation of the Paints, Varnishes, Lacquers and Printing Inks Industries Technologists' Associations of Continental Europe (FATIPEC) along with the Oil & Color Chemists' Association reported that new EU safety regulations have been put into place which includes a tenfold lowering of the concentration limits of isocyanates in all paints.
 In addition, the EPA has recently developed a new Action Plan causing any company that produces products with free isocyanates to report any health related incidents related to the isocyanate exposure of its workers and any consumers using its products.
 These measures are similar to recent EU actions, which preceded the banning of any Do-It-Yourself (DIY) consumer products with free isocyanates. These new regulations will afford the Company the opportunity to gain new ground.
 Manufacturing 
 Overview
 The Company intends to establish full commercial-scale manufacturing for both of its products at Adhpro Adhesives in Magog, Quebec and Simpson Coatings in California through non-exclusive toll manufacturing agreements.
 The Companys strategy is to avoid large capital investments in manufacturing and to outsource the manufacturing of the Company products to third-party manufacturers. At current capacity, the Company can manufacture 20,000 tons per year.
 Third Party Manufacturing Partners
 Adhpro Adhesives Inc. 
 Adhpro is an industrial premium quality adhesives manufacturer based out of Magog, Quebec Canada. Adhpros products are manufactured from the highest quality raw material to meet customers exact needs. Established since 1990, Adhpro is a young company that is expanding its skills from coast to coast.

Facilities and Employees 
 Hybrid Coating Technologies Inc.s office is located in Daly City, California, U.S.A.
 As of December 31, 2016, Hybrid Coating Technologies Inc. had 3 employees.
 Competition 
 To date, the Company is unaware of any other non isocyanate polyurethane product and as such does not have any direct competition. However, it still must compete against major companies manufacturing and supplying toxic PU based paints and coatings. Large members of this market are BASF, Sherwin Williams, PPG, Benjamin Moore, AKZO Nobel, Rust-Oleum and Sika AG. The Companys products, however, offer these competitors a cost-effective and attractive green alternative to their existing coating formulations and this is why almost all of the top 10 formulators in the world have sought out the Company to learn about Green Polyurethane.
Environmental Matters 
 The Company is not aware of any pending or threatened environmental investigation, proceeding or action by foreign, federal, state or local agencies, or third parties involving its current operations.
