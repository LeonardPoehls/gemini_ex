(a) GENERAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE REGISTRANT’S BUSINESS
The Registrant was incorporated in Mississippi in 1955, and is a fully, vertically-integrated poultry processing company engaged in the production, processing, marketing and distribution of fresh and frozen chicken products. In addition, the Registrant is engaged in the processing, marketing and distribution of processed and minimally prepared chicken.
The Registrant sells ice pack, chill pack, bulk pack and frozen chicken, in whole, cut-up and boneless form, primarily under the Sanderson Farms® brand name to retailers, distributors, and casual dining operators principally in the southeastern, southwestern, northeastern and western United States, and to customers who resell frozen chicken into export markets. During its fiscal year ended October 31, 2017, the Registrant processed approximately 567 million chickens, or approximately 4.3 billion dressed pounds. According to 2017 industry statistics, the Registrant was the third largest processor of dressed chicken in the United States based on average weekly processed pounds.
The Registrant’s fresh and frozen chicken operations presently encompass 10 hatcheries, 8 feed mills and 11 processing plants, including the facilities at its new St. Pauls, North Carolina complex. The Registrant began operations at the new St. Pauls hatchery in November 2016, and began processing chickens at the new processing plant in January 2017. The complex is currently operating near full capacity. The Registrant has one prepared chicken plant. 
The Registrant has contracts with operators of approximately 759 grow-out farms that provide it with sufficient housing capacity for its current operations. The Registrant also has contracts with operators of 218 breeder farms.
The Company’s prepared chicken product line includes approximately 90 institutional and consumer packaged partially cooked or marinated chicken items that it sells nationally, primarily to distributors and food service establishments. A majority of the prepared chicken items are made to the specifications of food service users.
Since the Registrant completed the initial public offering of its common stock in May 1987, the Registrant has significantly expanded its operations by expanding existing facilities, adding second shifts and constructing new facilities to increase production capacity, product lines and marketing flexibility. 
The Company changed its marketing strategy in 1997 to move away from growing small-sized birds serving primarily the fast food industry to concentrate its production in the medium-sized and larger-sized birds serving the retail grocery and food service industries, respectively. This shift resulted in larger average bird weights of the chickens processed by the Company, and substantially increased the number of pounds processed by the Company. In addition, the Company continually evaluates internal and external expansion opportunities to continue its growth in poultry and/or related food products.
In January 2011, the Company began initial operations at a new poultry processing complex in Kinston, North Carolina. The Kinston facilities comprise a poultry complex consisting of a hatchery, feed mill, processing plant, and wastewater facility with the capacity to process 1.25 million chickens per week. The facility reached full capacity during March 2012.

In February 2015, the Company began initial operations at a new poultry processing complex in Palestine, Texas. The complex consists of a hatchery, feed mill, processing plant and waste water facility with the capacity to process 1.25 million chickens per week, and the facility is currently operating at full capacity. During fiscal 2017, the Palestine processing plant processed approximately 539.4 million pounds of dressed poultry meat, as compared to 351.7 million pounds during fiscal 2016.
In March 2015, the Company announced the selection of sites in and near St. Pauls, North Carolina, for the construction of a new poultry complex. The completed complex consists of a hatchery, processing plant, waste water treatment facility, and an expansion of the Company's existing feed mill in Kinston, North Carolina. Construction began in July 2015, and initial operations of the new complex began during the first quarter of fiscal 2017. At full capacity, the new complex will process 1.25 million chickens per week. The facility steadily increased production throughout fiscal 2017 and is currently operating just below full capacity. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, the St. Pauls processing plant processed approximately 122.4 million pounds of dressed poultry meat, as compared to 76.4 million pounds during the third quarter of fiscal 2017, 46.2 million pounds during the second quarter of fiscal 2017, and 4.0 million pounds during the first quarter of fiscal 2017. We expect the complex to reach full capacity in January 2018. See “The construction and potential benefits of our new facilities are subject to risks and uncertainties” in the Risk Factors Section of this Annual Report. 
In March 2017, the Company announced the selection of sites in Lindale, Mineola and Smith County, Texas, for the construction of a new poultry processing complex. The completed complex will consist of a hatchery, feed mill, processing plant and waste water treatment facility with the capacity to process 1.25 million chickens per week. We are in the early stages of construction, and initial operations of the new complex are expected to begin during the first calendar quarter of 2019. Before the complex can become operational, we will need to obtain the necessary licenses and permits, enter into construction contracts, enter into contracts with a sufficient number of independent contract poultry producers to house the live inventory and hire and train our workforce. See "The construction and potential benefits of our new facilities are subject to risks and uncertainties" in the Risk Factors section of this Annual Report.
Capital expenditures for fiscal 2017 were funded by cash on hand and cash provided by operations during fiscal 2017. The Company is a party to a revolving credit facility dated April 28, 2017, as amended on November 22, 2017, with a maximum available borrowing capacity of $900.0 million. The facility has annual capital expenditure limitations of $100.0 million, $105.0 million, $110.0 million, $115.0 million, $120.0 million and $125.0 million for fiscal years 2017 through 2022, respectively, and permits up to $15.0 million of the unused capital expenditure limitation from fiscal year 2016 to be carried over to the fiscal year 2017; thereafter, up to $20.0 million of the unused limitation for any fiscal year starting with fiscal year 2017 may be carried over to the next fiscal year. The normal capital expenditure limitation for fiscal 2017 was $115.0 million (including $15.0 million carried over from fiscal 2016), and the normal limitation for fiscal 2018 is $125.0 million (including $20.0 million carried over from fiscal 2017). 
The credit facility also permits capital expenditures up to $200.5 million on the construction of a new poultry processing complex in Lindale, Mineola and Smith County, Texas, up to $210.0 million on the construction of a potential additional new poultry complex, up to $15.0 million on expansion of the Company's existing prepared chicken facility in Flowood, Mississippi, up to $60.0 million on a potential new prepared chicken facility, and up to $70.0 million on the purchase of three new aircraft. As amended on November 22, 2017, the facility also excludes from the normal capital expenditure limits certain capital projects in an aggregate amount of up to $135.0 million. These additional projects, which include the construction of a new feed mill, and other expansions, equipment and changes to the Laurel, Collins, McComb and Hazlehurst, Mississippi complexes; the Waco, Palestine and Brazos, Texas complexes; the Moultrie, Georgia complex; and the Kinston, North Carolina complex, are each subject to their own expenditure limitations. 
Under the credit facility, the Company may not exceed a maximum debt to total capitalization ratio of 50%. The Company has a one-time right, at any time during the term of the agreement, to increase the maximum debt to total capitalization ratio then in effect by five percentage points in connection with the construction of any of the three aforementioned new complexes for the four fiscal quarters beginning on the first day of the fiscal quarter during which the Company gives written notice of its intent to exercise this right. The Company has not exercised this right. The facility also sets a minimum net worth requirement that at October 31, 2017, was $980.2 million. The credit is unsecured and, unless extended, will expire on April 28, 2022. As of October 31 and December 13, 2017, the Company had no outstanding draws under the facility, and had approximately $19.7 million outstanding in letters of credit, leaving $880.3 million of borrowing capacity available under the facility. For more information about the facility, see Item 1.01 of our Current Report on Form 8-K filed May 4, 2017, and Item 1.01 of our Current Report on Form 8-K filed November 29, 2017, which are incorporated herein by reference.

Not applicable.
(c) NARRATIVE DESCRIPTION OF REGISTRANT’S BUSINESS
General
The Registrant is engaged in the production, processing, marketing and distribution of fresh and frozen chicken and the preparation, processing, marketing and distribution of processed and minimally prepared chicken items. The Registrant has one reporting segment, poultry products. 
The Registrant sells chill pack, ice pack, bulk pack and frozen chicken, in whole, cut-up and boneless form, primarily under the Sanderson Farms® brand name, to retailers, distributors and casual dining operators principally in the southeastern, southwestern, northeastern and western United States. During its fiscal year ended October 31, 2017, the Registrant processed approximately 567 million chickens, or approximately 4.3 billion dressed pounds. In addition, the Registrant purchased and further processed 0.8 million pounds of poultry products during fiscal 2017. According to 2017 industry statistics, the Registrant was the third largest processor of dressed chicken in the United States based on average weekly processed pounds.
The Registrant conducts its chicken operations through Sanderson Farms, Inc. (Production Division) and Sanderson Farms, Inc. (Processing Division), both of which are wholly-owned subsidiaries of Sanderson Farms, Inc. The production subsidiary, Sanderson Farms, Inc. (Production Division), which has facilities in Laurel, Collins, Hazlehurst and McComb, Mississippi; Bryan, Waco, Palestine, Freestone County, and Robertson County, Texas; Adel, Georgia; and Kinston and Lumberton, North Carolina, is engaged in the production of chickens to the broiler stage. Sanderson Farms, Inc. (Processing Division), which has facilities in Laurel, Collins, Hazlehurst and McComb, Mississippi; Hammond, Louisiana; Bryan, Palestine, and Waco, Texas; Moultrie, Georgia; and Kinston and St. Pauls, North Carolina, is engaged in the processing, sale and distribution of chicken products.
The Registrant conducts its prepared chicken business through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Sanderson Farms, Inc. (Foods Division), which has a facility in Flowood, Mississippi. This facility is engaged in the processing, marketing and distribution of approximately 90 processed and minimally prepared chicken items, which it sells nationally and regionally, principally to distributors and national food service accounts. The facility is managed by the same senior management team that manages our Processing Division. 
Products
The Registrant has the ability to produce a wide range of processed chicken products and prepared chicken items.
Processed chicken is first salable as an ice packed, whole chicken. The Registrant adds value to its ice packed, whole chickens by removing the giblets, weighing, packaging and labeling the product to specific customer requirements and cutting and deboning the product based on customer specifications. The additional processing steps of giblet removal, close tolerance weighing and cutting increase the value of the product to the customer over whole, ice packed chickens by reducing customer handling and cutting labor and capital costs, reducing the shrinkage associated with cutting, and ensuring consistently sized portions.
The Registrant adds additional value to the processed chicken by deep chilling and packaging whole chickens in bags or combinations of fresh chicken parts, including boneless product, in various sized, individual trays under the Registrant’s brand name, which then may be weighed and pre-priced, based on each customer’s needs. This chill pack process increases the value of the product by extending shelf life, reducing customer weighing and packaging labor, and providing the customer with a wide variety of products with uniform, well designed packaging, all of which enhance the customer’s ability to merchandise chicken products.
To satisfy some customers’ merchandising needs, the Registrant freezes the chicken product, which adds value by meeting the customers’ handling, storage, distribution and marketing needs and by permitting shipment of product overseas where transportation time may be as long as 60 days.

Markets and Pricing
The three largest customer markets in the fresh and frozen chicken industry are big bird, chill pack and small birds.
The following table sets forth, for each of the Company’s poultry processing plants, the general customer market to which the plant is devoted, the weekly capacity of each plant at full capacity expressed in number of head processed, and the industry's average size of birds processed in the relevant market.

Plant Location | Market | Capacity Per Week | Industry Bird Size
Laurel, Mississippi | Big Bird | 625,000 | | 8.99
Hazlehurst, Mississippi | Big Bird | 625,000 | | 8.99

Our big bird plants process a relatively large bird. The dark meat from these birds is sold primarily as frozen leg quarters in the export market or as fresh whole legs to further processors. While we have long-standing relationships with many of our export partners, virtually all of our export sales are at negotiated or spot commodity prices, which prices exhibit fluctuations typical of commodity markets. We have few long-term contracts for this product. 
The white meat produced at these plants is generally sold as bulk-packed, fresh boneless breast meat, chicken tenders and whole or cut wings, and is sold primarily to restaurants, food service customers and further processors at negotiated spreads from quoted commodity market prices for wings, tenders and boneless breast meat. We have long-term contracts with many of our customers for white meat produced at our big bird plants, but prices for products sold pursuant to those contracts fluctuate based on quoted commodity market prices. The contracts do not require the customers to purchase, or the Company to sell, any specific quantity of product.

As of October 31, 2017, the Company had the capacity to process 6.875 million head per week in its big bird plants, and its results are materially affected by fluctuations in the commodity market prices for leg quarters, boneless breast meat, chicken tenders and wings, as quoted by Urner Barry.
The Urner Barry spot market price for leg quarters, boneless breast meat, chicken tenders and whole wings for the past five calendar years is set forth below. Realized prices will not necessarily equal quoted market prices since most contracts offer negotiated discounts to quoted market prices, which discounts are negotiated on a customer by customer basis and are influenced by many factors. Selection of a particular market price benchmark is largely customer driven:

Our chill pack plants process medium sized birds and cut and package the product in various sized individual trays to customers’ specifications. The trays are weighed and pre-priced primarily for customers to resell through retail grocery outlets. While the Company sells some of its chill pack product under store brand names, most of its chill pack production is sold under the Company’s Sanderson Farms® brand name. The Company has long-term contracts with most of its chill pack customers. These agreements typically provide for the pricing of product based on negotiated formulas that use an agreed upon, regularly quoted market price as the base, as well as various other guidelines for the relationship between the parties. All of our contracts with retail grocery store customers also provide for the sale of negotiated quantities of product at fixed and periodically negotiated prices, rather than the formula-driven prices discussed above. None of our contracts with retail grocery store customers require the customers to purchase, or the Company to sell, any specific quantity of product. As of October 31, 2017, the Company had the capacity to process 5.0 million head per week at its chill pack plants, and its results are materially affected by fluctuations in Urner Barry prices and other market benchmarks.
As with products produced at our big bird plants, selection of the appropriate market benchmark for pricing chill pack products is largely customer driven. Prior to the discontinuation in November 2016 of the Georgia Dock index, which had been published by the Georgia Department of Agriculture, many of our chill pack customers used that index as the base for pricing formulas. Following its discontinuation, many of those customers preferred to continue using the last quoted Georgia Dock 
8

price for the formula base until a new index could be developed. As new and renewing contracts were negotiated during fiscal 2017, discussions included determining which index would be used as the pricing formula base during the life of the contract. For that base, some of our customers have chosen to use the index published by Express Markets, Inc ("EMI"), and some have not yet decided which index will be used. 
Almost all of our products sold by our prepared chicken plant are sold under long-term contracts at fixed prices related to the spot commodity price of chicken at the time the contract is negotiated, plus a premium for additional processing.
Sales and Marketing
The Registrant’s chicken products are sold primarily to retailers (including national and regional supermarket chains and local supermarkets) and distributors located principally in the southeastern, southwestern, northeastern and western United States. The Registrant also sells its chicken products to casual dining operators and to United States based customers who resell the products outside of the continental United States. This wide range of customers, together with the Registrant’s product mix, provides the Registrant with flexibility in responding to changing market conditions in its effort to maximize profits. This flexibility also assists the Registrant in its efforts to reduce its exposure to market volatility, although its ability to do so is limited.
Sales and distribution of the Registrant’s chicken products are conducted primarily by sales personnel at the Registrant’s general corporate offices in Laurel, Mississippi, by customer service representatives at each of its processing plants and one prepared chicken plant and through independent food brokers. Each plant has individual on-site distribution centers and uses contract carriers for distribution of its products.
Generally, the Registrant prices much of its chicken products based upon weekly and daily market prices reported by private firms such as EMI and Urner Barry. The Registrant’s profitability is affected by such market prices, which may fluctuate substantially and exhibit cyclical and seasonal characteristics. The Registrant will adjust base prices depending upon value added, volume, product mix and other factors. While base prices may change weekly and daily, the Registrant’s adjustments to those base prices are generally negotiated from time to time with the Registrant’s customers. The Registrant’s sales are generally made on an as-ordered basis, and the Registrant maintains some long-term sales contracts with its customers. These agreements, which provide for the pricing of product based on formulas that use market prices reported by private firms such as EMI and Urner Barry as a base, as well as various other guidelines for the relationship between the parties, do not require the customers to purchase or the Company to sell any specific quantity of product. 
From time to time, the Registrant may use television, radio and newspaper advertising, point of purchase material and other marketing techniques to develop consumer awareness of and brand recognition for its Sanderson Farms® products. The Registrant has achieved a high level of public awareness and acceptance of its products in its core markets. Brand awareness is an important element of the Registrant’s marketing philosophy, and it intends to continue brand name merchandising of its products. During calendar 2004, the Company launched an advertising campaign designed to distinguish the Company’s fresh chicken products from competitors’ products. The campaign noted that the Company’s product is a natural product free from salt, water and other additives that some competitors inject into their fresh chicken. The Company continues to use various media to communicate this message today. During fiscal 2016, the Company launched a multi-media advertising campaign designed to explain and support the Company's position regarding the judicious use of antibiotics to prevent illness and treat chickens that become ill. During fiscal 2017, the Company launched a multi-media advertising campaign designed to dispel many of the myths about poultry production. The Company regularly evaluates the success of this campaign and expects to continue to use the campaign, at least for the near term. 
The Registrant’s prepared chicken items are sold nationally, primarily to distributors and national food service accounts. Sales of such products are handled by sales personnel of the Registrant and by independent food brokers. Prepared chicken items are distributed from the Registrant’s plant in Flowood, Mississippi, through arrangements with contract carriers.
Production and Facilities
General. The Registrant is a fully, vertically-integrated producer of fresh, frozen and minimally prepared chicken products, controlling the production of hatching eggs, hatching, feed manufacturing, growing, processing and packaging of its product lines.
Breeding and Hatching. The Registrant maintains its own breeder flocks for the production of hatching eggs. The Registrant’s breeder flocks are acquired as one-day old chicks (known as pullets and cockerels) from primary breeding companies that specialize in the production of genetically designed breeder stock. As of October 31, 2017, the Registrant 
9

maintained contracts with 63 independent contract pullet producers for the grow-out of pullets (growing the pullet to the point at which it is capable of egg production, which takes approximately six months). Thereafter, the mature breeder flocks are transported by the Registrant’s vehicles to breeder farms that are maintained, as of October 31, 2017, by 155 independent contractors under the Registrant’s supervision. Eggs produced on the farms of independent contract breeder producers are transported to the Registrant’s hatcheries in the Registrant’s vehicles.
The Registrant owns and operates ten hatcheries located in Mississippi, Texas, Georgia and North Carolina where eggs are incubated, vaccinated and hatched in a process requiring 21 days. The chicks are vaccinated against common poultry diseases and are transported by the Registrant’s vehicles to independent contract grow-out farms. As of October 31, 2017, the Registrant’s hatcheries were capable of producing an aggregate of approximately 12.7 million chicks per week.
Grow-out. The Registrant places its chicks on the farms of 759 independent contract broiler producers, as of October 31, 2017, located in Mississippi, Texas, Georgia and North Carolina, where broilers are grown to an age of approximately seven to nine weeks. The farms provide the Registrant with sufficient housing capacity for its operations, and are typically family-owned farms operated under contract with the Registrant. The farm owners provide facilities, utilities and labor; the Registrant supplies the day-old chicks, feed and veterinary and technical services. The farm owner is compensated pursuant to an incentive formula designed to promote production cost efficiency.
Historically, the Registrant has been able to accommodate expansion in grow-out facilities through additional contract arrangements with independent contract producers.
Feed Mills. An important factor in the grow-out of chickens is the rate at which chickens convert feed into body weight. The Registrant purchases primary feed ingredients on the open market. Ingredients include corn and soybean meal, which historically have been the largest cost components of the Registrant’s total feed costs. The quality and composition of the feed are critical to the conversion rate, and accordingly, the Registrant formulates and produces its own feed. As of October 31, 2017, the Registrant operated eight feed mills, four of which are located in Mississippi, two in Texas, one in Georgia and one in North Carolina. The Registrant’s annual feed requirements for fiscal 2017 were approximately 4,594,000 tons, and it has the capacity to produce approximately 5,866,000 tons of finished feed annually under current configurations.
Feed grains are commodities subject to volatile price changes caused by weather, size of the harvest, transportation and storage costs, domestic and export demand and the agricultural and energy policies of the United States and foreign governments. On October 31, 2017, the Registrant had the capacity to store approximately 3,697,000 bushels of corn at its feed mills, which was sufficient to store approximately one week's requirements for corn. Generally, the Registrant purchases its corn and other feed ingredients at current prices from suppliers and, to a limited extent, directly from farmers. Feed grains are available from an adequate number of sources. Although the Registrant has not experienced and does not anticipate problems in securing adequate supplies of feed grains, price fluctuations of feed grains have a direct and material effect upon the Registrant’s profitability. Although the Registrant attempts to manage the risk of volatile price changes in grain markets by sometimes purchasing grain at current prices for future delivery, it cannot eliminate the potentially adverse effect of grain price increases.
Processing. Once broilers reach processing weight, they are transported to the Registrant’s processing plants. These plants use modern, highly automated equipment to process and package the chickens. The Registrant’s McComb and Collins, Mississippi; Moultrie, Georgia; Kinston and St. Pauls, North Carolina and Bryan, Waco and Palestine, Texas processing plants operate two processing lines on a double shift basis and each had the capacity to process approximately 1,250,000 chickens per week on October 31, 2017. The Registrant’s Laurel and Hazlehurst, Mississippi and Hammond, Louisiana processing plants operate on a double shift basis and collectively had the capacity to process approximately 1,875,000 chickens per week on October 31, 2017. At October 31, 2017, the Company’s deboning facilities were operating on a double shift basis and had the capacity to produce approximately 19.2 million pounds of big bird boneless breast product and 9.0 million pounds of chill pack boneless breast product each week.
Prepared Chicken. The Company's prepared chicken plant is located in Flowood, Mississippi and has approximately 85,000 square feet of refrigerated manufacturing and storage space. The plant uses highly automated equipment to prepare, process and freeze prepared chicken items.
Executive Offices; Other Facilities. The Registrant’s laboratory and corporate offices are located on separate sites in Laurel, Mississippi. The office buildings house the Company’s corporate offices, meeting facilities and computer equipment and constitute the corporate headquarters. As of October 31, 2017, the Registrant operated 13 automotive maintenance shops, which service approximately 1,200 over-the-road and farm vehicles used to support the Registrant's operations. In addition, the 
10

Registrant has one child care facility located near its Collins, Mississippi processing plant, serving on average approximately 215 children on October 31, 2017.
Quality Control
The Registrant believes that quality control is important to its business and conducts quality control activities throughout all aspects of its operations. The Registrant believes these activities are beneficial to efficient production and in assuring its customers receive wholesome, high quality products.
From its company owned laboratory in Laurel, Mississippi, the Director of Technical Services supervises the operation of a modern, well-equipped laboratory which, among other things, monitors sanitation at the hatcheries, quality and purity of the Registrant’s feed ingredients and feed, the health of the Registrant’s breeder flocks and broilers, and conducts microbiological tests on live chickens, facilities and finished products. The Registrant conducts on-site quality control activities at each of the ten processing plants and the prepared chicken plant.
Regulation
The Registrant’s facilities and operations are subject to regulation by various federal and state agencies, including, but not limited to, the Federal Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”), the United States Department of Agriculture (“USDA”), the Environmental Protection Agency ("EPA"), the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (“OSHA”) and corresponding state agencies. The Registrant’s chicken processing plants are subject to continuous on-site inspection by the USDA. The Registrant's prepared chicken plant operates under the USDA’s Total Quality Control Program, which is a strict self-inspection plan written in cooperation with and monitored by the USDA. The FDA inspects the production at the Registrant’s feed mills.
Compliance with existing regulations has not had a material adverse effect upon the Registrant’s earnings or competitive position in the past. Management believes that the Registrant is in substantial compliance with existing laws and regulations relating to the operation of its facilities and does not know of any major capital expenditures necessary to comply with such statutes and regulations.
The Registrant takes extensive precautions to ensure that its flocks are healthy and that its processing plants and other facilities operate in a healthy and environmentally sound manner. Events beyond the control of the Registrant, however, such as an outbreak of disease in its flocks or the adoption by governmental agencies of more stringent regulations, could materially and adversely affect its operations.
Competition
The Registrant is subject to significant competition from regional and national firms in all markets in which it competes. Some of the Registrant’s competitors have greater financial and marketing resources than the Registrant.
The primary methods of competition are price, product quality, number of products offered, brand awareness and customer service. The Registrant has emphasized product quality and brand awareness through its advertising strategy. See “Business — Sales and Marketing.” Although poultry is relatively inexpensive in comparison with other meats, the Registrant competes indirectly with the producers of other meats and fish, since changes in the relative prices of these foods may alter consumer buying patterns.
Customers
One customer accounted for more than 10% of the Registrant’s consolidated sales for the years ended October 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015. Sales to that customer accounted for 17.0%, 17.5% and 16.2% of the Company’s consolidated net sales in fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The Company does not believe the loss of this or any other single customer would have a material adverse effect on the Company because it could sell poultry earmarked for any single customer to alternative customers at market prices.
Sources of Supply
During fiscal 2017, the Registrant purchased its pullets and cockerels from a single major breeder. The Registrant has found the genetic breeds or cross breeds supplied by this company produce chickens most suitable to the Registrant’s purposes. The Registrant has no written contracts with this breeder for the supply of breeder stock. Other sources of breeder stock are available, and the Registrant continually evaluates these sources of supply.
11

Should breeder stock from its present supplier not be available for any reason, the Registrant believes that it could obtain adequate breeder stock from other suppliers.
Other major raw materials used by the Registrant include feed grains and other feed ingredients, cooking ingredients and packaging materials. The Registrant purchases these materials from a number of vendors and believes that its sources of supply are adequate for its present needs. The Registrant does not anticipate any difficulty in obtaining these materials in the future.
Seasonality
The demand for the Registrant’s chicken products generally is greatest during the spring and summer months and lowest during the winter months.
Trademarks
The Registrant has registered with the United States Patent and Trademark Office the trademark Sanderson Farms®, which it uses in connection with the distribution of its prepared chicken and premium grade chill pack products. The Registrant considers the protection of this trademark to be important to its marketing efforts due to consumer awareness of and loyalty to the Sanderson Farms® label. The Registrant also has registered with the United States Patent and Trademark Office five other trademarks that are used in connection with the distribution of chicken and other products and for other competitive purposes.
The Registrant, over the years, has developed important non-public proprietary information regarding product related matters.
