 Item 1.  Business
 WWE is an integrated media and entertainment company. We have been involved in the sports entertainment business for more than 35 years, and have developed WWE into one of the most popular brands in global entertainment today. We develop unique and creative content centered around our talent and present it via our subscription network (“WWE Network”), television, online and at our live events. At the heart of our success are the athletic and entertainment skills and appeal of our Superstars, and our consistently innovative and multi-faceted storylines. Our WWE Network, live and televised events, digital media, home entertainment, consumer products and feature films provide significant cross-promotion and marketing opportunities that reinforce our brands while effectively reaching our fans.
 Based on the strength of the Company’s brands and its ownership and control over its intellectual property, the Company has been able to leverage its content and talent across virtually all media platforms. We continually evaluate additional opportunities to monetize new and existing content, including our WWE Network, which launched in 2014 and is now available in almost all international markets other than the People’s Republic of China and embargoed countries.  The launch of WWE Network has been transformative to WWE; for example, WWE Network carries all of our pay-per-view events, and its annual revenues now greatly exceed prior annual revenues of our pay-per-view business, which WWE Network has largely replaced.

  Media Division
 (represents 63%, 65% and 63% of our net revenues in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively)
 WWE Network
 WWE Network launched on February 24, 2014, becoming the first-ever 24/7 live streaming direct-to-consumer network.  This subscription based network is currently available in almost all international markets, including the United Kingdom, Canada, the Middle East, and Australia, among others. Subscribers can access all of WWE’s live pay-per-view events, exclusive original programming and more than 7,000 hours of our video-on-demand library. The inclusion of our monthly marquis pay-per-view events, including WrestleMania, and the access to original content and live specials are critical components of the programming which drives our viewer engagement and satisfaction. WWE Network content includes exclusive original programming, including, Holy Foley, Swerved and WWE Story Time, as well as exclusive live in-ring specials, including our 2016 broadcasts of WWE Roadblock, Cruiserweight Classic and 205 Live, and our live NXT Takeover specials, among others. Our strategy of creating compelling original content for broadcast on WWE Network has contributed to the growth and acceptance of WWE Network, as we premiered more than 330 hours of original content during 2016. In addition, the continuing evolution of our NXT division, featuring developmental talent, into a global touring brand that airs weekly taped broadcasts on WWE Network, as well as live event specials during the year, has contributed to the growth and acceptance of WWE Network among our fans.
 WWE Network is available on desktops and laptops via WWE.com.  WWE Network is also available through the WWE App on Amazon Fire TV and Kindle Fire devices, Android devices, iOS devices, Apple TV, Roku streaming devices, gaming consoles, interconnected TVs, Blu-Ray players, Smart TVs, TiVo and Windows 10. As of December 31, 2016, WWE Network had 1,403,000 subscribers as compared to 1,217,100 subscribers at December 31, 2015, representing a 15% increase in our subscriber base. For domestic subscribers, the current subscription pricing of WWE Network is $9.99 per month with no minimum commitment, and new subscribers are currently offered a one month free trial.     Network subscription net revenues were $168.3 million, $138.8 million and $69.5 million, representing 23%, 21% and 13% of total net revenues in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.    Pay-Per-View Programming    Beginning in February 2014 with the launch of WWE Network, WWE’s monthly marquis pay-per-view events are included as part of the network subscription. Inclusion of these events as a part of the subscription to WWE Network has resulted in significant declines in our Pay-Per-View revenues, and this decline may continue with the ongoing growth and expansion of WWE Network.
 Pay-per-view net revenues were $12.6 million, $20.6 million and $45.2 million, representing 2%, 3% and 8% of total net revenues in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.  In 2013, the last year prior to the launch of WWE Network, pay-per-view revenues were $82.5 million, representing 16% of total net revenues.
 Television
 Leveraging our expertise in live event television production, we produce five hours of original weekly domestic television programming, RAW and SmackDown.  RAW and SmackDown are licensed domestically under a multi-year contract with NBC Universal, which became effective on October 1, 2014.  Second runs of RAW and SmackDown are also available on WWE Network 30 days after the original first run airing dates on television. We also produce reality shows and other programming. Our television programming is distributed domestically and internationally. Our domestic television programs currently are: RAW on USA Network with replays on NBC Universo and Uni HD; SmackDown, which moved to USA Network on January 7, 2016, with replays on NBC Universo; and Total Divas and Total Bellas on E! Network. WWE’s TV programs reach over 10 million viewers in the United States during the average week. USA Network, E! Network and NBC Universo are owned by NBC Universal.
 In May 2016, we announced the return of the WWE brand split.  A draft was held on July 19, 2016 to select the rosters for RAW and Smackdown.  As part of the brand split, each show now has its own distinct cast, unique storylines and a dedicated writing team.  
 RAW is a three-hour live primetime program which ranks among the most watched regularly scheduled programs on primetime cable television. RAW, which has been on air for 23 years, is the longest running weekly episodic program in primetime TV history, with more than 1,200 original episodes, and anchors USA Network’s programming line-up, consistently helping make it the top-rated cable network.

Beginning July 19, 2016, in connection with the WWE brand split, SmackDown became a two-hour live show (now titled SmackDown Live) for the first time ever and moved to Tuesdays on USA Network. In connection with this move, Raw and SmackDown Live each feature a distinct cast, unique storylines and a dedicated writing team.  Prior to moving to USA Network in January 2016, SmackDown had on average been Syfy’s most-watched program each week; and since its move it has been the second most-watched show on USA Network, second only to Raw. With more than 900 original episodes, SmackDown is the second longest running weekly episodic program in primetime TV history, second only to RAW.
 Total Divas, a one-hour reality series on E!, was added to WWE's programming line-up in July 2013, and returned for its sixth season in November 2016. The reality based show explores life beyond the ring for several female WWE Superstars. Previous episodes of Seasons 1 through 5 are also replayed on WWE Network.
 Total Bellas, a spinoff of the hit series, Total Divas, was added to WWE's programming line-up in October 2016.  This new one-hour reality based series airing on E! gives viewers exclusive access into the lives of The Bella Twins and their significant others, John Cena and Daniel Bryan. In November 2016, it was announced that the series would be renewed for a second season, premiering in 2017.
 WWE’s television programming can be seen in more than 165 countries and 20 languages around the world. Our broadcast partners include: Sky in the United Kingdom; Ten Sports in India, and Rogers Communication in Canada, among many others.  In addition, during 2016, we announced an exclusive multi-year content distribution agreement with PPTV in China to deliver our flagship shows, Raw and SmackDown, live in Mandarin.
 Television net revenues were $241.7 million, $231.1 million and $176.7 million, representing 33%, 35% and 33% of total net revenues in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
 Home Entertainment
 WWE distributes its home entertainment content in both physical (DVD and Blu-Ray) and digital formats.  Content distributed through home entertainment channels has included themed compilations from the Company’s vast archives as well as releases of the Company’s pay-per-view events. Domestically, Warner Brothers Home Entertainment is the current domestic distributor of our home entertainment products. WWE’s home entertainment titles are generally sold through retailers, such as Wal-Mart and Best Buy and via digital outlets, such as iTunes, Amazon, and others. Outside the United States, third-party licensees distribute our home entertainment releases. 
  The gradual shift by consumers to digital formats downloaded or streamed over the Internet has negatively impacted our DVD and Blu-Ray sales. In addition, we believe the continued growth and expansion of WWE Network, which includes access to WWE’s video-on-demand library that includes many titles that are also available in DVD, Blu-Ray and digital formats, has contributed to the decline in our Home Entertainment sales. In 2016, we released 24 new home video productions domestically and, in the U.S., shipped 1.6 million DVD and Blu-Ray units, including catalog titles released in prior years. This compares to 2.1 million DVD and Blu-Ray units shipped in the U.S. in 2015, in which year we released 28 new home video productions domestically. 
 Home entertainment net revenues were $13.1 million, $13.4 million and $27.3 million, representing 2%, 2% and 5% of total net revenues in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
 Digital Media
 WWE utilizes the Internet and social media platforms to promote our brands, market and distribute our content and digital products, create a community experience among our fans and sell online advertising. WWE currently streams its video content on select social media platforms, such as YouTube and Facebook. WWE consistently ranks among the top viewed channels on YouTube, with 11.4 billion views of WWE content in 2016.  The Company receives advertising revenues from YouTube and Facebook based on viewership of our content.  In 2016, WWE had over 1.1 billion social media fan engagements across social media platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Instagram and Tumblr.
 Our primary website, WWE.com, attracted an average of 18 million monthly unique visitors worldwide during 2016. These visitors viewed an average of 307 million pages and 29 million video streams per month. WWE wallpapers, ringtones, voicetones and videos are available through our mobile partnerships.
 WWE currently has language-based websites allowing fans to experience WWE in their native language with a concentration on local events and shows. Currently, the available languages are English, Mandarin, French, German, Polish and Arabic. We have relationships with local sales agencies to sell advertising on WWE.com, which allow a partner to sell advertising across a region of countries.

Total Digital Media net revenues were $26.9 million, $21.5 million and $20.9 million, representing 4%, 3% and 4% of total net revenues in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
 Live Events
 (represents 20%, 19% and 20% of our net revenues in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively)
 Our broad and talented roster of Superstars allows us to perform in numerous domestic markets and take advantage of the strong international demand for our events.  Live events and the associated programming produced at our live events are our principal creative content and production activities. Our creative team develops compelling and complex characters and weaves them into dynamic storylines that combine physical and emotional elements. Storylines are usually played out in the ring and unfold on our weekly television shows, culminating in our monthly marquis events which air on WWE Network and are also available via pay-per-view.
 In 2016, we produced 280 live events (excluding our NXT developmental division) throughout North America, entertaining 1.6 million fans at an average ticket price of $58.19. We hold many of our live events at major arenas across the country. In addition to providing content for our television and other programming, these events provide us with a real-time assessment of the popularity of our storylines and characters.
 In 2016, we produced 64 live events (excluding NXT) internationally, reaching 477,000 fans at an average ticket price of $65.85. These events were spread over several international tours throughout Europe, the Middle East, Asia, Latin America and Australia.    Since launching NXT as a separate live event brand in 2013, it continues to grow into a global touring brand.  In 2016, we produced 189 global NXT events, reaching 188,000 fans at an average ticket price of $37.32.  These events include weekly taped broadcasts that are produced at Full Sail University in Orlando, Florida and air on WWE Network, as well as live event specials, such as NXT: Takeover.  Additionally, the NXT brand held various live events throughout the U.S., as well as international tours in the United Kingdom, Japan and Australia.
 Live events net revenues were $144.4 million, $124.7 million and $110.7 million, representing 20%, 19% and 20% of total net revenues in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
 Consumer Products Division
 (represents 15%, 15% and 14% of our net revenues in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively)
 Licensing
 We have established a worldwide licensing program using our marks and logos, copyrighted works and characters on a large variety of retail products, including toys, video games, apparel and books. Currently, we have relationships with more than 150 licensees worldwide that provide products for sale at major retailers. To maintain the distinctive style and quality of our intellectual property and brand, we retain creative approval over the design, packaging, advertising and promotional materials associated with these products. Additionally, we continually seek new opportunities to partner with best-in-class organizations to develop new products for our fans and further expand our licensing business. 
 Video games and toys are the largest components of our licensing program.  We have a comprehensive, multi-year licensing agreement with Mattel, Inc. our master toy licensee, covering all global territories and a multi-year licensing agreement with Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc. ("Take-Two") who publishes our branded console video games. WWE branded video games currently include WWE 2K, available on PlayStation and XBOX platforms and on iOS and Android devices and WWE SuperCard which is available on iOS and Android devices. The video game industry continues to migrate the availability of video games as downloadable content through an Internet connected device.  Accordingly, both our WWE 2K and WWE SuperCard video games can be downloaded via the Internet and also contain subsequent downloadable content that can be purchased to add additional characters and game modes to enhance game play.
 Music is an integral part of the WWE entertainment experience. We compose and record most of our music, including Superstar entrance themes, in our recording studio. In addition to our own composed music, we license music performed by popular artists.
 Licensing net revenues were $49.1 million, $48.9 million and $38.6 million, representing 7%, 7% and 7% of total net revenues in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.

Venue Merchandise
 Our direct-to-consumer venue merchandise business consists of the design, sourcing, marketing and distribution of numerous WWE-branded products such as t-shirts, belts, caps and other novelty items, all of which feature our Superstars and/or logos.

 WWEShop net revenues were $34.6 million, $27.1 million and $20.2 million, representing 5%, 4%, and 4% of total net revenues in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
 WWE Studios
 (represents 1%, 1% and 2% of our net revenues in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively)
 WWE Studios oversees the Company’s participation in the production and global distribution of filmed entertainment content, which may include movies for theatrical, home entertainment, and/or television release. The Company believes its movie business expands its brands by reaching new audiences and supports the Company’s investment in its Superstar talent.
 Our WWE Studios business model focuses on the utilization of strategic partnerships, including production, distribution and acquisition relationships, to increase financial returns and mitigate risk.  WWE utilizes its marketing and content platforms, especially its weekly presence on prime-time television, to support its movie projects.
 In 2016, WWE Studios released five films.  Among the film projects, WWE Studios joined with Warner Brothers Animation to co-produce and co-finance Scooby Doo! & WWE: Curse of the Speed Demon.  WWE Studios also partnered with Lionsgate to release Countdown and Interrogation direct to DVD, and released Eliminators direct to DVD with Universal Pictures.  Additionally, WWE Studios joined with Blumhouse Productions to release Incarnate via theatrical distribution.
 WWE Studios net revenues were $10.1 million, $7.1 million and $10.9 million, representing 1%, 1% and 2% of total net revenues in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
 International    Revenues generated outside of North America across all our business segments were $189.3 million, $169.8 million and $116.4 million, representing 26%, 26% and 21% of total net revenues in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Revenues generated in the United Kingdom, our largest international market, were $78.5 million, $75.7 million and $40.5 million for 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. During 2016, we launched WWE Network in Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Japan, Thailand and the Philippines.  Also in 2016, we expanded our presence in China by announcing an exclusive multi-year content distribution agreement with PPTV, performing a WWE live event in Shanghai and signing our first-ever Chinese Superstar. Global expansion of WWE Network and television distribution continue to be the primary drivers of growth for our international business.    See Note 20 of the consolidated financial statements included in this report for additional information by segment and by geographic area.
 Creative Development and Production
 Headed by our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Vincent K. McMahon, our creative team develops compelling and complex characters and weaves them into dynamic storylines that combine physical and emotional elements. Storylines are usually played out in the ring and unfold on our weekly television shows, culminating in our monthly marquis events. We voluntarily designate the suitability of each of our television shows using standard industry ratings, and all of our in-ring television programming carries a PG rating, which is critical to maintaining the Company’s reputation for family friendly entertainment.
 Our success is due primarily to the continuing popularity of our Superstars. We currently have approximately 185 Superstars under exclusive contracts, ranging from multi-year guaranteed contracts with established Superstars to developmental contracts with our Superstars in training. Our Superstars are highly trained and motivated independent contractors, whose compensation is tied to the

revenue that they help generate. We own the rights to substantially all of our characters and exclusively license the rights we do not own through agreements with our Superstars. We continually seek to identify, recruit and develop additional talent for our business.
 Talent Development
 We continually seek to identify, recruit and develop additional talent for our business. Our NXT division, which continues to grow in popularity, features developmental talent training to become WWE Superstars. NXT has produced approximately 90% of our current active main roster stars, such as Kevin Owens, Charlotte Flair, American Alpha, Alexa Bliss, and Sami Zayn. NXT has now evolved into our third brand after Raw and SmackDown and has transitioned into a global touring brand broadcasting live specials on WWE Network throughout the year.  In 2016, we focused on recruiting international talent, resulting in approximately 40% of our developmental talent coming from outside the U.S., including China, Japan, Australia, Ireland, Scotland and Poland. NXT talent train at our WWE Performance Center in Florida, a state-of-the-art training facility, which was designed to cultivate our next generation of talent and has become the center of our talent development program. Competition
 While we believe that we have a loyal fan base, the entertainment industry is highly competitive and subject to fluctuations in popularity, which are not easy to predict. For our live, television, WWE Network, pay-per-view and movie audiences, we face competition from professional and college sports, other live, filmed, televised and streamed entertainment, and other leisure activities. We compete with entertainment companies, professional and college sports leagues and other makers of branded apparel and merchandise. We will face increased competition from websites and mobile and other internet connected apps delivering paid and free content, as streamed media offerings continue to expand.  Many companies with whom we compete have greater financial resources than we do. Trademarks and Copyrights
 Intellectual property is material to all aspects of our operations, and we expend substantial cost and effort in an attempt to maintain and protect our intellectual property and to maintain compliance vis-à-vis other parties’ intellectual property. We have a large portfolio of registered and unregistered trademarks and service marks worldwide and maintain a large catalog of copyrighted works, including copyrights in our television and WWE Network programming, music, photographs, books, films and apparel art.  We also own a large number of internet website domain names and operate a network of developed, content-based sites, which facilitate and contribute to the exploitation of our intellectual property worldwide.
 We vigorously seek to enforce our intellectual property rights worldwide by, among other things, searching the internet to ascertain unauthorized use, seizing counterfeit goods and seeking restraining orders and/or damages in court against individuals or entities infringing our intellectual property rights. Our failure or inability to curtail piracy, infringement or other unauthorized use of our intellectual property rights effectively, or our infringement of others’ intellectual property rights, could adversely affect our operating results.
 Financial Information about Segments
 See Note 20 of the consolidated financial statements, which is included elsewhere in this Form 10-K, for financial information about each of our segments.
 Employees
 As of February 2017, we had approximately 870 employees. This headcount excludes our Superstars, who are independent contractors. Our in-house production staff is supplemented with contract personnel for our television production. We believe that our relationships with our employees are good. None of our employees are represented by a union. Regulation
 Live Events
 In various states in the United States and some foreign jurisdictions, athletic commissions and other applicable regulatory agencies require us to obtain licenses for promoters, medical clearances and/or other permits or licenses for performers and/or permits for events in order for us to promote and conduct our live events. If we fail to comply with the regulations of a particular jurisdiction, we may be prohibited from promoting and conducting our live events in that jurisdiction. The inability to present our live events over an extended period of time or in a number of jurisdictions could lead to a decline in the various revenue streams generated from our live events, which could adversely affect our operating results.

Television and WWE Network Programming
 The marketplace for audio-visual programming (including cable television and Internet programming) in the United States and internationally is substantially affected by government regulations applicable to, as well as social and political influences on, television stations, television networks and cable and satellite television systems and channels. Certain Federal Communications Commission (“FCC”) regulations, such as closed-captioning, are imposed directly on the Company and/or indirectly through our distributions.  Other domestic and foreign governmental and private-sector initiatives relating to video programming are announced from time to time.  In addition, the delivery of WWE Network in international markets exposes us to multiple regulatory frameworks, the complexity of which may result in unintentional noncompliance.  Any failure by us to meet these governmental policies and private-sector expectations could restrict our program content and adversely affect our levels of viewership and/or number of WWE Network subscribers and operating results.
