Item 1.    Business
We are a biopharmaceutical company specializing in the development of novel therapeutics to treat ophthalmic diseases, with a focus on diseases of the back of the eye. To date, our primary focus has been on developing therapeutics for age-related macular degeneration, or AMD, which is a disorder of the central portion of the retina, known as the macula, that may result in blindness. Following our announcement in December 2016 that two of our three pivotal, Phase 3 clinical trials for Fovista® (pegpleranib), an anti-platelet derived growth factor, or PDGF, aptamer, in development for the treatment of wet AMD, failed to meet their primary endpoint, we initiated a plan to review our strategic alternatives in order to maximize shareholder value and implement an updated business plan.  Without limiting any option, we plan to continue to focus on the development of product candidates for ophthalmic diseases, especially back of the eye disorders. We are actively exploring opportunities to obtain rights to additional products, product candidates and technologies to treat ophthalmic diseases.  We are also currently continuing to develop our product candidate Zimura® (avacincaptad pegol), an inhibitor of complement factor C5, for the treatment of geographic atrophy, or GA, a form of dry AMD, and in combination with anti-VEGF drugs for the treatment of wet AMD, and are continuing our remaining Phase 3 Fovista clinical trial, OPH1004. We plan to reassess our existing Fovista and Zimura development programs throughout 2017 as the implementation of our updated business plan progresses and evolves, with the goal of aligning corporate resources in the context of a potentially broader product pipeline. We expect that our reassessment of our Fovista development program for the treatment of wet AMD will be primarily determined by the initial, top-line data from OPH1004 and that our reassessment of our Zimura development program may be particularly affected by the results of a competitor’s Phase 3 clinical trial of a complement inhibitor being studied for the treatment of GA. Data from both our OPH1004 trial and our competitor’s Phase 3 trial for the treatment of GA are expected during the second half of 2017.  As a result of this reassessment, we may modify, expand or terminate some or all of our development programs or clinical trials at any time. We generally expect that we will not engage in internal early stage research and drug discovery and will thus avoid the related costs and risks of these activities.
In December 2016, we announced initial, top-line data from two pivotal clinical trials, which we refer to as OPH1002 and OPH1003, evaluating the safety and efficacy of 1.5mg of Fovista administered in combination with monthly 0.5mg Lucentis® (ranibizumab) anti-VEGF therapy compared to monthly Lucentis monotherapy for the treatment of wet AMD. The current standard of care for wet AMD is monotherapy targeting vascular endothelial growth factor, referred to as anti-VEGF therapy. The pre-specified primary endpoint of mean change in visual acuity at 12 months was not achieved for either OPH1002 or OPH1003. Moreover, we have not observed any clinically meaningful visual benefit when 1.5mg of Fovista was added to a monthly regimen of 0.5mg Lucentis therapy for any subgroup of patients that we have analyzed from the OPH1002 and OPH1003 trials, including subgroups based on baseline visual acuity, baseline lesion size or the baseline amount of the classic component of choroidal neovascularization, or CNV.  Following the December 2016 data announcement, we subsequently stopped treating patients in, and terminated, both the OPH1002 and OPH1003 trials.  OPH1004, our remaining Phase 3 clinical trial, which is evaluating the safety and efficacy of 1.5 mg of Fovista administered in combination with 2.0mg Eylea® (afilbercept) or 1.25mg Avastin® (bevacizumab) anti-VEGF therapy compared to Eylea or Avastin monotherapy for the treatment of wet AMD, remains ongoing, with initial, top-line data expected to be available during the second half of 2017.  The failure of OPH1002 and OPH1003 to show any clinically meaningful visual benefit in adding 1.5mg of Fovista to a monthly regimen of 0.5mg of Lucentis and the recent failure of a competitor’s Phase 2 trial investigating the combination of a PDGF inhibitor and a VEGF inhibitor, may be indicative of a low likelihood of success for OPH1004. In light of the data from the OPH1002 and OPH1003 trials, we have also stopped treating patients in our additional Phase 2 clinical trials that were

evaluating the potential additional benefits of Fovista administered in combination with anti-VEGF drugs in wet AMD patients, which we previously referred to collectively as the Fovista Expansion Studies.
There are two forms of AMD, dry AMD and wet AMD. Dry AMD can progress to wet AMD. Although dry AMD is the most common form of AMD, there are no therapies approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration or European Medicines Agency to treat this condition. We are currently developing our product candidate Zimura as a monotherapy for the treatment of GA, a form of dry AMD, as well as in combination with anti-VEGF drugs for the treatment of wet AMD.  Zimura is an inhibitor of complement factor C5, a protein that is associated with complement mediated inflammation and cell damage, which we believe may be involved in the development and progression of dry AMD and wet AMD. We have completed a multicenter, uncontrolled, open-label Phase 1/2a clinical trial of Zimura monotherapy for the treatment of GA, a multicenter, uncontrolled, open-label, ascending dose and parallel group Phase 1/2a clinical trial of Zimura administered in combination with Lucentis for the treatment of wet AMD and a very small, uncontrolled, open-label Phase 2 clinical trial investigating Zimura's potential role when administered in combination with anti-VEGF drugs for the treatment of polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy, or PCV, which is a specific type of wet AMD, in patients who do not respond adequately to treatment with anti-VEGF monotherapy or for whom anti-VEGF monotherapy fails. Currently, we have the following ongoing clinical trials for Zimura:

• | Zimura Phase 2a Wet AMD Study. During the fourth quarter of 2015, we initiated an open‑label Phase 2a clinical trial to evaluate Zimura’s potential role when administered in combination with anti‑VEGF therapy for the treatment of wet AMD in patients who do not respond adequately to treatment with anti-VEGF monotherapy. We plan to enroll up to approximately 60 patients in this trial, and may include patients with PCV. Recruitment of patients in this study is ongoing. 


• | Zimura Phase 2/3 GA Study. During the fourth quarter of 2015, we initiated a randomized, double‑masked, controlled Phase 2/3 clinical trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Zimura monotherapy in patients with GA. Recruitment of patients in this study is ongoing. 

We remain very early in the recruitment phase for both of our ongoing Zimura clinical trials.
In early 2017, we engaged a financial advisor and initiated a plan to review our strategic alternatives in order to maximize shareholder value following the failure of two of our three pivotal Fovista trials. Without limiting any option, the principal focus of this plan, based on our deep expertise and experience in ophthalmology, is to actively explore obtaining rights to additional products, product candidates and technologies to treat ophthalmic diseases, particularly those of the back of the eye. We are particularly interested in obtaining rights to product candidates for ocular indications with a high unmet medical need. We believe that with our expertise and experience in ophthalmology we are well positioned to explore and critically evaluate a variety of opportunities. We also believe that our focus on diseases of the eye and our experienced management team will make us an attractive collaborator or acquirer for companies seeking to out-license or sell rights to products, product candidates or technologies. As part of our updated business plan, we are also reviewing whether there is any scientific rationale for potentially developing our current product candidates, Fovista and Zimura, in one or more other ophthalmic indications where there is a high unmet need. As part of our strategic review, we may also consider other alternatives, including the acquisition of products, product candidates or technologies or other assets outside of ophthalmology, mergers or other transactions involving our company as a whole, collaboration transactions, or the license, sale or divestiture of some of our assets or technologies. We cannot be sure when or if this strategic review process will result in any type of transaction. As of December 31, 2016, we had $289.3 million in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, of which approximately $100 million to $115 million is committed to the wind-down of OPH1002 and OPH1003 and the Fovista Expansion Studies, implementation of a previously announced reduction in personnel and related costs, cancellation fees related to manufacturing commitments, and obtaining initial, top-line data for the OPH1004 trial during the second half of 2017.

Eye Disease
Eye disease can be caused by many factors and can affect both the front and back of the eye. In its most extreme cases, eye disease can result in blindness. In the developed world, the major diseases that result in blindness are those affecting the retina, including AMD and diabetic retinopathy, and glaucoma. These diseases deprive patients of their sight and, as a result, their ability to live independently and perform daily activities. Any improvement in vision, or even a slowing of the rate of vision loss, has a tremendous impact on the quality of life of patients with impaired vision. There are also many other eye diseases, that may be less common but still have unmet medical need. We believe these other ophthalmic disease areas present several potential opportunities for ophthalmic drug development.
Age Related Macular Degeneration
AMD is a leading cause of vision loss in people over the age of 50 in the western world. There are two forms of AMD, dry AMD and wet AMD. According to AMD Alliance International, approximately 10 million people in the United States and 30 million people worldwide suffer from some form of AMD. AMD Alliance International estimates that dry AMD accounts for 85% to 90% of all AMD cases, while a study published in Ophthalmology in 2012 analyzing age and gender variations in AMD prevalence estimates that approximately 8 million people worldwide are affected by GA, a form of dry AMD. A study on the burden of AMD published in 2006 in the peer reviewed journal Current Opinion in Ophthalmology, estimated that 1,250,000 people in the United States, suffer from wet AMD. In addition, AMD Alliance International reports that approximately 200,000 new cases of wet AMD arise each year in the United States. Based on U.S. Census Bureau data, we estimate that over the next two decades in the United States the number of people aged 55 or older is expected to increase by approximately 36% and the number of people aged 65 and older is expected to increase by approximately 69%. We expect that this increase in the number of elderly people will result in a significant increase in the number of cases of both dry AMD, including cases of GA, and wet AMD in the United States. In addition to having a devastating effect on patients, AMD also has a significant impact on the economy. According to a 2010 study sponsored by AMD Alliance International, the annual direct healthcare system costs of visual impairment worldwide due to AMD were estimated at approximately $255 billion.
Wet AMD 
Wet AMD is preceded by dry AMD. In a subset of patients, dry AMD converts to wet AMD when new and abnormal blood vessels invade the retina. These abnormal new blood vessels originate beneath the retina, in a layer called the choroid, and invade into the overlying retinal layers. This abnormal new blood vessel growth is generally referred to as pathological angiogenesis. In the context of wet AMD, pathological angiogenesis is associated with both the development of neovascular cells and the accumulation of other cell types and altered tissue. The pathological neovascular tissue in wet AMD is called the choroidal neovascular complex or choroidal neovascularization. Choroidal neovascularization, or CNV, and adjacent and contiguous areas of blood and altered tissue are referred to as a lesion.
Abnormal new blood vessels tend to be fragile and often bleed and leak fluid into the macula, the central most portion of the retina responsible for central vision and color perception. Untreated, new blood vessel growth and associated leakage typically lead to retinal distortion and eventual retinal scarring, with irreversible destruction of the macula, resulting in loss of vision. This visual loss occurs rapidly with a progressive course. Approximately 90% of wet AMD cases involve subfoveal choroidal neovascularization, which is blood vessel growth directly under the central portion of the macula, known as the fovea. Our Phase 3 clinical program for Fovista enrolled patients with subfoveal wet AMD.
Wet AMD traditionally has been divided into subtypes based on the pattern of the abnormal new blood vessels using the diagnostic imaging technique fluorescein angiography or cross sectional location of the abnormal new blood vessels using the diagnostic imaging technique spectral domain optical coherence tomography, or SD-OCT. These subtypes form a continuous spectrum of pathological neovascularization based on whether the abnormal new blood vessels are well defined and delineated as determined by fluorescein angiography or whether they have invaded the retinal pigment epithelium, or RPE, layer of the retina. The RPE layer of the retina lies between the choroid and the neurosensory region of the retina. The term "classic" applies to the portion or component of the patient's abnormal new bloods vessels or neovascularization that is well defined by fluorescein angiography, with their location usually represented above the RPE. The term "occult" applies to the portion or component of the patient's abnormal new blood vessels that is poorly defined by fluorescein angiography, with their location usually represented below the RPE.
Abnormal new blood vessels are predominantly made up of two cell types, endothelial cells and pericytes. The endothelial cells line the inside of abnormal new blood vessels. Pericytes then intimately cover the outside of these blood vessels. Early in the process of abnormal new blood vessel formation, VEGF binds to a receptor on endothelial cells and causes endothelial cells to proliferate. The proliferating endothelial cells form new blood vessels. VEGF provides survival signals to 
4


endothelial cells. VEGF also is one of the most potent inducers of blood vessel permeability, which causes the new blood vessels to leak.
PDGF binds to a receptor on pericytes. The binding of PDGF provides an important cell survival signal to pericytes. PDGF also recruits pericytes to the abnormal new blood vessel, where they mature and cover the endothelial cells. Pericytes locally supply the endothelial cells with growth and survival factors, including VEGF, and play a major role in endothelial cell survival. Pericytes also physically support and stabilize the abnormal new blood vessels. PDGF attracts pericytes, RPE cells and other cells, which are all involved in the formation of the choroidal neovascular complex.
The current standard of care for wet AMD is administration by intravitreal injection of anti‑VEGF drugs as monotherapy. Anti‑VEGF drugs prevent VEGF from binding to its natural receptor on endothelial cells in the abnormal new blood vessels, thereby inhibiting further abnormal new blood vessel growth and leakage associated with wet AMD. The FDA has approved the anti‑VEGF drugs Lucentis, Eylea and Macugen for the treatment of wet AMD. The FDA also has approved photodynamic therapy with Visudyne (PDT) as a treatment of patients with wet AMD. In addition, although approved by the FDA as a cancer therapy, the anti‑VEGF drug Avastin is used off‑label to treat wet AMD. Lucentis is an antibody fragment derived from the same full length antibody from which Avastin was derived.
Fovista
Our product candidate Fovista is designed to target PDGF. We pursued development of Fovista based on a hypothesis that the administration of Fovista in combination with anti‑VEGF drugs in patients with wet AMD may cause regression of neovascularization more effectively than anti‑VEGF monotherapy, thereby potentially resulting in increased visual benefit for patients with wet AMD. However, in light of the failure of our pivotal OPH1002 and OPH1003 Fovista trials for the treatment of wet AMD to show a visual benefit from the addition of 1.5mg of Fovista to a monthly 0.5mg regimen of Lucentis therapy, the magnitude of such potential visual benefit, if any, remains to be demonstrated. Fovista is a pegylated aptamer, which means that polyethylene glycol is linked to a chemically-synthesized strand of nucleic acid. This pegylation increases the half‑life of Fovista, which in turn increases the time that Fovista actively targets PDGF. In our Phase 3 clinical program, as well as our prior Phase 1 and Phase 2b clinical trials, Fovista was administered by intravitreal injection after a separate intravitreal injection of an anti‑VEGF drug. Many other therapies used to treat serious retinal disorders, including Lucentis, Avastin and Eylea, also are administered by intravitreal injection.
Clinical Development of Fovista Combination Therapy for Wet AMD
Prior to commencing our pivotal, Phase 3 Fovista program in 2013, we completed a multicenter, uncontrolled, open-label, ascending dose Phase 1 clinical trial and a multicenter, randomized, controlled, double-masked Phase 2b clinical trial of Fovista administered in combination with Lucentis for the treatment of wet AMD. Our pivotal, Phase 3 Fovista clinical program consisted of three separate clinical trials, OPH1002, OPH1003 and OPH1004. All three of these Phase 3 clinical trials incorporated significant aspects from the design of our completed Phase 2b clinical trial. We enrolled a total of approximately 1,866 patients in more than 250 centers internationally across the three trials.
In December 2016, we announced initial, top-line data from OPH1002 and OPH1003, evaluating the safety and efficacy of 1.5mg of Fovista administered in combination with monthly 0.5mg Lucentis therapy compared to monthly 0.5mg Lucentis monotherapy for the treatment of wet AMD. The pre-specified primary endpoint of mean change in best-corrected visual acuity at 12 months was not achieved for either trial. Moreover, we have not observed any clinically meaningful visual benefit when 1.5mg of Fovista was added to a monthly regimen of 0.5mg Lucentis therapy for any subgroup of patients that we have analyzed from the OPH1002 and OPH1003 trials, including subgroups based on baseline visual acuity, baseline lesion size or the baseline amount of the classic component of CNV. Following the December 2016 data announcement, we subsequently stopped treating patients in, and terminated, both the OPH1002 and OPH1003 trials.
Our remaining Phase 3 clinical trial, OPH1004, evaluating the safety and efficacy of 1.5 mg of Fovista administered in combination with 2.0mg Eylea or 1.25mg Avastin compared to Eylea or Avastin monotherapy for the treatment of wet AMD remains ongoing. We expect initial, top-line data from the OPH1004 trial to be available during the second half of 2017. The failure of OPH1002 and OPH1003 to show any clinically meaningful visual benefit in adding 1.5mg of Fovista to a monthly regimen of 0.5mg of Lucentis and the recent failure of a competitor’s Phase 2 trial investigating the combination of a PDGF inhibitor and a VEGF inhibitor may be indicative of a low likelihood of success for OPH1004. In light of the data from the OPH1002 and OPH1003 trials, we have also stopped treating patients in our additional Phase 2 clinical trials that were evaluating the potential additional benefits of Fovista administered in combination with anti-VEGF drugs in wet AMD patients, which we previously referred to collectively as the Fovista Expansion Studies. In the event that we obtain favorable results from the OPH1004 trial, we expect that we would engage regulatory agencies, in particular the FDA and potentially, in 
5


conjunction with Novartis, our ex-US commercialization partner for Fovista, the EMA, to seek such agencies’ recommendations, if any, regarding future development in pursuit of potential marketing approval for Fovista. In all likelihood, even assuming favorable results from the OPH1004 trial, we will need to successfully complete an additional, confirmatory, pivotal trial in order to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of Fovista combination therapy for the treatment of wet AMD and obtain marketing approval.
Completed Phase 1 Clinical Trial of Fovista Combination Therapy for Wet AMD
In 2009, we completed a multicenter, uncontrolled, open-label, ascending dose Phase 1 clinical trial evaluating the safety and tolerability of Fovista administered in combination with Lucentis for the treatment of subfoveal wet AMD. We conducted our Phase 1 clinical trial in 23 patients at 11 centers in the United States. Fovista was generally well tolerated in this trial. Patients enrolled in our Phase 1 clinical trial were 50 years of age and older and newly diagnosed with subfoveal choroidal neovascularization secondary to AMD with some classic component as documented by fluorescein angiography. We enrolled patients with a range of baseline visual acuities. Visual acuity is measured as the number of letters, arranged in lines, that the patient can read on the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study, or ETDRS, eye chart. Each line on the ETDRS eye chart has five letters. This is a well-established standardized chart of vision testing used in these types of trials. Normal visual acuity is commonly referred to as 20/20 vision. To qualify for enrollment in our Phase 1 clinical trial, the visual acuity in the patient's study eye had to be between 20/63 and 20/200. We enrolled patients with a wide range of lesion sizes and with a variety of other lesion characteristics.
Fovista administered in combination with Lucentis was generally well tolerated in our Phase 1 clinical trial. None of the patients experienced any dose limiting toxicities at any of the dose levels tested. We did not observe any evidence of drug related adverse events. Adverse events were primarily ocular adverse events in the study eye which were related to the injection procedure. There were no adverse events related to Fovista or Lucentis, and no patients discontinued from the trial due to an adverse event. We did not observe any meaningful clinical immunologic reactions to Fovista.
Our Phase 1 clinical trial had a small sample size and a short follow up period. It was not designed to compare Fovista combination therapy to another therapy. However, we noted improvements in visual acuity and anatomical changes in the newly formed blood vessels of the eye that suggested the Fovista combination therapy was enhancing the visual outcome compared to results previously seen with anti‑VEGF monotherapy.
Completed Phase 2b Clinical Trial of Fovista Combination Therapy for Wet AMD
In 2012, we completed a multicenter, randomized, controlled, double‑masked Phase 2b clinical trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of Fovista administered in combination with Lucentis for the treatment of patients newly diagnosed with subfoveal wet AMD. We conducted this trial in 449 patients at approximately 69 centers in North America, South America, Europe and Israel. We made no meaningful changes to the inclusion and exclusion criteria in our Phase 2b clinical trial from those we used in our Phase 1 clinical trial. 
The primary objective of this trial was to evaluate the effect of two different doses of Fovista administered in combination with Lucentis compared to Lucentis monotherapy. The primary efficacy endpoint of this trial was mean change in visual acuity from baseline at 24 weeks for Fovista and Lucentis combination therapy compared to Lucentis monotherapy. Prior to enrollment in the trial, we measured each patient’s visual acuity to establish a baseline. Following assessment at baseline, visual acuity was measured at each subsequent four‑week time point. We had diagnostic imaging techniques of fluorescein angiography and SD‑OCT performed and assessed by an independent reading center at baseline and at week 24.
Secondary efficacy endpoints for this trial included the following:

• | mean change in visual acuity in ETDRS letters from baseline at 12 weeks;


• | proportion of patients in each treatment group gaining 15 or more ETDRS letters from baseline at 12 weeks;


• | proportion of patients in each treatment group gaining 15 or more ETDRS letters from baseline at 24 weeks; and


• | mean change in area of choroidal neovascularization from baseline at 24 weeks.

We randomly assigned patients in this trial to one of three treatment groups: 149 patients received intravitreal injections of 0.3 mg of Fovista following intravitreal injections of 0.5 mg of Lucentis; 152 patients received intravitreal injections of 1.5 mg of Fovista following intravitreal injections of 0.5 mg of Lucentis; and 148 patients in the control arm of the 
6


trial received sham injections following intravitreal injections of 0.5 mg of Lucentis. Patients were treated and assessed once every four weeks for 24 weeks.
Measures of Mean Visual Acuity-Primary Efficacy Endpoint
Mean Change in Visual Acuity from Baseline at 24 Weeks. In this trial, the combination of 1.5 mg of Fovista and Lucentis demonstrated statistically significant superiority compared to Lucentis monotherapy based on the pre‑specified primary endpoint of mean change in visual acuity from baseline at the 24 week time point. We determined statistical significance based on a widely used, conventional statistical method that establishes the p-value of clinical results. Typically, a p-value of 0.05 or less represents statistical significance. However, when multiple doses of a drug are tested against a single control group, a more stringent statistical method that accounts for multiple comparisons must be applied. For this purpose, we used the Hochberg multiple comparison procedure. Under the Hochberg procedure, in order to demonstrate statistical significance for any particular dose, it is necessary to establish a p-value that meets a stricter standard than the conventional standard of 0.05 or less unless each dose is statistically significant with a p-value of 0.05 or less. In the case of our Phase 2b clinical trial, in which we evaluated two doses of Fovista administered in combination with Lucentis, the Hochberg procedure required a more stringent p-value of 0.025 or less to establish statistical significance for the comparison of the combination of 1.5 mg of Fovista and Lucentis to Lucentis monotherapy.
At 24 weeks, patients receiving the combination of 1.5 mg of Fovista and Lucentis gained a mean of 10.6 ETDRS letters compared to a mean of 6.5 ETDRS letters for patients receiving Lucentis monotherapy, representing a 62% comparative benefit from baseline, with a p‑value of 0.019. This result was statistically significant. At 24 weeks, patients receiving the combination of 0.3 mg of Fovista and Lucentis gained a mean of 8.8 ETDRS letters. This result was not statistically significant, having a p‑value greater than 0.05, compared to Lucentis monotherapy. We determined not to test the combination of 0.3 mg of Fovista and Lucentis compared to Lucentis monotherapy in our Phase 3 clinical program.
Patients treated with the combination of 1.5 mg of Fovista and Lucentis showed greater improvement in visual acuity from baseline compared to patients treated with Lucentis monotherapy at week four and at each subsequent four‑week assessment. In addition, the relative magnitude of visual benefit favoring the combination of 1.5 mg of Fovista and Lucentis increased over the study period. The graph below sets forth the mean change in visual acuity from baseline for each treatment group over the course of the trial.
Mean Change in Visual Acuity (VA) from Baseline Over Time
Measures of Mean Visual Acuity-Secondary Endpoints
We evaluated measures of visual outcomes as secondary endpoints. Results from secondary endpoints are used to help interpret the primary result of the trial and to provide information for future research and clinical development. However, the statistical analysis plan for our Phase 2b clinical trial was not designed to establish and, as a result, we could not and did not 
7


demonstrate, statistical significance with respect to these secondary endpoints. Accordingly, only descriptive analyses and trends for secondary endpoints are presented below.
Mean Change in Visual Acuity from Baseline at 12 Weeks. We observed differences on the secondary endpoint of mean change in visual acuity from baseline at the 12 week time point favoring the combination of 1.5 mg of Fovista and Lucentis compared to Lucentis monotherapy. At 12 weeks, patients receiving the combination of 1.5 mg of Fovista and Lucentis gained a mean of 8.7 ETDRS letters compared to patients receiving Lucentis monotherapy who gained a mean of 5.1 ETDRS letters.
Proportion of Patients Gaining 15 or More Letters from Baseline at 12 Weeks and at 24 Weeks. We observed differences in the proportion of patients that showed improvement of 15 ETDRS letters, or three lines, or better in visual acuity favoring the combination of 1.5 mg of Fovista and Lucentis compared to Lucentis monotherapy both at 12 weeks and at 24 weeks of treatment.
The table below sets forth at 12 weeks and 24 weeks the number of patients in each treatment group and the percentage of patients in such treatment group who gained the specified number of lines in visual acuity and the percentage of patients whose final visual acuity improved to the specified level.
Proportion of Patients Gaining 15 or More ETDRS Letters

Arm | # (%) of PatientsGaining ≥ 15 lettersat Week 12 | # (%) of PatientsGaining ≥ 15 lettersat Week 24
1.5 mg Fovista + Lucentis | 48 (31.8)% | 59 (39.1)% 
0.3 mg Fovista + Lucentis | 31 (21.1)% | 49 (33.3)% 
0.5 mg Lucentis | 33 (22.4)% | 50 (34.0)% 

Measures of Anatomical Changes-Secondary Endpoint
We evaluated one measure of anatomical change as a secondary endpoint. The mean change in area of CNV from baseline at 24 weeks as determined by review of fluorescein angiograms was greater in patients treated with Lucentis monotherapy than in patients treated with the combination of 1.5 mg of Fovista and Lucentis. We believe that the inclusion of both larger and smaller CNV sizes in the single analysis of this secondary endpoint had the potential to create a distortion in the analysis of the mean change in area of CNV. This is because the average level of regression, as numerically measured, was approximately tenfold greater in a retrospective subgroup of patients with a large CNV size compared to the remaining subgroup of patients with a small CNV size. We believe that a treatment group with a greater number of patients with larger CNV sizes will show a markedly larger amount of regression on average. That was the case in our Phase 2b trial in which the Lucentis monotherapy group had a greater proportion of patients with large CNV sizes compared to the group treated with a combination of 1.5 mg of Fovista and Lucentis. 
Safety
Fovista was generally well tolerated in the Phase 2b trial at both doses tested in combination with Lucentis. We did not observe any cases of infection inside the eye, or endophthalmitis. We observed one case of severe intraocular inflammation among the patients treated with 0.3 mg of Fovista in combination with Lucentis and no such cases among the patients treated with 1.5 mg of Fovista in combination with Lucentis. We did not observe any significant imbalances among treatment groups in the incidence of ocular adverse events or systemic adverse events, including cardiovascular events or stroke. The number of patients in our Phase 2b clinical trial with one or more serious systemic adverse events, the most common systemic serious adverse events in this trial organized by MedDRA system organ class, a standard method of reporting adverse events, and by antiplatelet trialists’ collaboration events, a standard method of reporting cardiovascular adverse events, are set forth in the table below.

Most of the common ocular adverse events in this trial were related to the intravitreal preparation and injection procedure and were not drug related. These intravitreal adverse events, as reflected in the table above, included conjunctival hemorrhage, punctate keratitis, eye pain and conjunctival hyperemia. Most adverse events of increased intraocular pressure occurred after injection, were transient, were related to the injection and were treated and resolved the same day. Mean intraocular pressure in each treatment group returned to pre‑injection level at the next assessment, including at the end of the trial.

Phase 3 Clinical Program for Fovista Combination Therapy for Wet AMD
Our pivotal Phase 3 clinical program consists of three separate Phase 3 clinical trials to evaluate the safety and efficacy of 1.5 mg of Fovista administered in combination with anti‑VEGF drugs for the treatment of wet AMD compared to anti‑VEGF monotherapy. Two of these trials, OPH1002 and OPH1003, evaluated Fovista in combination with Lucentis compared to Lucentis monotherapy. The third trial, OPH1004, is evaluating Fovista in combination with Eylea or Avastin compared to Eylea or Avastin monotherapy. 
OPH1002 and OPH1003 both investigated Fovista in combination with Lucentis compared to Lucentis monotherapy and were identical with respect to the trial design in the first year. Therefore, the databases from both OPH1002 and OPH1003 were unmasked and analyzed together, which allowed for the pooled analysis of certain relevant endpoints in accordance with the statistical analysis plan. In December 2016, we announced initial, top-line data from OPH1002 and OPH1003. The pre-specified primary endpoint of mean change in best-corrected visual acuity at 12 months was not achieved for either trial. We did not observe any clinically meaningful visual benefit in adding Fovista to Lucentis in any subgroup of patients, including any lesion type (CNV size). We subsequently stopped treating patients in both the OPH1002 and OPH1003 trials. Our remaining Phase 3 clinical trial, OPH1004, was fully enrolled in June 2016 and remains ongoing. We currently plan to continue OPH1004 at least until all patients reach the 12 month primary efficacy endpoint, as Fovista combination therapy was generally well tolerated through the 12 month time point in OPH1002 and OPH1003 and OPH1004 is investigating Fovista in combination with different anti-VEGF drugs than the anti-VEGF comparator for the two failed Lucentis trials. We expect initial, top-line data from the OPH1004 trial to be available during the second half of 2017. The failure of OPH1002 and OPH1003 to show any clinically meaningful visual benefit in adding 1.5mg of Fovista to a monthly regimen of 0.5mg of Lucentis and the recent failure of a competitor’s Phase 2 trial investigating the combination of a PDGF inhibitor and a VEGF inhibitor may be indicative of a low likelihood of success for OPH1004. We plan to reassess our Fovista development program throughout 2017 as our updated business plan progresses and evolves, with the goal of aligning corporate resources relative to a potentially broader product pipeline.  Our reassessment of Fovista for the treatment of wet AMD will be primarily determined by the initial, top-line data from OPH1004. As a result of this reassessment, we may modify, expand or terminate our Fovista development program at any time.
Phase 3 Trial Design
The primary efficacy endpoint in each of our Phase 3 clinical trials is mean change in best-corrected visual acuity from baseline at 12 months for Fovista and anti‑VEGF combination therapy compared to anti‑VEGF monotherapy. Prior to enrollment in the Phase 3 clinical trials, we measured each patient’s visual acuity to establish a baseline. The protocols for each of these trials provide that patients be assessed monthly. 
Secondary efficacy endpoints for our completed OPH1002 and OPH1003 Phase 3 clinical trials included the following:

• | proportion of patients in each treatment group gaining 20 or more ETDRS letters from baseline at month 12;


• | proportion of patients in each treatment group losing 5 or more ETDRS letters from baseline at month 12;


• | proportion of patients in each treatment group achieving visual acuity of 20/25 or better at month 12; and


• | proportion of patients with growth of choroidal neovascular lesion area from baseline to month 12 (as determined by fluorescein angiography).

Secondary efficacy endpoints for our ongoing OPH1004 Phase 3 clinical trial include the following:

• | proportion of patients in each treatment group gaining 20 or more ETDRS letters from baseline at month 12;


• | proportion of patients in each treatment group losing 5 or more ETDRS letters from baseline at month 12; and


• | proportion of patients in each treatment group achieving visual acuity of 20/25 or better at month 12.

In each of OPH1002 and OPH1003, we randomly assigned patients to one of two treatment groups. Treatment for the two groups in each of these two trials was as follows:

• | In the first group, 310 and 312 patients, respectively, for OPH1002 and OPH1003 received intravitreal injections of 1.5 mg of Fovista following intravitreal injections of 0.5 mg of Lucentis.


• | In the second group, which served as the control arm for each trial, 309 and 314 patients, respectively, for OPH1002 and OPH1003, received sham injections following intravitreal injections of 0.5 mg of Lucentis.

In each of the OPH1002 and OPH1003 clinical trials, patients were treated monthly for the first 12 months. In OPH1002, for patients that were treated after month 12 (up to month 24), treatment was administered based on the stability of the patient’s visual acuity, ophthalmic examination and imaging consistent with the EU label for Lucentis. In OPH1003, for patients that were treated after month 12 (up to month 24), patients were treated every other month and could be retreated during the intervening months in accordance with specific retreatment criteria set forth in the protocol for the trial based on visual acuity and imaging. 
In the OPH1004 clinical trial, we randomly assigned patients to one of two treatment groups with approximately 311 patients in each group. Treatment for the two groups in this trial is as follows:
In the first group, patients are further randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive intravitreal injections of one of the following treatments:

• | 1.5 mg of Fovista following intravitreal injections of 1.25 mg of Avastin; or


• | 1.5 mg of Fovista following intravitreal injections of 2.0 mg of Eylea.

In the second group, which serves as the control arm of the trial, patients are further randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive one of the following treatments:

• | sham injections following intravitreal injections of 1.25 mg of Avastin; or


• | sham injections following intravitreal injections of 2.0 mg of Eylea.

The patients randomized to receive Avastin are treated monthly for the duration of the trial (up to 24 months) and the patients randomized to receive Eylea are treated every month for the first three months followed by every other month thereafter (up to 24 months).
We made no meaningful changes to the inclusion and exclusion criteria in these Phase 3 clinical trials from those we used in our Phase 2b clinical trial. However, we modified the methodology used to determine a patient’s eligibility under certain of the inclusion and exclusion criteria for our Phase 3 clinical trials as compared to our Phase 2b clinical trial. For our Phase 2b trial, we assessed patient eligibility based on the fluorescein angiographic pattern of the choroidal neovascular membrane. Since the most commonly employed modality for imaging, diagnosing and managing neovascular AMD is currently SD‑OCT, we modified the methodology to determine the patient’s eligibility to participate in our Phase 3 program to include SD‑OCT criteria. To ensure that uniform criteria were applied in characterizing patients’ neovascular lesions, we engaged a centralized reading center to review the SD‑OCT, fluorescein angiograms and fundus images of each patient’s affected eye. Fundus images are photos of the back of the eye taken using a camera attached to a specialized, low‑power microscope. These photos, which are often in color, show various elements of the back of the eye, including the retina, retinal vasculature, optic disc, macula and fovea. For our Phase 3 clinical trials, the reading center used all three of these imaging modalities, fluorescein angiography, SD‑OCT and fundus images, to assess the eligibility of patients based on the presence of abnormal new blood vessels relative to the RPE at the time of enrollment. We believe that use of a centralized reading center and the latest imaging technologies has enabled us to confirm patient eligibility and properly classify neovascular characteristics and the associated leakage in an accurate and standardized manner prior to enrolling patients in the trial.
As was the case in both our Phase 1 clinical trial and our Phase 2b clinical trial, there is a 30‑minute delay in the injection of Fovista after the anti‑VEGF drug.
Data from OPH1002 and OPH1003
In the pooled analysis of results from OPH1002 and OPH1003 consisting of 1,245 treated patients, the combination of 1.5 mg of Fovista and Lucentis did not result in statistically significant benefit compared to Lucentis monotherapy based on the pre-specified primary endpoint of mean change in best-corrected visual acuity from baseline at the 12-month time point. In 
11


these trials, a p-value of 0.05 or less represents statistical significance. Furthermore, there is no evidence to date from our analysis of the results from the OPH1002 and OPH1003 trials of any clinically meaningful benefit at any time point or in any subgroup of patients or any pattern with respect to the data suggestive of a potential drug effect by adding Fovista to Lucentis.
Measures of Mean Visual Acuity-Primary Efficacy Endpoint. 
In the pooled analysis, patients receiving the combination of 1.5mg of Fovista and Lucentis gained a mean of 10.24 ETDRS letters at month 12 compared to a mean gain of 10.01 ETDRS letters for patients receiving Lucentis monotherapy, a resulting difference of 0.23 ETDRS letters. In OPH1002, consisting of 619 treated patients, patients receiving Fovista combination therapy gained a mean of 10.74 ETDRS letters at month 12, compared to a mean gain of 9.82 ETDRS letters in patients receiving Lucentis monotherapy, a resulting difference of 0.92 ETDRS letters, with a p-value of 0.44.  In OPH1003, consisting of 626 treated patients, patients receiving Fovista combination therapy gained a mean of 9.91 ETDRS letters at month 12, compared to a mean gain of 10.36 ETDRS letters in patients receiving Lucentis monotherapy, a resulting difference of -0.44 ETDRS letters, with a p-value of 0.71.  None of these results of the pre-specified primary efficacy analysis were statistically significant.
Measures of Mean Visual Acuity-Secondary Endpoints
We evaluated measures of visual outcomes as secondary endpoints. Results from secondary endpoints are used to help interpret the primary result of the trial and to provide information for future research and clinical development. As with our Phase 2b trial, the statistical analysis plan for our Phase 3 clinical trials was not designed to establish and, as a result, we could not and did not demonstrate, statistical significance with respect to these secondary endpoints. In addition, where the primary efficacy endpoint for a clinical trial has not been met, data regarding secondary endpoints are generally less relevant and are potentially uninterpretable. 
Proportion of Patients Gaining 20 or More Letters from Baseline at 12 Months. In the pooled analysis of pre-specified secondary endpoints from both trials, 24.2% of patients receiving the combination of 1.5mg of Fovista and Lucentis gained 20 or more ETDRS letters from baseline at month 12, compared to 22.1% of patients receiving Lucentis monotherapy.  In OPH1002, 25.9% of patients receiving Fovista combination therapy gained 20 or more ETDRS letters from baseline at month 12, compared to 20.0% of patients receiving Lucentis monotherapy.  In OPH1003, 22.5% of patients receiving Fovista combination therapy gained 20 or more ETDRS letters from baseline at month 12, compared to 24.1% of patients receiving Lucentis monotherapy.
Proportion of Patients Losing 5 or More Letters from Baseline at 12 Months. In the pooled analysis, 12.1% of patients receiving the combination of 1.5mg of Fovista and Lucentis lost 5 or more ETDRS letters from baseline at month 12, compared to 11.2% of patients receiving Lucentis monotherapy. In OPH1002, 12.0% of patients receiving Fovista combination therapy lost 5 or more ETDRS letters at month 12, compared to 12.3% of patients receiving Lucentis monotherapy.  In OPH1003, 12.2% of patients receiving Fovista combination therapy lost 5 or more ETDRS letters at month 12, compared to 10.2% of patients receiving Lucentis monotherapy.
Proportion of Patients Achieving Visual Acuity of 20/25 or Better at 12 Months. In the pooled analysis, 13.5% of patients receiving the combination of 1.5mg of Fovista and Lucentis achieved visual acuity of 20/25 or better at month 12, compared to 13.9% of patients receiving Lucentis monotherapy.  In OPH1002, 13.6% of patients receiving Fovista combination therapy achieved visual acuity of 20/25 or better, compared to 13.2% of patients receiving Lucentis monotherapy.  In OPH1003, 13.5% of patients receiving Fovista combination therapy achieved visual acuity of 20/25 or better, compared to 14.6% of patients receiving Lucentis monotherapy.
Measures of Anatomical Changes-Secondary Endpoint 
We did not observe any difference in the proportion of patients with growth in choroidal neovascularization lesion area from baseline to month 12 as determined by review of fluorescein angiograms in patients treated with Fovista combination therapy as compared to patients treated with Lucentis monotherapy, in based on the treatment groups in either OPH1002 or OPH1003 or the pooled analysis.

Safety
Combination therapy consisting of 1.5mg of Fovista and 0.5mg of Lucentis and 0.5mg Lucentis monotherapy were each generally well tolerated in OPH1002 and OPH1003. We did not observe any clinically meaningful imbalances between the treatment groups in either trial or in the pooled analysis in the incidence of systemic adverse events, including arterial thromboembolic events. 
Serious Systemic Adverse Events. The number of patients in each treatment group in OPH1002 and OPH1003, as well as the pooled analysis, with one or more serious systemic adverse events, for the most common serious systemic adverse events organized by MedDRA system organ class, and for the arterial thromboembolic events using Standardized MedDRA Queries, or SMQ, are set forth in the tables below. For the first table of serious systemic adverse events by MedDRA system organ class, data are listed only for serious systemic adverse events for system organ classes that occurred in 1% or more of patients in any of the treatment groups across the two trials.

The incidence of endophthalmitis per intravitreal injection was 2/6997 (0.029%) in the Fovista and Lucentis combination therapy group and 0.0% in the Lucentis monotherapy group during the first 12 months of treatment in OPH1002; 6/7006 (0.086%) in the Fovista and Lucentis combination therapy group and 1/3510 (0.029%) in the Lucentis monotherapy group during the first 12 months of OPH1003; and 8/14003 (0.057%) in the pooled Fovista and Lucentis combination therapy groups from the first 12 months of both OPH1002 and OPH1003 and 1/6944 (0.014%) in the pooled Lucentis monotherapy groups from the first 12 months of both OPH1002 and OPH1003. Although the incidence of endophthalmitis per intravitreal injection is higher in the pooled Fovista and Lucentis combination therapy groups as compared to the pooled Lucentis monotherapy groups, it is still within the range of the reported incidence of endophthalmitis associated with intravitreal injections in previously reported wet AMD clinical trials.
Ocular Adverse Events Reported in Study Eye in 5% or More of Patients in Any Treatment Group. The most common ocular adverse events observed in the study eye for each treatment group in OPH1002 and OPH1003, as well as the pooled analysis, are presented in the table below. Data are listed for study eye ocular adverse events that occurred in 5% or more of patients in any of the treatment groups across the two trials.

Most of the commonly reported ocular adverse events in OPH1002 and OPH1003 were related to the intravitreal preparation and injection procedure and were not related to the study drugs. Of these most commonly reported ocular adverse events, conjunctival hemorrhage, increased intraocular pressure and vitreous floaters were reported in greater than 1% more patients in the pooled Fovista and Lucentis combination therapy groups than in the pooled Lucentis monotherapy groups. This result is not unexpected, as there were approximately twice as many intravitreal injections in the Fovista and Lucentis combination therapy groups compared to the Lucentis monotherapy groups. Most adverse events of increased intraocular pressure occurred after injection, were transient, related to the intravitreal injection procedure and resolved the same day. Mean intraocular pressure in each treatment group returned to near pre-injection levels at the next assessment, including at the end of the trial.

In addition to our Phase 3 clinical program for Fovista, we undertook additional Phase 2 clinical trials to evaluate the potential additional benefits of Fovista administered in combination with anti-VEGF drugs in wet AMD patients. We refer to these trials as the Fovista Expansion Studies. Following our receipt and announcement of initial, top-line data from our pivotal OPH1002 and OPH1003 Fovista trials for the treatment of wet AMD, we stopped treating patients in the Fovista Expansion Studies. The Fovista Expansion Studies included:

• | OPH1005 Fovista Anti-Fibrosis Study. During the third quarter of 2014, we initiated an open-label Phase 2a clinical trial of 1.5 mg of Fovista administered in combination with either Lucentis, Eylea or Avastin, to study subretinal fibrosis in wet AMD patients. The trial did not have any pre-specified efficacy endpoints as it was uncontrolled, open-label Phase 2a study with broad patient eligibility criteria. We completed enrollment in this trial in May 2015 with a total of 101 patients enrolled. Patients were followed for up to a 24-month period prior to our determination in December 2016 to stop treating patients in the Fovista Expansion Studies. 


• | OPH1006 Fovista Treatment Burden Reduction Study. During the fourth quarter of 2014, we initiated an open-label Phase 2a clinical trial of 1.5 mg of Fovista administered in combination with anti-VEGF drugs (Lucentis, Eylea or Avastin) to investigate a different treatment regimen of Fovista combination therapy. We completed enrollment in this trial in October 2015 with a total of 64 patients enrolled. Patients in this trial were to be followed for up to a 24-month period prior to our determination in December 2016 to stop treating patients in the Fovista Expansion Studies. 


• | OPH1007 Fovista in Combination with Avastin Discontinuous Regimen Study. During the fourth quarter of 2015, we initiated a randomized, double-masked, controlled Phase 2b clinical trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of a discontinuous, bimonthly regimen of 1.5 mg of Fovista administered in combination with Avastin during the maintenance phase of wet AMD treatment, compared to a discontinuous, bimonthly regimen of Avastin monotherapy. This trial was terminated prior to full enrollment. 


• | OPH1008 Fovista Imaging Study. During the fourth quarter of 2015, we initiated an open-label Phase 2a clinical trial to investigate the role of multi-modal imaging in assessing anatomic responses to various wet AMD treatment regimens of 1.5 mg of Fovista administered in combination with anti-VEGF drugs (Lucentis, Eylea or Avastin). This trial was terminated prior to full enrollment. 

Fovista in Other Ophthalmic Diseases
We are supplying Fovista for a clinical trial conducted by the National Eye Institute for the treatment of Von Hippel-Lindau disease, or VHL. VHL is an inherited disease characterized by multiple benign and malignant tumors and cysts in the eye and other organs. Deficiency of the protein "pVHL" in multiple cell types is thought to cause VHL. In the eye, tumors consisting of blood cells called retinal capillary hemangiomas, or RCH, are the most common and earliest manifestation of VHL. These tumors cause significant retinal leakage and may lead to significant vision loss. Smaller lesions, located a significant distance from the central regions of the retina can be treated by laser or freezing via cryotherapy. However, larger and poorly situated lesions are usually untreatable or have poor visual prognoses. PDGF levels have been shown to be elevated in cells with deficiency of pVHL. Therefore, we believe that a combination of Fovista with an anti-VEGF drug may prove beneficial in RCH patients. VHL is rare, and we estimate that there are approximately 5,000 people with the disease in the United States. Recruitment is ongoing in this study.

Dry AMD
Dry AMD is a significant cause of moderate and severe loss of central vision, affecting vision in both eyes in most patients. Although dry AMD is the most common form of AMD, there are no therapies approved by the FDA or EMA to treat this condition. According to a 2011 publication from AMD Alliance International, approximately 30 million people worldwide have some form of AMD, with dry AMD accounting for 85% to 90% of these cases. A study published in Ophthalmology in 2012 analyzing age and gender variations in AMD prevalence estimates that approximately 8 million people worldwide are affected by a form of dry AMD known as GA.
Dry AMD is typically associated with yellow‑white dots or deposits under the retina, known as drusen. Unlike in wet AMD, there is an absence of pathological neovascularization in dry AMD. The presence of drusen, in the absence of pathological neovascularization, is critical for making the diagnosis of dry AMD in patients over 50 years of age. GA, a form of dry AMD, can result in progressive and chronic degeneration of the retina characterized by variable thinning and dysfunction of retinal tissue.
The progression of visual outcomes for patients with dry AMD is variable. Most patients experience mild to moderate loss of visual function, manifesting in blurring of central vision in the affected eye, as a result of progressive degeneration of the light‑sensitive photoreceptor elements in the macula. There are two settings in which visual loss from dry AMD may lead to severe vision loss:

• | Geographic Atrophy. With severe and progressive macular degeneration, a readily identifiable pattern of severe degeneration called GA, forms, which consequently leads to profound and irreversible vision loss. GA is readily diagnosed by macular visualization using standard diagnostic instruments utilized by ophthalmologists. GA appears as abrupt and deep levels of macular tissue loss. It has sharp margins of characteristic degeneration compared to surrounding macular tissue, resulting in progressive and chronic degeneration of the retina characterized by variable thinning and dysfunction of retinal tissue. 


• | Conversion to Wet AMD. Dry AMD progresses to the wet form of the disease in approximately 10% ‑ 15% of patients, leading to more rapid and further visual loss. 

The Complement Cascade
The complement cascade consists of a series of proteins involved in the defense of a host body against infectious agents, or pathogens, and other foreign proteins. The complement cascade modulates a variety of immune and inflammatory responses to these pathogens and foreign proteins. Under normal circumstances, complement proteins, together with antibodies and white blood cells, act beneficially to protect the host body by removing the pathogens and foreign proteins, together with other cellular debris. The complement system is generally tightly regulated, achieving the proper balance of activation and inhibition depending on the host body’s requirements. Poorly regulated or aberrant activation of the complement cascade, without a balanced or proportional inhibition of complement proteins, may result in the formation of inflammation‑inducing proteins and molecules. These inflammation‑inducing byproducts of the complement cascade have the potential to inflict damage to normal tissue known as immune or complement mediated damage.
Though the complement cascade can be activated through different pathways, these pathways eventually converge with the generation of an enzyme known as C3 convertase. C3 convertase cleaves, or separates, to form a protein called C3, which itself cleaves to from a molecule known as C3b. C3b is an important element of the body’s immune response, as it binds to pathogens and makes them susceptible to destruction by white blood cells. Subsequent downstream reactions continue after the formation of C3b, with the eventual cleavage of another complement pathway protein known as C5. The cleavage of C5 results in the formation of other molecules known as terminal fragments, which are part of the terminal events of the complement pathway. One terminal fragment, known as C5a, is a potent mediator of inflammation and induces the release of VEGF from affected cells. The other terminal event is the generation of the membrane‑attack complex, or MAC. The cellular response to the formation of MAC on affected cells can result in cell damage, cell death and the release of various angiogenic mediators, such as PDGF.
Complement‑Mediated Pathology of AMD
Multiple published studies have implicated local inflammation resulting from poorly regulated or aberrant activation of the complement cascade in the development of both the dry and wet forms of AMD. For example, in third‑party preclinical studies, analysis of both human and primate retinal drusen deposits, which are the hallmark of dry AMD, have been found to contain components of complement proteins. In addition, young patients, between the ages of 25 and 35, diagnosed with a kidney disease known as membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis have been observed to have developed retinal drusen deposits. The retinal drusen deposits are structurally and compositionally similar to those found in dry AMD patients. 
16


Complement activation is associated with membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis and may explain drusen formation in these patients, which would be otherwise unexpected in healthy subjects of a similar young age.
Inflammation is mediated by the presence of white blood cells. In third‑party preclinical studies, choroidal neovascularization in animal subjects has been inhibited by the depletion of a specific white blood cell type known as monocytes. Similar effects on choroidal neovascularization have also been observed through the inhibition of other factors involved in inflammation. Furthermore, in the same preclinical retinal model, pharmacologic and genetic inhibition of C5a and MAC have inhibited neovascularization, suggesting that the inflammation responsible for choroidal neovascularization is complement mediated. In 2005, multiple studies published in the journal Science linked variations in the genetic sequence coding for specific complement regulatory proteins with a higher risk of developing both the dry and wet forms of AMD.
We believe one or more unidentified triggering events may lead to aberrant activation of the complement system in the macular region of AMD patients. Complement mediated inflammation, and in particular the excessive activation of C5, in the macular tissue may result in the accumulation of drusen, damage to retina cells and the release of angiogenic mediators, potentially resulting in the development of the dry and wet forms of AMD. Furthermore, data from multiple recently‑published studies of complement mediated inflammation in human subjects who have developed wet AMD continues to support this strategy.
Zimura
We are developing our product candidate Zimura for the treatment of dry AMD and wet AMD. Zimura is designed to target and inhibit the complement protein C5. We believe Zimura binds to and inhibits C5 from cleaving into later stage proteins, or terminal fragments. By inhibiting the formation of complement system terminal fragments, Zimura may decrease complement mediated inflammation and the release of angiogenic mediators such as VEGF and/or PDGF, thereby providing the rationale as a potential therapy for patients with dry AMD and wet AMD. Zimura is a chemically synthesized, pegylated aptamer. Zimura is administered by intravitreal injection.
Clinical Development of Zimura
We have completed a Phase 1/2a clinical trial of Zimura monotherapy for the treatment of GA, a Phase 1/2a clinical trial of Zimura administered in combination with Lucentis for the treatment of wet AMD and a very small Phase 2 clinical trial investigating Zimura's potential role when administered in combination with anti-VEGF drugs for the treatment of polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy, or PCV, which is a specific type of wet AMD, in patients who do not respond adequately to treatment with anti-VEGF monotherapy or for whom anti-VEGF monotherapy fails. During the fourth quarter of 2015, we initiated a Phase 2/3 clinical trial designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Zimura administered for the treatment of GA and an open‑label Phase 2a clinical trial to evaluate Zimura’s potential role when administered in combination with anti‑VEGF drugs for the treatment of wet AMD. We believe that, in wet AMD patients, Zimura may assist in inhibiting complement mediated inflammation which may improve visual outcomes, particularly when Zimura is administered in combination with an anti‑VEGF drug. We plan to reassess our Zimura development program throughout 2017 as our updated business plan progresses and evolves. Our reassessment for Zimura may be particularly affected by the results of a competitor’s Phase 3 clinical trial of a complement inhibitor being studied for the treatment of GA, which are expected during the second half of 2017. As a result of this reassessment, we may modify, expand or terminate any of our Zimura development programs or clinical trials at any time.
Completed Phase 1/2a Clinical Trial of Zimura for Dry AMD
In 2011, we completed a multicenter, uncontrolled, open label Phase 1/2a clinical trial evaluating the safety and tolerability of Zimura administered as a monotherapy in patients with GA. We enrolled 47 patients in this trial. We randomly assigned patients in this trial to one of two dose groups. Patients received a total of five intravitreal injections of either 0.3 mg or 1.0 mg of Zimura over a 36‑week treatment period. Patients received an intravitreal injection of Zimura at day 0, week 4, week 8, week 24 and week 36 of the trial, with a final follow‑up visit at week 48. Zimura was generally well‑tolerated in this trial. We did not observe any evidence of drug related adverse events. Adverse events were primarily ocular adverse events in the study eye which were related to the injection procedure.
In addition, we performed assessments of visual acuity to detect any potential decrease in vision associated with intravitreal injections, the administered drug or natural progression of the disease if left untreated. We did not identify any drug related safety issues through measurements of visual acuity.
17


Our Phase 1/2a clinical trial was an uncontrolled study with a small sample size and was not powered to detect a difference between Zimura dose groups, or the efficacy of Zimura monotherapy, with statistical significance. The primary purpose of the study was to assess safety and tolerability. However, we observed a trend, in favor of the higher of two dose groups, of a relative reduction in the mean growth of the GA lesion area, as measured by an independent reading center, at 24 weeks. The mean growth from baseline in the GA lesion area during the first 24 weeks of the trial, when the injections were administered more regularly, was 1.00 mm2 for the 24 patients receiving the 0.3 mg dose and 0.78 mm2 for the 23 patients receiving the 1.0 mg dose. When the injections were administered on a reduced dosing schedule during the subsequent 24 weeks, this relative trend in reduced growth in GA lesion area was no longer present. We believe this apparent trend in reduction of growth in GA lesion area when Zimura was dosed more frequently, together with the relative loss of the benefit when Zimura was dosed less frequently, may suggest a possible drug effect. In addition, data from a third party targeting the complement pathway also exhibited a trend in reduction of GA growth with a pronounced effect in patients with a specific biomarker. Given the safety profile of Zimura to date when administered by intravitreal injection, what we believe is a strong preclinical rationale, the trend in the potential benefit that we observed in our Phase 1/2a clinical trial and results observed in studies from the third party targeting the complement pathway, we determined to move forward with a Phase 2/3 clinical trial evaluating Zimura in the treatment of dry AMD.
Phase 2/3 Clinical Trial of Zimura in Dry AMD
During the fourth quarter of 2015, we initiated a randomized, double‑masked, controlled Phase 2/3 clinical trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Zimura monotherapy in patients with GA. Our initial plan was to enroll up to approximately 300 patients in the initial stage of the trial. During this stage, patients will be randomized into three groups, and will receive monthly injections of 1.0 mg of Zimura per eye, monthly injections of 2.0 mg of Zimura per eye or monthly sham injections as the control arm. At month 18, we plan to conduct an interim analysis to assess the safety and efficacy of Zimura compared to sham. Upon review of this interim analysis, a determination will be made whether to continue the trial and whether to expand the trial by enrolling additional patients. Patients in the trial will receive monthly injections for 24 months. Recruitment of patients in this trial is at a very early phase and is ongoing.
Completed Phase 1/2a Clinical Trial of Zimura for Wet AMD
In 2009, we completed a multicenter, uncontrolled, ascending dose and parallel group open label Phase 1/2a clinical trial evaluating the safety and tolerability of Zimura administered in combination with Lucentis for the treatment of wet AMD. We enrolled 60 patients in this trial. Zimura was generally well tolerated in this trial when tested in combination with Lucentis. None of the patients experienced any dose limiting toxicities at any of the dose levels tested. We observed only a single adverse event assessed by the investigators to be related to Zimura, mild subcapsular cataract in one patient in the group treated with 2.0 mg of Zimura. Adverse events were primarily ocular adverse events in the study eye which were related to the injection procedure. One patient withdrew from the trial as a result of a serious adverse event of bacteremia unrelated to study drug or injection procedure, which resulted in a subsequent fatality. Systemic adverse events in this trial were not frequently reported. No systemic adverse events were assessed as drug related.
Our Phase 1/2a clinical trial was an uncontrolled study with a small sample size and was not powered to detect a difference between Zimura and Lucentis combination therapy and Lucentis monotherapy with any statistical significance. The primary purpose of the study was to assess safety and tolerability. However, in addition to our safety assessment, we performed assessments of visual acuity primarily as safety assessments to detect any decrease in vision associated with the intravitreal drug combination or the injection procedure. We did not identify any safety issues through measurements of visual acuity. In a subgroup of 43 patients who had not previously been treated with anti‑VEGF drugs and who received six injections at doses of 0.3 mg, 1.0 mg or 2.0 mg of Zimura administered in combination with Lucentis, we observed a mean increase in visual acuity from baseline at all time points based on the number of ETDRS letters the patient can read. In a follow‑up visit at week 24 of the trial, we noted improvements in mean visual acuity from baseline as follows: 13.6 letters for the 13 patients receiving the 0.3 mg dose, 11.7 letters for the 15 patients receiving the 1.0 mg dose and 15.3 letters for the 15 patients receiving the 2.0 mg dose. In this subgroup, 22 patients (51%) gained at least 15 letters, consisting of six patients (46%) in the 0.3 mg dose group, seven patients (47%) in the 1.0 mg dose group and nine patients (60%) in the 2.0 mg dose group.
Phase 2 Clinical Programs for Zimura for Wet AMD
In late 2014, we initiated a very small, uncontrolled, open‑label, Phase 2a clinical trial to evaluate Zimura’s potential role when administered in combination with anti‑VEGF drugs for the treatment of PCV, a specific type of wet AMD, in patients who do not respond adequately to treatment with anti‑VEGF monotherapy or for whom anti‑VEGF monotherapy has failed, who we refer to as anti‑VEGF resistant. Our analysis of the data from this trial has not revealed any safety concerns related to Zimura.

During the fourth quarter of 2015, we initiated an uncontrolled, open‑label Phase 2a clinical trial to evaluate Zimura’s potential role when administered in combination with anti‑VEGF therapy for the treatment of wet AMD in patients who do not respond adequately to treatment with anti-VEGF monotherapy. We plan to enroll up to approximately 60 patients in this trial, and may include patients with PCV. Recruitment of patients in this trial is at a very early phase and is ongoing. This trial is an uncontrolled study with a small sample size and is not powered to detect a difference between Zimura and Lucentis combination therapy and Lucentis monotherapy with any statistical significance.
Option Agreement for Tivozanib
In November 2014, we entered into an exclusive research and option agreement with AVEO Pharmaceuticals to license tivozanib, a small molecule VEGF tyrosine kinase inhibitor, for the treatment of non‑oncologic conditions of the eye. Under the terms of the agreement, we paid AVEO an upfront fee of $0.5 million for exclusive rights to investigate tivozanib’s potency and potential as an ocular formulation. We terminated the option and research agreement in January 2017, prior to exercising our option.
Manufacturing
We do not currently own or operate manufacturing facilities for the production of clinical or commercial quantities of our product candidates. Although we rely and intend to continue to rely upon third‑party contract manufacturers to produce our products and product candidates, we have recruited personnel with experience to manage the third‑party contract manufacturers we engage to produce our product candidates. We do not have any long-term supply arrangements other than as described below.
Our current product candidates, Fovista and Zimura, are each chemically-synthesized aptamers. In pursuing our updated business plan, we could acquire or in-license a variety of types of product candidates, including small molecule drugs, protein drugs or biologics.  Small molecule drugs are organic compounds of low molecular weight that are generally associated with ready availability of starting materials and ease of synthesis. In contrast, manufacturing for proteins and biologics is more complex, especially in large quantities. For example, biologic products must be made consistently and in substantial compliance with a clearly defined manufacturing process, and often must be manufactured under aseptic conditions.
The process for manufacturing Fovista and Zimura consists of chemical synthesis, purification, pegylation, further purification and finally freeze drying to form a powder, which is the active pharmaceutical ingredient, or API. Each of these steps involves a relatively common chemical engineering process. The chemical synthesis is similar to peptide manufacturing. In a separate process that follows the chemical synthesis, API for each of Fovista and Zimura is dissolved in a liquid solution that includes certain chemical buffers and then is placed into vials from which the intravitreal injection solution is drawn. This process of rendering the API into a liquid solution and placing it into vials is referred to as fill/finish services.
We currently rely upon a single third-party manufacturer, Agilent Technologies, Inc., or Agilent, to supply us with the chemically synthesized aptamers comprising the API for both Fovista and Zimura and a different, single third-party manufacturer, Ajinomoto Althea, Inc., or Althea, to provide fill/finish services for both Fovista and Zimura. We have entered into clinical and commercial supply agreements with Agilent with respect to Fovista. We have also entered into a clinical and commercial services agreement with Althea with respect to Fovista and Zimura. These agreements are described below. We currently obtain Zimura API from Agilent on a purchase order basis.
Fovista API Clinical Supply Agreement. In May 2014, we entered into a Clinical Manufacturing and Supply Agreement with Agilent pursuant to which Agilent has agreed to manufacture and supply to us, and we have agreed to purchase from Agilent, a specified percentage of our clinical requirements in specified jurisdictions of Fovista API. The clinical supply agreement has an initial five-year term, which is subject to automatic renewal absent termination by either party in accordance with the terms of the clinical supply agreement. We may terminate the clinical supply agreement or any statement of work thereunder upon 12 months’ prior written notice to Agilent and Agilent may terminate the clinical supply agreement if we do not, over a specified period, purchase and take delivery from Agilent of a specified minimum quantity of API for Fovista. Each party also has the right to terminate the clinical supply agreement for other customary reasons such as material breach and bankruptcy. The clinical supply agreement contains provisions relating to compliance by Agilent with current Good Manufacturing Practices, cooperation by Agilent in connection with marketing applications for Fovista, indemnification, confidentiality, dispute resolution and other customary matters for an agreement of this kind.
Fovista API Commercial Supply Agreement. In September 2015, we entered into a Commercial Manufacturing and Supply Agreement with Agilent, pursuant to which Agilent has agreed to manufacture and supply to us, and we have agreed to purchase from Agilent, a specified percentage of our commercial requirements in all jurisdictions of Fovista API. The 
19


commercial supply agreement has an initial term that runs for seven years from the date of our first commercial sale of Fovista, and which is subject to one two‑year automatic renewal period, absent termination by either party in accordance with the terms of the commercial supply agreement. The commercial supply agreement provides for pricing for Fovista API structured on a tiered basis, with the price reduced as the volume of Fovista API ordered increases. We may cancel any purchase order under the commercial supply agreement at any time, subject to the payment of specified cancellation fees. We may terminate the commercial supply agreement with no financial penalty in the event that we cannot commercialize Fovista due to regulatory or other medical, scientific or legal reasons. Agilent may terminate the commercial supply agreement in the event that we do not, over a specified period, purchase and take delivery from Agilent of a specified minimum quantity of Fovista API. Each party also has the right to terminate the commercial supply agreement for other customary reasons such as material breach and bankruptcy. The commercial supply agreement contains provisions relating to compliance by Agilent with current Good Manufacturing Practices, cooperation by Agilent in connection with marketing applications for Fovista, indemnification, confidentiality, dispute resolution and other customary matters for an agreement of this kind.
In December 2016, following receipt of initial, top-line data from our pivotal OPH1002 and OPH1003 Fovista trials for the treatment of wet AMD, we canceled all of our outstanding purchase orders with Agilent for the manufacture of Fovista API for commercial drug product. We have incurred substantial cancellation fees in connection with such canceled purchase orders, payment of which will be made in 2017 as we unwind our Fovista manufacturing commitments.
Althea Clinical and Commercial Services Agreement. In October , 2016, we and Ajinimoto Althea, Inc., or Althea, entered into a Clinical and Commercial Services Agreement, which we refer to as the Fill/Finish Services Agreement.
Pursuant to the Fill/Finish Services Agreement, Althea has agreed to provide clinical and commercial fill/finish services for Fovista and Zimura, as well as any future product candidates that we and Althea may mutually agree. The Fill/Finish Services Agreement has an initial term that will expire at the end of 2027, absent termination by either party in accordance with the terms of the Fill/Finish Services Agreement. The initial term of the Fill/Finish Services Agreement may be extended by mutual agreement of the parties. The amount payable by us to Althea under the Fill/Finish Services Agreement is based on the volume of finished drug product that we order, subject to periodic adjustments over the term of the Fill/Finish Services Agreement. In addition, in the event that we order a specified volume of product, Althea has agreed to supply biological or pharmaceutical drug products meeting certain parameters exclusively to us.
We may cancel any purchase order under the Fill/Finish Services Agreement at any time, subject to the payment of specified cancellation fees. We may terminate the Fill/Finish Services Agreement, without cause, as of any date following the third anniversary of the effective date upon six months’ prior notice to Althea. Each party also has the right to terminate the Services Agreement for other customary reasons such as material breach and bankruptcy.
The Fill/Finish Services Agreement contains provisions relating to compliance by Althea with current Good Manufacturing Practices, cooperation by Althea in connection with marketing applications for our product candidates, indemnification, confidentiality, dispute resolution and other customary matters for an agreement of this kind.
In December 2016, following receipt of initial, top-line data from our pivotal OPH1002 and OPH1003 Fovista trials for the treatment of wet AMD, we canceled all of our outstanding purchase orders with Althea for the fill and finish of Fovista commercial drug product. We incurred approximately $0.6 million in connection with such cancellations in relation to non-returnable materials procured by Althea in anticipation of fulfilling such purchase orders, payment of which will be made in 2017 as we unwind our Fovista manufacturing commitments.
Other Manufacturing Arrangements. Under a license, manufacturing and supply agreement with Nektar Therapeutics, or Nektar, described in more detail below under “-Acquisition, License and Collaboration Agreements-Nektar Therapeutics Manufacturing and Supply Agreement,” we must purchase our entire clinical and commercial requirements for the polyethylene glycol, or PEG, reagent, which we use to make Fovista, exclusively from Nektar at an agreed price, which is subject to annual adjustment in accordance with changes in the producer price index, except under specified circumstances relating to Nektar’s failure to supply, in which event Nektar has agreed to enable a third‑party manufacturer to supply us. Under this agreement, Nektar has agreed to supply our entire clinical and commercial requirements for this PEG reagent, subject to certain forecasting and ordering requirements and other limitations, and has agreed to supply this PEG reagent only to us for the purpose of manufacturing a product produced by linking the active ingredient in Fovista to this PEG reagent by means of pegylation. The PEG reagent supplied by Nektar is proprietary to Nektar. We obtain a different PEG reagent used to make Zimura from a different third‑party manufacturer on a purchase order basis.
In December 2016, following receipt of initial, top-line data from our pivotal OPH1002 and OPH1003 Fovista trials for the treatment of wet AMD, we agreed with Nektar to purchase shipments of PEG reagent scheduled for delivery during the 
20


first quarter of 2017 that Nektar had already commenced manufacturing. Nektar also agreed to cancel our remaining future commitments for the purchase of PEG reagent subject to our payment of a $2.2 million cancellation fee. We expect to make this payment in 2017 as we unwind our Fovista manufacturing commitments. 
Sales and Marketing
We expect that our commercial strategy for any of our product candidates, including whether to retain commercial rights and market and sell the product candidate ourselves or to utilize collaboration, distribution or other marketing arrangements with third parties, will be determined based on a variety of factors, including the size and nature of the patient population, the disease area, the particular indication, the territory in which the product candidate may be marketed and the commercial potential for such product candidate. In addition, our commercial strategy will vary depending on whether the disease is typically treated by general ophthalmology practitioners, specialists, such as retinal specialists, or sub-specialists. For example, in the United States, retinal specialists perform most of the medical procedures involving diseases of the back of the eye. We believe that retinal specialists are sufficiently concentrated that we could effectively promote a product candidate approved for such an indication to these specialists with a targeted specialty sales and marketing group. 
We have entered into a commercialization agreement with Novartis for Fovista pursuant to which we have granted to Novartis commercialization rights for Fovista outside of the United States in return for an upfront fee, milestones and royalties. See “Acquisition, License and Collaboration Agreements-Licensing and Commercialization Agreement with Novartis Pharma AG.” If successful in the development of Zimura, we would expect to utilize a variety of types of collaboration, distribution and other marketing arrangements with one or more third parties to commercialize Zimura in markets outside the United States.
Competition
The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition and a strong emphasis on proprietary products. While we believe that our technologies, knowledge, experience and scientific resources provide us with competitive advantages, we face potential competition from many different sources, including major pharmaceutical, specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions and governmental agencies and public and private research institutions. Any product candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize will compete with existing therapies and new therapies that may become available in the future.
Our potential competitors include large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, and specialty pharmaceutical and generic or biosimilar drug companies. Many of our competitors have significantly greater financial and human resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing approved products than we do. Smaller and other early stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. These third parties compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel, establishing clinical trial sites and patient enrollment for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring products, product candidates or other technologies that we may target to in-license or acquire in pursuit of our updated business plan.
Growth of our business through our updated business plan will be based on our selectively licensing or acquiring and then developing product candidates. Our success will be based in part on our ability to build and actively manage a portfolio of drugs that address or seek to address unmet medical needs and creates value in ophthalmology. However, the acquisition and licensing of pharmaceutical products is a competitive area, and a number of more established companies, which have acknowledged strategies to license and acquire products, may have competitive advantages, as may emerging companies taking similar or different approaches to product acquisition. Established companies pursuing this strategy may have a competitive advantage over us due to their size, cash flows and institutional experience.
The key competitive factors affecting the success of our product candidates, if approved, are likely to be the respective drug’s efficacy, safety, method of administration, convenience, price, the level of generic competition and the availability of coverage and reimbursement from government and other third‑party payors. The method of administration of Fovista and Zimura, intravitreal injection, is commonly used to administer ophthalmic drugs for the treatment of severe disease and is generally accepted by patients facing the prospect of severe visual loss or blindness. However, a therapy that offers a less invasive method of administration might have a competitive advantage over one administered by intravitreal injection, depending on the relative safety of the other method of administration.
The current standard of care for wet AMD is monotherapy administration of anti-VEGF drugs, principally Avastin, Lucentis and Eylea, which are well-established therapies and are widely accepted by physicians, patients and third‑party payors. Physicians, patients and third‑party payors may not accept the addition of Fovista or Zimura to their current treatment 
21


regimens for a variety of potential reasons, including the incremental cost of our product, the burden to a patient or injecting physician of an additional intravitreal injection or the relative benefit offered by combination therapy with our product as compared to monotherapy treatment. A standalone therapy for wet AMD with demonstrated improved efficacy over currently marketed therapies in this indication and a favorable safety profile that does not involve VEGF or that does not require frequent or multiple intravitreal injections might pose a significant competitive threat to Fovista or Zimura.
Our commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if one or more of our competitors develop and commercialize products that are more effective, safer, have fewer or less severe side effects, are more convenient to use or are less expensive than our product candidates. Our competitors also may obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the relevant market.
There are a number of products in preclinical research and clinical development by third parties to treat wet AMD. Based on publicly available information, we are aware that Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Ohr Pharmaceutical, Santen, Tyrogenex, Allergan, GrayBug and Somologic each have PDGF inhibitors in clinical or pre-clinical development for wet AMD. Several of these product candidates also inhibit VEGF or are administered directly with an anti-VEGF agent in a manner that could negatively impact demand for a separate intravitreal injection of an anti-PDGF agent such as Fovista. The most advanced of these product candidates is Regeneron’s, for which negative Phase 2 data was previously announced in December 2016 and additional data may be announced during 2017. Moreover, based on publicly available information, we are aware that several companies and research organizations are pursuing treatments targeting other molecular targets, potential gene therapy treatments and stem cell transplant treatments for the treatment of wet AMD. In addition, other companies are undertaking efforts to develop technologies to allow for a less frequent dosing schedule than the dosing schedule currently in use for standard of care anti-VEGF drugs. 
There are a number of products in preclinical research and clinical development by third parties to treat dry AMD. In general, these product candidates can be categorized based on their proposed mechanisms of action. The mechanisms of action for these product candidates include inflammation suppression, such as complement system inhibitors and corticosteroids, visual cycle modulators, antioxidants and neuroprotectants, cell and gene therapies and vascular enhancers. Based on publicly available information, we are aware that Genentech, Novartis / MorphoSys, Apellis, Hemera Biosciences, Achillion, Ra Pharmaceuticals and Catalyst Biosciences each have complement inhibitors in development, the most advance of which is Genentech’s humanized Fab fragment targeting complement factor D, for which data from Phase 3 trials is expected during 2017. If Genentech's Phase 3 trials for its complement factor D product candidate are successful, it is likely that Genentech would obtain marketing approval for such product candidate several years in advance of when we could reasonably expect marketing approval for Zimura in GA, if at all. Moreover, based on publicly available information, we are aware that several other companies have announced development programs for the treatment of dry AMD targeting different mechanisms of action outside of the complement cascade.
Intellectual Property
Our success depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain proprietary protection for our product candidates, technology and know‑how, to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of others and to prevent others from infringing our proprietary rights. We seek to protect our proprietary position, among other methods and where patent protection is available, by filing U.S. and certain foreign patent applications related to our proprietary technology, inventions and improvements that are important to the development of our business, and by maintaining our issued patents. We also rely upon trade secrets, know‑how, continuing technological innovation and in‑licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our proprietary position.

The term of individual patents depends upon the legal term for patents in the countries in which they are granted. In most countries, including the United States, the patent term is generally 20 years from the earliest claimed filing date of a non‑provisional patent application in the applicable country. In the United States, a patent’s term may, in certain cases, be lengthened by patent term adjustment, which compensates a patentee for administrative delays by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office in examining and granting a patent, or may be shortened if a patent is terminally disclaimed over a commonly owned patent or a patent naming a common inventor and having an earlier expiration date.

Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, or the Hatch‑Waxman Act, permits a patent term extension of up to five years beyond the expiration date of a U.S. patent as partial compensation for the length of time the drug is under regulatory review while the patent is in force. A patent term extension cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the date of product approval, only one patent applicable to each regulatory review period may be extended and only those claims covering the approved drug, a method for using it or a method for manufacturing it may be extended.
Similar provisions are available in the European Union and certain other foreign jurisdictions to extend the term of a patent that covers an approved drug. In the future, if and when our product candidates receive approval by the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities, we expect to apply for patent term extensions on issued patents covering those products, depending upon the length of the clinical trials for each drug and other factors. The expiration dates referred to above are without regard to potential patent term extension or other market exclusivity that may be available to us.
We may rely, in some circumstances, upon trade secrets to protect our technology. However, trade secrets can be difficult to protect. We seek to protect our proprietary technology and processes, in part, by confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, scientific advisors and contractors. We also seek to preserve the integrity and confidentiality of our data and trade secrets by maintaining physical security of our premises and physical and electronic security of our information technology systems.
Acquisition, License and Collaboration Agreements
We are a party to several agreements under which we have in-licensed, acquired or out-licensed rights in certain patents, patent applications and other intellectual property. We entered into these agreements to acquire the intellectual property required to develop, manufacture and commercialize our product candidates. We also enter into these agreements to out-license intellectual property to our collaboration and research partners to assist in the development and, if approved, commercialization of our product candidates. These licenses impose certain license fee, royalty payment and diligence obligations on us. We expect to continue to enter into these types of license agreements in the future, particularly as we pursue our updated business plan to acquire or in-license additional products, product candidates or other technologies and expand our product pipeline. Our material acquisition, license and collaboration agreements are described below.
OSI (Eyetech) Divestiture Agreement
In July 2007, we entered into a divestiture agreement with OSI (Eyetech), Inc., or Eyetech, which agreement is now held by OSI Pharmaceuticals, LLC, or OSI Pharmaceuticals, a subsidiary of Astellas US LLC, under which we acquired specified technology, rights, and other assets owned or controlled by Eyetech relating to particular anti‑PDGF aptamers, including Fovista, and assumed Eyetech’s liabilities and obligations under specified agreements between Eyetech and Archemix, and between Eyetech and Nektar. These agreements with Archemix and Nektar, as subsequently amended, are described in more detail below.
We have agreed that we will not, alone or with any other party, research, develop or commercialize any compound, other than anti‑PDGF products covered by the divestiture agreement, which solely and specifically binds to PDGF for its mode of action.
Financial Terms
In connection with the agreement, we paid Eyetech a $4.0 million upfront payment and issued Eyetech 3,000,000 shares of our junior series A preferred stock. We are obligated to pay OSI Pharmaceuticals additional one‑time payments of $12.0 million in the aggregate upon marketing approval in the United States and the European Union, of a covered anti‑PDGF product. We are obligated to pay OSI Pharmaceuticals a royalty at a low single‑digit percentage of net sales of any covered anti‑PDGF product we successfully commercialize. Our obligation to pay such royalties will expire on a product‑by‑product and country‑by‑country basis on the later of 10 years after the first commercial sale of each product in each country or the expiration of the last‑to‑expire valid claim of specified patents that cover the composition, manufacture or use of each product in each country.
Diligence Obligations
We are required to use commercially reasonable efforts to conduct the development and manufacture of a covered anti‑PDGF product so as to obtain marketing approval and, thereafter, to commercialize a covered anti‑PDGF product in the United States and in the European Union.
24


Term and Termination
The agreement, unless terminated earlier by us or by OSI Pharmaceuticals, will remain in effect until we no longer have any financial obligations to OSI Pharmaceuticals, after which the rights granted to us will become perpetual and fully paid‑up. The agreement provides that either party may terminate the agreement in the event of the other party’s insolvency, bankruptcy or comparable proceedings, or if the other party materially breaches the agreement and does not cure such breach during a specified cure period.
If we fail to use commercially reasonable efforts to meet our specified diligence obligations and fail to take specified steps after receiving written notice thereof from OSI Pharmaceuticals, then OSI Pharmaceuticals may terminate the agreement as to such countries with respect to which such failure has occurred, and upon such termination we will be obligated to grant, assign and transfer to OSI Pharmaceuticals specified rights and licenses related to our anti‑PDGF aptamer technology and other related assets, and if we are manufacturing such anti‑PDGF products at the time of such termination, may be obligated to provide transitional supply to OSI Pharmaceuticals of covered anti‑PDGF products, for such countries.
Archemix License Agreements
In September 2011, we entered into two amended and restated exclusive license agreements with Archemix, one relating to anti‑PDGF aptamers, which we refer to as the PDGF agreement, and the other relating to anti‑C5 aptamers, which we refer to as the C5 agreement. The PDGF agreement superseded a 2004 agreement between Eyetech and Archemix that we assumed under the divestiture agreement described above. The C5 agreement superseded a July 2007 agreement between us and Archemix. Under these amended and restated agreements, we hold exclusive worldwide licenses (subject to certain pre‑existing rights) under specified patents and technology owned or controlled by Archemix to develop, make, use, sell, offer for sale, distribute for sale, import and export pharmaceutical products comprised of or derived from any anti‑PDGF aptamer or anti‑C5 aptamer for the prevention, treatment, cure or control of human indications, diseases, disorders or conditions of the eye, adnexa of the eye, orbit and optic nerve, other than certain expressly excluded applications.
The licenses we received under these agreements include sublicenses to us of rights to specified technology, which we refer to as the SELEX technology, licensed by University License Equity Holdings, Inc., or ULEHI, to Gilead Sciences, Inc., or Gilead, and sublicensed by Gilead to Archemix, as well as sublicenses to us of rights to certain other technology licensed by Gilead to Archemix, including the composition‑of‑matter patents relating to Fovista. Our agreements with Archemix contemplate that our rights to these sublicensed technologies will survive termination of the license from ULEHI to Gilead as long as we are not in breach of the C5 agreement or PDGF agreement, as applicable, and will survive termination of the sublicense from Gilead to Archemix as long as such termination did not arise from our action or inaction, provided in each case that we agree to be bound to ULEHI or Gilead, as applicable, under the terms of our agreements with Archemix. However, if Archemix, its affiliates and all of Archemix’s assignees and sublicensees, including us, cease to exercise reasonable efforts to develop commercial applications of products and services using the SELEX technology, then Archemix’s rights to the SELEX technology may revert to Gilead or ULEHI, and we would lose our rights to the SELEX technology.
Financial Terms
In connection with these agreements, as amended, we paid Archemix aggregate upfront licensing fees of $1.0 million and issued to Archemix an aggregate of 2,000,000 shares of our series A‑1 preferred stock and 500,000 shares of our series B‑1 preferred stock. We have also paid Archemix an aggregate of $6.75 million in fees based on our achievement of specified clinical milestone events under these agreements.
Under the PDGF agreement, we are also obligated to make additional future payments to Archemix of up to an aggregate of $14.0 million if we achieve specified clinical and regulatory milestones with respect to Fovista, and up to an aggregate of $3.0 million if we achieve specified commercial milestones with respect to Fovista. Under the PDGF agreement, we also are obligated to make additional payments to Archemix of up to an aggregate of approximately $18.8 million if we achieve specified clinical and regulatory milestones with respect to each other anti‑PDGF aptamer product that we may develop under the agreement, and up to an aggregate of $3.0 million if we achieve specified commercial milestones with respect to such other anti‑PDGF aptamer product.
Under the C5 agreement, for each anti‑C5 aptamer product that we may develop under the agreement, including Zimura, we are obligated to make additional payments to Archemix of up to an aggregate of $57.5 million if we achieve specified development, clinical and regulatory milestones, with $24.5 million of such payments relating to second and third indications, and, as to all anti‑C5 products under the agreement collectively, up to an aggregate of $22.5 million if we achieve 
25


specified commercial milestones. We are also obligated to pay Archemix a double‑digit percentage of specified non‑royalty payments we may receive from any sublicensee of our rights under the C5 agreement.
No royalties are payable to Archemix under either of the PDGF agreement or the C5 agreement.
Diligence Obligations
We are required to exercise commercially reasonable efforts in developing and commercializing at least one anti‑PDGF aptamer product and at least one anti‑C5 aptamer product and in undertaking investigations and actions required to obtain regulatory approvals necessary to market such products in the United States, the European Union, and Japan, and in such other markets where we determine that it is commercially reasonable to do so.
Term and Termination
Unless earlier terminated, the PDGF agreement will expire upon the later of 10 years after the first commercial sale in any country of the last licensed product and the expiration of the last‑to‑expire valid claim of the licensed patents that covers a licensed product.
Unless earlier terminated, the C5 agreement will expire upon the later of 12 years after the first commercial sale in any country of the last licensed product, the expiration of the last‑to‑expire valid claim of the licensed patents that covers a licensed product, and the date on which no further payments of sublicensing income are to be received by us.
Either we or Archemix may terminate each of the agreements if the other party materially breaches the applicable agreement and the breach remains uncured for a specified period. Archemix may also terminate each of the agreements, or may convert our exclusive licenses under the applicable agreement to non‑exclusive licenses, if we challenge or assist a third party in challenging the validity or enforceability of any of the patents licensed under the applicable agreement. We may terminate each of the agreements at any time and for any or no reason effective at the end of a specified period following our written notice to Archemix of termination.
Nektar Therapeutics Manufacturing and Supply Agreement
In April 2012, February 2015 and April 2015, we amended a 2006 license, manufacturing and supply agreement between Eyetech and Nektar that we assumed under the Eyetech divestiture agreement described above. Under the agreement, as amended, Nektar has granted us the following licenses:

• | an exclusive, worldwide license under specified patent rights and know‑how owned or controlled by Nektar to make, have made, develop, use, import, offer for sale and sell particular products that are produced by linking the API in Fovista to a specified polyethylene glycol, or PEG, reagent by means of pegylation; and


• | non‑exclusive sublicenses of certain other patent rights controlled by Nektar.

Financial Terms
We have paid approximately $21.5 million and Eyetech previously paid approximately $0.3 million, to Nektar under the agreement. We are also obligated to pay Nektar additional specified amounts in relation to certain milestone events. Such specified milestone amounts that may be payable by us in the future include an aggregate of $6.5 million payable upon the achievement of specified clinical and regulatory milestones. In addition, a payment of $3.0 million will be triggered upon the achievement of a specified commercial sale milestone with respect to Fovista.
If we grant to any third‑party commercialization rights to a licensed product under the agreement, we agreed to pay Nektar a low double‑digit percentage of any upfront payment we receive from such third party, less certain milestone amounts we have paid to Nektar. In June 2014, we paid Nektar $19.8 million in connection with our entry into the Novartis Agreement.
We are also obligated to pay Nektar tiered royalties at low to mid single‑digit percentages of net sales of any licensed product we successfully commercialize, with the royalty percentage determined by our level of licensed product sales, the extent of patent coverage for the licensed product and whether we have granted a third party commercialization rights to the licensed product. Our obligation to pay such royalties will expire on a licensed product‑by‑licensed product and country‑by‑country basis on the later of 10 years after first commercial sales of such licensed product in such country, and the expiration of the last‑to‑expire valid claim in the licensed patents that cover such licensed product in such country.
26


Exclusive Supply
Under the agreement, we must provide binding forecasts of requirements for the PEG reagent to Nektar and purchase our entire requirements for the PEG reagent, which we currently use to formulate Fovista, exclusively from Nektar at agreed prices based upon volume, which are subject to annual adjustment in accordance with changes in the producer price index, except under specified circumstances relating to Nektar’s failure to supply, in which event Nektar has agreed to enable a third‑party manufacturer to supply us.
Under the agreement, Nektar has agreed to supply our entire clinical and commercial requirements for this PEG reagent, subject to certain forecasting and ordering requirements and certain other limitations, and has agreed to supply this PEG reagent only to us for the purpose of manufacturing a product produced by linking the API in Fovista to this PEG reagent by means of pegylation.
Diligence Obligations
Under the terms of the agreement, if we fail to use commercially reasonable efforts to achieve the first commercial sale of Fovista in the United States or one of a specified group of other countries by June 30, 2018, which date Nektar and we may agree in good faith to extend in specified circumstances, Nektar may either terminate our license or convert our license for such country to a non‑exclusive license. In addition, if we fail to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop Fovista and file and seek approval of NDAs on a schedule permitting us to make first commercial sales of Fovista in specified countries by June 30, 2019, do not make such first commercial sales of Fovista by such date, or thereafter fail to use commercially reasonable efforts to continue to commercialize and market Fovista in such countries, we will be in material breach of the agreement.
Term and Termination
The agreement, unless earlier terminated by us or Nektar, will expire upon the expiration of our obligation to pay royalties to Nektar on net sales of licensed products. We and Nektar each may terminate the agreement if the other party materially breaches the agreement and does not cure such breach within a specified cure period. We may terminate the agreement at any time, without cause, effective at the end of a specified period following our written notice to Nektar of termination, in which event we will be obligated to pay Nektar specified termination fees and reimburse Nektar for certain costs.
If we challenge the validity or enforceability of any Nektar licensed patent right, we must pay for the defense of such challenge if such challenge is not successful and our licenses under certain licensed patent rights will terminate.
Licensing and Commercialization Agreement with Novartis Pharma AG
In May 2014, we entered into a licensing and commercialization agreement with Novartis Pharma AG, which we refer to as the Novartis Agreement. Under the Novartis Agreement, we granted Novartis exclusive rights under specified patent rights, know-how and trademarks controlled by us to manufacture, from bulk API supplied by us, standalone Fovista products and products combining Fovista with an anti-VEGF drug to which Novartis has rights in a co-formulated product, for the treatment, prevention, cure or control of any human disease, disorder or condition of the eye, and to develop and commercialize those licensed products in all countries outside of the United States, which we refer to as the Novartis Territory. We agreed to use commercially reasonable efforts to complete our Phase 3 clinical program for Fovista and Novartis agreed to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop a standalone Fovista product and a co-formulated product containing Fovista and an anti-VEGF drug to which Novartis has rights, as well as a pre-filled syringe presentation of such products and to use commercially reasonable efforts, subject to obtaining marketing approval, to commercialize licensed products in the Novartis Territory in accordance with agreed development and marketing plans. Novartis has also granted us options, subject to specified limitations, and to the extent such rights are controlled by Novartis, to obtain exclusive rights from Novartis to develop and commercialize in the United States the co-formulated and pre-filled syringe products developed by Novartis. We and Novartis have each granted the other options, subject to specified limitations, to obtain access to study data from certain clinical trials of licensed products that we or Novartis may conduct, including for use by the other in regulatory filings in its territory. We have agreed to exclusively supply Novartis, and Novartis has agreed to exclusively purchase from us, its clinical and commercial requirements for the bulk API for Fovista for use in-licensed products in the Novartis Territory. We have agreed not to commercialize any product comprising Fovista or any other anti-PDGF product in the ophthalmic field in the Novartis Territory.

Novartis paid us a $200.0 million upfront fee upon execution of the Novartis Agreement. Novartis also paid us $50.0 million upon the achievement of each of two patient enrollment-based milestones, and $30.0 million upon the 
27


achievement of a third, and final, enrollment-based milestone, for an aggregate of $130.0 million.  Under the terms of the Novartis Agreement, Novartis is also obligated to pay us up to an aggregate of an additional $300.0 million upon achievement of specified regulatory milestones, including marketing approval and reimbursement approval in certain countries in the Novartis Territory, and up to an aggregate of an additional $400.0 million if Novartis achieves specified sales milestones in the Novartis Territory. Novartis is also obligated to pay us royalties with respect to standalone Fovista products and combination Fovista products that Novartis successfully commercializes. We will receive royalties at a mid-thirties percentage of net sales of standalone Fovista products and a royalty of approximately equal value for sales of combination Fovista products. Such royalties are subject to customary deductions, credits, and reductions for lack of patent coverage or market exclusivity. Novartis’s obligation to pay such royalties will continue on a licensed product-by-licensed product and country-by-country basis until Novartis’s last actual commercial sale of such licensed product in such country. We will continue to be responsible for royalties we owe to third parties on sales of Fovista products.

Novartis has agreed to pay our manufacturing costs for clinical supplies and our manufacturing costs plus a specified percentage margin for commercial supplies of the bulk API for Fovista that we supply to Novartis. If we or Novartis exercise our or its respective rights to obtain access to study data from clinical trials conducted by the other party, the party exercising the option will be obligated to pay the other party’s associated past development costs and share with such other party any future associated development costs. If we exercise our option to obtain Novartis-controlled rights to develop, manufacture and commercialize any co-formulated Fovista product in the United States, we will be obligated to pay a specified percentage of Novartis’s associated past development costs and share with Novartis any future associated development costs. Novartis and we will also need to negotiate and agree on financial and other terms that would apply to such rights. If we exercise our option to obtain Novartis-controlled rights to develop and commercialize a pre-filled syringe product in the United States, we will be obligated to either enter into a supply agreement with Novartis under which we will pay Novartis its manufacturing cost plus a specified percentage margin for supplies of Fovista products in pre-filled syringes that Novartis supplies to us, or obtain supplies of products in pre-filled syringes from a third party manufacturer and pay Novartis a low single-digit percentage of our net sales of such products.

We retained control over the design and execution of our Phase 3 clinical program for Fovista and remain responsible for funding the costs of that program, subject to Novartis’s responsibility to provide Lucentis, an anti-VEGF drug to which Novartis has rights in the Novartis Territory, for use in Phase 2 and Phase 3 Fovista clinical trials in the Novartis Territory. Novartis will have control over, and will be responsible for the costs of, all other clinical trials that may be required to obtain marketing approvals in the Novartis Territory for licensed products under the agreement. Novartis is also responsible for costs associated with co-formulation development, pre-filled syringe development and other development costs in the Novartis Territory, but excluding regulatory filing fees in the European Union for the standalone Fovista product, for which we will be responsible.

The Novartis Agreement, unless earlier terminated by Novartis or us, will expire upon the expiration of Novartis’s obligation to pay us royalties on net sales of licensed products. Novartis and we each may terminate the Novartis Agreement if the other party materially breaches the agreement and does not cure such breach within a specified cure period, if the other party experiences any specified insolvency event, if the other party challenges or assists a third party in challenging the validity or enforceability of certain patent rights controlled by the terminating party, or if the parties are prevented in any manner that materially adversely affects the progression of the development or commercialization of licensed products for a specified period as a result of specified governmental actions. Novartis may terminate the Novartis Agreement at any time without cause, or within a specified period after a change in control of us, as defined in the Novartis Agreement, or for specified safety reasons, effective at the end of a specified period following Novartis’s written notice to us of Novartis’s election to terminate the agreement. We may also terminate the agreement if Novartis determines to seek marketing approval of an alternative anti-PDGF product in the Novartis Territory as more fully described below. If we elect to terminate the Novartis Agreement because specified governmental actions prevent the parties from materially progressing the development or commercialization of licensed products as described above, we will be required to pay a substantial termination fee. Following any termination, all rights to Fovista that we granted to Novartis, including, without limitation, the right to commercialize standalone Fovista products in the Novartis Territory, will revert to us, Novartis will perform specified activities in connection with transitioning to us the rights and responsibilities for the continued development, manufacture and commercialization of the standalone Fovista product for countries in the Novartis Territory, and the parties will cooperate on an orderly wind down of development and commercialization activities for other licensed products in the Novartis Territory.

Novartis has agreed to specified limitations on its ability to in-license, acquire or commercialize any anti-PDGF product that does not contain Fovista, which we refer to as an Alternative Anti-PDGF Product, in the Novartis Territory and, to the extent Novartis develops, in-licenses or acquires such a product, to make such product available to us in the United States under specified option conditions. If we exercise our option, we will be obligated to make certain payments to Novartis, including specified milestone and royalty payments. The amounts of such payments will vary based on the product’s stage of 
28


clinical development at the time we exercise our option, whether the product is a standalone or combination product and whether Novartis exercises an option to co-promote such product in the United States. If Novartis determines to seek marketing approval of an Alternative Anti-PDGF Product in the Novartis Territory, we will, subject to specified limitations, have the option to terminate the Novartis Agreement, convert Novartis’s exclusive licenses into non-exclusive licenses, or elect to receive a royalty on sales of such product by Novartis. If we elect to terminate the Novartis Agreement, Novartis will, subject to specified limitations, be required to pay to us certain payments based on achievement, with respect to such product, of the milestones that would have otherwise applied to licensed products under the Novartis Agreement.

The agreement contains standstill provisions pursuant to which Novartis agrees to certain restrictions relating to our voting securities until marketing approval for a standalone Fovista product is granted in either the United States or the European Union. The agreement contains indemnification and dispute resolution provisions that are customary for agreements of its kind.
During the fourth quarter of 2015, we were informed by Novartis that Genentech, Inc. a Roche wholly‑owned subsidiary, elected to exercise its option to participate in the financial arrangements relating to Novartis’ rights under the Novartis Agreement. Roche’s option originated from a pre‑existing agreement between Roche and Novartis. The ex‑U.S. commercialization agreement between Novartis and us, including its financial terms, remains unchanged as a result of the exercise of the opt‑in right. We continue to retain sole rights to Fovista in the United States.
Government Regulation and Product Approvals
Government authorities in the United States, at the federal, state and local level, and in other countries and jurisdictions, including the European Union, extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, approval, packaging, storage, recordkeeping, labeling, advertising, promotion, distribution, marketing, post‑approval monitoring and reporting, and import and export of pharmaceutical products. The processes for obtaining marketing approvals in the United States and in foreign countries and jurisdictions, along with subsequent compliance with applicable statutes and regulations and other regulatory authorities, require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources.
Review and Approval of Drugs in the United States
In the United States, the FDA approves and regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and implementing regulations. The failure to comply with requirements under the FDCA and other applicable laws at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval may subject an applicant and/or sponsor to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, including refusal by the FDA to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, imposition of a clinical hold, issuance of warning letters and other types of letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement of profits, or civil or criminal investigations and penalties brought by the FDA and the Department of Justice or other governmental entities.
A product candidate must be approved by the FDA through an NDA. An applicant seeking approval to market and distribute a new drug product in the United States must typically undertake the following:

• | completion of preclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies in compliance with the FDA’s good laboratory practice, or GLP, regulations;


• | submission to the FDA of an investigational new drug application, or IND, which must take effect before human clinical trials may begin;


• | approval by an independent institutional review board, or IRB, representing each clinical site before each clinical trial may be initiated;


• | performance of adequate and well‑controlled human clinical trials in accordance with good clinical practices, or GCP, to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug product for each indication;


• | preparation and submission to the FDA of an NDA requesting marketing for one or more proposed indications;


• | review by an FDA advisory committee, where appropriate or if applicable;

• | satisfactory completion of one or more FDA inspections of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the product, or components thereof, are produced to assess compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMP, requirements and to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the product’s identity, strength, quality and purity;


• | satisfactory completion of FDA audits of clinical trial sites to assure compliance with GCPs and the integrity of the clinical data;


• | payment of user fees and securing FDA approval of the NDA; and


• | compliance with any post‑approval requirements, including the potential requirement to implement a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, and the potential requirement to conduct post‑approval studies.

Preclinical Studies
Before an applicant begins testing a compound with potential therapeutic value in humans, the drug candidate enters the preclinical testing stage. Preclinical studies include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry, toxicity and formulation, and the purity and stability of the drug substance, as well as in vitro and animal studies to assess the potential safety and activity of the drug for initial testing in humans and to establish a rationale for therapeutic use. The conduct of preclinical studies is subject to federal regulations and requirements, including GLP regulations.
The IND and IRB Processes
An IND is an exemption from the FDCA that allows an unapproved drug to be shipped in interstate commerce for use in an investigational clinical trial and a request for FDA authorization to administer an investigational drug to humans. Such authorization must be secured prior to interstate shipment and administration of any new drug that is not the subject of an approved NDA. In support of a request for an IND, applicants must submit a protocol for each clinical trial and any subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. In addition, the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data and any available clinical data or literature and plans for clinical trials, among other things, are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND. The FDA requires a 30‑day waiting period after the filing of each IND before clinical trials may begin. This waiting period is designed to allow the FDA to review the IND to determine whether human research subjects will be exposed to unreasonable health risks. At any time during this 30‑day period, or thereafter, the FDA may raise concerns or questions about the conduct of the trials as outlined in the IND and impose a clinical hold or partial clinical hold. In this case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before clinical trials can begin.
In addition to the foregoing IND requirements, an IRB representing each institution participating in the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial before it commences at that institution, and the IRB must conduct continuing review and reapprove the study at least annually. The IRB must review and approve, among other things, the study protocol and informed consent information to be provided to study subjects. An IRB must operate in compliance with FDA regulations. An IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution, or an institution it represents, if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the drug has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients.
Information about certain clinical trials must be submitted within specific timeframes to the National Institutes of Health, or NIH, for public dissemination on its ClinicalTrials.gov website.
Human Clinical Trials in Support of an NDA
Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational product to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with GCP requirements, which include, among other things, the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent in writing before their participation in any clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under written study protocols detailing, among other things, the inclusion and exclusion criteria, the objectives of the study, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated.
Human clinical trials are typically conducted in four sequential phases, which may overlap or be combined:

• | Phase 1. The drug is initially introduced into a small number of healthy human subjects or, in certain indications, patients with the target disease or condition and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, 

30


distribution, excretion and, if possible, to gain an early indication of its effectiveness and to determine optimal dosage.

• | Phase 2. The drug is administered to a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage. 


• | Phase 3. These clinical trials are commonly referred to as “pivotal” studies, which denotes a study that presents the data that the FDA or other relevant regulatory agency will use to determine whether or not to approve a drug. The drug is administered to an expanded patient population, generally at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites, in well‑controlled clinical trials to generate enough data to statistically evaluate the efficacy and safety of the product for approval, identify adverse effects, establish the overall risk‑benefit profile of the product and to provide adequate information for the labeling of the product. 


• | Phase 4. Post‑approval studies may be required to be conducted after initial marketing approval. These studies are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication. 

Progress reports detailing the safety results of the clinical trials must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and more frequently if serious adverse events occur. In addition, IND safety reports must be submitted to the FDA for any of the following: serious and unexpected suspected adverse reactions; findings from other studies or animal or in vitro testing that suggest a significant risk in humans exposed to the drug; and any clinically important increase in the case of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure. The FDA or the sponsor or the data monitoring committee may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. The FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP and the integrity of the clinical data submitted.
Review of an NDA by the FDA
If clinical trials are successful, the next step in the drug development process is the preparation and submission to the FDA of an NDA. The NDA is the vehicle through which drug applicants formally propose that the FDA approve a new drug for marketing and sale in the United States for one or more indications. The NDA must contain a description of the manufacturing process and quality control methods, as well as results of preclinical tests, toxicology studies, clinical trials and proposed labeling, among other things. Every new drug must be the subject of an approved NDA before it may be commercialized in the United States. Under federal law, the submission of most NDAs is subject to an application user fee and the sponsor of an approved NDA is also subject to annual product and establishment user fees.
Following submission of an NDA, the FDA conducts a preliminary review of an NDA generally within 60 calendar days of its receipt and strives to inform the sponsor by the 74th day after the FDA’s receipt of the submission to determine whether the application is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. The FDA may request additional information rather than accept an NDA for filing. In this event, the application must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application is also subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in‑depth substantive review. Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, the FDA has agreed to specified performance goals in the review process of NDAs. Under that agreement, 90% of applications seeking approval of New Molecular Entities, or NMEs, are meant to be reviewed within ten months from the date on which FDA accepts the NDA for filing, and 90% of applications for NMEs that have been designated for “priority review” are meant to be reviewed within six months of the filing date. For applications seeking approval of drugs that are not NMEs, the ten‑month and six‑month review periods run from the date that FDA receives the application. The review process and the PDUFA goal date may be extended by the FDA for three additional months to consider new information or clarification provided by the applicant to address an outstanding deficiency identified by the FDA following the original submission.
Before approving an NDA, the FDA typically will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is or will be manufactured. These pre‑approval inspections may cover all facilities associated with an NDA submission, including drug component manufacturing (e.g., active pharmaceutical ingredients), finished drug product manufacturing, and control testing laboratories. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving an NDA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP.
31


In addition, as a condition of approval, the FDA may require an applicant to develop a REMS. REMS use risk minimization strategies beyond the professional labeling to ensure that the benefits of the product outweigh the potential risks. To determine whether a REMS is needed, the FDA will consider the size of the population likely to use the product, seriousness of the disease, expected benefit of the product, expected duration of treatment, seriousness of known or potential adverse events, and whether the product is an NME.
The FDA is required to refer an application for a novel drug to an advisory committee or explain why such referral was not made. Typically, an advisory committee is a panel of independent experts, including clinicians and other scientific experts, that reviews, evaluates and provides a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions.
The FDA’s Decision on an NDA
On the basis of the FDA’s evaluation of the NDA and accompanying information, including the results of the inspection of the manufacturing facilities, the FDA may issue an approval letter or a complete response letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the product with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A complete response letter generally outlines the deficiencies in the submission and may require substantial additional testing or information in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. If and when those deficiencies have been addressed to the FDA’s satisfaction in a resubmission of the NDA, the FDA will issue an approval letter. The FDA has committed to reviewing such resubmissions in two or six months depending on the type of information included. Even with submission of this additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval.
If the FDA approves a product, it may limit the approved indications for use for the product, require that contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling, require that post‑approval studies, including Phase 4 clinical trials, be conducted to further assess the drug’s safety after approval, require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the product after commercialization, or impose other conditions, including distribution restrictions or other risk management mechanisms, including REMS, which can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the product. The FDA may prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of post‑market studies or surveillance programs. After approval, many types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes and additional labeling claims, are subject to further testing requirements and FDA review and approval.
Fast Track, Breakthrough Therapy, Priority Review and Regenerative Advanced Therapy Designations and Accelerated Approval
The FDA is authorized to designate certain products for expedited review if they are intended to address an unmet medical need in the treatment of a serious or life‑threatening disease or condition. These programs are fast track designation, breakthrough therapy designation, priority review designation and regenerative advanced therapy designation. The FDA may also approve certain products based on an accelerated basis.
Specifically, the FDA may designate a product for fast track review if it is intended, whether alone or in combination with one or more other products, for the treatment of a serious or life‑threatening disease or condition, and if the product demonstrates the potential to address unmet medical needs for such a disease or condition. For fast track products, sponsors may have greater interactions with the FDA and the FDA may initiate review of sections of a fast track product’s application before the application is complete. This rolling review may be available if the FDA determines, after preliminary evaluation of clinical data submitted by the sponsor, that a fast track product may be effective. The sponsor must also provide, and the FDA must approve, a schedule for the submission of the remaining information and the sponsor must pay applicable user fees. However, the FDA’s time period goal for reviewing a fast track application does not begin until the last section of the application is submitted. In addition, the fast track designation may be withdrawn by the FDA if the FDA believes that the designation is no longer supported by data emerging in the clinical trial process.
In 2012, Congress enacted the Food and Product Administration Safety and Innovation Act, or FDASIA. This law established a new regulatory scheme allowing for expedited review of products designated as “breakthrough therapies.” A product may be designated as a breakthrough therapy if it is intended, either alone or in combination with one or more other products, to treat a serious or life‑threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. The FDA may take certain actions with respect to breakthrough therapies, including holding meetings with the sponsor throughout the development process; providing timely 
32


advice to the product sponsor regarding development and approval; involving more senior staff in the review process; assigning a cross‑disciplinary project lead for the review team; and taking other steps to design the clinical trials in an efficient manner.
The FDA may designate a product for priority review if it is a product that treats a serious condition and, if approved, would provide a significant improvement in safety or effectiveness. The FDA determines, on a case‑ by‑case basis, whether the proposed product represents a significant improvement when compared with other available therapies. Significant improvement may be illustrated by evidence of increased effectiveness in the treatment of a condition, elimination or substantial reduction of a treatment‑limiting product reaction, documented enhancement of patient compliance that may lead to improvement in serious outcomes, and evidence of safety and effectiveness in a new subpopulation. A priority designation is intended to direct overall attention and resources to the evaluation of such applications, and to shorten the FDA’s goal for taking action on a marketing application from ten months to six months.
With passage of the 21st Century Cures Act, or the Cures Act, in December 2016, Congress authorized the FDA to accelerate review and approval of products designated as regenerative advanced therapies. A product is eligible for this designation if it is a regenerative medicine therapy that is intended to treat, modify, reverse or cure a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug has the potential to address unmet medical needs for such disease or condition. The benefits of a regenerative advanced therapy designation include early interactions with the FDA to expedite development and review, benefits available to breakthrough therapies, potential eligibility for priority review and accelerated approval based on surrogate or intermediate endpoints.
Finally, the FDA may grant accelerated approval to a product for a serious or life‑threatening condition that provides meaningful therapeutic advantage to patients over existing treatments based upon a determination that the product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit. The FDA may also grant accelerated approval for such a condition when the product has an effect on an intermediate clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality and that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. Products granted accelerated approval must meet the same statutory standards for safety and effectiveness as those granted traditional approval.
Post‑Approval Requirements
Drugs manufactured or distributed pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to recordkeeping, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, advertising and promotion and reporting of adverse experiences with the product. After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims, are subject to prior FDA review and approval. There also are continuing, annual user fee requirements for any marketed products and the establishments at which such products are manufactured, as well as new application fees for supplemental applications with clinical data.
In addition, drug manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are required to register their establishments with the FDA and state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and these state agencies for compliance with cGMP requirements. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated and often require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon the sponsor and any third‑party manufacturers that the sponsor may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance.
Once an approval is granted, the FDA may withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post‑market studies or clinical trials to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things:

• | restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, suspension of the approval, or complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls;


• | fines, warning letters or holds on post‑approval clinical trials;

33



• | refusal of the FDA to approve pending NDAs or supplements to approved NDAs, or suspension or revocation of product license approvals;


• | product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; or


• | injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.

The FDA strictly regulates marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of products that are placed on the market. Drugs may be promoted only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off‑label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off‑label uses may be subject to significant liability.
In addition, the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical products is subject to the Prescription Drug Marketing Act, or PDMA, and its implementing regulations, as well as the Drug Supply Chain Security Act, or DSCA, which regulate the distribution and tracing of prescription drugs and prescription drug samples at the federal level, and set minimum standards for the regulation of drug distributors by the states. The PDMA, its implementing regulations and state laws limit the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical product samples, and the DSCA imposes requirements to ensure accountability in distribution and to identify and remove counterfeit and other illegitimate products from the market.
Abbreviated New Drug Applications for Generic Drugs
In 1984, with passage of the Hatch‑Waxman Amendments to the FDCA, Congress established an abbreviated regulatory scheme authorizing the FDA to approve generic drugs that are shown to contain the same active ingredients as, and to be bioequivalent to, drugs previously approved by the FDA pursuant to NDAs. To obtain approval of a generic drug, an applicant must submit an abbreviated new drug application, or ANDA, to the agency. An ANDA is a comprehensive submission that contains, among other things, data and information pertaining to the active pharmaceutical ingredient, bioequivalence, drug product formulation, specifications and stability of the generic drug, as well as analytical methods, manufacturing process validation data and quality control procedures. ANDAs are “abbreviated” because they generally do not include preclinical and clinical data to demonstrate safety and effectiveness. Instead, in support of such applications, a generic manufacturer may rely on the preclinical and clinical testing previously conducted for a drug product previously approved under an NDA, known as the reference‑listed drug, or RLD.
Specifically, in order for an ANDA to be approved, the FDA must find that the generic version is identical to the RLD with respect to the active ingredients, the route of administration, the dosage form, the strength of the drug and the conditions of use of the drug. At the same time, the FDA must also determine that the generic drug is “bioequivalent” to the innovator drug. Under the statute, a generic drug is bioequivalent to a RLD if “the rate and extent of absorption of the drug do not show a significant difference from the rate and extent of absorption of the listed drug...” Upon approval of an ANDA, the FDA indicates whether the generic product is “therapeutically equivalent” to the RLD in its publication “Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations,” also referred to as the “Orange Book.” Physicians and pharmacists consider a therapeutic equivalent generic drug to be fully substitutable for the RLD. In addition, by operation of certain state laws and numerous health insurance programs, the FDA’s designation of therapeutic equivalence often results in substitution of the generic drug without the knowledge or consent of either the prescribing physician or patient.
Under the Hatch‑Waxman Amendments, the FDA may not approve an ANDA until any applicable period of non‑patent exclusivity for the RLD has expired. The FDCA provides a period of five years of non‑patent data exclusivity for a new drug containing a new chemical entity. For the purposes of this provision, a new chemical entity, or NCE, is a drug that contains no active moiety, which is the molecule or ion responsible for the action of the drug substance, that has previously been approved by the FDA in any other NDA. In cases where such NCE exclusivity has been granted, an ANDA may not be filed with the FDA until the expiration of five years unless the submission is accompanied by a Paragraph IV certification, in which case the applicant may submit its application four years following the original product approval. The FDCA also provides for a period of three years of exclusivity if the NDA includes reports of one or more new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability or bioequivalence studies, that were conducted by or for the applicant and are essential to the approval of the application.
505(b)(2) NDAs
As an alternative path to FDA approval for modifications to formulations or uses of products previously approved by the FDA pursuant to an NDA, an applicant may submit an NDA under Section 505(b)(2) of the FDCA. Section 505(b)(2) was enacted as part of the Hatch‑Waxman Amendments and permits the filing of an NDA where at least some of the information 
34


required for approval comes from studies not conducted by, or for, the applicant. If the 505(b)(2) applicant can establish that reliance on FDA’s previous findings of safety and effectiveness is scientifically and legally appropriate, it may eliminate the need to conduct certain preclinical or clinical studies of the new product. The FDA may also require companies to perform additional studies or measurements, including clinical trials, to support the change from the previously approved RLD. The FDA may then approve the new product candidate for all, or some, of the label indications for which the RLD has been approved, as well as for any new indication sought by the 505(b)(2) applicant.
Hatch‑Waxman Patent Certification and the 30‑Month Stay
Upon approval of an NDA or a supplement thereto, NDA sponsors are required to list with the FDA each patent with claims that cover the applicant’s product or an approved method of using the product. Each of the patents listed by the NDA sponsor is published in the Orange Book. When an ANDA or 505(b)(2) applicant files its application with the FDA, the applicant is required to certify to the FDA concerning any patents listed for the RLD in the Orange Book, except for patents covering methods of use for which the ANDA applicant is not seeking approval. Specifically, the applicant must certify with respect to each patent that:

• | the required patent information has not been filed;


• | the listed patent has expired;


• | the listed patent has not expired, but will expire on a particular date and approval is sought after patent expiration; or


• | the listed patent is invalid, unenforceable or will not be infringed by the new product.

A certification that the new product will not infringe the already approved RLD’s listed patents or that such patents are invalid or unenforceable is called a Paragraph IV certification. If the applicant does not challenge the listed patents or indicates that it is not seeking approval of a patented method of use, the application will not be approved until all the listed patents claiming the referenced product have expired (other than method of use patents involving indications for which the applicant is not seeking approval).
If the ANDA or 505(b)(2) applicant has provided a Paragraph IV certification to the FDA, the applicant must also send notice of the Paragraph IV certification to the NDA and patent holders once the ANDA or the 505(b)(2) application has been accepted for filing by the FDA. The NDA and patent holders may then initiate a patent infringement lawsuit in response to the notice of the Paragraph IV certification. The filing of a patent infringement lawsuit within 45 days after the receipt of a Paragraph IV certification automatically prevents the FDA from approving the ANDA or 505(b)(2) application until the earlier of 30 months after the receipt of the Paragraph IV notice, expiration of the patent, or a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the applicant. The ANDA or 505(b)(2) application also will not be approved until any applicable non‑patent exclusivity listed in the Orange Book for the branded reference drug has expired.
Patent Term Restoration and Extension
A patent claiming a new drug product or its method of use may be eligible for a limited patent term extension, also known as patent term restoration, under the Hatch‑Waxman Amendments, which permits a patent restoration of up to five years for patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review. Patent term extension is generally available only for drug products whose active ingredient has not previously been approved by the FDA. The restoration period granted is typically one‑half the time between the effective date of an IND and the submission date of an NDA, plus the time between the submission date of an NDA and the ultimate approval date. Patent term extension cannot be used to extend the remaining term of a patent past a total of 14 years from the product’s approval date. Only one patent applicable to an approved drug product is eligible for the extension, and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent in question. A patent that covers multiple drugs for which approval is sought can only be extended in connection with one of the approvals. The United States Patent and Trademark Office (PTO) reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension in consultation with the FDA.
Pediatric Studies and Exclusivity
Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act, an NDA or supplement thereto must contain data that are adequate to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug product for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations, and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. With enactment 
35


of the FDASIA in 2012, sponsors must also submit pediatric study plans prior to the assessment data. Those plans must contain an outline of the proposed pediatric study or studies the applicant plans to conduct, including study objectives and design, any deferral or waiver requests, and any other information required by regulation. The applicant, the FDA, and the FDA’s internal review committee must then review the information submitted, consult with each other, and agree upon a final plan. The FDA or the applicant may request an amendment to the plan at any time.
The FDA may, on its own initiative or at the request of the applicant, grant deferrals for submission of some or all pediatric data until after approval of the product for use in adults, or full or partial waivers from the pediatric data requirements. Additional requirements and procedures relating to deferral requests and requests for extension of deferrals are contained in FDASIA. Unless and until FDA promulgates a regulation stating otherwise, the pediatric data requirements do not apply to products with orphan designation.
Pediatric exclusivity is another type of marketing exclusivity in the United States and, if granted, provides for the attachment of an additional six months of marketing protection to the term of any existing regulatory exclusivity or patent protection, including the non‑patent and orphan exclusivity. This six‑month exclusivity may be granted if an NDA sponsor submits pediatric data that fairly respond to a written request from the FDA for such data. The data do not need to show the product to be effective in the pediatric population studied; rather, if the clinical trial is deemed to fairly respond to the FDA’s request, the additional protection is granted. If reports of requested pediatric studies are submitted to and accepted by the FDA within the statutory time limits, whatever statutory or regulatory periods of exclusivity or patent protection cover the product are extended by six months. This is not a patent term extension, but it effectively extends the regulatory period during which the FDA cannot approve another application. With regard to patents, the six‑month pediatric exclusivity period will not attach to any patents for which an ANDA or 505(b)(2) applicant submitted a paragraph IV patent certification, unless the NDA sponsor or patent owner first obtains a court determination that the patent is valid and infringed by the proposed product.
Orphan Drug Designation and Exclusivity
Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may designate a drug product as an “orphan drug” if it is intended to treat a rare disease or condition, generally meaning that it affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more in cases in which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making a drug product available in the United States for treatment of the disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product. A company must request orphan drug designation before submitting an NDA for the drug and rare disease or condition. If the request is granted, the FDA will disclose the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential use. Orphan drug designation does not shorten the PDUFA goal dates for the regulatory review and approval process, although it does convey certain advantages such as tax benefits and exemption from the PDUFA application fee.
If a product with orphan designation receives the first FDA approval for the disease or condition for which it has such designation or for a select indication or use within the rare disease or condition for which it was designated, the product generally will receive orphan drug exclusivity. Orphan drug exclusivity means that the FDA may not approve another sponsor’s marketing application for the same drug for the same indication for seven years, except in certain limited circumstances. Orphan exclusivity does not block the approval of a different drug for the same rare disease or condition, nor does it block the approval of the same drug for different indications. If a drug designated as an orphan drug ultimately receives marketing approval for an indication broader than what was designated in its orphan drug application, it may not be entitled to exclusivity. Orphan exclusivity will not bar approval of another product under certain circumstances, including if a subsequent product with the same drug for the same indication is shown to be clinically superior to the approved product on the basis of greater efficacy or safety, or providing a major contribution to patient care, or if the company with orphan drug exclusivity is not able to meet market demand.
The 21st Century Cures Act
On December 13, 2016, President Obama signed the 21st Century Cures Act, or Cures Act, into law. The Cures Act is designed to modernize and personalize healthcare, spur innovation and research, and streamline the discovery and development of new therapies through increased federal funding of particular programs. It authorizes increasing funding for the FDA to spend on innovation projects. The new law also amends the Public Health Service Act, or PHSA, to reauthorize and expand funding for the NIH. The Act establishes the NIH Innovation Fund to pay for the cost of development and implementation of a strategic plan, early stage investigators and research. It also charges the NIH with leading and coordinating expanded pediatric research. Further, the Cures Act directs the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to expand surveillance of neurological diseases.
36


With amendments to the FDCA and the PHSA, Title III of the Cures Act seeks to accelerate the discovery, development, and delivery of new medicines and medical technologies. To that end, and among other provisions, the Cures Act reauthorizes the existing priority review voucher program for certain drugs intended to treat rare pediatric diseases until 2020; creates a new priority review voucher program for drug applications determined to be material national security threat medical countermeasure applications; revises the FDCA to streamline review of combination product applications; requires the FDA to evaluate the potential use of “real world evidence” to help support approval of new indications for approved drugs; provides a new “limited population” approval pathway for antibiotic and antifungal drugs intended to treat serious or life-threatening infections; and authorizes the FDA to designate a drug as a “regenerative advanced therapy,” thereby making it eligible for certain expedited review and approval designations.
Review and Approval of Drugs in Europe and other Foreign Jurisdictions
In addition to regulations in the United States, a manufacturer is subject to a variety of regulations in foreign jurisdictions to the extent it chooses to sell any drug products in those foreign countries. Even if a manufacturer obtains FDA approval of a product, it must still obtain the requisite approvals from regulatory authorities in foreign countries prior to the commencement of clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries. To obtain regulatory approval of an investigational drug in the European Union, a manufacturer must submit a marketing authorization application, or MAA, to the European Medicines Agency, or EMA. For other countries outside of the European Union, such as countries in Eastern Europe, Latin America or Asia, the requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. In all cases, clinical trials are to be conducted in accordance with GCP and the applicable regulatory requirements and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki.
Clinical Trial Approval in the European Union
Pursuant to the currently applicable Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC and the Directive 2005/28/EC on Good Clinical Practice, an applicant must obtain approval from the competent national authority of the European Union Member State, or the EU Member State, in which the clinical trial is to be conducted. If the clinical trial is conducted in different EU Member States, the competent authorities in each of these EU Member States must provide their approval for the conduct of the clinical trial. Furthermore, the applicant may only start a clinical trial at a specific study site after the competent ethics committee has issued a favorable opinion.
In April 2014, the European Union adopted a new Clinical Trials Regulation (EU) No 536/2014, which is set to replace the current Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC. The new Clinical Trials Regulation will be directly applicable to and binding in all 28 EU Member States without the need for any national implementing legislation. The new Clinical Trials Regulation (EU) No 536/2014 will become applicable no earlier than 28 May 2016. It will overhaul the current system of approvals for clinical trials in the European Union. Specifically, the new legislation aims at simplifying and streamlining the approval of clinical trials in the European Union. Under the new coordinated procedure for the approval of clinical trials, the sponsor of a clinical trial will be required to submit a single application for approval of a clinical trial to a reporting EU Member State (RMS) through an EU Portal. The submission procedure will be the same irrespective of whether the clinical trial is to be conducted in a single EU Member State or in more than one EU Member State. The Clinical Trials Regulation also aims to streamline and simplify the rules on safety reporting for clinical trials.
Marketing Authorization
In the European Union, marketing authorizations for medicinal products may be obtained through several different procedures founded on the same basic regulatory process.
The centralized procedure provides for the grant of a single marketing authorization that is valid for all EU Member States. The centralized procedure is compulsory for medicinal products produced by certain biotechnological processes, products designated as orphan medicinal products, and products with a new active substance indicated for the treatment of certain diseases. It is optional for those products that are highly innovative or for which a centralized process is in the interest of patients. Under the centralized procedure in the European Union, the maximum timeframe for the evaluation of an MAA is 210 days, excluding clock stops, when additional written or oral information is to be provided by the applicant in response to questions asked by the CHMP. Accelerated evaluation may be granted by the CHMP in exceptional cases. These are defined as circumstances in which a medicinal product is expected to be of a “major public health interest.” Three cumulative criteria must be fulfilled in such circumstances: the seriousness of the disease, such as severely disabling or life‑threatening diseases, to be treated; the absence or insufficiency of an appropriate alternative therapeutic approach; and anticipation of high therapeutic benefit. In these circumstances, the EMA ensures that the opinion of the CHMP is given within 150 days.
37


The decentralized procedure provides for approval by one or more other concerned EU Member States of an assessment of an application for marketing authorization conducted by one EU Member State, known as the reference EU Member State. In accordance with this procedure, an applicant submits an application for marketing authorization to the reference EU Member State and the concerned EU Member States. This application is identical to the application that would be submitted to the EMA for authorization through the centralized procedure. The reference EU Member State prepares a draft assessment and drafts of the related materials within 120 days after receipt of a valid application. The resulting assessment report is submitted to the concerned EU Member States which, within 90 days of receipt, must decide whether to approve the assessment report and related materials.
If a concerned EU Member State cannot approve the assessment report and related materials due to concerns relating to a potential serious risk to public health, disputed elements may be referred to the European Commission, whose decision is binding on all EU Member States. In accordance with the mutual recognition procedure, the sponsor applies for national marketing authorization in one EU Member State. Upon receipt of this authorization the sponsor can then seek the recognition of this authorization by other EU Member States. Authorization in accordance with either of these procedures will result in authorization of the medicinal product only in the reference EU Member State and in the other concerned EU Member States.
A marketing authorization may be granted only to an applicant established in the European Union. Regulation No. 1901/2006 provides that, prior to obtaining a marketing authorization in the European Union, an applicant must demonstrate compliance with all measures included in a Pediatric Investigation Plan, or PIP, approved by the Pediatric Committee of the EMA, covering all subsets of the pediatric population, unless the EMA has granted a product‑specific waiver, class waiver, or a deferral for one or more of the measures included in the PIP.
Regulatory Data Exclusivity in the European Union
Innovative medicinal products authorized in the European Union on the basis of a full MAA (as opposed to an application for marketing authorization that relies on data available in the marketing authorization dossier for another, previously approved, medicinal product) are entitled to eight years of data exclusivity. During this period, applicants for authorization of generic versions of these innovative products cannot rely on data contained in the marketing authorization dossier submitted for the innovative medicinal product. Innovative medicinal products are also entitled to ten years’ of market exclusivity. During this ten year period no generic version of the medicinal product can be placed on the EU market. The overall ten‑year period will be extended to a maximum of eleven years if, during the first eight years of those ten years, the marketing authorization holder obtains an authorization for one or more new therapeutic indications which, during the scientific evaluation prior to authorization, is held to bring a significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies. Even if a compound is considered to be a new chemical entity so that the innovator gains the prescribed period of data exclusivity, another company may market another version of the product if such company obtained marketing authorization based on an MAA with a complete independent data package of pharmaceutical tests, preclinical tests and clinical trials.
Periods of Authorization and Renewals in the European Union
A marketing authorization is valid for five years, in principle, and it may be renewed after five years on the basis of a reevaluation of the risk‑benefit balance by the EMA or by the competent authority of the relevant EU Member State. To that end, the marketing authorization holder must provide the EMA or the relevant competent authority of the EU Member State with a consolidated version of the file in respect of quality, safety and efficacy, including all variations introduced since the marketing authorization was granted, at least six months before the marketing authorization ceases to be valid. Once renewed, the marketing authorization is valid for an unlimited period, unless the European Commission or the relevant competent authority of the EU Member State decides, on justified grounds relating to pharmacovigilance, to proceed with one additional five‑year renewal period. Any marketing authorization that is not followed by the marketing of the medicinal product on the EU market (in the case of the centralized procedure) or on the market of the EU Member State which delivered the marketing authorization within three years after authorization ceases to be valid.
Regulatory Requirements after Marketing Authorization
As in the United States, marketing authorization holders and manufacturers of medicinal products are subject to comprehensive regulatory oversight by the EMA and the competent authorities of the individual EU Member States both before and after grant of the manufacturing and marketing authorizations.
The holder of an EU marketing authorization for a medicinal product must also comply with EU pharmacovigilance legislation and its related regulations and guidelines, which detail requirements for conducting pharmacovigilance or the assessment and monitoring of the safety of medicinal products. These rules can impose on central marketing authorization holders for medicinal products the obligation to conduct a labor intensive collection of data regarding the risks and benefits of marketed products and to engage in ongoing assessments of those risks and benefits, including the possible requirement to conduct additional clinical studies.
38


The manufacturing process for medicinal products in the European Union is highly regulated and regulators may shut down manufacturing facilities that they believe do not comply with regulations. Manufacturing requires a manufacturing authorization, and the manufacturing authorization holder must comply with various requirements set out in the applicable EU laws, regulations and guidance, including Directive 2001/83/EC, Directive 2003/94/EC, Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 and the European Commission Guidelines for Good Manufacturing Practice. These requirements include compliance with EU cGMP standards when manufacturing medicinal products and active pharmaceutical ingredients, including the manufacture of active pharmaceutical ingredients outside of the EU with the intention to import the active pharmaceutical ingredients into the European Union. Similarly, the distribution of medicinal products into and within the EU is subject to compliance with the applicable EU laws, regulations and guidelines, including the requirement to hold appropriate authorizations for distribution granted by the competent authorities of the EU Member States.
In the European Union, the advertising and promotion of products are subject to EU Member States’ laws governing promotion of medicinal products, interactions with physicians, misleading and comparative advertising and unfair commercial practices. In addition, other legislation adopted by individual EU Member States may apply to the advertising and promotion of medicinal products. These laws require that promotional materials and advertising in relation to medicinal products comply with the product’s Summary of Product Characteristics, or SmPC, as approved by the competent authorities. Promotion of a medicinal product that does not comply with the SmPC is considered to constitute off‑label promotion. The off‑label promotion of medicinal products is prohibited in the European Union. The applicable laws at the European Union level and in the individual EU Member States also prohibit the direct‑to‑consumer advertising of prescription‑only medicinal products. These laws may further limit or restrict the advertising and promotion of products to the general public and may also impose limitations on promotional activities with health care professionals.
Pediatric Studies and Exclusivity
Prior to obtaining a marketing authorization in the European Union, applicants must demonstrate compliance with all measures included in an EMA‑approved PIP covering all subsets of the pediatric population, unless the EMA has granted a product‑specific waiver, a class waiver, or a deferral for one or more of the measures included in the PIP. The respective requirements for all marketing authorization procedures are laid down in Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, the so‑called Pediatric Regulation. This requirement also applies when a company wants to add a new indication, pharmaceutical form or route of administration for a medicine that is already authorized. The Pediatric Committee of the EMA, or PDCO, may grant deferrals for some medicines, allowing a company to delay development of the medicine for children until there is enough information to demonstrate its effectiveness and safety in adults. The PDCO may also grant waivers when development of a medicine for children is not needed or is not appropriate, such as for diseases that only affect the elderly population. Before an MAA can be filed, or an existing marketing authorization can be amended, the EMA determines that companies actually comply with the agreed studies and measures listed in each relevant PIP. If an applicant obtains a marketing authorization in all EU Member States, or a marketing authorization granted in the Centralized Procedure by the European Commission, and the study results for the pediatric population are included in the product information, even when negative, the medicine is then eligible for an additional six month period of qualifying patent protection through extension of the term of the Supplementary Protection Certificate, or SPC.
Orphan Drug Designation and Exclusivity in the European Union
Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 and Regulation (EC) No. 847/2000 provide that a product can be designated as an orphan medicinal product by the European Commission if its sponsor can establish that the product is intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of: (1) a life‑threatening or chronically debilitating condition affecting not more than five in ten thousand persons in the European Union when the application is made, or (2) a life‑threatening, seriously debilitating or serious and chronic condition in the European Union and that without incentives the medicinal product is unlikely to be developed. For either of these conditions, the applicant must demonstrate that there exists no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention or treatment of the condition in question that has been authorized in the European Union or, if such method exists, the medicinal product will be of significant benefit to those affected by that condition.
Once authorized, orphan medicinal products are entitled to ten years of market exclusivity in all EU Member States and, in addition, a range of other benefits during the development and regulatory review process, including scientific assistance for study protocols, authorization through the centralized marketing authorization procedure covering all member countries and a reduction or elimination of registration and marketing authorization fees. However, marketing authorization may be granted to a similar medicinal product with the same orphan indication during the ten year period with the consent of the marketing authorization holder for the original orphan medicinal product or if the manufacturer of the original orphan medicinal product is unable to supply sufficient quantities. Marketing authorization may also be granted to a similar medicinal product with the same orphan indication if the product is safer, more effective or otherwise clinically superior to the original orphan medicinal product. The period of market exclusivity may, in addition, be reduced to six years if it can be demonstrated on the basis of 
39


available evidence that the original orphan medicinal product is sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of market exclusivity.
Pharmaceutical Coverage, Pricing and Reimbursement
In the United States and markets in other countries, patients who are prescribed treatments for their conditions and providers performing the prescribed services generally rely on third‑party payors to reimburse all or part of the associated healthcare costs. Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of products approved by the FDA and other government authorities. Thus, even if a product candidate is approved, sales of the product will depend, in part, on the extent to which third‑party payors, including government health programs in the United States such as Medicare and Medicaid, commercial health insurers and managed care organizations, provide coverage, and establish adequate reimbursement levels for, the product. The process for determining whether a payor will provide coverage for a product may be separate from the process for setting the price or reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the product once coverage is approved. Third‑party payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged, examining the medical necessity, and reviewing the cost‑effectiveness of medical products and services and imposing controls to manage costs. Third‑party payors may limit coverage to specific products on an approved list, also known as a formulary, which might not include all of the approved products for a particular indication.
In order to secure coverage and reimbursement for any product that might be approved for sale, a company may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost‑effectiveness of the product, in addition to the costs required to obtain FDA or other comparable marketing approvals. Nonetheless, product candidates may not be considered medically necessary or cost effective. A decision by a third‑party payor not to cover a product candidate could reduce physician utilization once the product is approved and have a material adverse effect on sales, results of operations and financial condition. Additionally, a payor’s decision to provide coverage for a product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Further, one payor’s determination to provide coverage for a drug product does not assure that other payors will also provide coverage and reimbursement for the product, and the level of coverage and reimbursement can differ significantly from payor to payor.
The containment of healthcare costs also has become a priority of federal, state and foreign governments and the prices of drugs have been a focus in this effort. Governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost‑containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products. Government authorities and third‑party payors, particularly Medicare, have attempted to control costs by limiting coverage and the amount of reimbursement for particular medications and encouraging the substitution of lower cost or generic products. Pricing pressures recently experienced by the pharmaceutical industry may be further exacerbated by legislative and policy changes under consideration by the Trump administration. For example, the new administration has expressed an interest in authorizing and/or directing the Center for Medicare & Medicaid Service or other agencies of the U.S. government to negotiate prices for drugs covered by Medicare directly with pharmaceutical companies. If this were to occur, especially for wet AMD drugs, where a large portion of the patient population is elderly and is therefore covered by Medicare, there could be significant downward pressure on prices charged, not only for patients covered by Medicare, but also for patients covered by private insurers who may follow the government’s lead on price. Adoption of price controls and cost‑containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could further limit a company’s revenue generated from the sale of any approved products. Coverage policies and third‑party reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which a company or its collaborators receive marketing approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future.
Outside the United States, ensuring adequate coverage and payment for a product also involves challenges. Pricing of prescription pharmaceuticals is subject to governmental control in many countries. Pricing negotiations with governmental authorities can extend well beyond the receipt of regulatory marketing approval for a product and may require a clinical trial that compares the cost effectiveness of a product to other available therapies. The conduct of such a clinical trial could be expensive and result in delays in commercialization.
In the European Union, pricing and reimbursement schemes vary widely from country to country. Some countries provide that products may be marketed only after a reimbursement price has been agreed. Some countries may require the completion of additional studies that compare the cost‑effectiveness of a particular drug candidate to currently available therapies or so called health technology assessments, in order to obtain reimbursement or pricing approval. For example, the European Union provides options for its member states to restrict the range of products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. European Union member states may approve a specific price for a product or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the 
40


profitability of the company placing the product on the market. Other member states allow companies to fix their own prices for products, but monitor and control prescription volumes and issue guidance to physicians to limit prescriptions. Recently, many countries in the European Union have increased the amount of discounts required on pharmaceuticals and these efforts could continue as countries attempt to manage healthcare expenditures, especially in light of the severe fiscal and debt crises experienced by many countries in the European Union. The downward pressure on health care costs in general, particularly prescription drugs, has become intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products. Political, economic and regulatory developments may further complicate pricing negotiations, and pricing negotiations may continue after reimbursement has been obtained. Reference pricing used by various European Union member states, and parallel trade, i.e., arbitrage between low‑priced and high‑priced member states, can further reduce prices. There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for pharmaceutical products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any products, if approved in those countries.
Healthcare Law and Regulation
Healthcare providers and third‑party payors play a primary role in the recommendation and prescription of drug products that are granted marketing approval. Arrangements with providers, consultants, third‑party payors and customers are subject to broadly applicable fraud and abuse, anti‑kickback, false claims laws, reporting of payments to physicians and teaching physicians and patient privacy laws and regulations and other healthcare laws and regulations that may constrain business and/or financial arrangements. Restrictions under applicable federal and state healthcare laws and regulations, include the following:

• | the federal Anti‑Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons and entities from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, paying, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, any good or service, for which payment may be made, in whole or in part, under a federal healthcare program such as Medicare and Medicaid;


• | the federal civil and criminal false claims laws, including the civil False Claims Act, and civil monetary penalties laws, which prohibit individuals or entities from, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, to the federal government, claims for payment that are false, fictitious or fraudulent or knowingly making, using or causing to made or used a false record or statement to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government;


• | the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, which created additional federal criminal laws that prohibit, among other things, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or making false statements relating to healthcare matters;


• | HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, and their respective implementing regulations, including the Final Omnibus Rule published in January 2013, which impose obligations, including mandatory contractual terms, with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information;


• | the federal false statements statute, which prohibits knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services;


• | the federal transparency requirements known as the federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act, under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care Education Reconciliation Act, or the Affordable Care Act, which requires certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies to report annually to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, within the United States Department of Health and Human Services, information related to payments and other transfers of value made by that entity to physicians and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members; and


• | analogous state and foreign laws and regulations, such as state anti‑kickback and false claims laws, which may apply to healthcare items or services that are reimbursed by non‑governmental third‑party payors, including private insurers.

41


Some state laws require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government in addition to requiring drug manufacturers to report information related to payments to physicians and other health care providers or marketing expenditures. State and foreign laws also govern the privacy and security of health information in some circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts.
Healthcare Reform
A primary trend in the United States healthcare industry and elsewhere is cost containment. There have been a number of federal and state proposals regarding the pricing of pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical products, limiting coverage and reimbursement for drugs and other medical products, government control and other changes to the healthcare system in the United States.
In March 2010, Congress enacted the Affordable Care Act, which, among other things, includes changes to the coverage and payment for products under government health care programs. Among the provisions of the Affordable Care Act of importance to potential drug candidates are:

• | an annual, nondeductible fee on any entity that manufactures or imports specified branded prescription drugs and biologic agents, apportioned among these entities according to their market share in certain government healthcare programs, although this fee would not apply to sales of certain products approved exclusively for orphan indications;


• | expansion of eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs by, among other things, allowing states to offer Medicaid coverage to certain individuals with income at or below 133% of the federal poverty level, thereby potentially increasing a manufacturer’s Medicaid rebate liability;


• | expanded manufacturers’ rebate liability under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program by increasing the minimum rebate for both branded and generic drugs and revising the definition of “average manufacturer price,” or AMP, for calculating and reporting Medicaid drug rebates on outpatient prescription drug prices and extending rebate liability to prescriptions for individuals enrolled in Medicare Advantage plans;


• | addressed a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injected;


• | expanded the types of entities eligible for the 340B drug discount program;


• | established the Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program by requiring manufacturers to provide a 50% point‑of‑sale‑discount off the negotiated price of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period as a condition for the manufacturers’ outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D;


• | established a new Patient‑Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research;


• | established the Independent Payment Advisory Board, or IPAB, which has authority to recommend certain changes to the Medicare program to reduce expenditures by the program that could result in reduced payments for prescription drugs. However, the IPAB implementation has been not been clearly defined. The Affordable Care Act provided that under certain circumstances, IPAB recommendations will become law unless Congress enacts legislation that will achieve the same or greater Medicare cost savings; and


• | established the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation within CMS to test innovative payment and service delivery models to lower Medicare and Medicaid spending, potentially including prescription drug spending. Funding has been allocated to support the mission of the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation from 2011 to 2019.

Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the United States since the Affordable Care Act was enacted. For example, in August 2011, the Budget Control Act of 2011, among other things, created measures for spending reductions by Congress. A Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction, tasked with recommending a targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for the years 2012 through 2021, was unable to reach required goals, thereby triggering the legislation’s automatic reduction to several government programs. This includes aggregate reductions of Medicare payments to providers of 
42


up to 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect in April 2013 and will remain in effect through 2024 unless additional Congressional action is taken. In January 2013, President Obama signed into law the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, which, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several providers, including hospitals, imaging centers and cancer treatment centers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. 
With the new Administration and Congress, there will likely be additional legislative changes, including repeal and replacement of some or all of the Affordable Care Act. Such reforms could have an adverse effect on anticipated revenue from product candidates that we may successfully develop and for which we may obtain marketing approval and may affect our overall financial condition and ability to develop product candidates.
In January 2017, Congress voted to adopt a budget resolution for fiscal year 2017, or the Budget Resolution, that authorizes the implementation of legislation that would repeal portions of the Affordable Care Act.  The Budget Resolution is not a law, although it is widely viewed as the first step toward the potential passage of legislation that would repeal certain aspects of the Affordable Care Act. Also in January 2017, President Trump signed an Executive Order directing federal agencies with authorities and responsibilities under the Affordable Care Act to waive, defer, grant exemptions from, or delay the implementation of any provision of the Affordable Care Act that would impose a fiscal or regulatory burden on states, individuals, healthcare providers, health insurers, or manufacturers of pharmaceuticals or medical devices. 
The President and Congressional leaders have expressed particular interest in repealing certain Affordable Care Act provisions and replacing them with alternatives that may be less costly and provide state Medicaid programs and private health plans more flexibility. It is possible that these repeal and replacement initiatives, if enacted into law, could ultimately result in fewer individuals having health insurance coverage or in individuals having insurance coverage with less generous benefits. The scope of potential future legislation to repeal and replace Affordable Care Act provisions is highly uncertain in many respects, and it is possible that some of the Affordable Care Act provisions that generally are not favorable for the research-based pharmaceutical industry could also be repealed along with Affordable Care Act coverage expansion provisions.
Employees
As of January 31, 2017, we had 156 full‑time employees, including a total of 20 employees with M.D. or Ph.D. degrees. Of our workforce, 116 employees are engaged in research and development. Following our receipt and announcement of initial, top-line data for our pivotal OPH1002 and OPH1003 Fovista trials for the treatment of wet AMD in December 2016, we determined to implement a reduction in personnel to focus on an updated business plan involving an expected workforce of approximately 30 employees. The reduction in personnel is expected to involve approximately 125 employees across our organization, including employees from nearly every department.  We expect to substantially complete the reduction in personnel during the first and second quarters of 2017 as part of implementing our updated business plan. None of our employees are represented by labor unions or covered by collective bargaining agreements.
