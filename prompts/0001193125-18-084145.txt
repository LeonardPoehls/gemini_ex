Overview 
 We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on bringing innovations in biotechnology to the discovery, development and commercialization of first-in-class, targeted, topical products in medical dermatology and aesthetics. Our objective is to develop our multi-asset pipeline of topical therapies that enhance the health, appearance and quality of life of dermatology patients. We are advancing multiple product candidates derived from our Topical by Design platform, all of which are designed to be suitable for chronic administration in patients with inflammatory skin diseases and other dermatologic and aesthetic conditions. Our lead candidate from this platform, SNA-120, is a first-in-class inhibitor of Tropomyosin receptor kinase A, or TrkA, in Phase 2b clinical development for the treatment of pruritus, or itch, associated with psoriasis, as well as for psoriasis itself. Our second Topical by DesignTM product candidate, SNA-125, is a dual JAK3/TrkA inhibitor being developed for the treatment of atopic dermatitis, psoriasis and pruritus. Additionally, we have advanced SNA-001, a silver particle treatment derived from our Topical Photoparticle Therapy platform, into pivotal clinical trials for both acne vulgaris and the reduction of unwanted light-pigmented hair. We believe our management team is well-positioned to execute on our objectives, having served in clinical and commercial leadership roles at several marquee dermatology, aesthetics and biotechnology companies, including Kythera, Allergan, Medicis, and Amgen. 
 There is a significant opportunity to address the historical lack of innovation in topical products for dermatology patients. Recent advances in biotechnology have enabled the development of novel, biologic drugs which act on specific molecular targets and pathways, and have been utilized to address inflammatory disorders. However, despite having shown impressive efficacy, use of these drugs has been limited to patients with more severe forms of disease due to the potentially significant side effects associated with systemic administration and their relatively high cost. Accordingly, the 80-90% of dermatology patients who present with mild-to-moderate disease severity or more localized disease have not benefitted from these advances. Today, such patients typically resort to non-specific, topical therapies such as corticosteroids and emollients, which are either marginally effective or unsuitable for chronic administration due to their side effects. We are focused on filling this innovation gap in dermatology by developing targeted topical products suitable for chronic administration to serve the vast majority of patients suffering from these inflammatory skin diseases and other dermatologic and aesthetic conditions. 
 Through our proprietary Topical by DesignTM platform we develop targeted, topical treatments for inflammatory skin diseases and other conditions by creating new chemical entities, or NCEs, based on small molecules with well understood mechanisms of action. Using this technology, we site-selectively direct the conjugation of small polyethylene glycol, or PEG, polymers to selected pharmacologically active compounds. This modification alters the pharmacological activity of the active compound to refine its target selectivity while also changing its physicochemical profile. The resulting NCEs are designed to permeate the skin or other targeted surfaces, such as the eye, the gastrointestinal tract or the respiratory tract, for highly localized delivery of the drug against the selected targets or pathway, while minimizing systemic exposure. By utilizing this targeted, topical approach, we create topical therapies that are specifically designed to be highly effective and suitable for chronic administration. Our lead product candidates from our Topical by DesignTM platform are: 
 

 | SNA-120 (pegcantratinib), a first-in-class topical TrkA inhibitor for the treatment of pruritus associated with psoriasis, and which may also be effective for the treatment of psoriasis itself. A Phase 2b trial was completed for SNA-120 that demonstrated statistically significant improvements in pruritus associated with psoriasis, positive trends in the improvement of psoriasis severity, and a favorable safety and tolerability profile. We initiated a second Phase 2b clinical trial in October 2017 in order to expand our understanding of SNA-120 in pruritus and the underlying psoriasis and provide additional endpoint evaluation and validation, with data expected in the first quarter of 2019.

 | SNA-125, a topical Janus kinase 3 (JAK3)/TrkA inhibitor with the potential to treat various inflammatory conditions, including atopic dermatitis, psoriasis and pruritus. Nonclinical studies have demonstrated anti-inflammatory activity in an animal model, and a favorable safety profile. We believe that by inhibiting both JAK3 and TrkA, SNA-125 has the potential to be a differentiated, best-in-class topical therapy. We initiated first-in-human, Phase 1/2 proof-of-concept clinical trials in February 2018 for psoriasis and in March 2018 for atopic dermatitis, with data expected in the third and fourth quarters of 2018, respectively.

 Our second technology platform, Topical Photoparticle TherapyTM, utilizes silver particles applied to the skin to direct the light from commercially available lasers to the sebaceous gland and hair follicle to cause selective photothermolysis, a method of using light energy to produce heat in a specific tissue and facilitate local tissue injury. SNA-001, our lead product candidate from this platform, is a topical suspension of silver particles under development for the treatment of acne and for the reduction of light-pigmented hair, including white, gray, blonde, light brown and light red hair. In the case of acne, SNA-001 targets one of the key structures implicated in the pathogenesis of acne, the sebaceous gland. In the case of unwanted light or mixed pigmented hair, which cannot be removed with lasers alone, SNA-001 targets the hair follicle. Our studies have shown significant reductions in acne lesions and in light-pigmented hair following a small number of procedures with SNA-001. We are currently conducting three pivotal trials for the treatment of acne and anticipate reporting initial topline data from these studies in the second half of 2018. Concurrently, we are conducting three pivotal trials for SNA-001 for the reduction of light-pigmented hair, with initial topline data expected in the second half of 2018. Assuming data from these trials are positive, we expect to file the first 510(k) premarket notifications in the second half of 2019 for both indications. 
 Prescription medical dermatology products represented an approximately $19 billion global market in 2016, which is projected to grow to over $25 billion by 2020. Prescription drugs indicated for the treatment of psoriasis, atopic dermatitis and acne accounted for approximately 50% of this market, and we believe that the treatment of pruritus, which affects the vast majority of psoriasis and atopic dermatitis patients and a large percentage of patients with other chronic conditions, presents a substantial additional market opportunity. Demand for treatments of dermatologic conditions is driven, in part, by the highly visible nature of skin disease and distressing symptoms the patient experiences, such as itch, burning, or pain, all of which negatively impact quality of life. As new products are developed to address these unmet needs, we believe patients, physicians and payors will prefer the use of effective topical treatments that are suitable for chronic use in the broader patient population. We design and develop our targeted topical products with these criteria in mind, and believe they will play an important role in the treatment of various underserved skin conditions in the future. 
 The market for non-surgical, aesthetic dermatologic procedures was estimated at $6.8 billion in the United States in 2016, and is characterized by the significant willingness of patients to pay out of pocket for aesthetic improvements. In addition to addressing acne in the medical dermatology market, our Topical Photoparticle TherapyTM platform targets an aesthetic market opportunity in the reduction of unwanted light-pigmented hair, and we believe our Topical Photoparticle TherapyTM product candidate SNA-001, if cleared, will play an important role in the market for non-surgical, aesthetic dermatologic procedures. 
 In comparison to many other segments of the biopharmaceutical industry, we believe that product development and commercialization in medical dermatology and aesthetics can be relatively efficient in terms of time and cost. In many cases, clinical studies to evaluate efficacy and safety are conducted using well established endpoints and regulatory pathways that allow for comparatively modest sample sizes and shorter durations of therapy. Additionally, the prescribing base of dermatologists in the United States is relatively concentrated compared to other medical specialties. We believe a targeted, specialty sales and marketing organization focused on dermatologists and aesthetic physicians will allow us to directly address these physicians and capture market share for our product candidates in North America. To realize the full commercial potential of our product candidates in other geographic markets and sales channels, we will evaluate alternate commercialization

   strategies, including licensing and co-commercialization agreements with third parties. We believe that these industry dynamics provide an attractive backdrop to establish ourselves as a leader in medical dermatology and aesthetic product development and commercialization. 
 We have assembled a management team with extensive experience in product development and commercialization at several leading dermatology, aesthetics and biotechnology companies, including Kythera, Allergan, Medicis, and Amgen. In these roles, members of our senior management team were integrally involved in securing regulatory approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, for multiple new dermatology and aesthetic products, and establishing several leading global brands, including Botox, Juvederm, Kybella, Latisse, Dysport, Restylane, and Solodyn. We believe this collective experience and achievement provides us with significant and differentiated insight into scientific, regulatory and commercial aspects of drug development that can influence our overall success, as well as a broad network of relationships with leaders within the industry and medical community. 
 Our Strategy 
 Our strategy is to develop and commercialize innovative and differentiated medical dermatology and aesthetic treatment solutions that we believe can be successful in the marketplace. The key components of our strategy are to: 

 | Leverage our proprietary technology platforms to design and develop targeted, topical therapies. There is an untapped opportunity to bring innovative topical therapies to the 80-90% of dermatology patients with mild-to-moderate inflammatory disease severity, for whom systemic therapies are inappropriate and existing topical therapies are marginally effective or unsuitable for chronic administration. We believe that our two proprietary technology platforms, Topical by DesignTM and Topical Photoparticle TherapyTM, are positioned to yield multiple topical products for this large underserved population, as well as potentially in other therapeutic areas where topical approaches may provide clinical benefit. We have validated our platforms by advancing lead product candidates from both platforms beyond clinical proof-of-concept. Importantly, by applying our technology platforms to well understood biological targets and pathways, we may be able to reduce the risks associated with the development of novel, targeted topical therapies.

 | Rapidly advance our existing product candidates through clinical development. Our first Topical by DesignTM product candidate, SNA-120, has shown statistically significant and clinically meaningful reductions in the pruritus associated with psoriasis in a Phase 2b trial. We initiated a second Phase 2b trial in October 2017. We initiated two clinical trials for our next product candidate from the Topical by DesignTM platform, SNA-125, in February 2018 for psoriasis and in March 2018 for atopic dermatitis, and expect to report proof-of-concept data in the third and fourth quarters of 2018, respectively. We believe these highly differentiated topical therapies have the potential to address multi-billion dollar market opportunities across atopic dermatitis, psoriasis, and pruritus. Our Topical Photoparticle TherapyTM product candidate, SNA-001, is currently in pivotal trials for both acne vulgaris and the reduction of unwanted light-pigmented hair. We intend to complete these trials efficiently and advance SNA-001 to our first regulatory filing in the United States and international markets in the second half of 2019.

 | Continue building a diversified multi-asset pipeline of novel topical therapies. Our objective is to build a well-balanced, multi-asset portfolio targeting the medical dermatology and aesthetics markets, with a strong focus on topical products and large patient populations with unmet needs. To achieve this, we will selectively pursue development of our current product candidates SNA-120, SNA-125 and SNA-001 in additional indications where they could have meaningful impact while, over time, selecting additional clinical development candidates from our preclinical pipeline of NCEs based on our Topical by DesignTM technology. We also plan to invest in our internal research efforts to bring forth new product candidates for medical dermatology and aesthetics, as well as in other therapeutic

areas for which localized, topical drug delivery could deliver clinical benefit. Our internal research efforts are led by the scientific team that originally developed the Topical by DesignTM technology platform. In addition to our internal discovery efforts, we may choose to selectively in-license or acquire complementary, external product candidates by leveraging the insights, network and experience of our management team.

 | Maximize the global commercial potential of our product candidates. We retain worldwide commercial rights to all of our product candidates. If approved, we intend to commercialize our product candidates independently by establishing specialized field medical, sales and marketing organization focused on dermatologists and aesthetic physicians in North America. In certain sales channels and geographies, we will evaluate alternate strategies to maximize the potential value of our assets, such as licensing and co-commercialization agreements with third parties.

 | Leverage the extensive experience of our management team in developing and commercializing multiple leading global dermatology brands. We have assembled a management team with extensive experience in product development and commercialization at several leading dermatology and aesthetics companies, including Kythera, Allergan, Medicis, and Amgen. Our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Medical Officer are practicing dermatologists whose close proximity to patients provides them with deep insight into the needs of patients as well as the changing treatment landscape. We have long-standing experience in the dermatology community and strong relationships with opinion leaders, regulatory agencies, advocacy groups and medical practitioners. In addition, our team has established credibility from a track record of success working with regulators to attain approval of multiple products, many of which were first-in-class and required the development and validation of new endpoints and agreement on the development pathways. These experiences enable us to better understand unmet medical needs, design and execute efficient clinical trial programs, craft effective regulatory strategies and identify new development opportunities. Recent consolidation in the medical dermatology and aesthetics industry has created an opportunity for us to work closely with physicians to identify unmet needs and deliver innovative products to patients.

 Overview of the Dermatology Market 
 Dermatology is a medical specialty encompassing a broad range of conditions, diseases, and aesthetic concerns associated with the skin, hair, nails and mucous membranes. The specialty is generally segmented into two categories: medical dermatology, which refers to the treatment of conditions and diseases including psoriasis, atopic dermatitis, pruritus, acne and rosacea, and aesthetics, which focuses on improving the patients appearance, most frequently the signs of aging or undesirable cosmetic features, such as unwanted wrinkles, fat or excessive body hair. 
 Dermatologic conditions can have significant effects on patients quality of life, due to the highly visible nature of skin disease and distressing symptoms felt by the patient, such as itching, burning, or pain. For example, itch from psoriasis has been shown to have a strong negative correlation with a patients quality of life on par with other severe chronic conditions. Acne vulgaris frequently results in significant emotional distress and other psychological issues from the social stigma associated with disease, and severe acne can cause permanent scarring, anxiety, and depression. 
 Due to the severe impact on patients lives, the medical dermatology market is large, with approximately $19 billion in global sales in 2016. Given high unmet need in indications for which there are currently no approved or adequate topical therapies, such as pruritus, psoriasis and atopic dermatitis, we expect the demand for innovative topical products to continue to expand. Similarly, the market for non-surgical, aesthetic procedures is large, estimated at approximately $6.8 billion in the United States in 2016, driven by consumers strong desire to reduce visible signs of aging and cosmetic concerns. The physician practice of dermatology has evolved to encompass both medical dermatology and aesthetics as a means to satisfy patient needs and improve practice revenue as trends in consumer demand and the health of the economy fluctuate. The increasing appetite of consumers for cosmetic improvements to their appearance has fueled a cash pay market in aesthetic dermatology

   that has favorable economic implications for treating physicians. Reflecting this convergence of medical and aesthetic dermatology, most dermatologists practice in both medical dermatology and aesthetics. For example, in a survey of 103 dermatologists that we conducted, 89% indicated that their practices are Medical and Aesthetic Dermatology. Dermatology procedures and other treatments have aligned with current practice and enable dermatologists to address medical as well as aesthetic concerns, with some procedures serving as an adjunct or alternative therapy. Procedural treatments are an integral part of the well-established approach to treating dermatological conditions with multiple therapeutic options, whereby many patients use multiple drugs and procedural treatments in parallel or in sequence, due to the limited availability of effective, targeted therapeutics suitable for long-term use. 
 The vast majority of dermatology patients are treated with topical products. The most frequently prescribed topical products are corticosteroids, which accounted for approximately 40 million prescriptions in the United States in 2015 according to IMS Health. Despite their efficacy, topical corticosteroids are often used for only short-term relief of chronic conditions such as atopic dermatitis and psoriasis, because side effects limit their long-term use. As a result, we believe there is a significant unmet need for non-steroidal topical therapies suitable for long-term use. This is evidenced by the topical calcineurin inhibitors Elidel and Protopic rapidly displacing topical steroids for atopic dermatitis, until boxed warnings for side effects significantly limited their use. Additionally, Eucrisa, a topical PDE4 inhibitor that was recently approved for atopic dermatitis, is projected to have multi-billion dollar peak sales potential globally, primarily driven by its safety profile. 
 Our Technology Platforms and Product Candidates 
 We have two proprietary technology platforms focused on topical dermatology products: our Topical by DesignTM platform and our Topical Photoparticle TherapyTM platform. We are utilizing these technology platforms to build a pipeline of product candidates that we believe will address significant unmet needs in medical dermatology and aesthetics, as summarized in Figure 1 below:

  Topical by DesignTM Platform 
 Our proprietary Topical by DesignTM platform is designed to enable the topical application of potent active pharmaceuticals against known biologic targets while minimizing exposure to the systemic circulation. Applying this technology, we have created a pipeline of drug candidates with unique pharmacological profiles that are designed to be suitable for chronic administration. The principal innovation of the Topical by DesignTM technology is the linkage of a short polymer to a pharmacologically active compound, typically a small molecule, through a bridging unit, resulting in an NCE, as illustrated in Figure 2 below. 
 Figure 2. Creation of New Chemical Entities with the Topical by DesignTM Platform 
 

The active compound is selected based on the target or pathway of interest. For example, one of our lead product candidates, SNA-125, targets JAK3 which is a validated target in atopic dermatitis and psoriasis. In a single chemical transformation, a short polymer is covalently linked to the small molecule through a bridging unit. Both the polymer, a short PEG tail, and the bridging unit, define the pharmacology of the active compound and refine its target selectivity. Furthermore, the polymer changes the physicochemical characteristics of the new molecule. The Topical by DesignTM technology creates new molecules; it is not a drug-delivery system, nor does it create prodrugs. The drug candidates derived from the Topical by DesignTM technology are necessarily amphiphilic, soluble in both aqueous and lipid environments. This enables sufficient permeation into the skin, where the drug effect is desired, and achievement of high local drug concentrations with low systemic absorption. To the extent there is any systemic absorption, in our nonclinical studies, the drug candidates have demonstrated pharmacokinetics consistent with rapid clearance by the kidneys in minutes. We have not detected systemic exposure of SNA-120, another lead product candidate, at the limit of detection in our clinical studies to date. 
 Clinically, the advantageous physicochemical properties resulting in high resident drug concentration in the skin and low systemic exposure may allow for concentrated, local treatment of cutaneous inflammation and other dermatoses by efficiently addressing validated targets while maintaining a favorable safety profile. Further, these

   drug candidates, if successfully developed and approved, may be eligible for regulatory exclusivity as NCEs. Our primary focus is the development of drug candidates for dermatological conditions. However, we believe that our Topical by DesignTM technology may also address other therapeutic needs in inflammation and immunology where localized drug delivery that avoids systemic exposure is desirable, such as ophthalmological, gastrointestinal or pulmonary conditions. To the extent we believe applications beyond dermatology are viable, we may explore alternatives to monetize the potential for our Topical by DesignTM platform. 
 Our lead product candidates developed through the Topical by DesignTM technology platform are SNA-120 and SNA-125. 
 SNA-120 
 SNA-120 is designed to selectively inhibit TrkA, the high affinity receptor for nerve growth factor, or NGF, a known mediator of pruritus, or itch, and neurogenic inflammation associated with psoriasis. TrkA and NGF are recognized targets in psoriasis and are overexpressed in plaques. We believe that SNA-120 has the potential to treat pruritus associated with psoriasis, as well as improve the underlying psoriasis, while being suitable for chronic administration. SNA-120 has demonstrated statistically significant and clinically meaningful reductions in the pruritus associated with psoriasis, as well as favorable tolerability in psoriasis patients in a Phase 2b clinical trial. We initiated a second Phase 2b clinical trial in October 2017 in order to expand our understanding of SNA-120 in the treatment of pruritus and the underlying psoriasis and to provide additional endpoint evaluation and validation, with data expected in the first quarter of 2019. 
 Pruritus 
 Pruritus is a common and persistent symptom of many inflammatory skin diseases and is often described as one of the most distressing symptoms. The medical communitys awareness of the clinical significance of pruritus has grown in recent years as endpoints measuring the intensity of pruritus have demonstrated a strong impact on patients quality of life. Pruritus manifests itself in different ways in different diseases and may be driven by different mechanisms of action. As such, the FDA recommends that pruritus treatments be studied in the context of the specific disease for which they will be used, which in the case of SNA-120 is pruritus associated with psoriasis. 
Psoriasis and Associated Pruritus Market 
 Psoriasis vulgaris is a chronic inflammatory skin disease that affects approximately 2-3% of the global population. Psoriasis is characterized by thickened plaques of inflamed, itchy, red skin covered with thick, silvery scales typically found at the elbows, knees, trunk and scalp. Patients are generally categorized as mild, moderate or severe, with approximately 80-90% of patients having mild or moderate forms of the disease according to GlobalData. The disease ranges from a single, small, localized lesion in some patients to a severe generalized eruption with complete body coverage. It is a chronic, complex, multifactorial immune-mediated disease that requires long-term treatment. According to Kalorama Information, sales of drugs for the treatment of psoriasis globally were $4.8 billion in 2016 and expected to grow to $8.1 billion by 2020. Drug spend is driven largely by the recent introductions of new systemic biologic therapies, which can be highly effective in reducing the appearance of plaques, but are only prescribed for the roughly 10-20% of the psoriasis population with more severe disease. The majority of patients use at least one topical therapy and pricing for these topicals is approximately $500-800 per 60g tube, which generally represents a one-month supply of a single therapy for mild disease. 
 Pruritus is one of the most common chronic symptoms in psoriasis. In fact, the word psoriasis originates from the Greek word psora, which means to itch. Chronic itch poses specific problems and is a particularly relevant clinical and patient concern as resultant scratch can lead to the appearance of new plaques or the exacerbation of existing psoriatic plaques, a well described process known as the Koebner phenomenon. A

Index to Financial Statements
   National Psoriasis Foundation study of 17,488 patients found that pruritus was experienced by 79% of patients, making it the second most commonly reported symptom, after scaling (94%). In a clinical study we conducted of 160 psoriatic patients, 97.4% of patients had pruritus and 68.7% had at least moderate pruritus at baseline. 
 Previously there has been a lack of awareness of the substantial effect of pruritus on psoriatic patients quality of life, with dermatologists primarily focusing on improving the visible appearance of psoriasis. Because the itch of psoriasis has a burning quality to it, it may at times have been categorized as pain rather than itch, resulting in itch being under-appreciated. Increased attention in the literature has revealed pruritus to be as important to patients as the visible appearance. At a recent FDA public meeting to discuss patient-focused drug development for psoriasis, patients rated the symptom of itching as having the most significant impact on their daily lives, equal in importance to flaking and scaling. Psoriatic patients with pruritus have a significant decrease in Health Related Quality of Life, or HRQoL, compared to those without pruritus, with a significant correlation between Dermatology Life Quality Index scoring and pruritus intensity. In patients with moderate-to-severe psoriasis, improvement in pruritus has been reported to correlate with improvement in quality of life scores. 
 Limitations of Current Therapies 
 The typical psoriasis patient has moderately pruritic plaques covering less than 10% body surface area and is prescribed topical medication. The most common topicals are corticosteroids, Vitamin D derivatives, such as Dovonex, Vitamin A derivatives, such as Tazorac, and crude coal tar preparations. None of these topical therapies adequately treat the important and often neglected symptom of pruritus associated with psoriasis. There are no specific, chronic topical anti-pruritic therapies to treat the pruritus associated with psoriasis vulgaris that have been approved. Our research indicates that patients often seek relief from pruritus by using an array of topical products available over the counter, or OTC, and without prescription. However, OTC medications like antihistamines offer little relief for the itch associated with psoriasis. 
 Corticosteroids, as monotherapy or in combination with Vitamin D derivatives, are the most effective topicals for treating plaques and may modestly impact pruritus in some patients, but are limited to short-term use because of association with localized atrophy or thinning of the skin and the potential to systemically suppress the bodys ability to make normal amounts of endogenous corticosteroids. Non-steroidal topicals, such as Vitamin D derivatives, have moderate efficacy and can cause skin irritation with some patients reporting burning sensations associated with their use, potentially exacerbating pruritic symptoms. 
 Ultraviolet, or UV, light therapy is recommended for those patients who are not well managed with topical therapy and/or have more widespread and diffuse psoriatic plaque involvement. These treatments can be effective but require multiple visits to the doctors office each week and have been shown to increase patients risk of developing skin cancer. For patients with more severe psoriatic plaque involvement, those who do not respond to UV therapy or seeking more rapid onset of relief, systemic drugs may be prescribed. The most common oral treatments are the immunosuppressive drug methotrexate, cyclosporine, and the Vitamin A derivative acitretin. These treatments are associated with systemic side effects including liver toxicity, hypertension, renal impairment, and, in the case of acitretin, the risk of birth defects, and therefore require routine monitoring. More recently, the Phosphodiesterase-4, or PDE, inhibitor apremilast has been approved as a systemic therapy for moderate-to-severe psoriasis with good efficacy, however side effects including neutropenia and depression have been reported. Moreover, despite improvement in visible plaques, based on patient reports, these treatments may not be adequately effective in treating the pruritus associated with psoriasis. This is particularly relevant given that studies have found no correlation between visible psoriasis plaque severity and pruritus disease severity in patients. 
 For patients that have moderate psoriasis and do not respond to oral treatments or UV therapy, or for patients that have severe psoriasis, physicians prescribe injectable biologic treatments. A number of injectable or intravenous biologic drugs have been approved over the years, including Enbrel, Humira, Remicade, Stelara, 
 
10 


Index to Financial Statements
   Cosentyx and Taltz. Many of these drugs are monoclonal antibodies, a type of complex protein molecule. Some of these drugs act by inhibiting TNF-alpha, IL-17 or IL-12/IL-23. While these injectable biologic drugs can have exceptional efficacy in reducing the appearance of plaques, they may have potentially life-threatening side effects resulting from infection or cancer, especially when used as a chronic treatment. Furthermore, these drugs are very expensive, costing tens of thousands of dollars annually, and as such are reserved for the severe patient populations or those patients with extensive body surface area coverage that do not respond to other treatments. Despite significant reductions in the visible plaques of patients on injectable biologic drugs, some patients still have persistent pruritus. Figure 3 below illustrates the current paradigm for the treatment of psoriasis. 
Figure 3. Current Psoriasis Treatment Paradigm 
 

Our Solution: SNA-120 
 SNA-120 is our topical product candidate for the treatment of pruritus and psoriasis. We are studying SNA-120 in mild-to-moderate psoriasis patients with associated pruritus. In addition, we believe SNA-120 has the potential to treat residual pruritus in patients with moderate-to-severe psoriasis who utilize a combination of topical and systemic treatments. SNA-120 is designed to address pruritus associated with psoriasis as well as the underlying psoriasis and biology of the disease, and, if approved, would likely be the first prescription topical treatment indicated for pruritus associated with psoriasis.

  The target of SNA-120 is TrkA, the high affinity receptor for NGF. Binding of NGF to TrkA induces TrkA autophosphorylation and leads to the activation of transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily V member 1 (TRPV1) through phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase (PI3K) and protein kinase C (PKC). TRPV1 activation results in the transmission of pain, burning and itch sensation to the central nervous system by peripheral sensory nerves. Both NGF and TrkA are upregulated in the epidermis, the outer layer of the skin, of psoriasis patients. In psoriatic lesions specifically, NGF is overexpressed by keratinocytes and causes sustained activation of the TrkA-TRPV1 axis, contributing to neurogenic inflammation, nerve sensitization, neurite outgrowth and the clinical manifestation of burning/itching sensation in the skin. In pruritic patients, psoriatic skin is more heavily innervated in the superficial dermis and epidermis with cutaneous nerves expressing elevated levels of NGF and TrkA. 
 SNA-120 inhibits the intracellular kinase domain of TrkA, blocking downstream over-activation of TRPV1 and reducing the signaling of itch sensation by peripheral nerves. Persistent inhibition of TrkA also decreases upregulation and potentiation of TRPV1 activity, an important component of neurogenic inflammation in psoriasis. We believe that SNA-120 also has the potential to address the underlying pathophysiology of psoriatic lesion development in addition to its effect on itch. Figure 4 below illustrates the pathophysiology of psoriatic itch and the mechanism of action of SNA-120. 
 Figure 4. Pathophysiology of Psoriatic Itch and the Mechanism of Action of SNA-120 
 

SNA-120 Clinical Development 
 SNA-120 is being developed for the treatment of pruritus associated with mild-to-moderate psoriasis and we believe it also has the potential to concurrently improve the psoriatic plaques, including associated scaling, erythema, and induration. We initiated a second Phase 2b clinical trial in October 2017 in order to expand our understanding of SNA-120 in the treatment of pruritus and the underlying psoriasis and provide additional endpoint evaluation and validation, with data expected in the first quarter of 2019. An investigational new drug application, or IND, for SNA-120 was submitted to the FDA in July 2010 for evaluation in the treatment of mild-to-moderate psoriasis by Creabilis, which remains the IND sponsor. To date, seven sponsor-initiated clinical trials and one investigator-initiated trial have been completed, four in Phase 1 and four in Phase 2. SNA-120 has been administered to 36 healthy volunteers and 336 patients, for up to 12 weeks. In these trials, SNA-120 was observed to be well tolerated, with a favorable safety profile and no demonstrable systemic exposure at the specified detection limit used in the trial. Additionally, SNA-120 showed statistically significant improvements in pruritus associated with psoriasis and had a positive impact on psoriasis disease severity among pruritic subjects.

Clinical Development Plan 
 In our interactions with the FDA, the FDA has recognized pruritus due to psoriasis as a distinct indication. Based on these interactions, and prior to commencing our Phase 3 trials, we plan to conduct additional nonclinical chronic toxicity studies, additional manufacturing work and scale development and validation for endpoints in pivotal Phase 3 trials. 
 We initiated a second Phase 2b clinical trial in October 2017 in order to further inform the patient population, clinical endpoints, duration of treatment and dose for our anticipated Phase 3 trials. In this new Phase 2b trial we are evaluating SNA-120 efficacy, safety and tolerability in a refined target population, focusing on patients with at least moderate itch associated with mild-to-moderate psoriasis, exploring two doses across multiple endpoints for 12 weeks, validating the use of the 11-point itch Numeric Rating Scale, or I-NRS, for measuring pruritus severity, defining a clinically meaningful improvement in pruritus in the study population, and capturing more extensive patient and clinician reported data on the impact of pruritus and psoriasis on patient HRQoL. We expect to report topline data from this trial in the first quarter of 2019. 
 To gain approval of SNA-120, we must submit nonclinical, clinical and chemistry data that adequately demonstrate the safety, purity, potency, efficacy and compliant manufacturing of the product in a new drug application, or NDA, or other applicable regulatory filing. Nonclinical studies for SNA-120 required for NDA submission include safety pharmacology, pharmacokinetics/bioavailability and single/repeat-dose toxicity studies, including chronic studies of up to nine months duration, a two-year dermal carcinogenicity study, genotoxicity, local tolerance and relevant reproductive toxicity testing. 
 We must also submit two adequate and well-controlled Phase 3 clinical trials, of similar design, with statistically significant results to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of the drug. As with all topical drug products, satisfactory data on dermal safety and maximal use conditions with SNA-120 must be provided. SNA-120 is an NCE; thus, data from a cardiovascular safety study to measure the effect of the drug on the QT interval, or evidence supporting a waiver for this study, must be provided. SNA-120 is intended for long-term intermittent use; therefore, data from a long-term safety study must be submitted. 
 Prior to approval, the FDA will inspect the manufacturing facilities at which the product is produced to assess compliance with current good manufacturing practice, or cGMP, requirements and to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the drugs identity, strength, quality and purity. 
 Regulatory feedback obtained from two European medicines regulatory agencies, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), in the United Kingdom and the Medicines Evaluation Board (MEB), in the Netherlands, indicated that the pivotal Phase 3 trials could leverage the placebo-controlled design used in the completed Phase 2b trial, rather than using approved products as the comparator, given that there are currently no approved topical therapies for pruritus. Additional meetings with European medicines regulatory agencies are expected and will provide further guidance.

  Ongoing Phase 2b Trial 
 Concurrent with the toxicology studies required to initiate Phase 3 pivotal trials, we initiated a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, Phase 2b trial to evaluate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of SNA-120 in subjects with moderate pruritus associated with mild-to-moderate psoriasis vulgaris. The primary objectives of this study are to characterize the efficacy of SNA-120 at two doses, 0.05% and 0.5% w/w where w/w denotes the mass fraction, as compared to placebo when administered topically twice daily (BID) for the treatment of pruritus associated with psoriasis, as well as the underlying psoriasis itself. Pruritus severity will be assessed using the 11-point I-NRS where 10 corresponds to worst itch imaginable and 0 corresponds to no itch. Additionally, the patient administered 100 mm itch visual analog scale, or VAS, a continuous scale with 100 mm corresponding to the worst possible itch and 0 mm corresponding to no itch will be assessed for concordance with the I-NRS. Psoriasis disease severity will be measured using both the 5-point Investigators Global Assessment, or IGA, from 0 (none) to 4 (severe), as well as the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index, or PASI, which is a weighted sum of symptom scores for erythema, scaling and plaque thickness over different parts of the body. Scores for the PASI range from 0 (no disease) to 72 (maximal disease). 
 Further, this study is expected to: 
 

 | Establish the threshold for a clinically meaningful change on the I-NRS, in a pre-defined pruritic population with NRS ³ 5, in anticipation of the scale being utilized as the primary endpoint measurement in our pivotal Phase 3 trials;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Determine sample size required to power the Phase 3 trials; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------


 | Validate new patient-reported outcome, or PRO, measures that specifically assess:
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Impacts of psoriasis on self-perceptions (including self-perceived bother, embarrassment, self-consciousness, and attractiveness);
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Impact of itch on sleep;
--+-------------------------


 | Psoriasis signs and symptoms, such as bleeding, burning, flaking and pain; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Impact of pruritus and psoriasis on patient HRQoL.
--+---------------------------------------------------

 Following completion of this trial, we intend to hold an End-of-Phase 2, or EOP2, meeting with the FDA ahead of initiating our Phase 3 clinical program to further refine our clinical and nonclinical development plans for SNA-120. Following the EOP2 meeting, we plan to seek a special protocol assessment, or SPA, for our Phase 3 protocols. 
 Completed Phase 2b Trial 
 SNA-120 was evaluated in a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 2b clinical trial in 160 subjects that were 18 years of age and older with stable, mild-to-moderate psoriasis affecting up to 10% body surface area. The primary efficacy objective of this study was to characterize the efficacy of SNA-120 at three doses (0.05% w/w, 0.1% w/w and 0.5% w/w) as compared to placebo when administered topically twice daily (BID) for eight weeks for the treatment of psoriasis. There were three pre-specified efficacy measures: 

 | Overall management of psoriasis as measured by IGA (primary endpoint);
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Improvement of psoriasis severity as measured by mPASI (secondary endpoint); and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Improvement in the psoriatic pruritus subpopulation as measured by VAS (secondary endpoint)
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 No significant improvements in disease response rates were observed for SNA-120 as measured by IGA. However, after eight weeks, SNA-120 treatment groups achieved a mean reduction in disease severity as measured by mPASI between 37.1% and 42.8%, with one dose (0.05% w/w) reaching statistical significance (p=0.0180) as compared to vehicle control.

Index to Financial Statements
  The pre-specified pruritus secondary endpoint, specifically, the change from baseline in pruritus VAS score in subjects with at least moderate psoriasis-related pruritus at baseline, was included in the Phase 2b trial due to the understood role of the NGF-TrkA-TRPV1 axis in signaling itch through sensory nerves. Additionally, we believed that inclusion of this endpoint was important based on increasing evidence that the incidence and severity of chronic pruritus was substantially under-reported in psoriasis. 
 In the 108-subject subset, or 70.6 % of the full study population, reporting at least moderate pruritus (VAS ³40 mm) at baseline, a reduction in pruritus VAS was observed for all SNA-120 treatment groups, with statistical significance compared to vehicle control reached for the 0.05% (p=0.0067) and 0.5% (p=0.0124) dose groups at week 8 (secondary endpoint). The mean changes in baseline VAS for the 0.05%, 0.1%, and 0.5% doses at week 8 were -37.1mm, -31.5 mm, and -36.4 mm, respectively, compared with vehicle at -16.1 mm. Figure 5 below sets forth the mean reductions from baseline VAS in all SNA-120 treatment groups in the completed Phase 2b trial. 
 For purposes of the presentation of the statistical results, a p-value is a measure of statistical significance of the observed results, or the probability that the observed results was achieved purely by chance. By convention, a p-value of 0.05 or lower is commonly considered statistically significant (e.g., a p-value of <0.05 means that there is a 5% chance that the observed result was purely due to chance). The FDA utilizes the reported statistical measures when evaluating the results of a clinical trial, including statistical significance as measured by p-value as an evidentiary standard of efficacy, to evaluate the reported evidence of a drug products safety and efficacy.

The Phase 2b trial also resulted in the following findings: 
 

 | SNA-120 treated subjects with at least moderate baseline pruritus experienced 43-59% reduction in itch severity from baseline to week eight;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 | 62-69% of SNA-120 treated subjects in the pruritic population had mild or no pruritus by end of treatment as measured by VAS compared with 41% of subjects treated with vehicle; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | 46-62% of SNA-120 treated subjects had at least a 50% reduction in VAS from baseline at week eight compared to 32% of subjects on vehicle.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Post-Hoc Analysis of Psoriasis Disease Severity in Phase 2b Trial 
 We also conducted a post-hoc analysis of psoriasis disease severity among subjects reporting at least moderate pruritus (VAS ³40 mm) at baseline. This analysis revealed that at week 8, all SNA-120 treatment groups experienced greater mean reductions in total mPASI scores than the vehicle group. Statistical significance was reached for the 0.05% (p<0.001) and 0.5% (p<0.02) dose groups. Subjects treated with SNA-120 experienced about a 40% reduction in baseline disease severity, as measured by mPASI, compared to a 17% reduction for vehicle treated subjects. In conjunction with the effect on pruritus in this population, we believe these data suggest that SNA-120 improves both pruritus and the underlying psoriasis. Improvement in psoriasis may reflect the anti-proliferative effects of TrkA inhibition by SNA-120 on keratinocyte proliferation. It also may be a consequence of inhibiting pruritus, by blocking of NGF-TrkA-TRPV1 signaling in sensory neurons, and breaking the itch-scratch cycle. Figure 6 below sets forth the mean reductions from baseline mPASI total score in all SNA-120 treatment groups in the completed Phase 2b trial. 
 Figure 6. Impact of SNA-120 on mPASI Total Score Compared to Vehicle in Subgroup with Baseline Pruritus VAS ³40 mm (N=108) 
 

To explore a potential dose range, the doses selected for the Phase 2b trial of 0.5% and 0.05% w/w were above and below the dose studied in a previously completed Phase 2a trial (0.1% w/w). The Phase 2b trial was not powered to detect differences in doses and the results demonstrated no significant difference or obvious trends in efficacy between the three doses in assessments of either psoriasis disease severity or pruritus severity.

Index to Financial Statements
   This finding of no dose response may indicate that our selected dose range is approaching the top of the dose-response curve. Nonclinical work undertaken in parallel with the trial provided some rationale for this conclusion. At the lowest concentration of 0.05%, SNA-120 reached levels in the skin that elicited greater than 90% inhibition of the target kinase. 
 In our Phase 2b trial, SNA-120 exhibited a favorable safety profile. Specifically, we observed the following: 
 

 | Low incidence of adverse events, or AEs, which were characterized as mostly mild or moderate;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | No SNA-120 was detected in blood samples down to a detection limit of 2.5ng/ml; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | No drug-related application site AEs were observed.
--+----------------------------------------------------

 In the safety population of 160 subjects, 73 experienced treatment emergent AEs, or TEAEs. TEAEs occurred in 33-55% of subjects in the SNA-120 group and 53% of subjects in the vehicle group. The most frequently reported AEs were pruritus, headache, nasopharyngitis and diarrhea. Figure 7 below sets forth the incidence and types of adverse events experienced by subjects in the completed Phase 2b trial.

a Counting is by subject, not event. 
 Pruritus was reported as an AE in nine (7.5%) SNA-120 subjects and six (15%) vehicle subjects. Five (12.5%) study subjects withdrew due to this AE in the vehicle arm as compared to the withdrawal of three (2.5%) subjects in the SNA-120 arm. There were no drug-related serious AEs, or SAEs. 
 Summary of Phase 2b safety profile for SNA-120 
 The findings for SNA-120 in the completed Phase 2b trial are consistent with data from prior SNA-120 clinical studies. To date, 36 healthy volunteers and 336 patients have received SNA-120 for up to 12 weeks. SNA-120 has been shown to be well-tolerated at concentrations up to 0.5% (w/w) for up to eight weeks twice daily (BID) and 12 weeks once daily (QD) application. To date, no clinically significant changes in safety laboratory tests, physical examination, vital signs or 12-lead ECG have been observed. 
 Six SAEs were reported in these prior trials, none of which was considered drug related. Reported AEs were mostly mild or moderate in severity. The most common AEs reported across the seven prior trials were pruritus, eczema, headache, nasopharyngitis and application-site pruritus. The frequency of events does not appear to be dose dependent. Figure 8 below sets forth the incidences and types of treatment emergent adverse events from SNA-120 sponsor-initiated studies.

 Human plasma from over 340 patients treated with SNA-120 has been analyzed for concentrations of SNA-120, its putative metabolite (the amide of SNA-120) and K252a, the unconjugated parent compound of SNA-120. None of the samples analyzed have been found to have plasma levels above the lower level of quantification for SNA-120, amide of SNA-120 or K252a, following single and multiple administrations. These clinical data are generally consistent with nonclinical in vivo experiments detecting very limited levels of SNA-120 or its derivatives in plasma following epicutaneous administration. SNA-120 is rapidly cleared following intravenous delivery. The pharmacokinetic profile reveals a volume of distribution similar to blood volume, meaning once in the blood it does not appear to be distributed out of the blood and into tissues readily. Because the drug remains in the systemic circulation once there, and its molecular size is below the threshold limit for glomerular filtration, it is rapidly cleared by the renal system. Following intravenous administration, the half-life for SNA-120 is only 10 minutes. Taken together, this evidence supports our belief that drug candidates produced from the Topical by DesignTM platform demonstrate low systemic exposure. 
 Other Planned Studies 
 We intend to conduct additional studies to support the clinical development and regulatory submission package. In addition to ongoing maximal use pharmacokinetic studies to confirm the low systemic exposure of SNA-120, these studies may include two Phase 3 pivotal trials to demonstrate safety and efficacy, dermal safety studies, a drug-drug interaction study, a concomitant use study with a topical reference drug, studies in the pediatric population, a thorough QT study and a long-term safety study. 
Market Opportunity for SNA-120 
 There are currently no approved prescription products indicated for treatment of pruritus associated with psoriasis, and, if approved, SNA-120 would likely be the first targeted topical pruritus treatment available to patients by prescription. Reduced itching is the primary benefit sought by psoriatic patients, on par with reduced 
 
18 


Index to Financial Statements
   flaking and scaling, when considering new treatments according to a recent FDA patient panel. Additionally, although we have not yet conducted any head-to-head clinical studies of SNA-120 compared to other non-steroidal topical drugs intended for chronic use, such as Vitamin D analogues, we have seen SNA-120s improvement in the visible appearance of psoriasis in our clinical studies to date at a level consistent with third party studies of those other non-steroidal topicals. Based on these factors, we believe that physicians could prescribe SNA-120 as a first-line treatment for pruritus associated with psoriasis, thereby helping patients avoid the prolonged use of topical corticosteroids. 
 We anticipate that SNA-120, if approved, would be marketed to dermatologists with a strong focus on medical conditions. In the United States, there are approximately 7.9 million psoriasis patients, of which approximately 80% have pruritus. We estimate that approximately 1.7 million patients will visit their dermatologists to seek treatment for their chronic pruritus annually. Of particular focus for SNA-120 are the majority of patients who seek chronic management of the signs and symptoms of disease while avoiding the use of corticosteroids or systemic therapy. 
 If approved, we expect SNA-120 to be priced in line with branded topical medications for psoriasis including Taclonex, Dovenex, and Tazorac. Branded topical pricing is well established and payors are supportive of cost-effective therapies that can address patient needs without having to resort to expensive biologics. We expect patients would require about 100g of topical product per month assuming a twice daily application on 7% body surface area, the average body surface area for patients in our previous Phase 2b trial. 
 Over time, there could be an opportunity to expand the addressable opportunity for SNA-120 by broadening the label to other pruritus indications and/or populations including prurigo nodularis and pruritus in the elderly population, where NGF is thought to play a role. Other opportunities could include developing additional formulations for intensely pruritic areas such as the scalp. Finally, we could expand the opportunity through a sales force targeting physicians beyond dermatology, such as primary care, likely through partnerships. 
 SNA-125 
 Our second lead product candidate derived from our Topical by DesignTM platform is SNA-125. It is a dual kinase inhibitor (JAK3/TrkA) in clinical development for the treatment of atopic dermatitis, psoriasis, and pruritus. SNA-125 represents a novel approach to the treatment of inflammatory skin diseases and associated pruritus through a validated pathway, JAK3, that is well understood in this disease setting. SNA-125 also inhibits TrkA at a higher level of potency than SNA-120. JAK3 is required for immune cell development, and published literature supports that inhibition of JAK3 blocks the signaling of key cytokines, such as IL-2, IL-4 and IL-15, in T cells and NK cells, and results in a reduction in the severity of autoimmune and inflammatory diseases in which those cytokines play a pivotal role. In an in vitro profiling study on human cells, SNA-125 was observed to decrease the release of key pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL17A, IL-17F and IL-2, as well as TNF-α. In a nonclinical study, we have observed anti-inflammatory effects of SNA-125 consistent with inhibition of JAK3, including the reduction of immune cell infiltration in a rabbit scar model. Figure 9 below shows the JAK3 signaling pathway and the point of SNA-125 inhibitory action. 
 
19 


Index to Financial Statements
  Figure 9. Inhibitory Action of SNA-125 on JAK3 Pathway 
 

There is clinical evidence to support the role of topical JAK3 inhibitors, such as tofacitinib, for the treatment of atopic dermatitis and/or psoriasis. In a randomized, double-blind, prospective, vehicle-controlled Phase 2 study of 69 subjects with atopic dermatitis conducted by Pfizer, topical tofacitinib demonstrated clinical efficacy with patients experiencing a mean 82% reduction in their Eczema Area Severity Index total score, compared with a 30% decrease in vehicle-treated controls after 4 weeks treatment. In a randomized, double-blind, prospective, vehicle-controlled Phase 2b trial of 435 subjects with mild-to-moderate plaque psoriasis, topical tofacitinib (2%, BID) demonstrated significant efficacy compared with control treatment whereby 22.5% of subjects achieved clear or almost clear and ³2 grade improvement on the Calculated Physicians Global Assessment at week 8. The study also demonstrated rapid and significant improvement in pruritus severity for tofacitinib compared with control. The clinical benefit of JAK inhibition, combined with SNA-125s higher potency on TrkA, may confer a greater effect on psoriasis disease endpoints in addition to pruritus and result in an improved profile in this indication. We believe the potential systemic safety issues that limit the use of tofacitinib and other JAK inhibitor compounds in topical administration, can be overcome with SNA-125 through our Topical by DesignTM technology that confers low systemic exposure. As a result, we believe SNA-125 has the potential to provide substantial improvements over currently approved topical therapies for atopic dermatitis, psoriasis and associated pruritus, including improved efficacy, by targeting both conventional and neurogenic inflammatory pathways, targeting pruritus, and providing better local tolerability and minimal systemic exposure. Further, because of the minimal to no systemic exposure, we believe that SNA-125 has the potential to be better suited for chronic administration than other topical JAK3 inhibitors, such as topical tofacitinib. 
 Overview of atopic dermatitis 
 Atopic dermatitis is an inflammatory skin disease involving an abnormal skin barrier and disruption in the skins ability to insulate the body from exposure to external stimuli. It is a disease of unknown origin that usually starts in early infancy and is typified by pruritus, eczematous lesions, xerosis (dry skin), and lichenification of the skin (thickening of the skin and increase in skin markings). Atopic dermatitis is also referred to as eczema and 
 
20 


Index to Financial Statements
   atopic eczema. Atopic dermatitis is associated with other atopic diseases, for example, asthma, allergic rhinitis, urticaria, acute allergic reactions to foods and increased immunoglobulin E production, in many patients. The American Academy of Dermatology estimates that up to 25% of children suffer from atopic dermatitis. Safety concerns with steroids are very high in this population and parents of affected children are highly focused on minimizing short- and long-term side effects from steroid use. Generally, the disease burden of atopic dermatitis decreases as patients age, leaving 2-3% of adults suffering from atopic dermatitis. As of 2016, the prevalence of atopic dermatitis is estimated at 16 million in the United States. Approximately 75% of atopic dermatitis patients have mild-to-moderate disease according to GlobalData. 
 There is an unmet need for new therapies for atopic dermatitis, as there are few safe and effective non-steroidal options suitable for chronic use. Topical corticosteroids are the predominant therapies used for mild-to-moderate atopic dermatitis, which is also treated with other topical immunomodulators such as calcineurin inhibitors. The treatment paradigm begins with education on proper skin care including the use of mild soaps and moisturizing lotions (emollients) and the elimination of any potential allergen triggers. Topical steroids are used next, and research indicates that these work well for a large proportion of atopic dermatitis patients; however, current topical medications have local and systemic safety risks. Side effects associated with topical corticosteroid use include local application-site reactions, such as atrophy or thinning of the skin. Because of the abnormal skin barrier and systemic absorption of steroids, there are concomitant systemic side effect risks such as diabetes, weight gain, hirsutism and the potential to systemically suppress the bodys ability to make normal amounts of endogenous corticosteroids, which can lead to reduced or delayed growth in adolescents. Chronic inadvertent exposure of the eye to topical steroids may also result in glaucoma or cataracts. Non-steroidal topical therapies used in the treatment of atopic dermatitis include the topical calcineurin inhibitors Elidel and Protopic, but these have boxed warnings for side effects that limit their use. 
 Patients who do not achieve sustained alleviation of symptoms with topical treatments are prescribed systemic steroids or other systemic immunosuppressive agents such as cyclosporine, a calcineurin inhibitor. While these are effective as temporary treatments of flare-ups, extended use has been associated with many potential side effects or adverse events. In fact, it is generally recommended that patients have no more than two rounds of systemic steroid treatment per year. Prednisone is an option; however, its long-term side effects make it unsuitable for chronic use and following discontinuation severe exacerbations of atopic dermatitis symptoms can occur. Cyclosporine is also not suitable for long-term use as it has been associated with renal toxicity, hirsutism, nausea, and lymphoma, and patients must discontinue use after one year. Furthermore, cyclosporine may not be used in patients with high blood pressure due to an increased risk of hypertension, which precludes its use in a large proportion of older patients. With a lack of safe and effective options, many patients with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis have serious, life-long consequences. Scarring may occur, and there is an elevated risk of depression and suicide. 
 In March 2017, the FDA approved Dupixent (dupilumab), an IL-4R antagonist biologic for the treatment of moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis. Just as with psoriasis, Dupixent and other biologics in development have the potential to improve the treatment of atopic dermatitis for the more severe population, but we believe the safety profile of these drugs will limit their use in the larger population with mild-to-moderate disease and in children and adolescents. In December 2016, the FDA approved Eucrisa (crisaborole) as a topical treatment for mild-to-moderate atopic dermatitis. Eucrisa is a PDE4 inhibitor and acts on TNF-alpha, IFN-gamma, IL-12, IL-23 and other cytokines. It was studied in multiple clinical trials in atopic dermatitis and demonstrated adequate efficacy and a favorable safety profile. We expect that the global market for prescription atopic dermatitis drugs will grow significantly from its 2014 level of $3.6 billion driven by these recent approvals. 
 Market Opportunity for SNA-125 
 We believe SNA-125 has the potential to be suitable for the chronic topical treatment of atopic dermatitis due to its dual mechanism of action (JAK3/TrkA) and the expectation of low systemic exposure seen in clinical studies to date utilizing our Topical by DesignTM technology. If approved for atopic dermatitis with a profile on 
 
21 


Index to Financial Statements
   par with Eucrisa, we believe there is a significant market opportunity for SNA-125. If SNA-125 is able to demonstrate better efficacy than Eucrisa while maintaining a strong safety profile, we estimate that SNA-125 could capture a significantly larger share than Eucrisa, exceeding the current market expectations for that drug. 
 We also believe SNA-125 has the potential to be suitable for the chronic topical treatment of psoriasis and pruritus. If SNA-125 is approved with a primary indication in psoriasis in addition to pruritus, we believe that many physicians would prescribe SNA-125 as a first-line treatment for mild-to-moderate psoriasis patients. This profile would reinforce the importance of SNA-125 as an agent to help patients avoid the prolonged use of topical corticosteroids, as well as to delay the time before a patient is moved on to more costly and risky systemic therapy, or prevent the need for such patients to be moved onto systemic therapy altogether. Based on this profile, we believe that SNA-125 would achieve higher market penetration than SNA-120, if both are approved. 
 If approved, we anticipate that SNA-125 is likely to be priced in line with other branded topical medications like Eucrisa for atopic dermatitis and Taclonex, Dovenex and Tazorac for psoriasis. Branded topical pricing is well established and payors are supportive of cost-effective therapies that can address patient needs without having to resort to expensive biologics. 
 Clinical Development 
 We initiated our first-in-human studies in psoriasis and atopic dermatitis outside the United States pursuant to Clinical Trial Applications in Germany and Canada. Subsequently we intend to file an IND for SNA-125 to support the first U.S. clinical study. In our psoriasis proof-of-concept study, we are using the modified microplaque assay model, a validated, randomized, double-blinded, intra-individual comparison, to gain early clinical insight into the safety, tolerability and efficacy of SNA-125 as a topical treatment for psoriasis. For our proof-of-concept study in atopic dermatitis, we are utilizing the validated bilateral lesion assay, a randomized, double-blinded, intra-individual comparison, to assess multiple concentrations and formulations and to provide a clinical and molecular assessment of change compared to untreated or control lesions. If these trials are successful, we plan to pursue further clinical development in one or both of these indications. 
Nonclinical Development 
 We have conducted numerous in vitro and in vivo nonclinical studies to evaluate the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and toxicology of SNA-125. Our studies have shown strong inhibitory activity against JAK3 and TrkA, key drug targets involved in inflammatory diseases. Importantly, in nonclinical studies, SNA-125 was shown to have a favorable safety profile and minimal systemic exposure, potentially supporting its chronic topical administration. Additional profiling of SNA-125s activity demonstrated anti-proliferative activity, anti-inflammatory activity and inhibition of neuronal signaling of itch in multiple nonclinical experiments, in the absence of toxicity. 
 We studied single dose topical administration of SNA-125 in rats and minipigs to demonstrate low systemic exposure and absorption. The results have shown that no or negligible amounts of SNA-125 are systemically absorbed through the dermal route. In repeat dose toxicology studies with topical administration, we again observed no systemic absorption or clinical signs of toxicity in ophthalmic, haematological and clinical chemistry examinations. To further understand the metabolism of SNA-125, we conducted pharmacokinetics studies in rodent and non-rodent species using intravenous administration. These studies demonstrated rapid system elimination, with an estimated half-life of approximately 25 minutes. 
 Single and repeat dose dermal studies showed no evidence of clinical or behavioral toxicity, noteworthy histological or immunohistochemical findings, or systemic absorption. After repeated IV administration, no treatment-related mortality was observed, and mid-to-high dose tissue inflammation completely resolved.

  Early-stage Pipeline 
 In addition to SNA-120 and SNA-125, we have developed additional NCEs which have shown favorable data in early nonclinical studies. If we continue to observe positive data indicating potential efficacy, we intend to advance these assets into preclinical and clinical development. While our primary focus is the development of drug candidates for dermatological conditions, there are several therapeutic areas for which we believe we can develop novel targeted drug candidates with minimal systemic exposure, by formulating therapeutics for topical delivery through other surfaces such as the eye, the gastrointestinal tract, or the respiratory tract. Over time, we intend to advance additional compounds from our Topical by DesignTM technology platform into clinical development. 
 Topical Photoparticle TherapyTM
Our Topical Photoparticle TherapyTM technology uses precisely engineered silver particles to absorb near infrared, or IR, laser light. This mechanism of action has the potential to address one of the key structures implicated in the pathogenesis of acne vulgaris, sebaceous glands, as well as unwanted hair, which in case of light or mixed pigmentation cannot be removed with lasers alone. SNA-001 is a ready-to-use topical suspension of ultra-efficient, near-infrared light absorbing silver particles. The particles are silica coated, nanoscale plates that are tuned, through variance of particle dimensions in manufacturing, to wavelengths of most of the currently installed base of dermatologic lasers, including 755 nm, 810 nm, and 1064 nm. SNA-001 is applied to the skin using mechanical vibration to drive the silver particles into the pilosebaceous unit, or PSU. When illuminated by laser light, the particles exhibit plasmonic resonance, whereby surface electrons oscillate at the frequency of the incident light and emit heat locally. The particles convert laser light energy into heat, facilitating local tissue injury through a process called selective photothermolysis. This effect is designed to cause injury to the sebaceous gland and hair follicle without damaging the adjacent skin, and therefore has the potential to be utilized for the topical treatment of acne and unwanted hair. SNA-001s mechanism of action causes it to be regulated as a medical device; it is regulated as a 510(k) medical device by the FDA, and we expect to pursue clearance of one or more premarket notifications pursuant to Section 510(k) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, for SNA-001. Figure 10 below illustrates the process of selective photothermolysis of the sebaceous gland and hair follicle caused by SNA-001.

  SNA-001 for the treatment of acne 
 The market for acne 
 Acne vulgaris is a common skin disease, especially among adolescents and young adults, and often is associated with physical and psychological morbidity. In the United States, acne is the most common skin disease, estimated by the American Academy of Dermatology to affect up to 50 million Americans annually. In 2016, acne accounted for approximately $2.8 billion of global pharmaceutical sales according to Global Data, and the non-prescription market for acne products is also large, reflecting a strong willingness of consumers to pay out-of-pocket. The disease ranges in severity from mild-to-severe cystic acne vulgaris and can result in permanent scarring, anxiety, depression and poor self-esteem. Even in cases of mild acne vulgaris, the social stigma associated with the disease often coincides with significant emotional distress and other psychological issues. Due to the frequency of recurrence or relapse and necessary treatment over a prolonged number of years, the American Academy of Dermatology considers acne vulgaris to be a chronic inflammatory disease. 
 Acne vulgaris results from the complex interplay of four major pathogenic factors: 
 

 | overproduction of oils, or sebum, by the sebaceous gland;
--+----------------------------------------------------------


 | abnormal keratinization in the follicle, narrowing the pores and obstructing the PSU;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | colonization by the anaerobic, lipophilic bacterium Propionibacterium acnes, or P. acnes; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | release of pro-inflammatory mediators into the skin.
--+-----------------------------------------------------

 Limitations of current treatment options and our solution 
 The typical acne patient has moderate severity acne on the face and is prescribed topical medications for treatment. Current topical treatment options are limited with respect to effectiveness, patient compliance, and potential side effects. Topical retinoids, such as tretinoin, adapalene and tazarotene, target the abnormal proliferation of cells to stop the narrowing of the follicle and also inhibit the pro-inflammatory cascade that initiates lesion formation. Retinoids often show efficacy over prolonged treatment durations, but can lead to undesirable dryness, irritation and scaling. These undesirable effects contribute to a lack of patient compliance with daily use, further impairing efficacy. In non-facial acne, patients are often treated with systemic therapies due to greater severity and the inconvenience of applying topical therapies. 
 Patients that fail topical therapy have the potential to go on systemic therapy including oral antibiotics, isotretinoin and hormone therapy, but patient, parent, and physician concern about unwanted side effects remains high. Oral antibiotics are associated with systemic side effects, including gastrointestinal tract irritation, photosensitivity of skin, headache, dizziness, anemia, bone and joint pain, and nausea. Furthermore, widespread use and extended treatment periods of antibiotics for over 30 years has led to the emergence of the antibiotic resistance of P. acnes and, in turn, the virtual discontinuation of some drugs such as erythromycin from clinical use. Recent attention from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the World Health Organization on the use of antibiotics and microbial resistance highlights the increasing need to curtail the overuse of antibiotics. 
 The oral retinoid isotretinoin, also known as Accutane, is the only approved drug shown to target the sebaceous gland, shrinking the size of the gland and significantly reducing sebum outflow. Notwithstanding its strong efficacy profile, use of isotretinoin is limited by its severe side effect profile, given that the drug is a known teratogen that can cause birth defects and may be associated with depression, psychosis and, in rare instances, suicide. Common side effects include dry skin, muscle aches, joint pains, and liver enzyme elevations. Therefore, its use has been reserved for the most severe form of the disease, and in 2009, the manufacturer of Accutane withdrew the branded product from the market. The method of action of isotretinoin and its high effectiveness has provided useful insights into the sebaceous gland as a key target, as it is the only drug with long-term maintenance of treatment effect after patients stop taking the drug. Figure 11 below illustrates the current paradigm for the treatment of acne.

  Figure 11. Current Acne Treatment Paradigm 
 

Procedural solutions have the potential to solve issues of patient compliance and provide safer alternatives to systemic therapy, as well as to supplement the efficacy of other ongoing therapies, but physicians are often dissatisfied with the outcomes from current treatments including laser or light-based treatments. Systematic reviews of the published evidence have revealed limitations with many relevant studies, such as the lack of appropriate controls or short duration of post-treatment follow-up, preventing firm conclusions about efficacy and safety. Nonetheless, some individual studies have shown reductions in lesion counts and acne severity using such technologies. Laser therapy often requires high energy intensities (50-150 J/cm2) to sufficiently damage sebaceous glands which can cause off-target side effects including sensitivity to light, pain, inflammation, hyper/hypopigmentation, and permanent scarring. 
 We believe the use of topical SNA-001 in combination with laser may increase the efficiency of selective photothermolysis of the sebaceous gland, which only isotretinoin can currently target, leading to reduced local sebum production and fewer inflammatory lesions as well as improved local tolerability, while sparing patients from systemic drugs or ongoing application of ineffective topical treatments. 
 Clinical Development Program 
 Pivotal studies
We met with the FDA to discuss our plans to develop SNA-001 for the treatment of acne. We incorporated the FDAs feedback regarding the design of our pivotal trials and confirmed that the applicable pathway to market for SNA-001 is via the 510(k) clearance process. 
 We are currently conducting multicenter, randomized, double-blind, split-face studies to evaluate SNA-001 in conjunction with laser for the treatment of moderate or severe facial acne. The split-face design means that each subject receives SNA-001 on one side of the face and vehicle, or sham control, on the other side of the face, 
 
25 


Index to Financial Statements
   and both sides of the face are treated with laser. The primary endpoint is the percentage change in inflammatory lesion counts from baseline to 12 weeks after the last of three weekly treatments. Three separate clinical trials, using nearly identical protocols but different laser wavelengths corresponding to three commonly used commercial lasers, 755 nm, 810 nm and 1064 nm, are each enrolling approximately 80 subjects. 
 Following these pivotal studies, patients will have the opportunity to participate in an additional 12-week follow-up study to evaluate the safety, effectiveness, and maintenance of the effect of SNA-001 used in conjunction with laser for the treatment of acne vulgaris. 
 Clinical feasibility studies 
 A prospective, evaluator-blinded, within subject controlled study of SNA-001 plus laser in subjects with back acne was undertaken using a split back design, where each subject receives active treatment on one side of the back and control treatment on the other. Subjects 18 years of age or older seeking laser treatment for moderate-to-severe back acne were eligible for this single center study. SNA-001 was applied topically to a defined area of the back, massaged into the skin using a mechanical vibration device, and excess suspension was wiped off the skin surface. The SNA-001 treatment area and a control area were treated with one to two passes of 810 nm diode laser at low or high peak power for four, once-weekly sessions. The primary endpoint was assessment of acne lesion count 12 weeks after the last treatment. AEs and expected local side effects, also known as local tolerabilities, including erythema and perifollicular edema, were assessed during treatment and follow-up. Pain occurring at the time of laser treatment was assessed using VAS. 
 An interim analysis was completed on 11 enrolled subjects (safety population), 10 of whom completed at least one follow-up visit (intent-to-treat, or ITT, population). At 12 weeks after the last treatment, there was a statistically significant reduction in mean total lesion count, or TLC, in both treatment areas (SNA-001 reduction of 60% (p <0.001) and control reduction of 59% (p = 0.003)); the difference between SNA-001 and control treatment was not statistically significant. Similar results were observed for inflammatory lesion count, or ILC. At 12 weeks after the last treatment, there was a statistically significant reduction in mean ILCs in both treatment areas (SNA-001 reduction of 61% (p=0.015) and control reduction of 62% (p=0.018). Figure 12 below sets forth the changes in total and inflammatory lesion counts with SNA-001 as compared to control in this interim analysis.

  To understand the impact of high peak power on lesion counts, a subgroup of six subjects was analyzed that received at least one of four treatments with high power laser settings. In this subgroup, statistically significant reductions in both total and inflammatory lesion counts were observed for SNA-001 (reduction of 73% (p=0.004) for TLC and reduction of 76% (p=0.003) for ILC), but not for control (not statistically significant). Mean TLC and ILC at 12 weeks were lower for SNA-001 compared with control, but the differences were not statistically significant. Figure 13 below sets forth the changes in total and inflammatory lesion counts with SNA-001 as compared to control in the analysis of this high-power subgroup of six patients.

Safety and tolerability results 
 Based on the interim analysis, no treatment-related AEs were reported, and no subjects discontinued the study due to an AE. One SAE of a staphylococcal infection of the left cheek was reported, but it was determined to be unrelated to treatment. Expected local tolerabilities occurred more often with SNA-001 than control. All cases were transient and resolved by 12 weeks after last treatment. Scarring events occurring with SNA-001 were associated with punch biopsies conducted during the study and were not associated with acne lesions or laser treatment. Figure 14 below sets forth the occurrence of expected local tolerabilities in this interim analysis of SNA-001.

  Subject ratings of pain using a VAS scale from 0 (no pain) to 10 (severe pain) demonstrated that across the four treatments, pain was mild-to-moderate in severity and was higher (mean [standard deviation]) in the SNA-001 treatment area (4.3 [1.5]) compared with the control area (2.8 [1.5]). Procedural pain at the mild-to-moderate level (2 to 4 on VAS scale) is easily managed by standard of care strategies, including the use of ice, oral analgesics and topical anesthetics. 
 Market opportunity for SNA-001 for acne 
 We anticipate that SNA-001 would be marketed to dermatologists with a strong focus on medical and aesthetic conditions. According to primary market research by the company with over 400 dermatologist respondents through multiple surveys, 64-82% of practices have laser/light technology installed and could be target customers for SNA-001. Of the approximately 10,000 dermatologists in the United States, 2,900 focus on acne, have laser technology installed, and have an estimated 6.5 million acne patients visits annually, representing approximately 3.0 million acne patients. We believe that physicians would be most likely to offer SNA-001 to patients that initially fail topical therapy as an alternative to systemic treatment, though non-facial acne such as back acne is often treated first line with systemic agents, and SNA-001 could be first line for non-facial acne. Physicians indicate that half of acne patients, or 1.5 million patients annually, do not achieve clearance within three months of initial therapy, representing a 4.5 million total potential procedure opportunity for SNA-001. Of particular focus for SNA-001 are the 39% of acne patients that are young adults or adults, typically female, and may already be consumers of other procedural solutions in the dermatologists office. 
 Despite the availability of reimbursed therapies, we expect that a large number of patients would be willing to pay for procedural solutions like SNA-001 which has a favorable safety and strong efficacy profile, making it a highly attractive solution. Procedural solutions are also attractive to health care practitioners, or HCPs, because they receive a portion of the economic value based on their participation in administering the solution. SNA-001 plus laser procedures are likely to be priced in line with other similar procedural cash-pay solutions. Pricing to the patient for procedural cash-pay solutions such as fillers, toxins, photodynamic therapy (Levulan) or cryolipolysis (CoolSculpting) ranges from approximately $350-2,500 per procedure. 
 We believe there is potential to expand the medical applications of SNA-001 beyond acne to patients suffering from rosacea, sebaceous gland hyperplasia and keratosis pilaris, particularly to patients that prefer a procedural solution to their skin problems, including patients that are not suitable for systemic therapies, that have experienced side effects on other therapies, or that seek a limited procedural solution as compared to a daily regimen. 
 SNA-001 for the reduction of light-pigmented hair 
 The market for hair reduction 
 A variety of options for temporary or permanent hair removal are available including shaving, plucking, clipping, waxing, threading, depilatory creams and foams, rotary epilation, electrolysis, and laser. Each of these options is limited by either inconvenience, temporary effectiveness, pain or the potential for adverse events associated with their use. The exception is the use of lasers to reduce the size and number of dark-pigmented hairs. 
 Laser hair removal is the highest volume aesthetic procedure performed globally. Laser-based hair removal solutions address consumer concerns about the lack of durability of alternative hair removal products and provide a permanent hair removal option. In 2016, consumers purchased over one million hair removal procedures using laser or pulsed light in the United States from dermatologists and plastic surgeons according to ASAPS 2016 Survey and as many as 11 million procedures from other HCPs in medispas and laser centers according to Medical Insights 2014 Survey.

  Limitations of current treatment options and our solution 
 Notwithstanding its widespread appeal, laser hair removal is largely ineffective for a large portion of the population that has light-pigmented hair and mix-pigmented hair. Multiple treatments, often six or more, are insufficient to achieve a therapeutic result in patients with light-pigmented hair. As a result, patients are often turned away by health care practitioners if their hair color is too lightly pigmented. Furthermore, a portion of patients who are treated see insufficient benefit due to light hair or a mixture of dark and light hair types. 
 Use of SNA-001 in combination with laser light has the potential to provide a differentiated and non-systemic treatment solution to help deliver light-absorbing silver particles to hair follicles. For dark hair, the sufficient pigment is present in the hair shaft and absorbs laser light, heating the hair-producing follicular cells and causing thermal injury to the follicle. For light-pigmented hair, there is insufficient pigment to result in thermal injury to the follicle from laser treatment. Photoparticle therapy with SNA-001 mediates selective photothermolysis of the hair follicle regardless of the amount of pigment. 
 Clinical Development Program 
 Pivotal studies 
 We met with the FDA to discuss our plans to develop SNA-001 for light-pigmented hair reduction. We incorporated the FDAs feedback regarding the design of our pivotal trials and confirmed that the applicable pathway to market for SNA-001 is via the 510(k) clearance process. 
 We are currently conducting multicenter, randomized, double-blind, within-subject and vehicle-controlled studies evaluating SNA-001 for enhancement of the therapeutic effect of laser in reduction of light-pigmented hair. The primary endpoint is the percentage change in hair count from baseline to three months after the final of six treatments delivered over 35 weeks. Three separate clinical trials, using nearly identical protocols but different laser wavelengths corresponding to three commonly used commercial lasers, 755 nm, 810 nm and 1064 nm, are now fully enrolled, each with approximately 70 subjects. 
 Clinical feasibility studies 
 A prospective, evaluator-blinded, randomized within subject controlled study of SNA-001 plus laser in subjects with light-pigmented axillary (underarm) hair was conducted. Females 18 years of age or older with light-pigmented hair planning to undergo laser hair reduction of both axillae were eligible for this single center study. Immediately following epilation (hair extraction) via sugaring (a technique similar to waxing) to enable efficient penetration of silver photoparticles, SNA-001 or vehicle was massaged into the left or right axillary treatment area using a mechanical vibration device and excess suspension was wiped off the skin surface. Both axillae were then treated with a single pass of 810 nm diode laser. Subjects received three treatments, each treatment spaced two weeks apart, with the primary efficacy assessment of hair counts occurring at 12 weeks after the last treatment. 
 An interim analysis was completed on 12 enrolled subjects (safety population), 10 of whom completed at least one follow-up visit and were included in the primary analysis (ITT population). A statistically significant reduction in hair counts from baseline to 12 weeks was observed in the SNA-001 treatment area, but not in the control area. The mean difference between SNA-001 and control (SNA-001 minus control) was statistically significant. The magnitude of hair reduction achieved in this feasibility study was consistent with our expectations for an abbreviated, three treatment protocol, and less than expected using the standard six treatment laser hair reduction protocol. Figure 15 below sets forth the results of the interim analysis of the magnitude of hair reduction achieved in this feasibility study.

  Figure 15. Reduction in Hair Counts with SNA-001 vs. Control in All Subjects at 12 Weeks (N=10) 
 

An analysis of efficacy stratified by hair color suggests that the statistically significant difference between treatments in the primary analysis was probably driven by the lighter pigmented hair cohort (n=5). Although SNA-001 reduced hair counts from baseline in both the lighter (red/blonde) and darker (brown/light brown) hair cohorts, vehicle plus laser reduced hair counts only in darker hair individuals. We believe this is due to the presence of sufficient pigment in the hair follicles of brown/light brown hair. Figure 16 below sets forth SNA-001s effect on reduction in hair counts, stratified by hair color cohort, as shown in this analysis.

 Subject ratings of pain at each treatment visit using the VAS scale suggested pain is mild-to-moderate and similar between treatments. As with SNA-001 for the treatment of acne, procedural pain associated with unwanted light-pigmented hair reduction can be managed with standard of care approaches, including ice, oral analgesics, and topical anesthetics. Figure 18 below sets forth subjects assessments of pain associated with treatment with SNA-001 for the treatment of unwanted light-pigmented hair, as measured by mean pain scores using the VAS scale.

 Market opportunity for SNA-001 for hair reduction 
 We anticipate that SNA-001 would be marketed to dermatologists and HCPs that are currently performing laser hair reduction in their practice. From our market research we estimate that approximately 1,300 dermatologists could be targeted for hair reduction using SNA-001 based on their current treatment patterns and access to a laser. These dermatologists perform approximately one million procedures annually. Of these, dermatologists report that 28% of existing procedures result in sub-optimal outcomes because of too lightly pigmented hair, representing a 0.3 million procedure opportunity for SNA-001. Additionally, surveyed dermatologists estimate that SNA-001 has the potential to expand their procedure volumes 27%, an additional 0.3 million procedure opportunity, by attracting patients who are currently not candidates for laser hair reduction. HCPs in medispas and laser centers perform approximately 10 times the laser hair reduction procedures as dermatologists, representing a potential six million procedure opportunity for SNA-001. Given the potential benefits of SNA-001 and ease with which it could fit into existing practice procedures, we believe SNA-001 could capture a meaningful share of these potential procedures. 
 
31 


Index to Financial Statements
  Currently, dermatologists and HCPs charge between $150-350 per laser hair reduction procedure for an average sized treatment area such as axillae or bikini line. Because laser hair reduction is ineffective for light-pigmented hair and limited alternative treatment options exist, we anticipate that physicians will be able to charge a modest premium for light-pigmented laser hair reduction with SNA-001. The anticipated premium of approximately 30% or more would include the price of the product as well as additional labor required to apply SNA-001. 
 In the future, we may evaluate the potential to expand the aesthetic applications of SNA-001 to also treat dark-haired and dark-skinned patients, and to use SNA-001 in skin rejuvenation procedures. 
 Competition 
 The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition and a strong emphasis on proprietary products. We consider our primary potential competition to be existing providers and drug developers of therapeutics to treat pruritus, psoriasis, atopic dermatitis and acne vulgaris, as well as currently available procedural solutions for the treatment of acne and hair reduction. Any product candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize will compete with these existing therapies and procedures as well as new therapies that may become available in the future. Our success will be based in part on our ability to discover, develop and commercialize product candidates that are innovative, differentiated and safer and more effective than competing products. 
Pruritus, Psoriasis and Atopic Dermatitis 
 With respect to SNA-120 for the treatment of pruritus associated with psoriasis, we would face competition from companies that market anti-histamines, doxepin and gabapentin. Other products approved for psoriasis, including certain biologics and topical steroids, may have a beneficial effect on pruritus in psoriasis patients. Product candidates under development that could be used to treat pruritus and compete with SNA-120 include: aprepitant, a topical neurokinin 1 antagonist being developed by Leo Pharma Inc. for the treatment of uremic pruritus and prurigo nodularis; Nalbuphine ER, an oral µ opioid receptor antagonist and K opioid receptor agonist being developed by Trevi Therapeutics for the treatment of uremic pruritus and prurigo nodularis; VPD-737/serlopitant, an oral NK-1 antagonist being developed by Menlo Therapeutics for the treatment of pruritus associated with prurigo nodularis, atopic dermatitis and psoriasis; CR845/difelikefalin, an oral K opioid receptor agonist being developed by Cara Therapeutics for uremic pruritus; asimadoline, an oral K opioid receptor agonist being developed by Tioga Pharmaceuticals for pruritus associated with atopic dermatitis; and VLY-686/tradipitant an oral NK-1 antagonist being developed by Lilly / Vanda Pharmaceuticals for the treatment of prurigo nodularis and atopic dermatitis. 
 With respect to SNA-120 and SNA-125 for the topical treatment of mild-to-moderate psoriasis, we would face potential competition from companies that market corticosteroids, Vitamin D analogues, combinations thereof and calcineurin inhibitors. There are also topical products that are marketed or in development for the treatment of psoriasis, and that could compete with SNA-120, including M5180, a cytokine and PDE inhibitor being developed by Maruho Co., Ltd.; IDP-118/Jemdel, halobetasol propionate 0.01% lotion, and IDP-122, a high-potency steroid, being developed by Valeant; INCB018424, a phosphate cream of Jakafi being developed by Incyte Corporation; GSK2981278, a topical RORg inverse agonist being developed by GlaxoSmithKline plc; GSK2894512, a topical non-steroidal anti-inflammatory being developed by GlaxoSmithKline; GSK2982772, an oral receptor-interacting protein 1 (RIP1) kinase inhibitor being developed by GlaxoSmithKline; GSK2894512/tapinarof, a topical aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) activator being developed by GlaxoSmithKline; Tofacitinib, a JAK3 inhibitor being developed in topical formulation by Pfizer Inc.; Eucrisa, a PDE4 inhibitor being marketed by Pfizer; SB414, a topical nitric oxide product candidate being developed by Novan, Inc.; ATI-450, an oral p38/MK-2 kinase inhibitor being developed by Aclaris Therapeutics; and multiple foam candidates, such as Vitamin D analogue and corticosteroid foams being developed by Foamix.

  With respect to SNA-125 for the treatment of atopic dermatitis, we would face potential competition from companies that market branded and generic corticosteroids or the topical calcineurin inhibitors, Elidel, which is being marketed by Valeant, and Protopic, which is being marketed by Leo Pharma. Products that treat atopic dermatitis and product candidates under development that could potentially be used to treat atopic dermatitis and compete with SNA-125 include Eucrisa, a PDE4 inhibitor being marketed by Pfizer; VTP-38543, a topical Liver X-receptor (LXR) beta agonist being developed by Allergan; RVT-501, a PDE4 inhibitor being developed by Roivant Sciences, Ltd. and Eisai Co., Ltd.; GSK2894512/tapinarof, a topical aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) activator being developed by GlaxoSmithKline; DMT210, a G protein-coupled receptor antagonist being developed by Signum Dermalogix Inc.; ZPL-521, a cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2) inhibitor being developed by Novartis; a topical soft JAK inhibitor being developed by Aclaris Therapeutics; and SB414, a topical nitric oxide product candidate being developed by Novan. 
Acne Vulgaris 
 If cleared by the FDA for the treatment of acne vulgaris, we anticipate that SNA-001 would be marketed either as first line therapy for those patients who are averse to pharmaceuticals, or for those patients who have tried and failed prior treatments such as topical therapeutics, skin care products and OTC treatments, or who are non-compliant with their current therapies. As a result, these patients require other treatments for their acne, and may consider systemic therapeutics or procedural solutions. We believe SNA-001 would compete with branded and generic oral and topical antimicrobials, oral and topical retinoids, oral contraceptives, and currently available procedures including chemical peels, laser or light-based treatments, and photodynamic therapy. In addition, the FDA in 2016 approved Differin Gel 0.1% for OTC use, which may impact the competitive landscape. We may compete with branded therapeutics, including Epiduo and Epiduo Forte, marketed by Galderma Laboratories, L.P., Aczone, marketed by Allergan plc, Onexton, marketed by Valeant Pharmaceuticals International, Inc., SB204, a topical nitric oxide product candidate being developed by Novan for the treatment of acne, and Sebashells, a gold particle being developed by Sebacia, Inc. The leading providers of procedural solutions are DUSA Pharmaceuticals, Inc., manufacturer of Levulan Kerastick, and ClearLight, Omnilux and Candela. There are also product candidates under development that could potentially be used to treat acne vulgaris and compete with SNA-001. For example, DRM01/olumacostat glasaretil, a topical acetyl-CoA carboxylase inhibitor product candidate being developed by Dermira, Inc.; FMX101, a minocycline foam product candidate being developed by Foamix Pharmaceuticals Ltd.; Winlevi, a novel-topical anti-androgen candidate being developed by Cassiopea SpA; sarecycline, a tetracycline derivative being developed by Allergan; IDP-120, as well as IDP-121/Altreno, tretinoin 0.05% lotion, and IDP-123, a retinoid, being developed by Valeant Pharmaceuticals International, Inc.; BPX01, a topical hydrophilic antibiotic (minocycline) candidate being developed by BioPharmX; and ANT-1207, a topical botulinum toxin type A candidate originated by Anterios, Inc. and now being developed by Allergan. 
Light-Pigmented Hair Reduction 
 If cleared by the FDA for light-pigmented hair reduction, we anticipate that SNA-001 would be marketed to patients with light-pigmented hair who are either ineligible for hair reduction using laser alone, or have previously used laser hair reduction but did not see sufficient benefits. SNA-001 would compete with hair reduction procedures using laser or intense pulsed light, or IPL. These procedures are available in dermatologist offices, medispas and laser treatment centers, as well as for at-home use by the patient. Key brands offering in-office hair reduction procedures are miraDry, Syneron Medical (acquired by Apax Partners and associated funds in April 2017), PhotoMedex, Inc., Cutera, Inc., Cynosure, Inc. (acquired by Hologic), Solta Medical, Inc. (acquired by Valeant), Sciton, Inc., and Alma Lasers Ltd. Home laser and IPL hair reduction systems include such brands as Tria, Remington, Braun Gillette Venus Silk-Expert, Philips Lumea, LumaRx, Veet InfiniSilk Pro, BellaLite by Silkn, Vector and Verseo ePen.

  Commercial Operations 
 We currently have no sales organization. We have retained global rights to all of our product candidates, and, if one of our product candidates is approved by the FDA, expect to access the market in North America through a specialty dermatology-focused sales force. We expect that our sales force will be supported by sales management, internal sales support, an internal marketing group and distribution support. We intend to invest in our commercial capabilities prudently by focusing our marketing efforts on the dermatologists who have the highest prescription volumes and those with a medical focus who have installed laser capabilities with which to use SNA-001. We will also evaluate licensing and partnering with third parties to help us reach other sales channels, such as medispas and laser treatment centers, and geographic markets outside of North America. 
Intellectual Property 
 Our success depends in large part upon our ability to obtain and maintain proprietary protection for our products and technologies and to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of others. Our policy is to protect our proprietary position by, among other methods, filing U.S. and foreign patent applications related to our proprietary technology, inventions and improvements that are important to the development and implementation of our business. We also use other forms of protection, such as confidential information, know-how and trademarks to protect our intellectual property, particularly where we do not believe patent protection is appropriate or obtainable. 
 Our Topical by DesignTM and Topical Photoparticle TherapyTM patent portfolios consist of a combination of issued patents and pending patent applications that are owned by us (and our subsidiaries) or licensed from third parties.

Certain other patents and patent applications directed to our Topical Photoparticle TherapyTM portfolio, if they were to issue, may have later expirations. 
 Most of our issued patents and pending patent applications are owned by us or one of our subsidiaries. Some of our issued and pending Topical Photoparticle TherapyTM patent applications are exclusively licensed to us in certain fields of use from nanoComposix, Inc., or nanoComposix. These patents and pending patent applications are solely owned by nanoComposix or jointly owned by us and nanoComposix, and are generally directed to technologies related to the production of silver nanoplates used in the Topical Photoparticle TherapyTM technology for SNA-001. 
 Our continuing research and development, technical know-how, and contractual arrangements supplement our intellectual property protection in an effort to maintain our competitive position. Our policy is to require inventors who are identified on any Company-owned patent applications to assign rights to us. We also rely, in part, on confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, and other advisors to protect our proprietary information. Our policy is to require third parties that receive material confidential information to enter into confidentiality agreements with us. 
 We also protect our brand through procurement of trademark rights. As of December 31, 2017, we own approximately 53 registered trademarks around the world, as well as 16 U.S. and 120 international pending trademark applications, including registrations in the European Union, Switzerland, Norway, Turkey, Russia, China, Colombia, India, Japan, Mexico, South Korea, Singapore, Vietnam, Australia, Argentina, Israel, New Zealand, Monaco, and the Philippines. Our trademarks SIENNA®, SIENNA BIOPHARMACEUTICALS®, TPT®, TOPICAL BY DESIGN®, LSE®, and SCIENCE YOU CAN SEE. CONFIDENCE YOU CAN FEEL.® are registered trademarks that we own in certain international countries. In order to supplement protection of our brand, we have also registered several internet domain names. 
 Significant TransactionAcquisition of Creabilis plc 
 In December 2016, we entered into a Share Purchase Agreement to acquire the entire issued share capital of Creabilis plc, which, upon closing, became our direct wholly-owned subsidiary. Through the acquisition of Creabilis we obtained the Topical by DesignTM platform and related product candidate, SNA-120 and SNA-125. In connection with closing, we made an upfront payment of $0.2 million in cash, issued 1,407,679 shares of our Series A-3 Preferred Stock to the former Creabilis shareholders and settled approximately $6.7 million of Creabilis liabilities. In October 2017, we commenced our additional Phase 2b clinical trial for SNA-120, triggering our first contingent milestone payment of $5.0 million, less certain offsets totaling approximately $0.3 million, which we satisfied by issuing an aggregate of 201,268 shares of common stock to the former Creabilis shareholders in December 2017 pursuant to the terms of the Share Purchase Agreement. 
 Upon the achievement of certain additional development, approval and sales milestones for SNA-120 and SNA-125, we are obligated to pay the former Creabilis shareholders up to an aggregate of $53.0 million, which consists of an aggregate of $25.0 million in cash and $28.0 million in shares of our common stock. In addition, upon the achievement of certain annual net sales milestone thresholds for qualifying products, including SNA-120 and SNA-125, we are required to pay the former Creabilis shareholders up to an aggregate of $80.0 million in cash as well as one-time royalties of less than 1% on net sales of qualified products that exceed these net sales thresholds in the year such threshold is achieved. 
 Government Regulation 
 The FDA and comparable regulatory authorities in state and local jurisdictions and in other countries impose substantial and burdensome requirements upon companies involved in the clinical development, manufacture, marketing and distribution of drugs and medical devices, such as those we are developing. These 
 
35 


Index to Financial Statements
   agencies and other federal, state and local entities regulate, among other things, the research and development, testing, manufacture, quality control, safety, effectiveness, labeling, storage, record keeping, approval, advertising and promotion, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, sampling and export and import of our product candidates. 
U.S. Government Regulation of Drug Products 
 In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the FDCA and its implementing regulations. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with applicable federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval, may subject an applicant to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as the FDAs refusal to approve pending NDAs, withdrawal of an approval, imposition of a clinical hold, issuance of warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement or civil or criminal penalties. 
 The process required by the FDA before a drug may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following: 
 

 | completion of nonclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies in compliance with the FDAs good laboratory practice, or GLP, regulations;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | submission to the FDA of an investigational new drug application, or IND, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin in the United States;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | approval by an independent institutional review board, or IRB, at each clinical site before each trial may be initiated;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with good clinical practice, or GCP, requirements to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug product for each indication;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | submission to the FDA of an NDA;
--+---------------------------------


 | satisfactory completion of an FDA advisory committee, if applicable;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------


 | satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the product is produced to assess compliance with cGMP requirements and to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the drugs identity, strength, quality and purity;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | satisfactory completion of FDA audits of clinical trial sites and the sponsors clinical trial records to assure compliance with GCPs and the integrity of the clinical data;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | payment of user fees and securing FDA approval of the NDA; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------


 | compliance with any post-approval requirements, including the potential requirement to implement a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, and the potential requirement to conduct post-approval studies.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Nonclinical Studies 
 Nonclinical studies include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry and formulation, as well as animal studies to assess safety, toxicity and efficacy. An IND sponsor must submit the results of the nonclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data and any available clinical data or literature, among other things, to the FDA as part of an IND. Some nonclinical testing may continue even after the IND is submitted. An IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless before that time the FDA raises concerns or questions related to one or more proposed clinical trials and places the clinical trial on a clinical hold. 
 
36 


Index to Financial Statements
   In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. As a result, submission of an IND may not result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to commence. 
Clinical Trials 
 Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational new drug to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with GCP requirements, which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent in writing for their participation in any clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety, and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. A protocol for each clinical trial and any subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. In addition, an IRB at each institution participating in the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial before it commences at that institution. Information about certain clinical trials must be submitted within specific timeframes to the National Institutes of Health for public dissemination on their www.clinicaltrials.gov website. 
 Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases, which may overlap or be combined: 
 

 | Phase 1: The drug is initially introduced into healthy human subjects or patients with the target disease or condition and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution, excretion and, if possible, to gain an early indication of its effectiveness.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Phase 2: The drug is administered to a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Phase 3: The drug is administered to an expanded patient population, generally at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites, in well-controlled clinical trials to generate enough data to statistically evaluate the efficacy and safety of the product for approval, to establish the overall risk-benefit profile of the product, and to provide adequate information for the labeling of the product.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and more frequently if serious adverse events occur. The FDA or the sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRBs requirements or if the drug has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients. 
 Special Protocol Assessment 
 The SPA process is designed to facilitate the FDAs review and approval of drugs by allowing the FDA to evaluate the proposed design and size of certain clinical trials, including those that are intended to form the primary basis for determining a drug products efficacy. Although not required, upon specific request by a clinical trial sponsor, the FDA will evaluate the protocol and respond to a sponsors questions regarding, among other things, primary efficacy endpoints, trial conduct and data analysis, within 45 days of receipt of the request. 
 The FDA ultimately assesses whether the protocol design and planned analysis of the trial are acceptable to support regulatory approval of the product candidate with respect to effectiveness of the indication studied. All agreements and disagreements between the FDA and the sponsor regarding an SPA must be clearly documented in an SPA letter or the minutes of a meeting between the sponsor and the FDA. 
 Even if the FDA agrees to the design, execution and analyses proposed in protocols reviewed under the SPA process, the FDA may revoke or alter its agreement if FDA determines that a substantial scientific issue essential 
 
37 


Index to Financial Statements
   to determining the safety or efficacy of the product has been identified after the trial has begun. Such issues may include, but are not limited to: 

 | public health concerns emerge that were unrecognized at the time of the protocol assessment, or the director of the review division determines that a substantial scientific issue essential to determining safety or efficacy has been identified after testing has begun;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | safety concerns emerge related to the product or its pharmacological class;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | data are identified that would call into question the clinical relevance of previously agreed-upon endpoints;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | a sponsor fails to follow a protocol that was agreed upon with the FDA; or
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | the relevant data, assumptions, or information provided by the sponsor in a request for SPA change, are found to be false statements or misstatements, or are found to omit relevant facts.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 A documented SPA may be modified, and such modification will be deemed binding on the FDA review division, except under the circumstances described above, if FDA and the sponsor agree in writing to modify the protocol and such modification is intended to improve the study. 
 Marketing Approval 
 Assuming successful completion of the required clinical testing, the results of the nonclinical and clinical studies, together with detailed information relating to the products chemistry, manufacture, controls and proposed labeling, among other things, are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. In most cases, the submission of an NDA is subject to a substantial application user fee. Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, guidelines that are currently in effect, the FDA has a goal of ten months from the date of filing of a standard NDA for a new molecular entity to review and act on the submission. This review typically takes twelve months from the date the NDA is submitted to the FDA because the FDA has approximately two months to make a filing decision. 
 In addition, in accordance with the Pediatric Research and Equity Act, certain NDAs or supplements to an NDA must contain data that are adequate to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations, and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The FDA may, on its own initiative or at the request of the applicant, grant deferrals for submission of some or all pediatric data until after approval of the product for use in adults, or full or partial waivers from the pediatric data requirements. 
 The FDA also may require submission of a REMS plan to ensure that the benefits of the drug outweigh its risks. The REMS plan could include medication guides, physician communication plans, assessment plans, and/or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries, or other risk minimization tools. 
 The FDA conducts a preliminary review of all NDAs within the first 60 days after submission, before accepting them for filing, to determine whether they are sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. The FDA may request additional information rather than accept an NDA for filing. In this event, the application must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application is also subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review. The FDA reviews an NDA to determine, among other things, whether the drug is safe and effective and whether the facility in which it is manufactured, processed, packaged or held meets standards designed to assure the products continued safety, quality and purity. 
 The FDA may refer an application for a novel drug to an advisory committee. An advisory committee is a panel of independent experts, including clinicians and other scientific experts, that reviews, evaluates and 
 
38 


Index to Financial Statements
   provides a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions. 
 Before approving an NDA, the FDA typically will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving an NDA, the FDA may inspect one or more clinical trial sites and the sponsor to assure compliance with GCP requirements. 
 After evaluating the NDA and all related information, including the advisory committee recommendation, if any, and inspection reports regarding the manufacturing facilities and clinical trial sites, the FDA may issue an approval letter, or, in some cases, a complete response letter. A complete response letter generally contains a statement of specific conditions that must be met in order to secure final approval of the NDA and may require additional clinical or nonclinical testing in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. Even with submission of this additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval. If and when those conditions have been met to the FDAs satisfaction, the FDA will typically issue an approval letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications. 
 Even if the FDA approves a product, it may limit the approved indications for use of the product, require that contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling, require that post-approval studies, including Phase 4 clinical trials, be conducted to further assess a drugs safety after approval, require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the product after commercialization, or impose other conditions, including distribution and use restrictions or other risk management mechanisms under a REMS, which can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the product. The FDA may prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of post-marketing studies or surveillance programs. After approval, some types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes, and additional labeling claims, are subject to further testing requirements and FDA review and approval. 
 Special FDA Expedited Review and Approval Programs 
 The FDA has various programs, including fast track designation, accelerated approval, priority review, and breakthrough therapy designation, which are intended to expedite or simplify the process for the development and FDA review of drugs that are intended for the treatment of serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs. The purpose of these programs is to provide important new drugs to patients earlier than under standard FDA review procedures. 
 To be eligible for a fast track designation, the FDA must determine, based on the request of a sponsor, that a product is intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and demonstrates the potential to address an unmet medical need. The FDA will determine that a product will fill an unmet medical need if it will provide a therapy where none exists or provide a therapy that may be potentially superior to existing therapy based on efficacy or safety factors. The FDA may review sections of the NDA for a fast track product on a rolling basis before the complete application is submitted. If the sponsor provides a schedule for the submission of the sections of the NDA, the FDA agrees to accept sections of the NDA and determines that the schedule is acceptable, and the sponsor pays any required user fees upon submission of the first section of the NDA. 
 The FDA may give a priority review designation to drugs that are designed to treat serious conditions, and if approved, would provide a significant improvement in treatment, or provide a treatment where no adequate therapy exists. A priority review means that the goal for the FDA to review an application is six months, rather than the standard review of ten months under current PDUFA guidelines. Under the current PDUFA agreement, these six and ten month review periods are measured from the filing date rather than the receipt date for NDAs 
 
39 


Index to Financial Statements
   for new molecular entities, which typically adds approximately two months to the timeline for review and decision from the date of submission. Most products that are eligible for fast track designation are also likely to be considered appropriate to receive a priority review. 
 In addition, products studied for their safety and effectiveness in treating serious or life-threatening illnesses and that provide meaningful therapeutic benefit over existing treatments may be eligible for accelerated approval and may be approved on the basis of adequate and well-controlled clinical trials establishing that the drug product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. As a condition of approval, the FDA may require a sponsor of a drug receiving accelerated approval to perform post-marketing studies to verify and describe the predicted effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical endpoint, and the drug may be subject to accelerated withdrawal procedures. 
 Moreover, under the provisions of the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act, a sponsor can request designation of a product candidate as a breakthrough therapy. A breakthrough therapy is defined as a drug that is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. Drugs designated as breakthrough therapies are also eligible for accelerated approval. The FDA must take certain actions, such as holding timely meetings and providing advice, intended to expedite the development and review of an application for approval of a breakthrough therapy. 
 Even if a product qualifies for one or more of these programs, the FDA may later decide that the product no longer meets the conditions for qualification or decide that the time period for FDA review or approval will not be shortened. We may explore some of these opportunities for our product candidates as appropriate. 
 Post-Approval Requirements 
 Drugs manufactured or distributed pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to recordkeeping, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, advertising and promotion and reporting of adverse experiences with the product. After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims are subject to prior FDA review and approval. There also are continuing, annual program user fee requirements for any marketed products. 
 The FDA may impose a number of post-approval requirements as a condition of approval of an NDA. For example, the FDA may require post-marketing testing, including Phase 4 clinical trials, and surveillance to further assess and monitor the products safety and effectiveness after commercialization. 
 In addition, drug manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are required to register their establishments with the FDA and state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and these state agencies for compliance with cGMP requirements. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated and often require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP requirements and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon the sponsor and any third-party manufacturers that the sponsor may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance. 
 
40 


Index to Financial Statements
  Once an approval or clearance of a drug or medical device is granted, the FDA may withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in mandatory revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market studies or clinical trials to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things: 

 | restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | fines, warning letters or holds on post-approval clinical trials;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------


 | refusal of the FDA to approve pending NDAs or supplements to approved NDAs, or suspension or revocation of product approvals;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; or
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------

 The FDA strictly regulates marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of products that are placed on the market. Drugs or devices may be promoted only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability. 
 The Hatch-Waxman Act 
 Section 505 of the FDCA describes three types of NDAs that may be submitted to request marketing authorization for a new drug. A 505(b)(1) NDA is an application that contains full reports of investigations of safety and effectiveness. The Hatch-Waxman Act created two additional marketing pathways under Sections 505(j) and 505(b)(2) of the FDCA. Section 505(j) establishes an abbreviated approval process for generic versions of approved drug products through the submission of an abbreviated new drug application, or ANDA. An ANDA provides for marketing of a drug product that has the same active ingredients in the same strengths and dosage form as the branded reference drug and has been shown to be bioequivalent to the branded reference drug. ANDA applicants are required to conduct bioequivalence testing to confirm chemical and therapeutic equivalence to the branded reference drug. Generic versions of drugs can often be substituted by pharmacists under prescriptions written for the branded reference drug. 
 A 505(b)(2) NDA is an application that contains full reports of investigations of safety and effectiveness but where at least some of the information required for approval comes from studies not conducted by or for the applicant. This alternate regulatory pathway enables the applicant to rely, in part, on the FDAs findings of safety and efficacy for an existing product, or published literature, in support of its application. The FDA may then approve the new product candidate for all or some of the labeled indications for which the branded reference drug has been approved, as well as for any new indication sought by the 505(b)(2) applicant. 
 The Hatch-Waxman Act establishes periods of regulatory exclusivity for certain approved drug products, during which the FDA cannot approve (or in some cases accept) an ANDA or 505(b)(2) application that relies on the branded reference drug. For example, the holder of an NDA may obtain five years of exclusivity upon approval of a new drug containing an NCE that has not been previously approved by the FDA. During the five year exclusivity period, the FDA cannot accept for filing or approve any ANDA seeking approval of a generic version of that drug or any 505(b)(2) NDA for the same active moiety and that relies on the FDAs findings regarding that drug, except that FDA may accept an application for filing (but still may not approve it) after four years if the follow-on applicant makes a paragraph IV certification, as described below. The Hatch-Waxman Act 
 
41 


Index to Financial Statements
   also provides three years of marketing exclusivity to the holder of an NDA (including a 505(b)(2) NDA) for a particular condition of approval, or change to a marketed product, such as a new formulation or new indication for a previously approved product, if one or more new clinical studies (other than bioavailability or bioequivalence studies) was essential to the approval of the application and was conducted/sponsored by the applicant. This three-year exclusivity period protects against FDA approval of ANDAs and 505(b)(2) NDA for drugs that include the innovation that required the new clinical data. 
 Upon submission of an ANDA or a 505(b)(2) NDA, an applicant must certify to the FDA, in the opinion of the applicant and to the best of its knowledge (1) that relevant patent information on the referenced drug product has not been submitted to the FDA; (2) that the relevant patent has expired; (3) the date on which the relevant patent expires; or (4) that such patent is invalid, unenforceable or will not be infringed upon by the manufacture, use or sale of the drug product for which the application is submitted. This last certification is known as a paragraph IV certification. If the NDA holder or patent owner(s) files a patent infringement action against the ANDA or 505(b)(2) applicant within 45 days of receipt of the paragraph IV certification, the FDA may not approve the ANDA or 505(b)(2) application until the earlier of (i) 30 months from the receipt of the notice of the paragraph IV certification (generally referred to as the 30 month stay), (ii) the expiration date of the patent(s) listed in the Orange Book for the reference drug product, (iii) the date the court enters a final order or judgment that the patent(s) are invalid, unenforceable and/or not infringed or (iv) such shorter or longer period as may be ordered by a court. Where the ANDA or 505(b)(2) applicant files an application with a paragraph IV certification within the fifth year of the five-year NCE exclusivity period enjoyed by the NDA holder for the reference branded product, and where patent litigation is brought within 45 days of receipt of notice of the paragraph IV certification, the 30-month stay will be extended by the amount of time such that 7.5 years will elapse from the date of approval of the original NDA to the expiration of the stay. Thus, approval of an ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA could be delayed for a significant period of time depending on the patent certification the applicant makes, whether the reference product enjoys NCE exclusivity, and the reference drug sponsors decision to initiate patent litigation. 
 U.S. Government Regulation of Medical Devices 
 Unless an exemption applies, each medical device commercially distributed in the United States requires either FDA clearance of a 510(k) premarket notification, or approval of a premarket approval application, or PMA. Under the FDCA, medical devices are classified into one of three classesClass I, Class II or Class IIIdepending on the degree of risk associated with each medical device and the extent of manufacturer and regulatory control needed to ensure its safety and effectiveness. Class I includes devices with the lowest risk to the patient and are those for which safety and effectiveness can be assured by adherence to the FDAs General Controls for medical devices, which include compliance with the applicable portions of the Quality System Regulation, or QSR, facility registration and product listing, reporting of adverse medical events, and truthful and non-misleading labeling, advertising, and promotional materials. Class II devices are subject to the FDAs General Controls, and special controls as deemed necessary by the FDA to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the device. These special controls can include performance standards, postmarket surveillance, patient registries and FDA guidance documents. While most Class I devices are exempt from the 510(k) premarket notification requirement, manufacturers of most Class II devices are required to submit to the FDA a premarket notification under Section 510(k) of the FDCA requesting permission to commercially distribute the device. The FDAs permission to commercially distribute a device subject to a 510(k) premarket notification is generally known as 510(k) clearance. Devices deemed by the FDA to pose the greatest risks, such as life-sustaining, life-supporting or some implantable devices, or devices that have a new intended use, or use advanced technology that is not substantially equivalent to that of a legally marketed device, are placed in Class III, requiring approval of a PMA. Some pre-amendment devices are unclassified, but are subject to the FDAs premarket notification and clearance process in order to be commercially distributed.

  510(k) Marketing Clearance Pathway 
 We expect our product candidates that are regulated as medical devices, including SNA-001, to be subject to the 510(k) marketing clearance pathway. To obtain 510(k) clearance, we must submit to the FDA a premarket notification submission demonstrating that the proposed device is substantially equivalent to a predicate device already on the market. A predicate device is a legally marketed device that is not subject to premarket approval, i.e., a device that was legally marketed prior to May 28, 1976 (pre-amendments device) and for which a PMA is not required, a device that has been reclassified from Class III to Class II or I, or a device that was found substantially equivalent through the 510(k) process. The FDAs 510(k) clearance process usually takes from three to twelve months, but may take significantly longer. The FDA may require additional information, including clinical data, to make a determination regarding substantial equivalence. 
 If the FDA agrees that the device is substantially equivalent to a predicate device currently on the market, it will grant 510(k) clearance to commercially market the device. If the FDA determines that the device is not substantially equivalent to a previously cleared device, the device is automatically designated as a Class III device. The device sponsor must then fulfill more rigorous PMA requirements, or can request a risk-based classification determination for the device in accordance with the de novo process, which is a route to market for novel medical devices that are low to moderate risk and are not substantially equivalent to a predicate device. 
 After a device receives 510(k) marketing clearance, any modification that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, or that would constitute a major change or modification in its intended use, will require a new 510(k) marketing clearance or, depending on the modification, PMA approval. The FDA requires each manufacturer to determine whether the proposed change requires submission of a 510(k) or a PMA in the first instance, but the FDA can review any such decision and disagree with a manufacturers determination. Many minor modifications today are accomplished by a letter-to-file in which the manufacture documents the change in an internal letter-to-file. The letter-to-file is in lieu of submitting a new 510(k) to obtain clearance for every change. The FDA can always review these letters-to-file in an inspection. If the FDA disagrees with a manufacturers determination, the FDA can require the manufacturer to cease marketing and/or request the recall of the modified device until 510(k) marketing clearance or PMA approval is obtained. Also, in these circumstances, we or our manufacturers may be subject to significant regulatory fines or penalties. The FDA has guidance to assist device manufacturers in making the determination as to whether a modification to a device requires a new 510(k). 
 Clinical Trials for Medical Devices 
 Clinical trials are almost always required to support a PMA and are sometimes required to support a 510(k) submission. We expect the FDA to require clinical data in support of our 510(k) premarket notifications. All clinical investigations of investigational devices to determine safety and effectiveness must be conducted in accordance with the FDAs investigational device exemption, or IDE, regulations which govern investigational device labeling, prohibit promotion of the investigational device, and specify an array of recordkeeping, reporting and monitoring responsibilities of study sponsors and study investigators. If the device presents a significant risk, to human health, as defined by the FDA, the FDA requires the device sponsor to submit an IDE application to the FDA, which must become effective prior to commencing human clinical trials. SNA-001 was not deemed to present a significant risk and, as such, an IDE application was not required in order to initiate clinical trials. A significant risk device is one that presents a potential for serious risk to the health, safety or welfare of a patient and either is implanted, used in supporting or sustaining human life, substantially important in diagnosing, curing, mitigating or treating disease or otherwise preventing impairment of human health, or otherwise presents a potential for serious risk to a subject. An IDE application must be supported by appropriate data, such as animal and laboratory test results, showing that it is safe to test the device in humans and that the testing protocol is scientifically sound. The IDE will automatically become effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA unless the FDA notifies the company that the investigation may not begin. If the FDA determines that there are deficiencies or other concerns with an IDE for which it requires modification, the FDA may permit a clinical trial to proceed under a conditional approval. 
 
43 


Index to Financial Statements
  In addition, the study must be approved by, and conducted under the oversight of, an IRB for each clinical site. The IRB is responsible for the initial and continuing review of the IDE, and may pose additional requirements for the conduct of the study. If an IDE application is approved by the FDA and one or more IRBs, human clinical trials may begin at a specific number of investigational sites with a specific number of patients, as approved by the FDA. If the device presents a non-significant risk to the patient, a sponsor may begin the clinical trial after obtaining approval for the trial by one or more IRBs without separate approval from the FDA, but must still follow abbreviated IDE requirements, such as monitoring the investigation, ensuring that the investigators obtain informed consent, and labeling and record-keeping requirements. Acceptance of an IDE application for review does not guarantee that the FDA will allow the IDE to become effective and, if it does become effective, the FDA may or may not determine that the data derived from the trials support the safety and effectiveness of the device or warrant the continuation of clinical trials. An IDE supplement must be submitted to, and approved by, the FDA before a sponsor or investigator may make a change to the investigational plan that may affect its scientific soundness, study plan or the rights, safety or welfare of human subjects. 
 During a study, the sponsor is required to comply with the applicable FDA requirements, including, for example, trial monitoring, selecting clinical investigators and providing them with the investigational plan, ensuring IRB review, adverse event reporting, record keeping and prohibitions on the promotion of investigational devices or on making safety or effectiveness claims for them. The clinical investigators in the clinical study are also subject to FDA regulations and must obtain patient informed consent, rigorously follow the investigational plan and study protocol, control the disposition of the investigational device, and comply with all reporting and recordkeeping requirements. Additionally, after a trial begins, we, the FDA or the IRB could suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time for various reasons, including a belief that the risks to study subjects outweigh the anticipated benefits. 
 Postmarket Regulation of Medical Devices 
 After a medical device is cleared or approved for marketing, numerous and pervasive regulatory requirements continue to apply. These include: 
 

 | establishment registration and device listing with the FDA;
--+------------------------------------------------------------


 | QSR requirements, which require manufacturers, including third-party manufacturers, to follow stringent design, testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures during all aspects of the design and manufacturing process;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | labeling and marketing regulations, which require that promotion is truthful, not misleading, fairly balanced and provide adequate directions for use and that all claims are substantiated, and also prohibit the promotion of products for unapproved or off-label uses and impose other restrictions on labeling; FDA guidance on off-label dissemination of information and responding to unsolicited requests for information;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | the federal Physician Sunshine Payment Act and various state laws on reporting remunerative relationships with health care customers;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | The federal Anti-kickback statute (and similar state laws) prohibiting certain illegal remuneration to physicians and other health care providers that may financially bias prescription decisions and result in an over-utilization of goods and services reimbursed by the federal government;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | clearance or approval of product modifications to 510(k)-cleared devices that could significantly affect safety or effectiveness or that would constitute a major change in intended use of one of our cleared devices;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | medical device reporting regulations, which require that a manufacturer report to the FDA if a device it markets may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury, or has malfunctioned and the device or a similar device that it markets would be likely to cause or contribute to a death or serious injury, if the malfunction were to recur;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Index to Financial Statements
  
 | correction, removal and recall reporting regulations, which require that manufacturers report to the FDA field corrections and product recalls or removals if undertaken to reduce a risk to health posed by the device or to remedy a violation of the FDCA that may present a risk to health;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | complying with the new federal law and regulations requiring Unique Device Identifiers (UDI) on devices and also requiring the submission of certain information about each device to the FDAs Global Unique Device Identification Database (GUDID);
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | the FDAs recall authority, whereby the agency can order device manufacturers to recall from the market a product that is in violation of governing laws and regulations; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | post-market surveillance activities and regulations, which apply when deemed by the FDA to be necessary to protect the public health or to provide additional safety and effectiveness data for the device.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Our manufacturing processes are required to comply with the applicable portions of the QSR, which cover the methods and the facilities and controls for the design, manufacture, testing, production, processes, controls, quality assurance, labeling, packaging, distribution, installation and servicing of finished devices intended for human use. The QSR also requires, among other things, maintenance of a device master file, device history file, and complaint files. As a manufacturer, we are subject to periodic scheduled or unscheduled inspections by the FDA. Our failure to maintain compliance with the QSR requirements could result in the shut-down of, or restrictions on, our manufacturing operations and the recall or seizure of our products, which would have a material adverse effect on our business. The discovery of previously unknown problems with any of our products, including unanticipated adverse events or adverse events of increasing severity or frequency, whether resulting from the use of the device within the scope of its clearance or off-label by a physician in the practice of medicine, could result in restrictions on the device, including the removal of the product from the market or voluntary or mandatory device recalls. 
 Regulation Outside the United States 
 Regulation and Procedures Governing Approval of Medicinal Products and Medical Devices in the EEA 
 EEA Medicinal Products Approval 
 In the European Economic Area, or EEA, which is composed of the 28 Member States of the European Union plus Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein, medicinal products can only be commercialized after obtaining a Marketing Authorization, or MA. 
 There are two types of MAs: 
 

 | The Community MA, which is issued by the European Commission through the Centralized Procedure, based on the opinion of the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, or CHMP, of the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, and which is valid throughout the entire territory of the EEA. The Centralized Procedure is mandatory for certain types of products, such as biotechnology medicinal products, orphan medicinal products, and medicinal products that contain a new active substance indicated for the treatment of AIDS, cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, diabetes, auto-immune and viral diseases. The Centralized Procedure is optional for products containing a new active substance not yet authorized in the EEA, or for products that constitute a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation or which are in the interest of public health in the EU. Under the Centralized Procedure the maximum timeframe for the evaluation of a marketing authorization application is 210 days (excluding clock stops, when additional written or oral information is to be provided by the applicant in response to questions asked by the CHMP). Accelerated evaluation might be granted by the CHMP in exceptional cases, when the authorization of a medicinal product is of major interest from the point of view of public health and in particular from the viewpoint of therapeutic innovation. Under the accelerated procedure the standard 210 days review period is reduced to 150 days.

Index to Financial Statements
  
 | National MAs, which are issued by the competent authorities of the Member States of the EEA and only cover their respective territory, are available for products not falling within the mandatory scope of the Centralized Procedure. Where a product has already been authorized for marketing in a Member State of the EEA, this National MA can be recognized in another Member State through the Mutual Recognition Procedure. If the product has not received a National MA in any Member State at the time of application, it can be approved simultaneously in various Member States through the Decentralized Procedure.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Prior to obtaining an MA in the EEA, applicants have to demonstrate compliance with all measures included in a Paediatric Investigation Plan, or PIP, approved by the EEA regulatory agency, covering all subsets of the pediatric population, unless the EEA regulatory agency has granted (1) a product-specific waiver, (2) a class waiver or (3) a deferral for one or more of the measures included in the PIP. 
 In the EEA, upon receiving an MA, new chemical entities generally receive eight years of data exclusivity and an additional two years of market exclusivity. If granted, data exclusivity prevents regulatory authorities in the EEA from referencing the innovators data to assess a generic application. During the additional two-year period of market exclusivity, a generic marketing authorization can be submitted, and the innovators data may be referenced, but no generic product can be marketed until the expiration of the market exclusivity. However, there is no guarantee that a product will be considered by the EEA regulatory agencies to be a new chemical entity, and products may not qualify for data exclusivity. 
 EEA Medical Devices Approval 
 In the EEA medical devices manufacturers need to comply with the requirements of the EU Medical Devices Directive. To achieve compliance, medical devices must meet the Essential Requirements laid down in Annex I of the EU Medical Devices Directive relating to safety and performance. To demonstrate compliance with the Essential Requirements and obtain the right to affix the Conformité Européene, or CE, mark, without which medical devices cannot be commercialized in the EEA, medical device manufacturers must undergo a conformity assessment procedure, which varies according to the type of medical device and its classification. Except for low risk medical devices (Class I with no measuring function and which are not sterile), where the manufacturer can issue an EC Declaration of Conformity based on a self-assessment of the conformity of its products with the Essential Requirements, a conformity assessment procedure requires the intervention of a Notified Body, which is an organization designated by a competent authority of an EEA country to conduct conformity assessments. Depending on the relevant conformity assessment procedure, the Notified Body would audit and examine the Technical File and the quality system for the manufacture, design and final inspection of the medical devices. The Notified Body issues a CE Certificate of Conformity following successful completion of a conformity assessment procedure conducted in relation to the medical device and its manufacturer and their conformity with the Essential Requirements. This Certificate entitles the manufacturer to affix the CE mark to its medical devices after having prepared and signed a related EC Declaration of Conformity. 
 On April 5, 2017, the European Parliament passed the Medical Devices Regulation which repeals and replaces the EU Medical Devices Directive. Unlike directives, which must be implemented into the national laws of the EEA member states, a regulation is directly applicable, i.e., without the need for adoption of EEA member state laws implementing them, in all EEA member states. The Medical Devices Regulation, among other things, is intended to establish a uniform, transparent, predictable and sustainable regulatory framework across the EEA for medical devices and ensure a high level of safety and health while supporting innovation. The Medical Devices Regulation will not become fully applicable until three years following its entry into force. Once applicable, the Medical Devices Regulation will among other things: 
 

 | strengthen the rules on placing devices on the market and reinforce surveillance once they are available;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | establish explicit provisions on manufacturers responsibilities for the follow-up of the quality, performance and safety of devices placed on the market;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
46 


Index to Financial Statements
  
 | improve the traceability of medical devices throughout the supply chain to the end-user or patient through a unique identification number;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | set up a central database to provide patients, healthcare professionals and the public with comprehensive information on products available in the EU; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | strengthen rules for the assessment of certain high-risk devices, such as implants, which may have to undergo an additional check by experts before they are placed on the market.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Further, the EU Medical Devices Regulation explicitly provides that high intensity electromagnetic radiation (e.g. infra-red, visible light and ultra-violet) emitting equipment intended for use on the human body, including coherent and non-coherent sources, monochromatic and broad spectrum, such as lasers and intense pulsed light equipment, for skin resurfacing, tattoo or hair removal or other skin treatment, falls under its scope. This may affect the regulatory approval pathway of SNA-001 when intended for removal of light-pigmented hair, which currently may not qualify as a medical device under the EU Medical Devices Directive, and could qualify instead as a cosmetic product regulated under the EU Cosmetics Product Regulation. 
 For other countries outside of the United States and EEA, such as countries in Eastern Europe, Latin America or Asia, the requirements governing the conduct of clinical studies, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. If we fail to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements, we may be subject to, among other things, fines, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecution. 
 Other Healthcare Laws 
 In addition to FDA restrictions on the marketing of pharmaceutical and medical device products, other foreign, federal and state healthcare regulatory laws restrict business practices in the pharmaceutical and device industry. These laws include, but are not limited to, federal and state anti-kickback, false claims, data privacy and security, and physician payment and drug pricing transparency laws. 
 The U.S. federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, any person or entity from knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting, receiving or providing any remuneration, directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, to induce or in return for purchasing, leasing, ordering, or arranging for or recommending the purchase, lease, or order of any good, facility, item or service reimbursable, in whole or in part, under Medicare, Medicaid or other federal healthcare programs. The term remuneration has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value. The Anti-Kickback Statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical and medical device manufacturers on the one hand and prescribers, purchasers, formulary managers and beneficiaries on the other hand. Although there are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting some common activities from prosecution, the exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly. Practices that involve remuneration that may be alleged to be intended to induce prescribing, purchases, or recommendations may be subject to scrutiny if they do not meet the requirements of a statutory or regulatory exception or safe harbor. Failure to meet all of the requirements of a particular applicable statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor does not make the conduct per se illegal under the U.S. federal Anti-Kickback Statute. Instead, the legality of the arrangement will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis based on a cumulative review of all its facts and circumstances. Several courts have interpreted the statutes intent requirement to mean that if any one purpose of an arrangement involving remuneration is to induce referrals of federal healthcare covered business, the statute has been violated. In addition, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. Moreover, a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the U.S. federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal civil False Claims Act. The majority of states also have anti-kickback laws, which establish similar prohibitions and in some cases may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payor, including commercial insurers. 
 
47 


Index to Financial Statements
  The federal false claims and civil monetary penalties laws, including the civil False Claims Act, prohibit, among other things, any person or entity from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false, fictitious or fraudulent claim for payment to, or approval by, the federal government, knowingly making, using, or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim to the federal government, or knowingly making a false statement to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the U.S. federal government. A claim includes any request or demand for money or property presented to the U.S. government. Actions under the civil False Claims Act may be brought by the Attorney General or as a qui tam action by a private individual in the name of the government. Violations of the civil False Claims Act can result in very significant monetary penalties and treble damages. Several pharmaceutical, medical device and other healthcare companies have been prosecuted under these laws for, among other things, allegedly providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product. Other companies have been prosecuted for causing false claims to be submitted because of the companies marketing of products for unapproved (e.g., or off-label) uses. In addition, the civil monetary penalties statute imposes penalties against any person who is determined to have presented or caused to be presented a claim to a federal health program that the person knows or should know is for an item or service that was not provided as claimed or is false or fraudulent. Many states also have similar fraud and abuse statutes or regulations that apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in several states, apply regardless of the payor. 
 Violations of fraud and abuse laws, including federal and state anti-kickback and false claims laws, may be punishable by criminal and civil sanctions, including fines and civil monetary penalties, the possibility of exclusion from federal healthcare programs (including Medicare and Medicaid), disgorgement and corporate integrity agreements, which impose, among other things, rigorous operational and monitoring requirements on companies. Similar sanctions and penalties, as well as imprisonment, also can be imposed upon executive officers and employees of such companies. Given the significant size of actual and potential settlements, it is expected that the government authorities will continue to devote substantial resources to investigating healthcare providers and manufacturers compliance with applicable fraud and abuse laws. 
 The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, created additional federal criminal statutes that prohibit, among other actions, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors, knowingly and willfully embezzling or stealing from a healthcare benefit program, willfully obstructing a criminal investigation of a healthcare offense, and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. Similar to the U.S. federal Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. 
 In addition, there has been a recent trend of increased federal and state regulation of payments made to physicians and certain other healthcare providers. The Affordable Care Act imposed, among other things, new annual reporting requirements through the Physician Payments Sunshine Act for covered manufacturers for certain payments and transfers of value provided to physicians and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. Failure to submit timely, accurately and completely the required information for all payments, transfers of value and ownership or investment interests may result in civil monetary penalties. Covered manufacturers must submit reports by the 90th day of each subsequent calendar year. In addition, certain states require implementation of compliance programs and compliance with the pharmaceutical industrys voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government, impose restrictions on marketing practices and/or require the tracking and reporting of marketing expenditures and pricing information as well as gifts, compensation and other remuneration or items of value provided to physicians and other healthcare professionals and entities.

Index to Financial Statements
  We may also be subject to data privacy and security regulation by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, and their respective implementing regulations, including the Final HIPAA Omnibus Rule published on January 25, 2013, impose specified requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information held by covered entities and their business associates. Among other things, HITECH made HIPAAs security standards directly applicable to business associates, defined as independent contractors or agents of covered entities that create, receive, maintain or transmit protected health information in connection with providing a service for or on behalf of a covered entity. HITECH also increased the civil and criminal penalties that may be imposed against covered entities, business associates and possibly other persons, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorneys fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. In addition, state laws govern the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same requirements, thus complicating compliance efforts. 
 Similar foreign laws and regulations, which may include, for instance, applicable post-marketing requirements, anti-fraud and abuse laws, and implementation of corporate compliance programs and reporting of payments or other transfers of value to healthcare professionals, may apply to us to the extent that any of our product candidates, once approved, are sold in a country other than the United States. 
 Coverage and Reimbursement 
 Third-party payors typically do not provide coverage and reimbursement for products for aesthetic indications or procedures using such products. Accordingly, we do not expect any coverage or reimbursement for procedures using SNA-001 to remove light-pigmented hair or for other aesthetic treatments. As such, the commercial success of any product, including SNA-001, if cleared, for an aesthetic indication will depend on the extent to which patients will be willing to pay out of pocket for the in-office procedure using these products. For products approved or cleared for medically necessary indications, success depends on continued coverage and adequate reimbursement for the product or procedures using such product. Therefore, although it is possible that third-party payors may cover and reimburse providers using SNA-001, if cleared, for non-aesthetic indications such as the treatment of acne, we do not currently plan to pursue coverage and reimbursement for procedures using SNA-001 for such indications. 
 Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any pharmaceutical product for which we obtain regulatory approval. In the United States and markets in other countries, patients who are prescribed drugs generally rely on third-party payors to reimburse all or part of the associated healthcare costs. Providers and patients are unlikely to use our products unless coverage is provided and reimbursement is adequate to cover a significant portion of the cost of our products. Sales of SNA-120, SNA-125 and any other product candidates for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale will therefore depend, in part, on the availability of coverage and adequate reimbursement from third-party payors. Third-party payors include government authorities, managed care plans, private health insurers and other organizations. 
 In the United States, the process for determining whether a third-party payor will provide coverage for a pharmaceutical product typically is separate from the process for setting the price of such product or for establishing the reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the product once coverage is approved. With respect to drugs, third-party payors may limit coverage to specific products on an approved list, also known as a formulary, which might not include all of the FDA-approved products for a particular indication, or place products at certain formulary levels that result in lower reimbursement levels and higher cost-sharing obligation imposed on patients. A decision by a third-party payor not to cover a product could reduce physician utilization of a product. Moreover, a third-party payors decision to provide coverage for a pharmaceutical product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available to enable a manufacturer to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on its 
 
49 


Index to Financial Statements
   investment in product development. Additionally, coverage and reimbursement for products can differ significantly from payor to payor. One third-party payors decision to cover a particular medical product does not ensure that other payors will also provide coverage for the medical product, or will provide coverage at an adequate reimbursement rate. As a result, the coverage determination process usually requires manufacturers to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of their products to each payor separately and is a time-consuming process. 
 In the European Union, governments influence the price of products through their pricing and reimbursement rules and control of national health care systems that fund a large part of the cost of those products to consumers. Some jurisdictions operate positive and negative list systems under which products may only be marketed once a reimbursement price has been agreed to by the government. To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval, some of these countries may require the completion of clinical trials that compare the cost effectiveness of a particular product to currently available therapies. Other member states allow companies to fix their own prices for medicines, but monitor and control company profits. The downward pressure on health care costs in general, particularly prescription products, has become very intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products. In addition, in some countries, cross border imports from low-priced markets exert a commercial pressure on pricing within a country. 
 The containment of healthcare costs has become a priority of federal, state and foreign governments, and the prices of pharmaceutical products have been a focus in this effort. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and services, examining the medical necessity and reviewing the cost-effectiveness of pharmaceutical products, in addition to questioning safety and efficacy. If third-party payors do not consider a product to be cost-effective compared to other available therapies, they may not cover that product after FDA approval or, if they do, the level of payment may not be sufficient to allow a manufacturer to sell its product at a profit. 
 Healthcare Reform 
 A primary trend in the U.S. healthcare industry and elsewhere is cost containment. Government authorities and other third-party payors have attempted to control costs by limiting coverage and the amount of reimbursement for particular medical products and services, implementing reductions in Medicare and other healthcare funding, and applying new payment methodologies. For example, in March 2010, the Affordable Care Act was enacted, which, among other things, increased the minimum Medicaid rebates owed by most manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program; introduced a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injected; extended the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program to utilization of prescriptions of individuals enrolled in Medicaid managed care plans; imposed mandatory discounts for certain Medicare Part D beneficiaries as a condition for manufacturers outpatient drugs coverage under Medicare Part D; subjected drug manufacturers to new annual fees based on pharmaceutical companies share of sales to federal healthcare programs; imposed a new federal excise tax on the sale of certain medical devices; which was subsequently suspended until January 1, 2020; created a new Patient Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research; and established a Center for Medicare Innovation at the CMS to test innovative payment and service delivery models to lower Medicare and Medicaid spending. 
 Since its enactment, there have been judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the Affordable Care Act, and we expect there will be additional challenges and amendments to the Affordable Care Act in the future. The current Presidential Administration and U.S. Congress will likely continue to seek to modify, repeal, or otherwise invalidate all, or certain provisions of, the Affordable Care Act. It is uncertain the extent to which any such changes may impact our business or financial condition.

  In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the United States since the Affordable Care Act to reduce healthcare expenditures. These changes include the Budget Control Act of 2011, which led to aggregate reductions of Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year and that will remain in effect through 2025 unless additional action is taken by Congress, and the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, which, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several types of providers, including hospitals, imaging centers and cancer treatment centers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. More recently, there has been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed products, which has resulted in several Congressional inquiries and proposed bills designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for pharmaceutical products. 
 Individual states in the United States have also become increasingly active in passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. 
 Manufacturing and Supply 
 We contract with third parties for the manufacture of our product candidates and intend to do so in the future. We do not own or operate, and we do not expect to own or operate, facilities for product manufacturing, storage and distribution, or testing. Because we rely on contract manufacturers, we have personnel with extensive technical, manufacturing, analytical and quality experience and strong project management discipline to oversee contract manufacturing and testing activities, and to compile manufacturing and quality information for our regulatory submissions. 
 Manufacturing is subject to extensive regulations that impose various procedural and documentation requirements, and which govern record keeping, manufacturing processes and controls, personnel, quality control and quality assurance, among others. Our systems and our contractors are required to be in compliance with these regulations, and this is assessed regularly through monitoring of performance and a formal audit program. 
 Drug Substance 
 We are responsible for supplying drug substance for all of our drug product candidates, including SNA-120 and SNA-125, in all territories. Our current drug substance supply chains for our lead drug product candidates, SNA-120 and SNA-125, involve three contractors: the supplier of K252a, the unconjugated parent compound of SNA-120 and SNA-125, the supplier of GMP grade PEG polymers, and the manufacturer of the conjugated drug substance. We currently operate under purchase order programs for SNA-120 and SNA-125, and we intend to establish long-term supply agreements in the future. We believe our current drug substance contractors have the scale, the systems and the experience to supply all remaining and planned clinical trials. We need to scale-up our drug substance manufacturing processes and execute manufacturing transfers to enable commercial launch. To ensure continuity in our supply chain, we plan to establish supply arrangements with alternative larger scale suppliers for certain portions of our supply chain, as appropriate. 
 Our process uses synthetic procedures and commercially available raw materials. We have established an ongoing program to identify possible process changes to improve purity, yield and manufacturability, and process changes will be implemented as warranted and appropriate. The drug substances for SNA-120 and SNA-125 have historically shown stability adequate to support commercialization.

  Drug Product 
 We are responsible for drug product manufacturing for all of our drug product candidates, including SNA-120 and SNA-125, in all territories. We currently operate under purchase order programs with our third-party manufacturers for SNA-120 and SNA-125 clinical drug product, and we intend to establish long-term supply agreements in the future. 
 We expect that the drug product for SNA-120 will be an ointment formulation for topical application, and we intend to assess multiple concentrations and formulations for SNA-125. Drug product manufacturing uses common processes and readily available materials. The formulation of SNA-120 we will use in our Phase 3 pivotal trials is the formulation anticipated for commercial launch, and which will be informed by our Phase 2b trial. The ointment formulation has historically shown stability at room temperature adequate to support commercialization. We believe our current SNA-120 drug product supply chain is sufficient to supply our anticipated Phase 2b and Phase 3 pivotal clinical trials. 
 Topical Photoparticle TherapyTM 
We are responsible for supplying SNA-001 substance for all territories. Our current SNA-001 substance supply chain involves three contractors: the supplier of silver nanoplates for SNA-001, the supplier of our gel carrier and the manufacturer of the topical gel formulation. 
 We currently have an exclusive supply and license agreement with nanoComposix as the exclusive supplier of silver nanoplates. Under our agreement, nanoComposix has granted us an exclusive worldwide, royalty-bearing, sublicensable license under certain patents, patent applications, and know-how related to silver nanoplate technology owned by nanoComposix to use such technology in commercializing licensed products, including SNA-001, for certain aesthetic, cosmetic, medical, and veterinary fields of uses. We pay nanoComposix a fixed price per unit of silver nanoplates, as well as the greater of a fixed amount per year or low-single digit royalties on net sales of licensed products. Such royalties are payable on a country-by-country and product-by-product basis until the later of five years after the first commercial sale of the licensed product in the applicable country and the expiration of the last-to-expire valid claim of the licensed patents covering such licensed product in the country of sale. 
 Our agreement with nanoComposix expires upon the later of July 2021 or the expiration or abandonment of all valid claims under the patent rights licensed to us from nanoComposix. The agreement can also be terminated prior to expiration by (i) us for convenience, upon three months prior written notice, (ii) nanoComposix upon 30 days prior written notice of an uncured and undisputed material breach of the agreement, (iii) nanoComposix upon notice to us if we have not received FDA approval to sell a licensed product by August 2022, or (iv) either party upon certain bankruptcy or insolvency events of the other party. 
 However, during the term of this agreement, we are generally obligated to purchase our requirements of this key raw starting material from nanoComposix. The agreement provides us with the ability to, at our convenience, manufacture these materials ourselves or secure a specified percentage of our requirements of these materials from alternative sources, subject to our making certain negotiated payments to nanoComposix. In addition, in the event of a specified supply failure, we have the ability to secure materials from third parties or manufacture the materials ourselves and, in such a case, nanoComposix would be required to assist us with necessary technology transfer in exchange for a payment to be agreed-upon by the parties at such time. 
 We currently operate under a purchase order program with the supplier of our gel carrier and the manufacturer of the topical gel formulation, and we intend to establish long-term supply agreements with them or other suppliers. We believe our current SNA-001 substance contractors have the scale, the systems and the experience to supply our requirements of silver nanoplates, gel carriers, and topical gel formulations for all remaining and planned nonclinical studies, clinical trials and commercial launch.
