General
 
Comarco, Inc. was incorporated in California in 1960 and its common stock has been publicly traded since 1971, when it was spun-off from Genge Industries, Inc. Comarco Inc.’s wholly-owned subsidiary Comarco Wireless Technologies, Inc. (“CWT”) was incorporated in the state of Delaware in September 1993. Comarco and CWT are collectively referred to as “we,” “us,” “our,” “Comarco,” or the “Company”. 
 
We are focused on potentially realizing value from our ongoing IP enforcement actions and other litigation as well as exploring opportunities to further expand, protect, and monetize our patent portfolio, including through the potential sale or licensing of our patent portfolio.

Our Business
 
We are focused on potentially realizing value from our ongoing IP enforcement actions and other litigation as well as exploring opportunities to further expand, protect, and monetize our patent portfolio, including through the potential sale or licensing of our patent portfolio.

Going Concern 
 
Our management have expressed substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern as a result of (1) our historical losses from operations, (2) the length of time required to prosecute IP enforcement actions, (3) the uncertainty surrounding the results of IP enforcement actions, (4) our limited existing cash flow and financial resources and (5) uncertainties surrounding our ability to raise additional funds. In addition, our independent registered public accounting firm have expressed substantial doubt regarding the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern in their report on the Company’s consolidated financial statements dated April 28, 2017. If we become unable to continue as a going concern, our shareholders may lose all or part of their investment in our common stock. (see “Risk Factors”). In addition, as described in more detail elsewhere in this report, we expect that our appeal of the Patent Trial and Appeal Board’s decision concerning our U.S. Patent No. 8,492,933 B2 will require approximately 12 months to run its course and that we may require incremental financing in order to pursue the appeal to conclusion. We currently have no commitments for any additional financing and there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain requisite financing on acceptable terms, if at all.
Working Capital
 
As of January 31, 2017, we had working capital of approximately $0.2 million. Our working capital is not sufficient to allow us to discharge liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business over the next twelve months. We are currently generating no revenues and have ceased traditional operations. Our future is highly dependent on our ability to successfully resolve our current litigation, capitalize on our portfolio of patents, generate positive cash flows and obtain borrowings or raise capital to meet our future liquidity needs.
Marketing, Sales, and Distribution
 
Since we are focused on the monetization of our patent portfolio, we had no marketing, sales or distribution expenses in fiscal years 2017 and 2016.
 
 Key Customers
 
For fiscal years 2017 and 2016, we had no customers. For more information regarding our customers, see Note 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this report.
Research and Development
 
During fiscal years 2017 and 2016, we had no research and development investment. In addition, we currently only have one full-time employee, who is our Chief Executive Officer and President. Since we are focused on the monetization of our patent portfolio, we anticipate engaging in extremely limited or no research and development activities for the foreseeable future.
Manufacturing and Suppliers
 
Since we are focused on the monetization of our patent portfolio, our manufacturing activities and related commercial relations with suppliers are extremely limited and will likely remain so for the foreseeable future. 
Patents, Trademarks and Other Intellectual Property
 
 Our future existence and success depend in large part on our proprietary technology, including our patents, trademarks and other intellectual property, on which we have commenced efforts to monetize through enforcement actions and licensing arrangements. We also regularly consider the possibility of selling some or all of our intellectual property portfolio. We generally rely upon patent, copyright, trademark, and trade secret laws in the United States and in certain other countries, and upon confidentiality agreements with our employees, customers, and partners, to establish, maintain and protect our intellectual property rights in our proprietary technology. As of January 31, 2017, we had approximately 51 issued U.S. patents and additional U.S. patent applications pending. We also have 38 foreign patents, however, we are discontinuing maintenance of some of our foreign patents in order to focus our resources on monetization of our U.S. patent portfolio. 21 of our issued U.S. patents expired in April of 2014. However, these expired patents are still enforceable for any infringement that occurred during the last six years of the patent term and may elect to pursue certain enforcement actions on that basis. The patents we believe to be the most valuable extend into 2024. Specifically, our patent portfolio addresses sophisticated charging challenges, including charging multiple devices simultaneously and identifying power requirements of electronic devices, as well as light-weight compact form factors. In addition, we have registered trademarks in the United States for ChargeSource® and SmartTip®. 
 Government Regulation
 
Many of the products that we have produced over our history are subject to various federal, state, local and foreign laws governing substances in products and their safe use, including laws regulating the manufacture and distribution of chemical substances and laws restricting the presence of certain substances in electronics products. While we are no longer focused on manufacturing or selling products, if our existing products in the marketplace are found to be non-compliant with these laws, we could be subject to various liabilities and obligations, including sanctions, fines or product recalls.

Employees
 
As of April 1, 2017, we employed one full-time employee, who is our Chief Executive Officer and President. We also engage certain consultants on a part-time basis, including our Chief Accounting Officer. This significantly reduced headcount is the result of reductions in force targeted at reducing our cash burn.
