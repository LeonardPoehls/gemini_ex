Corporate History
 
GlyEco, Inc. (“GlyEco” or the “Company”) is a Nevada corporation, with its principal executive offices located at 230 Gill Way, Rock Hill, South Carolina, 29730.  GlyEco was formed in the State of Nevada on October 21, 2011. On that same date, the Company became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Environmental Credits, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“ECVL”). On November 21, 2011, ECVL merged itself into its wholly-owned subsidiary, GlyEco (the “Reincorporation”). Upon the consummation of the Reincorporation, the Company was the surviving corporation and the Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Company replaced the Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws of ECVL.
 
On November 28, 2011, the Company consummated a reverse triangular merger (the “Merger” or “Transaction”) as a tax-free reorganization within the meaning of Section 368 of the United States Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated November 21, 2011 (the “Merger Agreement”), with GRT Acquisition, Inc., a Nevada corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, and Global Recycling Technologies, Ltd., a Delaware corporation and privately-held operating subsidiary (“Global Recycling”). Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, GRT Acquisition, Inc. merged with and into Global Recycling, with Global Recycling being the surviving corporation and which resulted in Global Recycling becoming a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company.
 
On December 27, 2016, the Company purchased WEBA Technology Corp. (“WEBA”), a privately-owned company that develops, manufactures and markets additive packages for the antifreeze/coolant, gas patch coolants and heat transfer industries; and 96% of Recovery Solutions & Technologies Inc. (“RS&T”), a privately-owned company involved in the development and commercialization of glycol recovery technology. On December 28, 2016, the Company purchased certain glycol distillation assets from Union Carbide Corporation, a wholly-owned subsidiary of The Dow Chemical Company, at Institute, West Virginia.

GlyEco has two segments: Consumer and Industrial. Consumer’s principal business activity is the processing of waste glycol into high-quality recycled glycol products, specifically automotive antifreeze, and related specialty blended antifreeze, which we sell in the automotive and industrial end markets. We operate six processing and distribution centers located in the eastern region of the United States. Industrial’s principal business activity consists of two divisions. WEBA develops, manufactures and markets additive packages for the antifreeze/coolant, gas patch coolants and heat transfer industries throughout North America, and RS&T, which operates a 14-20 million gallons per year, ASTM E1177 EG-1, glycol re-distillation plant in West Virginia that processes waste glycol into virgin quality recycled glycol for sale to industrial customers worldwide.
 
Consumer segment
 
Prior to the December acquisitions of WEBA, RS&T and UCC assets and through December 31, 2016, the Company operated as one segment, the Consumer segment.
 
Our Consumer segment has processing and distribution centers located in (1) Minneapolis, Minnesota, (2) Indianapolis, Indiana, (3) Lakeland, Florida, (4) Rock Hill, South Carolina, (5) Tea, South Dakota, and (6) Landover, Maryland. The Minneapolis, Minnesota, Lakeland, Florida, Rock Hill, South Carolina and Tea, South Dakota facilities have distillation equipment and operations for recycling waste glycol streams as well as blending equipment and operations for mixing glycol and other chemicals to produce finished products for sale to third party customers, while the Indianapolis, Indiana and Landover, Maryland facilities currently only have blending equipment and operations for mixing glycol and other chemicals to produce finished products for sale to third party customers. We estimate that the monthly processing capacity of our four facilities with distillation equipment is approximately 100,000 gallons of ready to use finished products. We have invested significant time and money into increasing the capacity and actual production of our facilities. Our average monthly production was approximately 40,000 gallons in the first quarter of 2016 as compared to approximately 60,000 gallons in the fourth quarter of 2016. Our processing and distribution centers utilize a fleet of trucks to collect waste material for processing and delivering recycled glycol products directly to retail end users at their storefronts, which is typically 50-100 gallons per customer order. Collectively, we directly service approximately 5,000 generators of waste glycol. To meet the delivery volume needs of our existing customers, we supplement our collected and processed glycol with new or virgin glycol that we purchase in bulk from various suppliers. In addition to our retail end users, we also sell our recycled glycol products to wholesale or bulk distributors who, in turn, sell to retail end users specifically as automotive or specialty blended antifreeze. In certain markets we also sell windshield washer fluids which we do not recycle.
 
We have deployed our proprietary technology across our six processing distribution centers, allowing for safe and efficient handling of waste streams, application of our processing technology and Quality Control & Assurance Program (“QC&A”), sales of high-quality glycol products, and data systems allowing for tracking, training, and further development of our products and service.
 
Our Consumer segment product offerings include:
 

· | High-Quality Recycled Glycols - Our technology allows us to produce glycols which meet ASTM standards and can be used in any industrial application. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | Recycled Antifreeze - We formulate several universal recycled antifreeze products to meet ASTM and/or OEM manufacturer specifications for engine coolants. In addition, we custom blend recycled antifreeze to customer specifications. 
· | Recycled HVAC Fluids - We formulate a universal recycled HVAC coolant to meet ASTM and/or OEM manufacturer specifications for heating, ventilation and air conditioning fluids. In addition, we custom blend recycled HVAC coolants to customer specifications. 
· | Waste Glycol Disposal Services - Utilizing our fleet of collection/delivery trucks, we collect waste glycol from generators for recycling. We coordinate large batches of waste glycol to be picked up from generators and delivered to our processing centers for recycling or in some cases to be safely disposed. 
· | Windshield Washer Fluid - In certain markets we sell windshield washer fluids which we do not recycle. 

 
We currently sell and deliver all of our products in bulk containers (55 gallon barrels, 250 gallon totes, etc.) or variable metered bulk quantities.
 
We began developing innovative new methods for recycling glycols in 1999. We recognized a need in the market to improve the quality of recycled glycol being returned to retail customers. In addition, we believed through process technology, systems, and footprint we could clean more types of waste glycol in a more cost efficient manner. Each type of industrial waste glycol contains a different list of impurities which traditional waste antifreeze processing does not clean effectively. Additionally, many of the contaminants left behind using these processes - such as esters, organic acids and high dissolved solids - leave the recycled material risky to use in vehicles or machinery.

Our proprietary and patented technology removes difficult pollutants, including esters, organic acids, high dissolved solids and high un-dissolved solids in addition to the benefit of clearing oil/hydrocarbons, additives and dyes that are typically found in used engine coolants. Our QC&A program (Quality Control & Assurance) seeks to ensure consistently high quality, ASTM (American Society for Testing and Materials) standard compliant recycled material. Our products are trusted in all vehicle makes and models, regional fleet, local auto, and national retailers. Our proprietary QC&A program is managed and supported by dedicated process and chemical engineering staff, requires periodic onsite field audits, and ongoing training by our facility managing partners.
 
Industrial Segment
 
Our Industrial segment consists of two divisions: WEBA, our additives business, and RS&T, our glycol re-distillation plant in West Virginia.
 
WEBA develops, manufactures and markets additive packages for the antifreeze/coolant, gas patch coolants and heat transfer industries throughout North America. We believe WEBA is one of the largest companies serving the North American additive market. WEBA's METALGUARD® additive package product line includes one-step inhibitor systems, which give our customers the ability to easily make various types of antifreeze concentrate and 50/50 coolants for all automobiles, heavy-duty diesel engines, stationary engines in gas patch and other applications. METALGUARD additive packages cover the entire range of coolant types from basic green conventional to the newest extended life OAT antifreezes of all colors. Our heat transfer fluid additives allow our customers to make finished heat transfer fluids for most industry applications including all-aluminum systems. The METALGUARD heat transfer fluids include light and heavy-duty fluids, both propylene and ethylene glycol based, for various operating temperatures. These inhibitors cover the industry standard of phosphate-based inhibitors as well as all-organic (OAT) inhibitors for specific pH range and aluminum system requirements.
 
All of the METALGUARD products are tested at our in-house laboratory facility and by third-party laboratories to assure conformance. We use the standards set by ASTM (American Society of Testing Materials) for all of our products. All of our products pass the most current ASTM standards and testing for each type of product. Our manufacturing facility conforms to the highest levels of process quality control including ISO 9001 certification.
 
RS&T operates a 14-20 million gallons per year, ASTM E1177 EG-1, glycol re-distillation plant in West Virginia, which processes waste glycol into virgin quality recycled glycol for sale to industrial customers worldwide. The facility is uniquely designed to process industrial waste glycol. It utilizes the only currently active process that produces a product that both meets the virgin glycol antifreeze grade specification, ASTM E1177 EG-1, and achieves the important aesthetic requirement for most applications of having no odor. It is the largest glycol re-distillation plant in North America, with a capacity of 14-20 million gallons per year, several times higher processing capacity than the next largest glycol recycling facility. The facility, located at the Dow Institute Site at Institute, WV, includes five distillation columns, three wiped-film evaporators, heat exchangers, processing and storage tanks, and other processing equipment. The facility’s tanks include feedstock storage capacity of several million gallons and finished goods storage capacity of several million gallons. The plant is equipped with rail and truck unloading/loading facilities, and on-site barge loading/unloading facilities.

Our Industry
 
Background on Glycol
 
Glycols are man-made liquid chemicals derived from natural gas and crude oil - non-renewable and limited natural resources. Glycols are used as a base chemical component in five primary industries:

1. | Automotive - Glycols are used as antifreeze in vehicles and other equipment with a combustion engine. 
---+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. | HVAC - Glycols are in the heat transfer fluids used to warm and cool buildings. 
3. | Textiles - Glycols are used as a raw material in the manufacturing of polyester fiber and plastics (e.g. water bottles). 
4. | Airline - Glycols are used in aircraft deicing fluid to avoid accumulation of moisture on aircraft wings. 
5. | Medical - Glycols are used for equipment sterilization in the medical industry. 

 
Glycols are also used extensively in the Oil & Gas/Exploration & Production industry, which is an industry segment we plan to focus considerable effort on during the upcoming 2017 year.


During use in these industries, glycol becomes contaminated with impurities. Impurities in waste glycol vary depending on the industry source, with each waste stream containing different amounts of water, glycols, dirt, metals, and oils. Most waste glycol is landfilled, sent to waste water treatment, released to surface water, or disposed of improperly, wasting an important natural resource and causing a negative effect on our environment. Because of rapid biodegradability of glycol, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) allows disposal by “release to surface waters.” However, when glycols break down in water they deplete oxygen levels, which kill fish and other aquatic life. Exposure to ethylene glycol can be hazardous and may cause death for humans, animals, birds, fish, and plants.
 
There are different types of glycol, including propylene glycol and ethylene glycol. Through the use of our technology, assets and expertise, we generally focus on ethylene glycol but can work with any type of glycol. Virgin ethylene glycol is produced in petrochemical plants using the ethane/ethylene extracted from natural gas or cracked from crude oil in refineries. Ethylene is oxidized in these petrochemical plants to ethylene oxide, which is then hydrated to form ethylene glycol. Glycols are also used in other applications such as paints and coatings, but these uses do not produce waste glycol, thus are not relevant to our business.
 
Glycol and Antifreeze Market
 
World-wide consumption for ethylene glycol is over 5.5 billion gallons per year. China and the United States are the largest consumers of ethylene glycol (“EG”), with the majority of EG being used in polyester and antifreeze applications. While the growth rate of EG consumption has slowed, demand continues to exceed supply for ethylene glycol, largely because of growth in polyester manufacturing used to make clothing, plastic containers, and plastic beverage bottles. The United States consumes approximately 700 million gallons of EG per year, with over 160 million gallons being used in antifreeze applications.
 
It is estimated that only 15% of waste antifreeze is recycled, equaling approximately 25 million gallons recycled per year (Environmental Protection Agency).

Glycol Recycling
 
Companies began recycling waste glycol in the 1980s. Material technological advances and market acceptance of recycled glycol did not occur until the 1990s, but recyclers rarely processed any other type of glycol than waste automotive antifreeze. To this day, recyclers still generally focus on automotive antifreeze, as waste glycol from the other industries have unique impurities and are challenging to process. The glycol recycling industry is generally fragmented with many small to mid-sized companies throughout North America that recycle glycol, antifreeze, and/or other glycol-based liquids. Additionally, a few used motor-oil recyclers who operate in multi-state regions also collect and recycle waste antifreeze. The most common methods of glycol recycling include distillation, nanofiltration, and electrodialysis.
Glycol Recycling Standards
 
The American Society for Testing and Materials (“ASTM”), Original Equipment Manufacturers (“OEM”), and various states have developed guidelines and regulations that govern the quality of virgin and recycled glycol. ASTM is recognized as the independent leader in creating standards for the composition of antifreeze and other glycol-based products. ASTM sets both performance standards (e.g. specifications for engine coolant used in light- and heavy-duty automobiles) and general purity standards. OEMs set particular standards for the individual needs and preferences for the vehicles/equipment they each manufacture. GlyEco is, and will continue to be, a leader in producing high quality recycled glycol and finished products such as antifreeze and heat transfer fluids, while meeting or exceeding ASTM and OEM specifications.
Competition
 
We compete in the highly fragmented specialty chemicals industry.  We operate in highly competitive markets and face competition in each of our product categories and subcategories. The participants in the industry offer a varied and broad array of product lines designed to meet specific customer requirements.  Participants compete with individual and service product offerings on a global, regional and/or local level subject to the nature of the businesses and products, as well as the end-markets and customers served.  Competition is based on several key criteria, including product performance and quality, product price, product availability and security of supply, responsiveness of product development in cooperation with customers, customer service, industry knowledge and technical capability.  Most key competitors are significantly larger than GlyEco and have greater financial resources, leading to greater operating and financial flexibility.
 
The glycol recycling industry, a key submarket for GlyEco, is comprised primarily of independent recyclers who operate within their own geographic region. The industry is fragmented with multiple small to mid-sized independent recyclers spread out across the United States. Many operations are companies still owned by the original entrepreneur that founded the company, or they are a division of a larger chemical operation where glycol recycling is only a small portion of the business. Additionally, a few used motor-oil recyclers who operate in multistate regions also collect and recycle waste antifreeze. The majority of recycled glycol from these operations is sold into secondary markets as generic automotive antifreeze. This material is often mixed with refinery-grade glycol to dilute remaining impurities and because the quality does not meet the standards of many buyers and certain industries as a whole. These glycol recycling competitors actively seek to purchase waste glycol from local, regional, and national collectors, competition which can increase the price to obtain such waste.
 
Other competitors include refinery grade glycol manufacturers (e.g. MEGlobal and SABIC), antifreeze producers (e.g. Prestone and Old World), antifreeze distributors (e.g. Nexeo and Brenntag), and waste collectors and recyclers (e.g. Safety Kleen; Heritage-Crystal Clean).
 
Suppliers
 
We purchase raw materials from multiple sources of supply primarily in the United States. 
 
Waste glycol is a significant raw material. We conduct business with a number of waste glycol generators, including specialty chemical companies, as well as waste collectors that have varied operations in solid, hazardous, special, and liquid waste. Our consumer segment collects waste glycol directly from approximately 5,000 generators, such as oil change service stations, automotive and heavy equipment repair shops, automotive dealerships, vehicle fleet operations, plastic bottle manufacturers, virgin glycol refineries, and other companies that generate waste glycol. We also receive waste glycol from waste collectors that act as a “one-stop shop” for companies generating a variety of waste including oil, glycol, solvents, and solid waste. At our consumer segment processing centers, we receive the majority of our waste glycol from waste generators, with the balance coming from waste collectors. Our consumer segment normally collects waste glycol from waste generators in volumes between 50 and 100 gallons. We also receive waste glycol in bulk loads by trucks and railcars from waste collectors and generators. Depending on the type of waste glycol and the chemical composition of that glycol, we may pay the collector/generators to take the material, take it for free, or pay for the material.

Seasonality
 
Our business is affected by seasonal factors, mainly the demand for automotive antifreeze, which can affect our sales volume and the price point. Because the demand for automotive antifreeze is typically higher in winter months, we often see an increase in sales during the first and fourth quarters.
Regulation
 
Although glycol can be considered a hazardous material, there are few federal rules or regulations governing its characterization, transportation, packaging, processing, or disposal (e.g. handling). Typically any regulations that address such activities occur at either the state and/or county level and can vary significantly from region to region. For example, while a majority of states do not regulate the resale of recycled glycol in any manner, a few states do regulate the quality of recycled glycol that can be resold in the market as antifreeze by requiring that all branded recycled antifreeze be tested and approved before resale can occur.
 
Regarding the handling of waste glycol, most states have little to no regulation specifically regarding the handling of waste glycol. Instead, the handling of waste glycol is typically regulated under state-level hazardous waste and solid waste regulations. Waste glycol is not automatically characterized as a hazardous waste by the states, but it can be considered hazardous if the waste material is tested and contains a certain amount of contaminants, such as lead. For example, the State of Indiana published guidance explaining that used antifreeze is not a “listed” hazardous waste, but it can be identified as a hazardous waste if it is contaminated from use or mixture with other wastes. Importantly, a handful of states grant an exception to handlers of waste glycol allowing them to not have to test their waste material if its destination is a recycling facility. This is a notable exception that allows the glycol recycling industry to function without significant barriers. For example, the State of Minnesota does not require used antifreeze destined for recycling to be evaluated. Additionally, some states exempt the handling of waste glycol from the application of state-level hazardous waste regulations if the waste material is recycled according to certain best management practices (BMPs) identified by the states. BMPs often relate to the labeling and storage of waste glycol and to proper recordkeeping. For example, the State of Florida exempts used antifreeze generated by vehicle repair facilities from the application of the state’s hazardous waste regulations if it is recycled according to the BMPs outlined by the state. The handling of waste glycol is also often regulated by state-level solid waste regulations, as such regulations typically define “solid waste” to include spent liquids. However, similar to state-level hazardous waste regulations, an exception sometimes applies that exempts the handling of waste glycol from the application of state-level solid waste regulations if the waste glycol is being recycled and therefore does not pose any threat to public health or the environment.
 
A few states and localities require a license or permit to process waste glycol. The cost of such licenses and permits to process waste glycol can vary from less than one hundred dollars to a few thousand dollars. Recyclers are often left with hazardous metals or chemicals as a byproduct of their process, for which they pay a nominal fee to register with the state and/or county as a hazardous waste generator and pay for the waste to be incinerated or disposed of in some other environmentally friendly way.
 
As a handler of glycol, we are subject to the requirements of the United States Occupational Safety and Health Act (“OSHA”) and comparable state laws that regulate the protection of employee health and safety. OSHA’s hazard communication standard requires that information about hazardous materials used or produced in our operations be maintained and provided to employees, state and local government authorities and citizens.
 
We also conduct interstate motor carrier operations that are subject to federal regulation by the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (“FMCSA”), a unit within the United States Department of Transportation, (“USDOT”). The FMCSA publishes and enforces comprehensive trucking safety regulations, including rules on commercial driver licensing, controlled substance testing, medical and other qualifications for drivers, equipment maintenance, and drivers’ hours of service. Another unit within USDOT publishes and enforces regulations regarding the transportation of hazardous materials, but our interstate motor carrier operations are not typically regulated as hazmat (hazardous materials) at this time.

In addition to taking the necessary precautions and maintaining the required permits/licenses, glycol recyclers generally take out environmental liability insurance policies to mitigate any risks associated with the handling of waste glycol. We believe we have appropriate procedures in place to so that permits, licenses, and insurance policies are in place to mitigate risks stemming from the actions of our employees or third parties.
 
Internationally, the regulation of waste glycol varies from country to country. Some countries have strong regulations, meaning they specifically identify waste glycol as a hazardous waste that requires particular handling (e.g. transportation, collection, processing, packaging, resale, and disposal). Other countries have fewer regulations, meaning they do not specifically identify waste glycol as a hazardous waste that requires particular handling, allowing producers of waste glycol to dispose of the waste in ways that may harm the environment. Europe and Canada have strong regulations. Aside from the United States, Canada, and Europe, the remainder of the world generally has weak regulations. Despite strong regulations in certain parts of the world, we believe the United States is the only market with an established glycol recycling industry. Strong regulations are favorable for glycol recyclers because it causes waste generators to track their waste, resulting in more waste glycol supply for recyclers, and therefore potentially lower prices for raw material.
 
Intellectual Property
 
On March 15, 2013, we filed a utility patent application for our GlyEco Technology™ processes with the United States Patent and Trademark Office (“USPTO”) claiming priority to the provisional patent application that we filed in August of 2012. This utility patent application was approved and issued by the USPTO on September 29, 2015. We maintain and use several service marks including “GlyEcoÒ”, “Innovative Green ChemistryÒ”, “GlyEco CertifiedÒ”, and “GlyEco Technology”. In addition, we have developed a website and have registered www.glyeco.com as our domain name, which contains information we do not desire to incorporate by reference herein.
 
GlyEco University is our center for intellectual property, advanced development group, and both internal and external glycol and GlyEco course training. We have begun to operate a larger facility in South Carolina, specifically, Rock Hill, SC, for our QC&A, research and advanced development group headquarters. Our commitment to the glycol recycling industry requires our organization to advance product and operational technologies. We will continue to apply for intellectual property protection as identified, however we continue to focus primarily on proprietary and process secrets to advance our ownership in the industry. We have recently created strategic partnerships which have expanded our product reach based on proprietary knowledge of process technology. As new and unique glycol waste streams are introduced, we will add to our knowledge and intellectual property that will leverage back to our internal staff and strategic partners.
