Financial Information About Geographic Areas
During the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, our operations were exclusively in the United States.
Employees
As of March 4, 2018, we had a total of 373 employees, which included 363 full-time and ten part-time employees. These employees included 82 unionized employees at our subsidiary, C and C Power Line, Inc. (“C&C”). The total number of employees includes 323 hourly-rate employees. The number of hourly-rate employees fluctuates depending upon the number and size of projects under construction at any particular time. We believe that our relationship with our employees is good.
Electrical Construction Operations
Through our subsidiaries, Power Corporation of America (“PCA”), Southeast Power Corporation (“Southeast Power”) and C&C, we are engaged in the construction of electrical infrastructure for the utility industry and industrial customers. Southeast Power and C&C operate under Power Corporation of America, headquartered in Port Orange, Florida. Southeast Power is headquartered in Titusville, Florida, and has additional offices in Bastrop, Texas and Spartanburg, South Carolina. C&C, headquartered in Jacksonville, Florida, is a full service electrical contractor that provides similar services as Southeast Power with a unionized work force. 
Our electrical construction business includes the construction of transmission lines, distribution systems, substations, drilled pier foundations and other electrical services. 
Representative customers include:

Santee Cooper (South Carolina Public Service Authority) | Central Electric Power Cooperative, Inc.
Florida Power & Light Company | Duke Energy Corporation 
CPS Energy | Orlando Utilities Commission 
Lower Colorado River Authority | Lee County Electric Cooperative 

Historically, a significant portion of our revenue has come from several different customers each year. Our largest customers may change from year to year. For the year ended December 31, 2017, our top three customers accounted for approximately 58.7% of our consolidated revenue. Since the contribution of a customer may vary from year to year, we cannot predict the future effect of the loss of any given customer.
It is our policy to commit ourselves only to the amount of work we believe we can properly supervise, equip and complete to the customer’s satisfaction and timetable. As a result of this policy and the magnitude of some of the construction projects undertaken by us, a substantial portion of our annual revenue is derived from a relatively small number of customers. See note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for detail on sales to major customers that exceed 10% of total sales.
Construction is customarily performed pursuant to plans and specifications of customers. We generally supply the management, labor, equipment and tools, while customers generally supply most of the required materials, except we generally supply most of the required materials for the construction of concrete foundations. We are not presently experiencing, nor do we anticipate experiencing, any difficulties in procuring an adequate supply of materials.

Revenue and results of operations in our electrical construction business can be subject to seasonal variations. These variations are influenced by weather, customer spending patterns and system loads. Project duration varies based on project type, complexity and customer requirements.
We enter into contracts on the basis of either competitive bidding, direct negotiations or pursuant to master service agreements (“MSAs”). Competitively bid contracts and MSAs account for a majority of our electrical construction revenue. Although there is considerable variation in the terms of the contracts undertaken, such contracts are typically lump sum (fixed-price) or unit price contracts. Most of our contracts do not require our clients to purchase a minimum amount of services, and some of our contracts are cancelable on short notice. 
In certain circumstances, we are required to provide performance and payment bonds issued by a surety to secure our contractual commitments. These bonds provide a guarantee to the customer that we will perform under the terms of a contract and that we will pay subcontractors and vendors. If we fail to perform under a contract or to pay subcontractors and vendors, the customer may demand the surety make payments or provide services under the bond. Management is not aware of any performance bonds issued for us that have ever been called by a customer. We currently believe that we will not have to fund any claims under our surety arrangements in the foreseeable future. We believe that we have adequate bonding availability for our operations. As of December 31, 2017, outstanding performance bonds issued on behalf of our electrical construction subsidiaries amounted to $58.2 million. 
Contracts may include retention provisions. From 5% to 10% is withheld by the customer from progress payments as retainage until the contract work has been completed and approved.
Backlog
Our backlog represents future services to be performed under existing project-specific fixed-price and maintenance contracts and the estimated value of future services that we expect to provide under our existing MSAs.
The following table presents our total backlog as of December 31, 2017 and 2016 along with an estimate of the backlog amounts expected to be realized within 12 months and during the life of each of the MSAs. The existing MSAs have remaining renewals ranging from one to three years at the option of the customer. The calculation assumes exercise of the renewal options by the customer. Revenue from assumed exercise of renewal options represents $131.2 million (70.1%) of our total estimated MSA backlog as of December 31, 2017. 

 | Backlog as of | | Backlog as of 
 | December 31, 2017 | | December 31, 2016
Electrical Construction Operations | 12-Month | | Total | | 12-Month | | Total 
Project-Specific Firm Contracts (1) | $ | 27,110,793 | | | $ | 27,110,793 | | $ | 27,094,081 | $ | 27,094,081 
Estimated MSAs | 83,124,471 | | | 187,047,802 | | | 70,464,180 | | 162,923,289
Total | $ | 110,235,264 | | | $ | 214,158,595 | | $ | 97,558,261 | $ | 190,017,370
(1)Amount includes firm contract awards under MSA agreements.

Our 12-month backlog as of December 31, 2017, increased $12.7 million (13.0%) to $110.2 million, due to the successful renewal of an MSA agreement and adjustments to existing MSA backlog estimates, partially offset by existing MSA backlog run off. 
Our total backlog as of December 31, 2017, increased $24.1 million (12.7%) to $214.2 million, compared to $190.0 million as of December 31, 2016. The increase in total backlog is primarily due to the aforementioned successful renewal of an MSA agreement and adjustments to existing MSA backlog estimates, partially offset by existing MSA backlog run off.
Of our total backlog as of December 31, 2017, we expect approximately $110.2 million (51.5%) to be completed during 2018.
Backlog is estimated at a particular point in time and is not determinative of total revenue in any particular period. It does not reflect future revenue from a significant number of short-term projects undertaken and completed between the estimated dates. Our electrical construction revenue in 2017 exceeded our 12-month backlog as of December 31, 2016 by 11.9%.
The estimated amount of backlog for work under MSAs is calculated by using recurring historical trends inherent in current MSAs and projected customer needs based upon ongoing communications with the customer. Our estimated backlog also assumes exercise of existing customer renewal options. Certain MSAs are not exclusive to the Company and, therefore, the size and amount of projects we may be awarded cannot be determined with certainty. Accordingly, the amount of future revenue from MSA contracts may vary substantially from reported backlog. Even if we realize all of the revenue from the projects in our backlog, there is no guarantee of profit from the projects awarded under MSAs.

As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, MSAs accounted for approximately 87.3% and 85.7% of total backlog, respectively. We plan to continue our efforts to grow MSA business. MSA contracts are generally multi-year and should provide improved operating efficiencies.
Backlog is not a term recognized under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, but is a common measurement used in our industry. While we believe that our methodology of calculation is appropriate, such methodology may not be comparable to that employed by some other companies. Given the duration of our contracts and MSAs and our method of calculating backlog, our backlog at any point in time may not accurately represent the revenue that we expect to realize during any period, and our backlog as of the end of the year may not be indicative of the revenue we expect to earn in the following year and should not be viewed or relied upon as a stand-alone indicator. Consequently, we cannot provide assurance as to our customers’ requirements or our estimates of backlog.
Revenue estimates included in our backlog may be subject to change as a result of project accelerations, additions, cancellations or delays due to various factors, including but not limited to: commercial issues, material deficiencies, permitting, regulatory requirements and adverse weather. Our customers are not contractually committed to a specific level of services under our MSAs (other than project-specific firm contracts under MSAs). While we did not experience any material cancellations during the current period, most of our contracts may be terminated, even if we are not in default under the contract. 
For further information regarding the factors that affect the realizability of profits from our business backlog, please refer to the information set forth in “Item 1A. Risk Factors.”
Competition and Regulation
The electrical construction business is highly competitive. We compete with other independent contractors, including larger regional and national firms that may have financial, operational, technical and marketing resources that exceed our own. Competitive factors include: level of technical expertise and experience, industry reputation, quality of work, price, geographic presence, dependability, availability of skilled personnel, worker safety and financial stability. Our management believes that we compete favorably with our competitors on the basis of these factors. There can be no assurance that our competitors will not develop the expertise, experience and resources to provide services that are superior in both price and quality to our services, or that we will be able to maintain or enhance our competitive position.
We are subject to various federal, state and local statutes and rules regarding, among other things, contractor licensing, electrical codes, worker safety and environmental protection. We believe that we are in substantial compliance with all applicable regulatory requirements.
Properties
The Company and its subsidiaries operate with owned or leased offices and facilities located in Florida, South Carolina and Texas. Individually, none of the properties are financially significant to the Company. We believe that such properties are currently in good condition and properly maintained. See note 8 to the consolidated financial statements for additional detail on properties.
Other Operations - Real Estate Development
Our real estate development operations are not significant for reporting purposes and, accordingly, results of the ongoing real estate development operations are included in the income statement under the caption “Other.” Revenue from real estate development under the caption “Other” was $4.8 million and $4.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, representing approximately 4% of our total revenue for both years. Our current real estate development activity is the construction of single and multi-family residential projects in Brevard County, Florida.
