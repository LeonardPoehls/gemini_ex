ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Corporate Background
 
Elite Data Services, Inc., (“DEAC”), formerly Dynamic Energy Alliance Corporation (the “Company”), was incorporated in the State of Florida on November 23, 1981 as Mammathetics Corp. On November 4, 2013, the Board of Directors approved the proposal to change the name of the company from Dynamic Energy Alliance Corporation to Elite Data Services, Inc. 
 
From 1981 through the first quarter of 2011, the Company’s business was that of a marketer of tumor detection equipment. On March 9, 2011, the Company shifted its focus to the recoverable energy sector. In 2013, the Company transitioned its operations to offering web-based marketing services for the automotive industry through owned and operated online platforms. Further, in 2014, the Company acquired licensing and distribution rights to operate gaming machines in Honduras and Roatan. Both the online marketing and gaming operations continued from 2014 through December 31, 2016. 
 
On May 18, 2016, we restructured the Company resulting in the online marketing assets and operations being transferred into a newly formed entity, Elite Data Marketing LLC, a Florida corporation, as a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. On same date, we also created Elite Gaming Ventures LLC, a Florida limited liability company, as a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, to own and operate Elite Data Holdings S.A., a Honduras corporation, which was designated to handle all the gaming operations under a newly formed joint venture.
 
On August 26, 2016, the Company entered into a definitive agreement to acquire 100% of WOD Market LLC ("WOD"), a Colorado limited liability company and provider of intelligent retail solutions for gym owners and coaches, in three (3) separate closings with the final closing anticipated on October 15, 2016. 
 
For the period ending December 31, 2016, we were a technology driven management company which owned and operated online marketing and gaming businesses. In addition, we continued to pursue the acquisition of WOD, which did not close as anticipated on October 15, 2016.
 
Subsequently, on January 10, 2017, the Company executed the first amendment to the purchase of WOD to extend the second closing date from on or about September 15, 2016 to on or about March 31, 2017, and further extend the third and final closing date from on or about October 15, 2016 to on or about June 30, 2017, respectively.
 
On March 14, 2017, the Company executed a note cancellation agreement and assignment with Baker & Myers & Associates LLC (“Baker Myers”) which resulted in Elite Data Marketing LLC no longer being a subsidiary of the Company, with no further operational effect or obligation to the Company. On same date, Company executed a joint venture termination agreement with H Y H Investments S.A. (“HYHI”) which resulted in Elite Gaming Ventures LLC (and, its wholly-owned subsidiary, Elite Data Holdings S.A.) no longer being a subsidiary of the Company, with no further operational effect or obligation to the Company, except for certain amounts owed by the Company under a further amendment to the Amended and Restated Redeemable Note (as more fully described herein) executed on May 18, 2016.
 
Concurrently, on March 14, 2017, Company executed the second amendment to the definitive agreement, as amended, which further amended certain terms of the WOD purchase, including the formation of a joint venture to further develop and manage the current WOD business.
 
Under the terms of the Joint Venture, the Company retained its original 20% ownership interest of WOD, with the remaining 80% owned by WOD Holdings Inc. (“WODH”), a Delaware corporation majority owned by Brenton Mix and Taryn Watson, with the option of the Company to provide additional capital contributions to WOD in increments of not less than $10,000 up to a total of $8 million dollars in the aggregate, which would include an equity exchange of up to a total of 800 units (80%) of WOD owned initially by WODH to the Company for a total of approximately 199,000 shares of Series B Preferred Stock and approximately 19,801,000 shares of Common Stock of the Company (the “Shares”) to be issued to WODH, but held and then released upon the completion of a final closing on or before December 31, 2018.

Until a minimum of at least $4 million in additional capital contributions have been made by the Company to WOD, resulting in a controlling ownership interest of not less than 60% of WOD by the Company, all the Shares of Company stock earmarked for the equity exchange with WODH is being held in a Voting Trust (as defined elsewhere in this filing), along with other key shareholder positions, in order to recapitalize the Company post a 1:1000 reverse split (which was previously approved), pending effectiveness after the Company becomes a current as fully-reporting public company, and thereafter sets a precise effective date and completes the required filing with the State of Florida.
 
Today, the Company is a retail focused management company which owns currently a 20% minority interest of WOD, under a joint venture agreement with WODH to provide intelligent retail solutions for gym owners and coaches, including the management of retail sales, up front inventory purchases, ongoing inventory management, payments, marketing, and related services.
 
On the Original Filing Date, the Company was delinquent on its annual report filing for 2016 with the State of Florida. On January 24, 2017, the Company filed for reinstatement and is currently an active corporation in the State of Florida. Said delinquency had no negative effective on the Company or any transaction completed during such delinquent period, and no parties have challenged the validity of any executed agreement during such time.

Online Marketing Platforms
 
On January 13, 2014, the Company entered into an asset purchase agreement with Baker Myers and Associates, LLC (“Baker Myers”) to acquire certain assets including, www.classifiedride.com, an online classified listing website where private sellers can buy, sell, and trade their vehicle. ClassifiedRide provides a classified listing platform where users list their vehicle, truck, boat (i.e. anything that has a motor) to the Company’s website (either by free or paid listing options). The main premise of the website is to aid the private seller in selling or trading their vehicle. The Company, in turn, then works as the community leader to establish relationships between buyers and sellers using social media platforms and consumer customer support incentives. These relationships are used to generate revenue from private sellers, dealerships, affiliate lead providers, and third party advertisers.
 
On January 15, 2014, the Company entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement with Baker Myers LLC for 51% of the membership interest of Autoglance, LLC, a Tennessee Limited Liability Company, and with it majority control over all owned assets of Autoglance, LLC, including the website www.autoglance.com (collectively “Autoglance”) for 765,000 shares the Company’s common stock as consideration. Autoglance is a search engine of used cars that prioritizes and compares inventory in individualized markets by displaying the best deals first while hiding listings that are older, more expensive, and have more mileage. Autoglance currently has a provisional patent for this method of organizing and displaying vehicles. More specifically, Autoglance’s invention group’s vehicles of the same make and model in a market location to determine the best price based on the market value of the vehicle. Vehicles that are deemed worse deals are hidden from the user. The user cans easily see hidden cars if he/she wishes by the click of a button.
 
On May 20, 2016, the Company executed an Assignment of Ownership Interest with its newly formed subsidiary, Elite Data Marketing LLC, pursuant to which the Company assigned and transferred (A) a certain amount of Company's ownership interest held in www.classifiedride.com, an online classified listing website (the "ClassifiedRide"), equal to an aggregate total of one hundred percent (100%) of the ownership interest of the ClassifiedRide asset (the "ClassifiedRide Asset"), acquired by the Company from Baker Myers, on or about January 13, 2014, and (B) a certain amount of Company's ownership interest in Autoglance LLC, a Tennessee limited liability company (the "Autoglance"), equal to an aggregate total of fifty-one percent (51%) of the units of membership interest (the "Autoglance Units"), including, but not limited to, the majority control over all owned assets of Autoglance, acquired by the Company from Baker Myers, on or about January 15, 2014.

The Cancellation Transaction and Assignment resulted in Elite Data Marketing LLC no longer being a subsidiary of the Company, with no further operational effect or obligation to the Company.
 
Gaming Operations
 
On April 4, 2015, the Company entered into a Agreement and Promissory Note (the “Note”) with H y H Investments, S.A. (the “Seller”) for the purchase of all outstanding securities of El Muerto Beauty Mineral, Sociedad Anonima (hereafter “EMBM”) whose sole asset consists of a license to operate 80 gaming machines in La Lima, 80 gaming machines in Trujillo, and 160 gaming machines in Roatan, the largest of the bay islands of Honduras. The Company entered into contract to acquire the shares of EMBM and not the license directly as the license is in the name of EMBM. The total purchase price for the license was Ten Million Dollars ($10,000,000) payable in the form of a Promissory Note (the “Note”). The Company tendered $100,000 as a non-refundable good-faith deposit under the terms of the Note that is applicable towards the purchase price which allows permitted use of EMBM’s assets as long as we are in good standing in regards to our payments as further discussed below.
 
Pursuant to the first Amendment, the Company owes no further obligation under the terms of the Note until April 6, 2016, at which time $900,000 is due to the Seller, payable in the form of cash or shares of common stock of the Company at the option of the note holder. If the seller elects to convert such payment or a portion of such payment into shares, the value of the shares will be assessed at the average closing price of the common stock of the Company for the five trading days immediately proceeding April 6, 2016. If the Seller elects to receive cash, and we do not have the cash on hand to satisfy the obligation, pursuant to Section 4.3 of the Securities Purchase Agreement, the Seller has the right to terminate the entire Agreement, unwind the transaction and assume ownership of the EMBM shares if the Company is unable to negotiate an extension or alternate arrangement. The remaining balance under the Note is payable up to $2,500,000 per year thereafter through March 31, 2021 by either cash payments or by a revenue-share of 25% of the net revenues received by EMBM during such time period. In the event that Seller has not received the full amount due on or before March 31, 2021, such amount due may be payable via the issuance of the Company’s shares at the average closing price of the Company’s common stock for the five trading days immediately preceding March 31, 2021. Beginning on or after April 17, 2017, payments tendered in the Company’s common stock may be repurchased by the Company given the Seller’s approval. The Seller agreed to waive interest payments of 3.85% per annum, due in monthly installments, in exchange for a sub-license granting the Seller usage of twenty-five (25) machines in the municipality of Roatan.

On June 30, 2015, the Company amended the Note to reflect an effective date of April 6, 2016 in conjunction with the first payment of Nine Hundred Thousand Dollars ($900,000) which is due in either cash, stock, or 25% of the net revenues of EMBM’s operations. The Note was also amended to reflect the current purchase price owed ($9,900,000) April 6, 2016, which deducts the $100,000 non-refundable deposit tendered on April 6, 2015. The business purpose for this amendment was to allow the Company the proper time to incorporate a Honduras corporation to be in compliance with the laws of the Republic of Honduras to effectively be able to transact business in that municipality.
 
The license permits operation and/or distribution of gaming machines at different locations as follows: Eighty (80) gaming machines in La Lima, Eighty (80) gaming machines in Trujillo, and One Hundred and Sixty (160) gaming machines in Roatan, the largest of the bay islands of Honduras.

Pursuant to the terms of the Third Amendment, the parties mutually agreed to cancel the Original Purchase Agreement dated April 6, 2015, in exchange for a new Joint Venture Agreement (the "Joint Venture") executed on even date therewith, pursuant to which the Company and HYHI agreed to create a joint venture relationship using Elite Data Holdings S.A., a Honduras corporation, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Elite Gaming Ventures LLC, a Florida limited liability company ("EVG"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, and a distributor license from HYHI and El Mar Muerto Beauty Mineral, S.A., a Honduras corporation ("EMBM") to establish gaming operations (the "Purpose") by distributing and maintaining a total of eighty (80) slot machines in the cities of La Lima, Cortes; eighty (80) slot machines in the cities of Trujillo, Colon; and One Hundred and Sixty (160) slot machines in Roatan in the bay island of Honduras.

The Joint Venture also included the option of the Company and EVG to acquire the ownership of EMBM and License directly, within thirty (30) days of the date payment in full of the Total Consideration is made to HYHI pursuant to the Agreement, at which time, EVG and Company would have the right to exercise an option (the "Option") to acquire one hundred percent (100%) of EMBM, including, but not limited to, any and all assets (e.g. gaming licenses, etc.), and liabilities required to continue the gaming operation set forth by the Joint Venture, for a purchase price of (USD $10.00) (the "Option Payment"), paid by the Company to HYHI.
