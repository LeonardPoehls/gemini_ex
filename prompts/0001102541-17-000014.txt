Item 1.    Business.
Overview 
EarthLink Holdings Corp. (“EarthLink” or the “Company”), together with our consolidated subsidiaries, is a leading managed network, security and cloud services provider to business and residential customers in the United States. We provide a broad range of data, voice and managed network services to retail and wholesale business customers. We also provide nationwide Internet access and related value-added services to residential customers. We operate an extensive network including more than 29,000 route miles of fiber and 90 metro fiber rings that provide data and voice IP service coverage across more than 90 percent of the United States.
Our corporate offices are located at 1170 Peachtree Street NE, Suite 900, Atlanta, Georgia 30309, and our telephone number at that location is (404) 815-0770. Our website address is www.earthlink.com.
History
We were incorporated in 2013 as a Delaware corporation through the creation of a holding company structure. We began operations in 1994 as a provider of nationwide Internet access and related value-added services to residential customers. In 1996, we first expanded into the small to mid-sized business market by introducing business-class Internet access and web hosting services to businesses nationwide. In 2006, we expanded into the enterprise business market by acquiring a provider of managed IP-based network solutions to businesses nationwide. As the market for consumer Internet access began to mature, we began to seek additional growth opportunities. During 2010 through 2013, we acquired eight companies which transformed our business from being primarily an Internet services provider to residential customers into a network, communications and IT services provider for business customers. During that time we were focused on integrating our acquired businesses and managing a broad portfolio of products and services. During 2014 and 2015, we established a more focused strategy for our company and stabilized and simplified our business in order to position our company for growth and transform into a leading managed network, security and cloud services provider. In 2016, we sold certain assets associated with our IT services product offerings in connection with our strategy to simplify our operations and provide more flexibility to invest in new capabilities and services to drive growth in our core business. Also in 2016, as part of our strategy to invest in new capabilities and services to drive growth, we acquired a privately-held management consulting firm focused on the retail industry that will enable us to provide additional professional services to our retailer customers.
In November 2016, we entered into a definitive merger agreement with Windstream Holdings, Inc. (“Windstream”) under which EarthLink and Windstream will merge in an all-stock transaction valued at approximately $1.1 billion. Under the terms of the merger agreement, EarthLink’s stockholders will receive 0.818 shares of Windstream common stock for each EarthLink share owned. Upon closing of the transaction, we expect Windstream stockholders will own approximately 51% and EarthLink stockholders will own approximately 49% of the combined company. The transaction was approved by the EarthLink and Windstream stockholders on February 24, 2017. The transaction remains subject to customary closing conditions and is expected to close in the first quarter of 2017.

Business Strategy
Our business strategy is to be a leading managed network, security and cloud services provider for multi-location retail and service businesses. We believe there is a significant market opportunity for managed network, security and cloud services due to the changing technological and business landscape, which is experiencing increased demand for data, evolving security threats, a shift towards more software based solutions, increased use of outsourcing and tightening budgets. We are positioning our company to focus on this opportunity. The key elements of our business strategy and transformation are as follows:

• | Operate each of our business units with focused, value-optimizing strategies. Our organization is aligned around four distinct business units, which are Enterprise/Mid-Market, Small Business, Carrier/Transport and Consumer. We believe this concentrates resources and investments into areas that will drive growth and deliver improved performance, enable each business to compete more successfully in the market and provide strategic optionality. We are focused on operating each business unit with value-optimizing strategies, which are managing the decline in our Small Business and Consumer business units and investing the cash flow to grow our Enterprise/Mid-Market and Carrier/Transport business units.


• | Optimize our cost structure and cash flows. We are focused on optimizing our cost structure and maximizing our cash flows. This includes managing our cost of revenues and operating expenses, streamlining our internal processes and aligning our workforce to current revenue trends. It also includes the repayment and/or refinancing of debt in order to reduce our interest expense. We plan to use the cash flow generated from our improvement efforts to continue to optimize our balance sheet and invest in growth.


• | Invest in growth business products, marketing and sales. Our growth business products are MultiProtocol Label Switching ("MPLS"), hosted voice and other UCaaS products, software-defined wide area network ("SD-WAN"), hybrid WAN and managed network, security and cloud services for multi-location businesses and transport services for other communications carriers and enterprises. We are focused on investing in product and service capabilities and sales and marketing initiatives to support these growth products.


• | Evaluate potential strategic transactions. We believe that targeted acquisitions, when available at the right economics, can be an effective means for growth and targeted capability building. In addition, we continue to evaluate our business, which could lead us to further discontinue or divest non-strategic products, assets or customers based on management's assessment of their strategic value to our business.

Reportable Segments
We operate four reportable segments: Enterprise/Mid-Market, Small Business, Carrier/Transport and Consumer. Our reportable segments are strategic business units aligned around distinct customer categories. We are organized around these business units to optimize operations. We believe this structure allows for better management accountability and decision making while providing greater visibility to our Chief Operating Decision Maker. For more information concerning our reportable segments, see Note 18 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. 
Below is a summary of our reportable segments and the revenues generated in 2016 for each (in thousands): 

Segment | Description | 2016 Revenues | Percent

Sales and Distribution
Business Markets
We market our products and services to a variety of buyers, ranging from small, medium and large businesses, public sector organizations, global carriers and Fortune 100 companies. Our go-to-market strategy is focused on effectively serving the connectivity needs and challenges of each of these markets, aligning to the highest growth segments, and doing so in the most cost-effective manner. We tie together all of our go-to-market efforts through consistent brand messaging. 
Over the past two years, we launched new products and services aimed at our highest growth market, which is medium-to-large size businesses with needs to connect stores, branches and remote users/locations. Of significant note, we were one of the first to market with an integrated SD-WAN offering that is differentiated by our concierge services. Our sales and marketing efforts are focused on engaging with our target decision makers, both online and in-person, with insights on the issues they face. Recognizing the longer sales cycles and the need for relationship building through local presence, we go to market through a mix of inside and regional direct sales channels, a national sales channel and independent and third-party partners and agents. We invest in content creation and an automated lead nurture strategy to drive a pipeline of potential customers. We also invest in additional demand generation through a mix of proprietary and industry conferences and trade shows, search engine marketing and optimization, and account based marketing and communication. Sales enablement investments are aimed at onboarding and training our channel partners and at simplifying and automating core sales processes. Media outlets and industry analyst relationships also play a key role in bringing product and company positioning to market.
Our marketing efforts for small business customers are focused on retaining customers approaching contract expiration with attractive renewal offers. Our sales and marketing growth efforts are centered on customers most likely to benefit from our voice, data and value-added products and services as they grow. To develop the right bundle of services for our small business customers, we partner with third-party resellers and solution providers.
Our marketing efforts for carrier/transport customers are focused on building relationships with network industry planners and buyers through conferences and events. 
Consumer Markets
We engage in limited sales and marketing for our consumer services. Our marketing efforts are focused on retaining customers and adding customers through alliances and partnerships. We offer our products and services primarily through direct customer contact through our call centers, search engine marketing, affinity marketing partners, resellers and marketing alliances. 
Competition
Business Markets
The market for our business customers is highly competitive, and we expect this competition to continue to intensify. Our business markets are rapidly changing due to industry consolidation, an evolving regulatory environment and the emergence of new technologies. 
We believe the primary competitive factors in our business markets include price, availability, reliability of service, network security, variety of service offerings, quality of service and reputation of the service provider. While we believe our business services compete favorably based on some of these factors, we are at a competitive disadvantage with respect to certain of our competitors. Many of our current and potential competitors have greater market presence, technical and marketing capabilities and financial, personnel and other resources substantially greater than ours; own larger and more diverse networks; are subject to 
4

less regulation; or have substantially stronger brand names. In addition, industry consolidation has resulted in larger competitors that have greater economies of scale. Consequently, these competitors may be better equipped to adapt more swiftly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements, to provide more attractive product offerings, to develop and expand their communications and network infrastructures more quickly, to charge lower prices for their products and services, and to devote greater resources to the marketing and sale of their products and services.
Enterprise/Mid-Market. Our Enterprise/Mid-Market segment provides managed network, security and cloud services to distributed multi-site business customers as well as traditional voice and data services. The market for managed network, security and cloud services is expanding rapidly and the number of companies providing these services has increased in recent years. Our primary competitors are ILECs, such as AT&T, CenturyLink, Inc. and Verizon Communications Inc.; CLECs, such as Global Capacity, Level 3 Communications Inc., Windstream and XO Communications; cable service providers, such as Charter Communications, Inc., Comcast Corporation and Cox Communications, Inc., which also compete and have penetrated the market for larger business customers; wireless service providers; and asset-light network companies. We also compete with various other service providers for our managed network, security and cloud services, including managed hosting and cloud providers, managed security companies, technology companies, hardware manufacturers and systems integrators. To compete effectively in our Enterprise/Mid-Market segment, we are focused on selling our growth products and services, investing in new products and service capabilities to create value for our customers and improving the customer experience.
Small Business. Our Small Business segment primarily provides traditional voice and data services to small, often single site business customers. Our primary competitors are ILECs, CLECs, cable service providers and wireless and satellite service providers. Technological and regulatory changes have led to the development of new products and services that have reduced demand or compete with our traditional voice and data products. Our Small Business segment experiences intense competition from cable companies and significant pricing and product competition from AT&T and other incumbents that are the dominant providers of telecommunications services in our markets. To compete effectively in our Small Business segment, we are focused on customer retention, contract renewals, upselling products and services and offering new services to extend customer relationships.
Carrier/Transport. Our Carrier/Transport segment provides transmission capacity and other data, voice and managed network services to telecommunications carriers and large enterprises. Our primary competitors in our Carrier/Transport segment are other facilities-based communications companies, such as AT&T, CenturyLink, Verizon, XO and Zayo. To compete effectively in our Carrier/Transport segment, we are focused on leveraging our unique fiber assets to provide transport services. 
Consumer Markets
The Internet access industry is highly competitive, and we expect competition to continue to intensify. Our primary competitors are national communications companies and local exchange carriers, such as AT&T, CenturyLink, Verizon and Windstream; cable companies providing broadband access, including Charter Communications, Comcast and Cox Communications; local and regional ISPs; free or value-priced ISPs, such as United Online, Inc. which provides service under the brands Juno and NetZero; wireless Internet service providers; content companies and email providers, such as AOL, Google, Microsoft Network and Yahoo!; and satellite and fixed wireless service providers. Competitors for our advertising services also include content providers, large web publishers, web search engine and portal companies, Internet advertising providers, content aggregation companies, social-networking companies, and various other companies that facilitate Internet advertising. The wireless business has expanded significantly and has caused many subscribers with traditional Internet access services to terminate those services and to rely exclusively on wireless services, and devices such as smartphones, tablets and wireless data cards and mobile wireless routers that connect to such devices, also compete with our Internet access services. 
We believe the primary competitive factors in the Internet access industry are price, speed, features and quality of service. While we believe our Internet access services compete favorably based on some of these factors when compared to some Internet access providers, we are at a competitive disadvantage relative to some or all of these factors with respect to other of our competitors. Many of our competitors have substantially greater market presence and greater financial, technical, marketing and other resources than we have. Our dial-up Internet access services do not compete favorably with broadband services with respect to speed, and dial-up Internet access services no longer have a significant, if any, price advantage over certain broadband services. Most of the largest providers of broadband services, such as cable and telecommunications companies, control their own networks and offer a wider variety of services than we offer, including voice, data and video services. Their ability to bundle services and to offer broadband services at prices below the price that we can profitably offer comparable services puts us at a competitive disadvantage. In addition, our only significant access to offer broadband services over cable is through our agreement with Charter Communications.

Network Infrastructure
Business Markets
We provide secure, efficient and reliable communications services primarily through an expansive fiber optic network, an advanced nationwide MPLS network and switch and colocation facilities. Throughout the network, advanced monitoring and management tools are in place to ensure performance and quality, bringing value and an enhanced experience to our customers.
Fiber Optic Network - Our advanced fiber optic network consists of more than 29,000 route miles covering 30 states plus the District of Columbia and provides for high-quality wavelength, Ethernet, SONET, Internet access and virtual private networking services. The network infrastructure is built on our Dense Wave Division Multiplexing, or DWDM, platform. With this network we can offer multi-rate transport service up to 100 gigabyte across our fiber footprint, offering customers the advantage of unique network routes for enhanced redundancy and network diversity.
Nationwide MPLS Network - Our nationwide IP network based on MPLS technologies is a redundant, highly-scalable and high-performance packet transport system, with a broad array of IP infrastructure positioned in strategic locations across the United States. We have interconnection agreements with major local exchange carriers, as well as commercial services agreements with national communications companies, CLECs, and cable and wireless service providers to provide last mile access technologies to EarthLink for our customers and connectivity onto our network.
Colocation Facilities - With co-located communications equipment within the central offices of ILECs and alternative access providers in various markets in the United States, we offer remote facilities-based local and long distance services in markets by using our switches in other locations as hosts. Using our fiber optic network and leased facilities to connect our remote equipment to our switches, colocation provides cost-efficient access to last mile facilities to connect to customers.
Voice Switch Facilities - Our array of switch facilities send voice and data traffic domestically and internationally through balanced and cost-effective routing. Services are also offered over a VoIP platform providing an innovative portfolio of hosted and managed business-class communications solutions such as nationwide hosted PBX and SIP trunking services. Our VoIP platform capabilities are also integrated into customer portals, offering our clients easy access to a ubiquitous, cross-platform, unified messaging, call control and self-service interface enabling them to access directly and upgrade their entire communications experience.
Network Management/Monitoring - Our network infrastructure is supported by two geographically diverse Network Operations Centers ("NOCs") in Atlanta, Georgia and Anniston, Alabama as well as a technical support team located remotely throughout the Northeast part of the country. These two centers operate 24 by 7 by 365, providing proactive network surveillance, incident management, and planned maintenance activities for all Transport, Data, and Switching infrastructure. The two centers use a consolidated suite of network surveillance tools that allows shared distribution of alarms and alerts. The geographic diversity of the NOCs enables a robust disaster recovery/business continuity plan. In the event one NOC is unable to operate; functions are designed to transfer over to the other fully redundant center.
Consumer Markets
We provide consumer services primarily through third-party network service providers. Our principal provider for narrowband services is GlobalPOPs. We also have agreements with various other providers, including certain regional and local dial-up providers. We provide residential broadband services via DSL and cable service agreements. We provide cable broadband services through agreements with Charter Communications that allow us to provide broadband services over its cable network in certain of its markets. We provide DSL broadband services through agreements with AT&T, Fairpoint, Frontier, Global Capacity and Verizon.

Regulatory Environment
Our communications services are subject to varying degrees of federal, state and local regulation. Telecommunications services are subject to particularly extensive regulation at both the federal and state levels. Internet access services, which are not telecommunications services, are subject to a lesser degree of regulation. Federal, state and local regulations governing our communications services are the subject of ongoing judicial proceedings, rulemakings and legislative initiatives that could change the manner in which our industry operates and affect our business.
Overview
Through our wholly-owned subsidiaries, we hold numerous federal and state regulatory licenses to provide communications services. The Federal Communications Commission (“FCC”) exercises jurisdiction over, among other things, providers of interstate and international telecommunications services. The FCC also has authority over some issues related to local competition in the provision of telephone services and other telecommunications services. State regulatory commissions, commonly referred to as public utility commissions (“PUCs”), generally retain jurisdiction over telecommunications carriers to the extent that they provide intrastate communications services. PUCs also have authority to review and approve interconnection agreements between incumbent telephone carriers and competitive carriers such as us, and to arbitrate disputes arising in the negotiation of such agreements. Local governments may require us to obtain licenses, permits or franchises to use the public rights-of-way necessary to install and operate our network. Our operations are also subject to various consumer, environmental, building, safety, health and other governmental laws and regulations.
The regulatory environment relating to our business continues to evolve. Bills intended to amend the Communications Act of 1934, as amended by the Telecommunications Act of 1996 (“Communications Act”), are introduced in Congress from time to time and their effect on us and the communications industry cannot always be predicted. In late 2013, the House Commerce Committee announced what is expected to be a multi-year process to revise the Communications Act and given changes in technology and the Internet, we expect there will be Congressional efforts to outline possible changes to the Communications Act. Proposed legislation, if enacted, could have a significant effect on our business, particularly if the legislation impairs our ability to interconnect with incumbent carrier networks, lease portions of other carriers' networks or resell their services at reasonable prices, or lease elements of incumbent carrier networks under acceptable rates, terms and conditions. We cannot predict the outcome of any ongoing legislative initiatives or administrative or judicial proceedings or their potential impact upon the communications and information technology industries generally or upon us specifically.
Federal Regulation
Our operating subsidiaries that provide telecommunications services subject to FCC authorizations are classified as non-dominant telecommunications carriers by the FCC and, as a result, the prices, terms and conditions of our interstate and international telecommunications services are subject to relatively limited FCC regulation. Like all common carriers, we are subject to the general requirement that our charges, practices and classifications for telecommunications services be “just and reasonable,” and that we refrain from engaging in any “unjust or unreasonable discrimination” with respect to our charges, practices or classifications. The FCC must grant its approval before any change in control of any carrier providing interstate or international communications services, or of any entity controlling such a carrier, and before the assignment of any authorizations held by such a carrier. Windstream and we filed applications seeking FCC approval, and subsequently received such approval, to transfer control of various licenses and authorizations held by our wholly-owned subsidiaries to Windstream in connection with the pending merger. We have the operating authority required by the FCC to conduct our interstate and international telecommunications business as it is currently conducted. As a non-dominant carrier, we may install and operate additional facilities for the transmission of domestic interstate communications without prior FCC authorization, except to the extent that radio licenses are required. We currently do not hold any radio licenses. The following discussion summarizes some specific areas of federal regulation that directly or indirectly affect our business.
Local Competition. The Communications Act preempts state and local laws to the extent that they prevent competition in the provisioning of any telecommunications service. It also imposes a variety of duties on carriers providing local telephone services, including competitive carriers such as us, to promote competition in the provisioning of these services. These duties include requirements for all local carriers to:

• | interconnect with other telecommunications carriers;


• | establish reciprocal compensation arrangements for the completion of telecommunications service calls originated by customers of other carriers, which the FCC has interpreted to include bill and keep (a pricing arrangement under which each carrier terminates calls from the other at no charge);


• | permit the resale of their services;

7


• | permit users to retain their telephone numbers when changing carriers; and


• | provide competing carriers access to poles, ducts, conduits and rights-of-way at regulated prices.

Incumbent carriers, which are telephone companies that held monopoly local telephone service franchises before the Telecommunications Act of 1996, or their successors in interest, are subject to additional duties. These include obligations of incumbent carriers to:

• | offer interconnection at any technically feasible point in their networks on non-discriminatory, cost-based terms;


• | offer collocation of competitors' equipment at their premises on a non-discriminatory basis;


• | make available some of their network facilities, features and capabilities, referred to as Unbundled Network Elements, or UNEs, on non-discriminatory, cost-based terms; and


• | offer wholesale versions of their retail services for resale at discounted rates.

Collectively, these requirements recognize that local telephone service competition depends on cost-based and non-discriminatory interconnection with, and use of, some elements of incumbent carrier networks and facilities under specified circumstances. Failure to achieve and maintain such arrangements could have a material adverse effect on our ability to provide competitive local telephone services.
FCC rules define the scope of the facilities that incumbent carriers must make available as UNEs to competitive carriers such as us at rates based on the Total Element Long Run Incremental Cost, or TELRIC, standard. Incumbent carriers must offer access to their copper loops and subloops in all areas, until they choose to retire them, which FCC rules permit them to do 180 days after providing notice of retirement. Certain incumbents accelerated their retirement of copper loops in 2016 and we expect that trend to continue. Incumbents must offer access to certain higher-capacity DS1 and DS3 transmission facilities only in wire center serving areas with relatively few business lines and collocated competitive carriers, as defined by detailed FCC regulations. In general, incumbent carriers are not required to offer DS1 and DS3 transmission facilities and interoffice fiber optic facilities as UNEs in relatively large wire centers or wire centers deemed to already be “competitive” based on FCC standards. Incumbent carriers are also not required to offer optical speed transmission facilities or packet-switched facilities as UNEs. Further, incumbent companies are not required to provide local switching as a UNE, which means that we cannot rely on the Unbundled Network Element-Platform, or UNE-P, to provide local services to customers at TELRIC-based rates. In some circumstances, AT&T, Verizon and other incumbent carriers are making available some of these facilities and services, either as lightly regulated special access services or under unregulated “commercial agreements,” at prices significantly higher than TELRIC.
Interconnection Agreements. Under the Communications Act, incumbent carriers are required to negotiate in good faith with competitive carriers such as us regarding terms for interconnection, collocation, reciprocal compensation for local traffic and access to UNEs. If the negotiating carriers cannot reach agreement within a prescribed time, either carrier may request binding arbitration of the disputed issues by a state regulatory commission. In addition, competitive carriers are permitted to “adopt” in their entirety agreements reached between the incumbent carrier and another carrier during the initial term of that agreement.

An interconnection agreement typically has a term of three years, although the parties may mutually agree to extend or amend such agreements. We operate under interconnection agreements with AT&T, CenturyLink, Fairpoint Communications, Frontier Communications, Verizon and Windstream. Our retail operating companies each maintain interconnection agreements with the incumbent in each state and service territory within which we purchase UNEs. We expect, but cannot assure, that each new interconnection agreement to which we are or will be a party will provide us with the ability to provide service in a state on a reasonable commercial basis. Many of our interconnection agreements provide either that a party is entitled to demand renegotiation of the entire agreement or particular provisions thereof based on intervening changes in law resulting from ongoing legal and regulatory activity, or as a result of an immediately effective change in law, in which case the agreement will be resolved pursuant to a dispute resolution process if the parties do not agree upon the impact of a change in law. The initial terms of many of our interconnection agreements have expired; however, each of our expired agreements contains an “evergreen” provision that allows the agreement to continue in effect until terminated. New agreements could result in less favorable rates, terms and conditions than our prior agreements.
If we cannot negotiate new interconnection agreements or renew our existing interconnection agreements in each state on acceptable terms, we may invoke our ability to seek binding arbitration before state regulatory agencies. The arbitration process, which is conducted on a state-by-state basis, can be costly and time-consuming, and the results of arbitration may be unfavorable to us. If we are not able to renegotiate or enter into interconnection agreements on acceptable terms, or if we are subject to unfavorable arbitration decisions, our cost of doing business could increase and our ability to compete could be impeded. Moreover, our interconnection agreements and traffic exchange with companies other than ILECs are not subject to the statutory arbitration mechanism, making it potentially more difficult to reach any agreement on terms that we view as acceptable.
8

Consolidation in the telecommunications industry has significantly affected the availability of acceptable interconnection agreements that competitive carriers such as us can adopt without incurring the expense of lengthy negotiation and arbitration with an incumbent carrier in each state. Before their respective mergers with ILECs, AT&T and MCI dedicated significant internal and external resources to negotiate and arbitrate interconnection agreements that many competitive carriers adopted or used as model agreements. These resources and the resulting model agreements are no longer available as a result of consolidation among carriers, and it is likely that competitive carriers like us will be required to invest more resources than in the past to secure acceptable interconnection agreements. The largest incumbent carriers are also attempting to eliminate mandatory interconnection through FCC rulemaking, and replace regulated interconnection arrangements with commercial negotiations.
Internet Protocol-Enabled Services. We resell broadband Internet access offered by cable companies and wireline LECs pursuant to wholesale agreements with those providers. In an order released in March 2015, the FCC classified retail broadband Internet access services as telecommunications services subject to regulation under Title II of the Communications Act. In June 2016, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia affirmed the FCC ruling. The classification of retail broadband Internet access services as telecommunications services means that providers of these services are subject to the general requirement that their charges, practices and classifications for telecommunications services be “just and reasonable,” and that they refrain from engaging in any “unjust or unreasonable discrimination” with respect to their charges, practices or classifications. The FCC has not determined what, if any, regulations will apply to wholesale broadband Internet access services. We cannot predict the extent to which the FCC will address this issue in the future and, if it does, whether it will adopt requirements that are favorable or unfavorable to us. In the absence of favorable regulation applicable to wholesale broadband Internet access services, we may not be able to obtain those services on prices that enable us to compete effectively for retail customers. It is also possible that Congress will adopt legislation reversing the classification of retail broadband Internet access services or that a future FCC will reverse that decision. Any of these outcomes would reduce the likelihood that favorable regulations governing wholesale broadband Internet access services will be adopted in the future.
The current regulatory environment for voice over Internet Protocol (“VoIP”) services remains unclear, as the FCC has not decided whether VoIP is an “information service” or “telecommunications service.” The FCC has, however, issued a series of rulings addressing aspects of the regulatory treatment of interconnected VoIP service, so that VoIP services that interconnect with the public switched telephone network (“PSTN”) are now subject to a number of regulatory requirements, including rules relating to Universal Service Fund (“USF”) contributions, Customer Proprietary Network Information rules, the provisioning of network access to authorized law enforcement personnel, local number portability, E-911, outage reporting, access for individuals with disabilities, and others. The FCC also ruled that state utility regulatory commissions may not impose pricing and entry regulations on “nomadic” interconnected VoIP services such as that offered by Vonage, concluding that Vonage's VoIP application and others like it, are interstate services. Reviewing courts have affirmed these FCC decisions. Broader questions on the regulatory status of VoIP remain to be resolved. We cannot predict how these matters will be resolved or the impact of these matters on companies with which we compete or interconnect.
Intercarrier Compensation and Interconnection. The FCC regulates the access rates charged by local carriers to interexchange carriers for the origination and termination of long distance traffic. These access rates historically have made up a significant portion of the cost of providing long distance service. In November 2011, however, the FCC adopted intercarrier compensation rules under which access rates for all traffic, including VoIP traffic that interconnects with the PSTN, are being reduced, and a uniform bill-and-keep framework for both intrastate and interstate terminating access traffic will be the ultimate end state for all telecommunications traffic exchanged with a local exchange carrier. The reforms required by the FCC's new rules are being phased in over a multi-year transition. Since July 2013, all local carriers' intrastate tariffed terminating access charges must be no higher than their interstate access charges. Under existing FCC rules, competitive carriers' interstate access charges may not be greater than those of the incumbent carriers with which they compete, so the net effect of these rules is to limit competitive carriers' intrastate access charges to the incumbent carrier's level. From now through 2018, further reductions in both intrastate and interstate terminating access charges and reciprocal compensation rates are required, with an ultimate end state of bill-and-keep (that is, a rate level of zero) for all transport and termination charges. These new rules significantly alter the manner in which all carriers, including us, are compensated and pay for the origination and termination of telecommunications traffic. We expect these rules to result in a loss of revenues and potentially to increase our volume of carrier disputes. Several states, industry groups, and other telecommunications carriers filed petitions for review of the FCC order, which were consolidated in the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit. The Tenth Circuit denied these petitions, affirming the FCC order. 
The FCC also issued a Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (“FNPRM”) in November 2011 which asks for further input on many issues relating to interconnection and traffic exchange, including how to reduce originating access/remaining transport charges to bill-and-keep. The FCC may take action to reduce originating access/remaining transport charges, and other database query charges, to bill-and-keep either through rulemaking or in response to forbearance requests. The FNPRM also asks whether incumbent carriers have an obligation under the 1996 Act to provide competitors like us with IP-to-IP interconnection for the exchange of voice traffic at any technically feasible point in their networks on non-discriminatory, cost-based terms. While the 
9

FCC rulemaking order states an “expectation that parties will negotiate in good faith” toward IP to IP interconnection agreements, the FNPRM asks questions about the legal framework that should govern these interconnection arrangements, which creates some potential uncertainty regarding whether these arrangements will be economic.
Special Access. Special access is a service offered by incumbent carriers that provides for use of dedicated transmission facilities or private lines by wireline and wireless telecommunications carriers, Internet-based service providers and large enterprise end-users. We rely on the purchase of special access services for “last mile” access to many of our customers' locations. As a result, the price of special access services has a major effect on our ability to price our retail offerings to meet our gross margin expectations while remaining competitively priced in the retail market. Incremental increases in the prices of special access services will exert pressure on our gross margins. Since special access services are not subject to the unbundling requirements of the Communications Act, the prices for special access services have not been directly affected by the FCC's modification of network unbundling rules. To the extent, however, that the availability of UNE digital T1 lines may have served as a restraint on the prices charged for special access services, we could face increased prices for special access services given the elimination of such UNEs in some larger central offices resulting from application of the current unbundling rules.
In 1999, the FCC adopted rules that enable incumbent carriers to obtain pricing flexibility for their interstate special access services in particular metropolitan areas depending on the level of competition present in that area. We purchase interstate special access services from incumbent carriers in many metropolitan areas where pricing flexibility has been granted. Depending on the degree of pricing flexibility for which the incumbent carrier qualifies in particular areas, the incumbent carrier may be freed from most ex ante rate regulation or entitled to impose contracts with minimum revenue commitments and bundles of purportedly discounted and non-discounted services that, in effect, enable the carrier to charge substantially greater prices for special access services in those areas, while making it more difficult for competitive carriers to offer substitute services. In addition, the FCC has granted petitions by the incumbent carriers for forbearance from regulation of some special access services, including packet-switched services such as Ethernet, and optical carrier services such as OC-3 and higher-capacity services. These services are not subject to the price regulations applicable to most other incumbent carrier services and are provided by incumbent carriers solely under contracts, which as noted above may contain minimum revenue commitments and other restrictive terms.
As a result of the mergers of BellSouth/SBC/AT&T and of MCI/XO/Verizon, the number of providers of competitive access services has diminished. The FCC and the Department of Justice placed conditions on the AT&T and Verizon mergers to constrain the ability of AT&T and Verizon to raise prices on their wholesale special access and equivalent retail services, but these regulatory pricing constraints have now expired. AT&T and Verizon are therefore free to realign charges for special access services with current commercial rates. Because a substantial portion of our services are delivered over special access lines purchased from AT&T and Verizon, a significant increase in the price for special access could substantially increase our cost of services.
In 2012, the FCC suspended consideration of new petitions for metropolitan area pricing flexibility by incumbent carriers, but this decision does not affect previously-approved pricing flexibility. During 2015 and 2016, the FCC reviewed the special access market and ordered AT&T, CenturyLink, Frontier and Verizon to end certain tariff practices, but did not adopt new special access pricing rules. The FCC’s April 2016 Tariff Investigation Order required some incumbent LECs to remove from their tariffs language requiring a customer prospectively to aggregate all its purchases under a single pricing plan. The Tariff Investigation Order also required incumbents to reduce early termination and shortfall fees to be no higher than expectation damages, which is an amount no greater than the amount the purchaser would have paid had it met its minimum commitment level for the service. We rely to a considerable extent on interstate special access services purchased from the incumbent carriers in order to connect to our customers. We cannot predict when the FCC will issue a decision regarding special access prices or how any such decision will affect our business. A significant increase in the price for special access could materially increase our cost of services. Additional pricing flexibility for special access services offered by the incumbent carriers could place us at a competitive disadvantage, both as a purchaser of access and as a vendor of access to other carriers or end-user customers.
Certain ILECs have expressed an intention to begin discontinuing DS1 and DS3 special access services or at least certain term plans that provide us with discounts on these services. Under the FCC’s current rules, this could eliminate our ability to serve certain customers or increase the cost of doing so. However, in August 2015, the FCC adopted a requirement to receive authority to discontinue, reduce, or impair a legacy service that is used as a wholesale input by competitive providers, an ILEC must commit to providing competitive carriers “reasonably comparable” wholesale access on “reasonably comparable” rates, terms, and conditions. This requirement expires upon the resolution the FCC’s pending review of the special access market. We cannot predict how the FCC will interpret the “reasonably comparable” standard or how application of that standard will affect our ability to obtain sufficient wholesale inputs from the incumbent LECs in the future. 
Universal Service. The Communications Act and the FCC's rules provide for a federal USF, which is intended to subsidize communications services in rural and high-cost areas, services for low-income consumers, and services for schools, libraries and rural health care providers. Currently, the FCC assesses all providers of telecommunications services, interconnected VoIP services, 
10

and certain providers of telecommunications a percentage of interstate and international revenues received from U.S. retail customers. We are subject to this contribution requirement. Providers are permitted to pass through their USF contribution assessment to their customers in a manner consistent with FCC billing regulations. The FCC is considering a number of proposed changes to the method of assessing these USF contributions, but we cannot predict when it may reach a decision or what types of changes may be adopted.
In December 2012, the FCC adopted an order clarifying its USF contribution rules that adversely affect companies like us that use special access services purchased from incumbent carriers to provide only broadband Internet access to our customers. The FCC stated that in these cases, the incumbent carrier must pay a USF contribution on its special access revenues, which these carriers as a matter of course pass through to the special access customer. This in turn increases our cost of purchasing special access service and using it as an input in providing broadband Internet access services. However, we must compete against broadband Internet access services provided by incumbent carriers and cable television companies, among others, which are not subject to USF contribution requirements and therefore do not incur this added cost. Several companies have petitioned for FCC reconsideration of this decision, but we cannot predict whether these petitions will be successful or when they may be decided.
In November 2011 and March 2016, the FCC adopted extensive revisions to its high-cost support USF program, which largely subsidizes the provision of local telephone service by incumbent carriers in rural areas. Under the new program, it should be difficult for incumbent carriers to receive subsidies for services provided in competition with unsubsidized providers like us, although we cannot be certain that this will occur. It is also possible, under certain conditions, for competitive providers like us to seek subsidies for constructing and operating broadband Internet access facilities in rural areas. However, we cannot predict whether provision of broadband Internet access services in such rural areas will be economically practicable, even with potential subsidies.
Customer Proprietary Network Information and Privacy. The Communications Act and the FCC's rules require carriers to implement measures to prevent the unauthorized disclosure of Customer Proprietary Network Information (“CPNI”). CPNI includes personally identifiable information, content of communications, and information related to the quantity, technological configuration, type, destination and the amount of use of a telecommunications service, including Broadband Internet Access, or an interconnected VoIP service. CPNI rules include restrictions on telecommunications carriers, providers of Broadband Internet Access Service and providers of interconnected VoIP service. We must file a verified certification of compliance by March 1 of each year that affirms the existence of training and other sales and marketing processes designed to prevent improper use and unauthorized release of CPNI. An inadvertent violation of these and related CPNI requirements by us could subject our company to significant fines or other regulatory penalties.
Additional measures to protect CPNI and consumer privacy are proposed from time to time, and Congress currently is considering such additional measures. These developments appear to be part of a broader trend to protect consumer information as it continues increasingly to be transmitted in electronic formats. We cannot predict whether additional requirements governing CPNI or other consumer data will be enacted, or whether such additional requirements will affect our ability to market or provide our services to current and future customers.
Forbearance. The Communications Act provides the FCC with the authority to not enforce, or “forbear” from enforcing, statutory requirements and regulations if certain factors are satisfied. If the FCC were to forbear from enforcing regulations that have been established to enable competitors to offer broadband Internet access and VoIP, our business could be adversely affected. In December 2005, the FCC granted, in part, a petition for forbearance filed by CenturyLink (formerly Qwest) seeking relief from specified dominant carrier regulations, including some unbundling obligations related to high capacity loops and transport, in those portions of the Omaha metropolitan statistical area where facilities-based competition had allegedly increased significantly. The FCC's dominant carrier regulations require CenturyLink, in part, to offer UNEs and also serve as a check on dominant carrier pricing for other wholesale services, such as special access lines, that we seek to purchase at commercially acceptable prices. Since being granted relief by the FCC, CenturyLink has substantially increased the prices for the network elements that we use to provide services in eight central offices in the Omaha metropolitan statistical area.
Since 2007, the FCC has denied a series of petitions by CenturyLink and Verizon seeking similar forbearance from unbundling requirements in particular metropolitan areas. However, the FCC has granted a series of petitions forbearing from dominant carrier regulation for most incumbent LECs’ enterprise broadband services, such as Ethernet. In a June 2010 order denying a CenturyLink petition for forbearance from unbundling requirements in Phoenix, the FCC set forth specific thresholds and analytical frameworks that must be met for grant of such petitions. That FCC decision was affirmed by a court of appeals. In late December 2015, the FCC granted forbearance from a range of incumbent LEC regulatory obligations, including the requirement to offer competitors access to newly deployed entrance conduit in greenfield (new development) areas at regulated rates. If the FCC grants similar forbearance petitions filed by incumbent carriers in the future affecting markets in which we operate, our costs could increase and, thus, our ability to achieve our target profit margins in those markets could be materially adversely affected. The grant of these 
11

petitions also would enable incumbent carriers to compete with their competitors, including us, more aggressively on price in the affected markets.
Other Federal Regulation. In addition to the specific matters listed above, we are subject to a variety of other FCC filing, reporting, record-keeping and fee payment requirements. The FCC has the authority generally to condition, modify, cancel, terminate, revoke or decline to renew licenses and operating authority for failure to comply with federal laws and the FCC's rules, regulations and policies. Fines or other penalties also may be imposed for such violations. The FCC or third parties may raise issues with regard to our compliance with applicable laws and regulations. Moreover, we are subject to additional federal regulation and compliance requirements from other government agencies such as the Federal Trade Commission, the Internal Revenue Service and the Securities and Exchange Commission.
State Regulation
We are subject to various state laws and regulations. Most state PUCs require providers such as us to obtain certificates of authority from the commission before offering communications services between points within the state. We may also be required to file tariffs or price lists setting forth the terms, conditions and prices for specified services that are classified as intrastate and to update or amend our tariffs when we adjust our rates or add new products. We also are subject to various reporting and record-keeping requirements and contribute to state USF, E911 and other funds, and collect and/or pay other taxes, fees and surcharges where applicable. Certificates of authority can be conditioned, modified, canceled, terminated or revoked by state regulatory authorities for a carrier's failure to comply with state laws or rules, regulations and policies of state regulatory authorities. State utility commissions generally have authority to supervise telecommunications service providers in their states and to enforce state utility laws and regulations. Fines or other penalties also may be imposed for violations. PUCs or third parties may raise issues with regard to our compliance with applicable laws or regulations.
Through certain of our operating subsidiaries, we have authority to offer intrastate long distance services in all 50 U.S. states, and have authority to offer local telephone services in all 50 U.S. states and the District of Columbia. We provide local services, where authorized, by reselling the retail local services of the incumbent carrier in a given territory and, in some established markets, by using incumbent carriers' network elements and our own local switching facilities.
State PUCs have responsibility under the Communications Act to oversee relationships between incumbent carriers and their competitors with respect to such competitors' use of the incumbent carriers' network elements and wholesale local services. PUCs arbitrate interconnection agreements between the incumbent carriers and competitive carriers such as us when requested by one of the parties. Under the Communications Act, the decisions of state PUCs with regard to interconnection disputes may be appealed to federal courts. There remain important unresolved issues regarding the extent to which the commissions will adopt policies that promote local telephone service competition.
States also regulate in part the intrastate carrier access services of carriers like us. As an interexchange carrier (“IXC”), we are required to pay intrastate access charges to local exchange carriers when they originate or terminate our intrastate long distance traffic. As a CLEC, we charge IXCs intrastate access charges for the origination and termination services we provide to them. Under the FCC's November 2011 order, state commissions will have oversight of the intrastate access charge transition process to ensure that carriers comply with the FCC's timing and required reductions. States will continue to review intrastate switched access tariffs, as well as interconnection agreements and associated reciprocal compensation rates, to ensure compliance with the FCC's intercarrier compensation framework and transition. States may also have responsibility for determining the network “edge” for purposes of bill-and-keep agreements. What these proceedings may entail or to what extent requirements arising from such proceedings will affect our operations is unclear.
In addition, state legislatures are considering, and in some cases enacting, new laws that limit the authority of the state PUCs to regulate and oversee the business dealings of carriers. We could be harmed by these actions.
We will be affected by how states regulate the retail prices of the incumbent carriers with which we compete. As the degree of intrastate competition is perceived to increase, states are offering incumbent carriers increased pricing flexibility and deregulation of services deemed to be competitive. This flexibility and deregulation may present the incumbent carriers with an opportunity to subsidize services that compete with our services with revenues generated from their non-competitive services, thereby allowing them to offer competitive services at prices lower than most or all of their competitors. For example, some ILECs have obtained authority to create affiliates that operate on a much less regulated basis and, therefore, could provide significant competition in addition to the local services historically offered by more regulated entities. We cannot predict the extent to which these developments may affect our business.

Many states require prior approval for transfers of control of certified carriers, corporate reorganizations, acquisitions of telecommunications operations, assignment of carrier assets, carrier stock offerings and incurrence by carriers of significant debt obligations. These requirements can delay and increase the cost we incur to complete various financing transactions, including future stock or debt offerings, the sale of part or all of our regulated business or the acquisition of assets and other entities to be used in our regulated business. Windstream and we filed applications seeking certain state approvals, and subsequently received such approvals, necessary to transfer control of various licenses and authorizations held by our wholly-owned subsidiaries to Windstream in connection with the pending merger. 
Local Government Authorizations and Related Rights-of-Way
We are subject to numerous local regulations such as building codes, municipal franchise requirements and licensing. Such regulations vary on a city-by-city and county-by-county basis and can affect our provision of both network services and carrier services. We are required to obtain street use and construction permits and licenses or franchises to install and expand our fiber optic network using municipal rights-of-way. In some municipalities where we have installed network equipment, we are required to pay license or franchise fees based on a percentage of gross revenues or a per linear foot basis. Following the expiration of existing franchises, these fees are at risk of increasing. In many markets, incumbent carriers do not pay these franchise fees or pay fees that are substantially lower than those required to be paid by us, although the Communications Act requires that, in the future, such fees be applied in a competitively neutral manner. To the extent that our competitors do not pay the same level of fees that we do, we could be at a competitive disadvantage. Termination of the existing franchise or license agreements before their expiration dates, or a failure to renew the franchise or license agreements, and a requirement that we remove the corresponding portion of our facilities or abandon the corresponding portion of our network, could harm our business. In addition, we would be adversely affected if we are unable to obtain additional authorizations for any new network construction on reasonable terms.
A number of states are considering reforming their laws and regulations governing the issuance of franchises and permits by local governmental authorities, and some states already have enacted laws authorizing some types of entities to secure a state-wide franchise. Congress also has considered from time to time, and may consider in the future, various proposals intended to reform the relationship between federal, state and local governments in connection with the franchising process. We cannot predict how these issues will be resolved, or the extent to which these developments will affect our ability to compete. Unresolved issues also exist regarding the ability of new local service providers to gain access to commercial office buildings to serve tenants. The outcome of these challenges cannot be predicted.

Proprietary Rights
Our EarthLink, EarthLink Business and EarthLink Carrier trademarks are valuable assets to our business, and are registered trademarks in the United States. In particular, we believe the strength of these brands among existing and potential customers is important to the success of our business. Additionally, our EarthLink, EarthLink Business and EarthLink Carrier service marks, proprietary technologies, domain names and similar intellectual property are also important to the success of our business. We principally rely upon trademark law as well as contractual restrictions to establish and protect our technology and proprietary rights and information. We require employees and consultants and, when possible, suppliers and distributors to sign confidentiality agreements, and we generally control access to, and distribution of, our technologies, documentation and other proprietary information. We will continue to assess appropriate occasions for seeking trademark and other intellectual property protections for those aspects of our business and technology that we believe constitute innovations providing us with a competitive advantage. From time to time, third parties have alleged that certain of our technologies infringe on their intellectual property rights. To date, none of these claims has had an adverse effect on our ability to market and sell our services.
Employees
As of December 31, 2016, we had 1,890 employees. None of our employees are represented by a labor union, and we have no collective bargaining agreements. We consider our relationship with our employees to be good and have not experienced interruptions of operations due to labor disagreements.
