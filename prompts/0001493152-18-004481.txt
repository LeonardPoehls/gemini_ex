Blockchain Powered Smart Contract Solutions within the FinTech Industry
 
 We are developing decentralized applications for Micro lending, Warehouse Finance, Trade Finance, Bullion Trading and Real-time Derivative Settlements through the deployment of the Ziddu Warehouse Coin. Currently we are using Smart contracts for real time foreign exchange derivatives settlements.
Ziddu Technology:
 
Ziddu Ethereum ERC20 Blockchain Token uses a technology stack in which Smart Contracts run in distributed virtual machines.
 
It acts in two ways:
 
a) Everyone can see the copy of open ledger and transparent execution
 b) Everyone can see the result of contract execution
 
Ziddu AppFabric is built to serve as an integrated platform to provide robust automation for deployment of smart contracts, and settlements over physical events on Ethereum Blockchain.
 
We keep the substantial portion of Ziddu tokens and these tokens are not meant for redemption or listing. These tokens are used to validate the transactions within our business clients/partners on the public Ethereum block chain.
 
Our intention is not to sell the crypto currency but to use it as a tool to utilize Ethereum Blockchain Technology in token form to facilitate smart contracts of real time settlements between our business partners.
 
Acquisition of Ziddu.com - Block chain powered Smart Contracts
 
Our acquisition of the Ziddu.com assets of Meridian Enterprises Pte. Ltd. on December 11, 2017, gave us access to a Blockchain empowered technology that can offer Micro-Lending against Collateralized Warehouse Receipts in the form of Ziddu Tokens to Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs), Processors, Manufactures, Importers and Exporters across continents.
 
Our Ethereum Blockchain Ziddu Token (www.ziddu.com) is a utility token powered by ERC20 Smart Contract. The Ziddu warehouse coin implements a technology stack in which Smart Contracts run in distributed virtual machines. There is public availability for the view of the open ledger, transparent execution, and the result of contract execution.

Government Regulations
 
The Company is currently a proprietary trading member of Singapore Exchange Derivatives Clearing Limited (“SGX”), Dubai Gold and Commodities Exchange (“DGCX”), Chicago Mercantile Exchange Inc. (“CME”) Group, Intercontinental Exchange (“ICE”), Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited (“HKEX”). To the extent our expansion into the North American market results in Longfin being deemed a “money services business” (“MSB”) pursuant to the regulations promulgated by FinCEN under the authority of the U.S. Bank Secrecy Act, Longfin may be required to comply with FinCEN regulations, including those that would mandate us to register with FinCEN, implement anti-money laundering programs, make certain reports to FinCEN and maintain certain records. FinCEN registration would likely also require Longfin to register as an MSB or in a similar capacity in all states requiring such registration where Longfin conducts business. In addition, some states, such as New York, also require that a virtual currency business obtain a separate license.
 
Until February 2014, the only U.S. federal regulator to release official guidance on cryptocurrencies was FinCEN, a bureau of the U.S. Department of the Treasury responsible for the federal regulation of currency market participants. On March 18th, 2013, FinCEN issued interpretive guidance relating to the application of the Bank Secrecy Act to distributing, exchanging and transmitting “virtual currencies.” More specifically, it determined that a cryptocurrency user will not be considered an MSB or be required to register, report and perform recordkeeping; however, an administrator or exchanger of bitcoin must be a registered MSB under FinCEN’s money transmitter regulations. As a result, Bitcoin Exchanges that deal with U.S. residents or otherwise fall under U.S. jurisdiction are required to obtain licenses and comply with FinCEN regulations. FinCEN released additional guidance on January 30, 2014, April 29, 2014, October 27, 2014 and August 14, 2015, clarifying that most miners, software developers, hardware manufacturers, escrow service providers and investors in cryptocurrencies would not be required to register with FinCEN on the basis of such activity alone, but that cryptocurrency exchanges, payment processors and convertible Digital Asset administrators would likely be required to register with FinCEN on the basis of the activities described in the October 2014 and August 2015 letters. Longfin does not process payments for or on behalf of the customers using the ZidduWC, and therefore does not believe its activities require registration as an MSB.
 
ZidduWC
 
Cryptocurrencies and tokens are recent technological innovations and the regulatory schemes to which they may be subject have not been fully explored or developed in most jurisdictions around the world. Recent actions taken by the SEC in its Report that digital assets may be securities and actions taken by the CFTC including its July 24, 2017 order approving the first derivative clearing organization for digital currency swaps reflects that we may face increased government regulation and oversight.
 
The principal regulations applicable to the ZidduWC depend on its status as a “security” under the U.S. federal securities laws. The key definition in this regard is the term “investment contract” and what is an investment contract. In 1946, the U.S. Supreme Court held that an investment in an orange grove operated and controlled by a third party was an investment contract and therefore a security subject to various provisions of the federal securities laws, known as the Howey Test. Most members of the cryptocurrency industry agree that the application of the Howey Test to Digital Assets is the fundamental issue for the industry, at least insofar as the U.S. regulation is concerned.

We analyze whether the ZidduWC is a security under the investment contract analysis from the leading case and the lower court cases which have followed it. The test for determining if an asset is an investment contract based upon whether there was: (i) an investment of money, (ii) in a common enterprise, (iii) with the expectation of profits, and (iv) primarily through the efforts of others. Our clients using the ZidduWC invest ETH, a virtual currency to obtain the ZidduWC, therefore meeting the first part of the Howey Test.
 
Courts have focused on three distinct types of common enterprise: (i) horizontal commonality; (ii) broad vertical commonality; and (iii) strict vertical commonality. The horizontal commonality test requires a pooling of investments and profit sharing. Although ZidduWC holders pay ETH to Longfin, who then administers the validation of blocks on the blockchain, ZidduWC holders view the ZidduWC as a convenient medium for cross-border exchange not as a common enterprise and in no circumstances share in any profits resulting from holding ZidduWC. Thus, the ZidduWC does not satisfy the test for horizontal commonality.
 
With broad vertical commonality, the key is the investors’ dependence on the efforts and expertise of the promoter or in the case of virtual currencies based on blockchain, the developer. There is no central promoter or common seller for the ZidduWC, as the underlying protocol was developed by the Ethereum Foundation and the smart contracts implementing the ZidduWC were designed by Longfin. The lack of continuing management by Longfin in the development of the Ethereum Blockchain and lack of continuing management by the Ethereum Foundation in the use of the ZidduWC is similar to the land development cases where the courts have concluded that initial development services by a promoter do not lead to the conclusion that the sale of a real estate parcel is a security. Thus, the ZidduWC does not satisfy the test for broad vertical commonality.
 
Strict vertical commonality differs from broad vertical commonality by requiring that the fortunes of the investors be tied to the efforts of the promoter or third parties; pooling is not an element. Because Longfin provides further services in the form of validating blocks on the Blockchain (although it does not share in future price increases once the customers have executed their smart contracts and exchanged the ZidduWC), it is possible the ZidduWC satisfies the test for strict vertical commonality, although the strict vertical commonality theory has only been adopted by two circuit courts that have ruled on the issue.
 
The speculative fever surrounding cryptocurrency means that buyers of it often expect profits arising from value of the appreciation of cryptocurrency just as has historically happened with gold and silver. As holders may only acquire the ZidduWC in order to exchange it pursuant to smart contracts designed by Longfin to implement our fintech solutions, as described elsewhere in this report, and there is no exchange on which their ZidduWC may be resold for profit in the form of price appreciation, we do not believe the “expectation of profit” test is met in the case of the ZidduWC.
 
The Supreme Court’s use of “solely” has been interpreted by an appellate court to mean “the efforts made by those other than the investor are the undeniably significant ones, those essential managerial efforts which affect the failure or success of the enterprise.” However, the effort to create profit need not come exclusively from the efforts of others so long as the efforts of others are significant and primary. Any holder of the ZidduWC holding for investment, and an expectation of profits, would necessarily expect those profits to arise not from any efforts of Longfin but from mere hoped for appreciation of value. This is similar to commodities such as gold or diamonds. As such, the ZidduWC does not satisfy this prong of the Supreme Court’s test.
 
As a result of failing to meet the foregoing prongs of the Howey Test, we believe that the ZidduWC does not constitute an investment contract and is not a security.
 
On March 5, 2018, the Division of Enforcement of the SEC informed the Company that it is conducting an investigation In the Matter of Trading in the Securities of Longfin Corp. and requested that the Company provide certain documents in connection with its investigation, including documents related to our IPO and other financings and the acquisition of Ziddu.com. We are in the process of responding to this document request and will cooperate with the SEC in connection with its investigation. While the SEC is trying to determine whether there have been any violations of the federal securities laws, the investigation does not mean that the SEC has concluded that anyone has violated the law. Also, the investigation does not mean that the SEC has a negative opinion of any person, entity or security.

Intellectual Property and Patents
 
Our success depends in part on our ability to protect our intellectual property and proprietary technologies. To protect our proprietary rights, we rely on a combination of intellectual property rights in the United States and other jurisdictions, including trade secret laws, license agreements, internal procedures, and contractual provisions. Our internal controls restrict access to proprietary technology.
 
As of April 2, 2018, we had one trademark registered with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. We may not be able to obtain protection for our intellectual property, and our existing and future trademark and other intellectual property rights may not provide us with competitive advantages or distinguish our products and services from those of our competitors. Additionally, our current and future trademark and other intellectual property rights may be contested, circumvented, or found unenforceable or invalid, and we may not be able to prevent third parties from infringing them. Our internal controls and contractual provisions may not always be effective at preventing unauthorized parties from obtaining our intellectual property and proprietary technologies.
 
We license technology and other intellectual property from our partners and rely on our license agreements with those partners to use the intellectual property. We also enter into licensing agreements with third parties to receive rights to intellectual property and other know-how. Third parties may assert claims related to intellectual property rights against our partners or us.
