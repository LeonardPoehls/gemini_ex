Item 1.    BUSINESS 
 Overview 
         Activision Blizzard, Inc. is a leading global developer and publisher of interactive entertainment content and services. We develop and distribute content and services across all of the major gaming platforms, including video game consoles, personal computers ("PC"), and mobile devices. The terms "Activision Blizzard," the "Company," "we," "us," and "our" are used to refer collectively to Activision Blizzard, Inc. and its subsidiaries. 
         The Company was originally incorporated in California in 1979 and was reincorporated in Delaware in December 1992. We are the result of the 2008 business combination (the "Business Combination") by and among the Company (then known as Activision, Inc.), Vivendi S.A. ("Vivendi"), and Vivendi Games, Inc. ("Vivendi Games"), an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Vivendi. In connection with the consummation of the Business Combination, Activision, Inc., was renamed Activision Blizzard, Inc. 
         The common stock of Activision Blizzard is traded on The NASDAQ Stock Market under the ticker symbol "ATVI." 
   The King Acquisition 
         On February 23, 2016 (the "King Closing Date"), we acquired King Digital Entertainment, a leading interactive mobile entertainment company ("King"), by purchasing all of its outstanding shares (the "King Acquisition"). We made this acquisition because we believe that the addition of King's 
 3

   highly complementary mobile business positions the Company as a global leader in interactive entertainment across mobile, console, and PC platforms, as well as positioning us for future growth. The aggregate purchase price of approximately $5.8 billion was funded with $3.6 billion of existing cash and $2.2 billion of cash from new debt issued by the Company. King's results of operations since the King Closing Date are included in our consolidated financial statements. 
   Our Strategy and Vision 
         Our objective is to continue to be a worldwide leader in the development, publishing, and distribution of high-quality interactive entertainment content and services and other media that deliver year-round, highly satisfying and engaging entertainment experiences. In pursuit of this objective we focus on three strategic pillars: expanding audience reach; driving deep consumer engagement; and providing more opportunities for player investment. 
  Expanding audience reach.    Building on our strong established franchises and creating new franchises through compelling new content is at the core of our business. Our employees, technology, and institutionalized processes allow us to continue to deliver high-quality content that expands our reach. We endeavor to reach as many consumers as possible either through: (1) the purchase of our content and services; (2) engagement in our free-to-play games, which allow consumers to play games with no up-front cost but are instead monetized through sales of downloadable content or via microtransactions; or (3) engagement in other types of media based on our franchises. 
  Driving deep consumer engagement.    Our high-quality entertainment content not only expands our audience reach, but it also drives deep engagement with our franchises. We design our games and other forms of media to provide a depth of content that keeps consumers playing and engaged for a long period of time following a game's release, delivering value to our players and additional growth opportunities for our franchises. 
         Providing more opportunities for player investment.    Increasingly, our consumers engage in our content year-round and are connected to our games online through mobile devices, connected consoles, and PCs. This allows us to offer additional digital player investment opportunities directly to the consumers. In addition to purchasing full games or subscriptions, players can invest in certain of our games and franchises by purchasing incremental "in-game" content (including larger downloadable content or smaller content, via microtransactions). These digital revenue streams tend to be recurring and have higher profit margins. Further, if executed properly, additional player investment can increase engagement as it provides more frequent and incremental content for our players. In addition, we believe there is an opportunity for advertising within certain of our franchises, as well as opportunities to drive new forms of player investment through esports, film and television, and consumer products. We are in the early stages of developing these new revenue streams. 
         Our strategy is ultimately aimed at creating shareholder value and enhancing returns. We strive to increase profitability, cash flows, and return on capitaland to do so while keeping our company a great place to work for our employees. 
   Reportable Segments 
         Based on our organizational structure, we conduct our business through three reportable operating segments as follows: 
 (i)    Activision Publishing, Inc. 
         Activision Publishing, Inc. ("Activision"), is a leading global developer and publisher of interactive software products and entertainment content, particularly in console gaming. Activision primarily delivers content through retail channels or digital downloads, including full-game sales and in-game 
 4

   purchases, as well as licenses of software to third-party or related-party companies that distribute Activision products. Activision develops, markets and sells products which are principally based on our internally developed intellectual properties, as well as some licensed properties. Additionally, we have established a long-term alliance with Bungie to publish its game universe, Destiny. 
         Activision's key product franchises include: Call of Duty®, a first-person shooter for the console and PC platforms; Destiny, an online universe of first-person action gameplay (which we call a "shared-world shooter") for console platforms; and Skylanders®, a kid's game franchise that brings physical toys to life digitally in the game primarily for console platforms. Call of Duty, Activision's leading franchise, was the number one console franchise globally in 2016, and in North America for the 8th year in a row, according to The NPD Group, GfK Chart-Track, and our internal estimates. 
 (ii)   Blizzard Entertainment, Inc. 
         Blizzard Entertainment, Inc. ("Blizzard") is a leading global developer and publisher of interactive software products and entertainment content, particularly in PC gaming. Blizzard primarily delivers content through retail channels or digital downloads, including subscriptions, full-game sales, and in-game purchases, as well as licenses of software to third-party or related-party companies that distribute Blizzard products. Blizzard also maintains a proprietary online gaming service which facilitates digital distribution of Blizzard content, online social connectivity across all Blizzard games, and the creation of user-generated content for Blizzard's games. 
         Blizzard's key product franchises include: World of Warcraft®, a subscription-based massive multi-player online role-playing game ("MMORPG") for the PC; StarCraft®, a real-time strategy PC franchise; Diablo®, an action role-playing franchise for PC and console platforms; Hearthstone®, an online collectible card franchise for the PC and mobile platforms; Heroes of the Storm®, a free-to-play team brawler for the PC; and Overwatch®, a team-based first person shooter for the PC and console platforms. World of Warcraft is the leading subscription-based MMORPG and was initially launched in November 2004. 
 (iii)  King Digital Entertainment 
         King Digital Entertainment ("King") is a leading global developer and publisher of interactive entertainment content and services, particularly on mobile platforms, such as Android and iOS. King also distributes its content and services on online social platforms, such as Facebook and the king.com websites. King's games are free-to-play, however players can acquire in-game virtual items, either with virtual currency the players purchase, or directly using real currency. 
         King's key product franchises, all of which are for the PC and mobile platforms, include: Candy Crush, which features "match three" games; Farm Heroes, which also features "match three" games; Pet Rescue, which is a "clicker" game; and Bubble Witch, which features "bubble shooter" games. King had two of the top 10 highest-grossing titles in the United States of America ("U.S.") mobile app stores for the last thirteen quarters in a row, according to App Annie Intelligence and internal estimates for Apple App Store and Google Play Store combined. 
 (iv)  Other 
         We also engage in other businesses that do not represent reportable segments, including:
 

 The Major League Gaming ("MLG") business (which we formerly referred to as Activision Blizzard Media Networks or Media Networks), which is
devoted to esports and builds on our competitive gaming efforts by creating ways to deliver a best-in-class fan experience across games, platforms, and geographies with a long-term strategy of
monetization through advertising, sponsorships, tournaments, and premium content. 

 5

   

 The Activision Blizzard Studios ("Studios") business, which is devoted to creating original film and television content based on our library of
globally recognized intellectual properties, and, in October 2016, released the first season of the animated TV series Skylanders Academy
on Netflix. 
 The Activision Blizzard Distribution ("Distribution") business, which consists of operations in Europe that provide warehousing, logistics, and
sales distribution services to third-party publishers of interactive entertainment software, our own publishing operations, and manufacturers of interactive entertainment hardware. 

 Products 
         We develop content and services principally for console, PC, and mobile devices, and we market and sell our games through retail and digital distribution channels. We develop products spanning various genres, including first-person shooter, action/adventure, role-playing, strategy, and "match three," among others. We primarily offer the following products and services:


 Full-games, which typically provide access to main game content, primarily for console or PC. 
 Downloadable content, which provides players with additional in-game content to purchase following the purchase of a full game. 
 Microtransactions, which typically provide relatively small pieces of additional in-game content or enhancements to gameplay, generally at
relatively low price points. 
 Subscriptions for players in our World of Warcraft franchise that provide for continual access to the game content. 

         Providing additional opportunities for player investment outside of full-game purchases has allowed us to shift from our historical seasonality to a more recurring and year-round revenue model. In addition, if executed properly, it allows us to increase player engagement as it provides more frequent and incremental content for our players. 
   Product Development and Support 
         We focus on developing enduring franchises backed by well-designed, high-quality games with regular content updates. We build content with the potential for broad reach, sustainable engagement and year-round player investment. It is our experience that enduring franchises then serve as the basis for sequels, prequels and related new products and content that can be released over an extended period of time. We believe that the development and distribution of products and content based on proven franchises enhances predictability of revenues and the probability of high unit volume sales and operating profits. We intend to continue development of owned franchises in the future. 
         We develop and produce our titles using a model in which a group of creative, production, and technical professionals, including designers, producers, programmers, artists, and sound engineers, in coordination with our marketing, finance, analytics, sales, and other professionals, has responsibility for the entire development and production process, including the supervision and coordination of internal and, where appropriate, external resources. We believe this model allows us to deploy the best resources for a given task, by supplementing our internal expertise with top-quality external resources on an as-needed basis. 
         While most of the content for our franchises is developed by internal studios, we periodically engage independent third-party developers to create content on our behalf. From time to time, Activision also acquires the license rights to publish and/or distribute software products that are, or will be, independently created by third-party developers. Since 2010, Activision has been in a long-term exclusive relationship with Bungie, the developer of game franchises including Halo, Myth and 
 6

   Marathon, to publish games in the Destiny franchise. During the term of the agreement, Activision has exclusive, worldwide rights to publish and distribute on multiple platforms all future Bungie games based on Destiny. 
         We provide various forms of product support. Central technology and development teams review, assess, and provide support to products throughout the development process. Quality assurance personnel are also involved throughout the development and production of published content. We subject all such content to extensive testing before public release to ensure compatibility with appropriate hardware systems and configurations and to minimize the number of bugs and other defects found in the products. To support our content, we generally provide 24-hour game support to players through various means, primarily online and by telephone. 
   Marketing, Sales, and Distribution 
         Many of our products contain software that enables us to connect with our gamers directly. This provides a significant marketing tool that allows us to communicate and market directly to our customers, including through customized advertising and in-game messaging based on customer preferences and trends. Our marketing efforts also include activities on Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and other online social networks, other online advertising, other public relations activity, print and broadcast advertising, coordinated in-store and industry promotions (including merchandising and point of purchase displays), participation in cooperative advertising programs, direct response vehicles, and product sampling through demonstration software distributed through the Internet or the digital online services provided by our partners. From time to time, we also receive marketing support from hardware manufacturers, producers of consumer products related to a game, and retailers in connection with their own promotional efforts. 
         Our physical products are available for sale in outlets around the world. These products are sold primarily on a direct basis to mass-market retailers (e.g., Target, Wal-Mart), consumer electronics stores (e.g., Best Buy), discount warehouses, game specialty stores (e.g., GameStop), and other stores (e.g., Amazon, Toys "R" Us) or through third-party distribution and licensing arrangements. 
         Most of our products and content are also available in a digital format, which allows consumers to purchase and download the content at their convenience directly to their console, PC, or mobile device through our platform partners, including Microsoft Corporation ("Microsoft"), Sony Interactive Entertainment Inc. ("Sony"), Nintendo Co., Ltd. ("Nintendo"), Apple Inc. ("Apple"), Google Inc. ("Google"), and Facebook, Inc. ("Facebook"). Blizzard utilizes its proprietary online gaming service, Battle.net®, to distribute most of Blizzard's content directly to PC consumers. 
         In addition to serving as a distribution platform, Blizzard's Battle.net offers players communications features, social networking, player matching and digital content delivery and is designed to allow people to connect regardless of what Blizzard game they are playing. It attracts millions of active players, making it one of the largest online game-related services in the world. 
   Manufacturing 
         We prepare master program copies for our products on each release platform. With respect to products for Microsoft, Sony and Nintendo consoles, our disk duplication, packaging, printing, manufacturing, warehousing, assembly and shipping are performed by third-party subcontractors or distribution facilities owned by us. 
         Microsoft, Sony, and Nintendo generally specify or control the manufacturing and assembly of finished products and license their hardware technologies to us for which we pay an applicable royalty per unit once the manufacturer fills the product order, even if the units do not ultimately sell. We 
 7

   deliver the master materials to the licensor or its approved replicator, who then manufactures the finished goods and delivers them to us for distribution under our label. 
   Significant Customers and Top Franchises 
   Customers 
         While the Company does sell directly to end consumers in certain instances, such as sales through our Battle.net platform, in other instances our customers may be platform providers, such as Sony, Microsoft, and Apple, or retailers, such as Wal-Mart and GameStop, who act as distributors of our content to end consumers. For the year end December 31, 2016, Sony and Apple each accounted for 13% of our net revenues. For the year ended December 31, 2015, Sony and Microsoft accounted for 12% and 10%, respectively, of our net revenues. We did not have any single customer that accounted for 10% or more of our net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2014. 
         We had three customersSony, Microsoft, and Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.who accounted for 17%, 10%, and 10%, respectively, of consolidated gross receivables at December 31, 2016, and 18%, 13%, and 11%, respectively, of consolidated gross receivables at December 31, 2015. 
   Top Franchises 
         For the year ended December 31, 2016, our top four franchisesCall of Duty, Candy Crush, World of Warcraft, and Overwatchcollectively accounted for 69% of our net revenues. For the year ended December 31, 2015, our top four franchisesCall of Duty, World of Warcraft, Destiny, and Hearthstonecollectively accounted for 75% of our net revenues. For the year ended December 31, 2014, our top four franchisesCall of Duty, World of Warcraft, Skylanders, and Diablocollectively accounted for 75% of our net revenues. 
 Competition 
         We compete for the leisure time and discretionary spending of consumers with other interactive entertainment companies, as well as with providers of different forms of entertainment, such as film, television, social networking, music and other consumer products. 
         The interactive entertainment industry is intensely competitive and new interactive entertainment software products and platforms are regularly introduced. We believe that the main competitive factors in the interactive entertainment industry include: product features, game quality, and playability; brand name recognition; compatibility of products with popular platforms; access to distribution channels; online capability and functionality; ease of use; price; marketing support; and quality of customer service. 
         We compete with other publishers of video game console, PC, and mobile interactive entertainment software. In addition to third-party software competitors, integrated video game console hardware and software companies, such as Microsoft, Sony, and Nintendo, compete directly with us in the development of software titles for their respective platforms. A number of software publishers have developed and commercialized, or are currently developing, online games for use by consumers. Further, we compete with publishers of mobile games. Lastly, with our Skylanders franchise and its toys and accessories, we compete indirectly with companies who sell toys to our target consumers for this franchise. 
   Intellectual Property 
         Like other interactive entertainment companies, our business is significantly dependent on the creation, acquisition, use and protection of intellectual property. Some of this intellectual property is in the form of copyrighted software code, patented technology, and other technology and trade secrets 
 8

   that we use to develop and run our games. Other intellectual property is in the form of copyrighted audio-visual elements that consumers can see, hear and interact with when they are playing our games. 
         We develop a majority of our products based on wholly-owned intellectual properties, such as Call of Duty, World of Warcraft, and Candy Crush, among others. In other cases, we obtain intellectual property through licenses and service agreements, such as for our Destiny franchise. Further, our products that play on consoles and mobile platforms include technology that is owned by the platform provider and is licensed non-exclusively to us for use in the relevant product. We also license technology from providers other than console manufacturers in developing our content and services. While we may have renewal rights for some licenses, our business is dependent on our ability to continue to obtain the intellectual property rights from the owners of these rights on reasonable terms and at reasonable rates. 
         We actively engage in enforcement and other activities to protect our intellectual property. For our PC products, we use copy protection technology or other technological protection measures to prevent piracy and the use of unauthorized copies of our products. For other platforms, the platform providers typically incorporate technological protections and other security measures in their platforms to prevent the use of unlicensed products on those platforms. In addition, we are actively engaged in enforcement of our copyright, trademark, patent, and trade secret rights against potential infringers of those rights along with other protective activities, including monitoring online channels for distribution of pirated copies and participating in various enforcement initiatives, education programs and legislative activity around the world.
