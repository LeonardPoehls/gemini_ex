 Item 1 - Business
 
  As used in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the terms "we", "us", "our", “SpendSmart”, “SpendSmart Networks, Inc.”, and the "Company" means SpendSmart Networks, Inc., a Delaware corporation, its wholly-owned subsidiary SpendSmart Networks, Inc., a California corporation or their management.
 Current Business & Strategy
  
  We are a national full-service mobile and loyalty marketing agency that offers a means for small and large business owners alike to better connect with their consumers and generate sales. We do business under the name “SMS Masterminds.” The core of our business involves two licenses which include, among other things, a proprietary SaaS (software as a service) system, proprietary marketing and sales training materials and mobile-responsive website building software.
  
  With our mobile and loyalty marketing programs and proprietary responsive website building software, we provide proprietary loyalty systems and a suite of digital engagement and marketing services that help local merchants build relationships with consumers and drive revenues. These services are sold, implemented and supported both internally and by a vast network of certified digital marketing specialists, aka “Certified Masterminds,” who drive revenue and consumer relationships for merchants via loyalty programs, custom mobile-responsive websites, review generation and management, social media engagement, mobile marketing, mobile commerce and financial tools, such as reward systems. We enter into licensing agreements for our proprietary loyalty and mobile marketing solutions and custom mobile-responsive website building tools with “Certified Masterminds” which sell and support the technology in their respective exclusive markets. We provide extensive training materials, best practice guides and other resources to our licensees, including access to a “Mentor,” who is an existing successful “Mastermind.” In addition to our introductory training program, our licensees have access to an online forum and knowledge base, and the ability to interface with various in house resources for needs related to merchant account management and support, as well as sales and business development.
  
  The licensees also utilize digital loyalty tablets provided to their merchants. The loyalty tablets are proprietary tablet devices set up in physical retail locations where consumers can enter their mobile phone number to “opt-in” to receive notifications from the merchant and participate in the merchant’s loyalty program.

 We plan to pursue these strategies across a broad range of consumer, business, for-profit and non-profit organization, and government/municipal sectors. In addition, we have partnered with various groups to develop strategic affinity/co-brand opportunities. We expect to continue such partnership programs with various global for-profit and non-profit organizations.
  
  Advertising and Marketing Strategies
  
 SpendSmart develops the loyalty and mobile marketing license through the acquisition of interested ‘prospects’ or leads generated through various advertisements placed on web portals throughout the internet, as well as through referrals from existing licensees. These lead sources have proven to be a consistent and reliable channel for interested potential licensees. We intend to continue to look for new sources of licensee leads, as well as increase our budget to increase our volume of leads generated. All other aspects of the business will be promoted through our network of licensees in North America.
 Financial Model
  
 Our Mobile and Loyalty Marketing and website development programs provide for multiple revenue components including set up fees and recurring license fees, messaging, equipment and marketing services fees and value added mobile marketing and mobile commerce services.
  
 We generate revenues primarily in the form of set up fees, recurring license fees, messaging, equipment and marketing services fees and value added mobile marketing and mobile commerce services. License fees are charged monthly for our support services. Business development and set-up fees primarily consist of fees for website development services (including support and unspecified upgrades and enhancements when and if they are available), training and professional services that are not essential to functionality.
  
 We employ outside consultants to handle overflow development work on our proprietary software platforms, marketing services, legal and other specific business functions when needed. While we intend to restrict the number of new employees we add to our Company’s workforce, we believe that new personnel will be necessary in the future in the areas of project management, software programming, operations, accounting, sales and administration.
  
  Barriers to Entry
  
 Our Company has applied for patents in connection with our Mobile and Loyalty Marketing program and its related uses and planned future features. We believe that the business processes in connection with our Mobile and Loyalty Marketing program are original to our Company; however we may discover that others have patent claims of which we are currently unaware. Should we be successful in obtaining the grant of the patents under application and should we be successful in countering any challenges to their validity that might emerge, the lifetime of the granted patents would be twenty years. Should the patent applications in question be approved, it could give us a cost advantage from the license fees that future potential competitors would be required to pay as well as revenues from said license fees. There can be no assurance however that we will be successful in receiving such a patent or successful in countering any challenges thereto.
 Competitive Business Conditions
  
 The market for loyalty and mobile marketing services is large, growing and highly competitive. We have identified a few providers of loyalty and mobile marketing related products and services.

  Spot On is a provider of a loyalty rewards platform that utilizes a touchscreen tablet to digitize a punch card type loyalty program. At this time Spot appears to be privately held, but well financed. They are based in California. They do not appear at this time to have any kind of text based marketing component to their offering, but instead focus on digitizing the punch card experience and delivering messaging to consumers via email. Spot On does not at this time have any localized representation or support, instead they rely on selling and supporting nationally over the phone and via their website.
  
  BellyCard is a provider of loyalty rewards platforms directly to merchants utilizing a touchscreen tablet to digitize the punch card type loyalty program. They claim to have a total of ten thousand merchants located in the US. They utilize an iPad device as their touchscreen interface and have robust customer analytics engine that the merchant can utilize to understand trends in their business. They do not at this time provide any texting capability and do not have localized support or sales teams. They instead rely on national support and an outsourced phone sales team.
  
 In summary, while we face potential future competition in our target market for our products, we currently believe our products offer distinct features that respond to market needs not well served by the identified competitors mentioned above. However, many of these firms have longer operating histories, greater name recognition and greater financial, technical, and marketing resources than us. Increased competition from any of these sources could result in our failure to achieve and maintain an adequate level of customer demand and market share to support the cost of our operations.
 
  Pre-Paid Credit Card
  
 On November 26, 2014, in an effort to reduce expenses as well as focus its resources on its mobile and loyalty marketing solutions, the Company decided to begin a wind down of the operations of its pre-paid credit card product. All credit card related operations ceased on or about January 26, 2015. The Company will maintain certain card customer data for five (5) years. The pre-paid card program included our general-purpose card and our SpendSmart MasterCard Teen Prepaid Card.
 Corporate History
  
 Our Company was originally incorporated in the State of Colorado on May 14, 1990 as “Snow Eagle Investments, Inc.” and was inactive from 1990 until 1997. In April 1997, the Company acquired the assets of 1st Net Technologies, LLC, a California limited liability company, and the Company changed its name to “1st Net Technologies, Inc.” and operated as an Internet commerce and services business. In August 2001, the Company suspended its operations. In September of 2005, the Company acquired VOS Systems, Inc. (the “VOS Subsidiary”) as its wholly owned subsidiary and the Company changed its name to “VOS International, Inc.” and traded under the symbol “VOSI.OB”. The VOS Subsidiary operated as a technology company involved in the design, development, manufacturing, and marketing of consumer electronic products.
  
 On October 16, 2007, we sold the VOS Subsidiary and acquired BillMyParents-CA (at the time both our Colorado parent and California subsidiary were named IdeaEdge, Inc.). On May 1, 2009, our Company changed our name from IdeaEdge, Inc. to Socialwise, Inc., and our stock traded under the symbol “SCLW.OB”. On May 25, 2011, we changed our name to BillMyParents, Inc. and beginning June 13, 2011, our stock traded under the symbol “BMPI.OB.” On February, 15, 2013, we changed our name to The SpendSmart Payments Company and beginning February 28, 2013, our stock traded under the symbol “SSPC.OB.” Effective as of June 20, 2014, the Company was re-domiciled from Colorado to Delaware. Effective as of June 20, 2014, we filed an amendment to our Certificate of Incorporation changing our name to “SpendSmart Networks, Inc.”
