ITEM 1.  BUSINESS
Overview
 
Tremor Video, Inc., we or us, provides software for video advertising effectiveness.  Our buyer and seller platforms enable seamless transactions in a premium video marketplace by offering control and transparency to our clients.
 
Our buyer platform enables advertisers, agencies and other buyers of advertising, which we collectively refer to as buyers, to discover, buy, optimize and measure the effectiveness of their video ad campaigns, across all screens, including computers, smartphones, tablets and connected TVs.  Our proprietary technology analyzes video content, detects viewer and system attributes, and leverages our large repository of stored and integrated third-party data to optimize and target the delivery of ad campaigns to achieve a broad spectrum of marketing goals  from audience reach to more sophisticated goals such as engagement, brand lift and viewability.  Through our All-Screen optimization solution, buyers are able to choose a single campaign goal and our technology will optimize delivery of  the campaign across a broad inventory pool to find the right viewer wherever they may be watching video, eliminating the need to allocate campaign budgets to a specific screen or device.
 
We empower video ad buying however a buyer wants to transact.    Our buyer platform is directly integrated with video inventory sources, enabling the dynamic purchase of ad impressions through robust auctions, as well as through private marketplaces that connect buyers directly to sellers.  Buyers can purchase advertising on a guaranteed basis, where we execute the campaign according to an agreed set of objectives for a fixed price, or on a non-guaranteed basis, utilizing our proprietary real-time bidding technology.  We offer varying levels of client service, from fully managed to self-service, depending on a buyers needs.
 
Buyers are able to access our buyer platform on a programmatic basis through the Tremor Video DSP, an intuitive and customizable user interface where they can actively manage the execution of their campaigns.  The Tremor Video DSP creates significant work flow efficiencies for buyers, providing them with tools to manage settings across account, advertiser, campaign or placement level, and the ability to discover, activate and measure all of their private market place deals through one central console. Our advanced analytics suite enables buyers to gain a deep understanding of the drivers of campaign performance and obtain reporting on key brand performance metrics such as viewability, as well as TV-like metrics that measure reach and frequency of viewing by a particular audience.
 
Our higher-function buying products offer clients innovative ways to reach their target audiences and ensure that they are only paying for what performs.   With our proprietary outcome-based pricing models, a buyer only pays when they have achieved their desired objective, fully aligning our results with the success of a campaign.    For instance, with our CPE pricing, an advertiser only pays when a viewer actively engages with an ad, such as by interacting with the ad through clicks or screen touches.  Our advanced targeting solutions allow buyers to leverage unique data sets to find their desired audience across screens and increase the impact of their brand advertising.
 
Our seller platform, the Tremor Video SSP, helps suppliers of video advertising inventory, or sellers, improve yield and maximize the value of their inventory by enabling their programmatic sales efforts.  Sellers on the Tremor Video SSP can make inventory available to buyers through an open exchange, where buyers bid on inventory in a robust auction environment, or through private marketplaces so that only selected buyers have the opportunity to purchase video ad inventory.  Through the Tremor Video SSP, we provide sellers with tools to manage their supply hierarchies and demand tiers, and offer real-time reporting that allows sellers to effectively monitor bidding activity on their inventory.   Buyers connect to sellers on the Tremor Video SSP through third-party demand side platforms, or third party DSPs, that are integrated directly with our seller platform.  In addition, the Tremor Video SSP is one of many inventory sources that is connected to our buyer platform.
 
Industry Background
 
Online video advertising is among the fastest growing advertising formats worldwide.  Several factors, including the availability of high-speed broadband and mobile network infrastructure, growth of internet-connected devices capable of video consumption, an increase in online video content and a behavioral shift towards online video viewing are driving robust growth in online video consumption across screens.  We believe this growth will continue to accelerate as traditional television content migrates online.
 
Online video advertising offers brand advertisers a number of advantages over more traditional advertising solutions, such as the ability to measure and analyze large repositories of data in real-time and optimize the delivery of an ad campaign for a specific campaign objective or target audience.  Online video provides buyers with unprecedented control over the direction and targeting of their ad campaigns and offers transparency into what is driving performance, giving marketers the ability to effectively measure the return on their brand advertising dollars.  Online video also provides sellers with the opportunity to maximize yield and the value of their video content by providing access to advanced analytics and reporting as well as tools to manage and allocate inventory.  We believe that online video is a highly effective channel for brand advertisers to meet their advertising objectives by combining the rich sight, sound and motion of television, the opt-in engagement of print and the real-time measurement and optimization capabilities of online.

As online video advertising continues to scale and evolve, the need for software solutions that automate the process for planning, buying, selling and measuring video advertising across screens has become more pronounced.  Recently, an increasing amount of online video advertising is being transacted programmatically.  Programmatic buying refers to the automated purchase and sale of digital advertising through technology, including the use of real-time bidding technology that allows for the dynamic purchase and sale of advertising inventory on an impression-by-impression basis.  This technology enables buyers and sellers to efficiently transact in an open auction environment or through private marketplaces that seamlessly connect buyers and sellers of video advertising.
 
Despite the tremendous growth opportunity for the online video advertising market, there are a number of challenges to the adoption of online video advertising that require sophisticated technology to solve, including: audience and device fragmentation; the complexity of analyzing video and optimizing campaigns across multiple screens; ensuring that video ads are viewable to viewers; the absence of performance transparency; scarcity of premium inventory; reliance on multiple technology providers and intermediaries; challenges combatting fraudulent activities and brand safety issues; and the lack of consistent and standard measurements.
 
Tremor Video Technology and Solutions
 
We provide software for video advertising effectiveness. Our buyer and seller platforms enable seamless transactions between buyers and sellers of advertising in a premium video marketplace.
Buyer Platform
 
Our buyer platform enables buyers to efficiently discover, buy, optimize and measure the effectiveness of their video ad campaigns. Through our buyer platform we deliver:
 
·                  Advanced optimization for brand performance.  We have developed a suite of brand-centric key performance indicators, or KPIs, such as engagement, viewability and brand preference (i.e., a positive shift in preference towards a brand or branded product driven by exposure to a video ad and brand education), which are tailored to the needs of brand advertisers and designed specifically for video. Before the launch of a video advertising campaign, a buyer selects the KPI against which it wants to optimize the performance of its campaign.  Using a proprietary algorithm, our technology builds a decision tree that predicts performance of the video ad campaign for the chosen KPI based on its analysis of a series of signals, such as video player size, geography, content category, length of video and viewer data, including demographic information and viewing history.  Our technology performs an analysis on the video stream, including by using the ability to scan and categorize content by analyzing the audio track and certain visual elements, and optimizes delivery of the campaign for the selected KPI by directing advertising spend towards video ad inventory that is more likely to perform.  For instance, if a client chooses to optimize a video ad campaign for engagement, our technology will continuously track and analyze the signals described above to determine which are most correlated with achieving a high engagement rate and direct campaign spend towards video ad inventory that meet these criteria.
 
·                  All-screen optimization.  Our all-screen optimization solution for in-stream video advertising enables buyers to select a single performance objective and our technology will optimize delivery of the campaign across screens to find the right viewer wherever they may be watching video, whether on computers, tablets, smartphones or connected TVs, thus eliminating the need to allocate campaign budgets to a specific device.
 
·                  Real-time bidding technology.  Our buyer platform is directly integrated with the largest video supply side platforms, enabling the dynamic purchase of individual ad impressions in an open exchange as well as through private marketplaces that connect buyers directly to selected sellers of video advertising inventory.  Our buyer platform utilizes proprietary real-time bidding and optimization technology to maximize a buyers campaign spend for delivery against a given campaign objective.
 
·                  Precision targeting.  In addition to offering optimization against a suite of brand-centric KPIs, our technology enables precise targeting across specific signals such as demographics, geography and player-size.  We also enable buyers to target consumers using first-party data or data from integrated third party data management platforms.
 
·                  Integrated data and technology partners.  In addition to our proprietary technology, our buyer platform is integrated with a suite of third-party technologies, including data management platforms to enhance audience targeting.  For example, through our partnership with Alphonso Inc., we are able to offer buyers the ability to target audiences in real-time based

on TV viewership data.  We are also integrated with a number of third-party technologies that offer placement verification and reporting services.  By offering access to these integrated technologies through a single platform, we reduce complexities faced by buyers utilizing multiple technology providers.
 
·                  Full spectrum buying options.  Our buyer platform empowers video ad buying however a buyer wants to transact. We offer varying levels of client service, from fully managed to self-service, based on the individual preference of a buyer.  Buyers can purchase advertising through guaranteed pricing models as well as non-guaranteed pricing, and can transact through open auction or private marketplaces with specific sellers.
 
·                  Work-flow efficiency.   Buyers are able to access our buyer platform programmatically through the Tremor Video DSP, an intuitive and customizable user interface where they can actively manage the execution of their campaigns.  Buyers are able to manage settings from account level, advertiser level, campaign level or placement level to create workflow efficiency.  Our Deal Manager solution allows buyers to discover, activate and measure all of their private market place deals through one central console.  Buyers can explore and purchase pre-approved packages of inventory that have been curated for performance against a given metric or seamlessly execute direct buys with specific sellers, while monitoring performance in real time.
 
·                  Advanced Analytics.  We provide buyers with advanced analytics and measurement tools so that they can understand the true performance of their ad campaigns, relieving them from the need to integrate and support multiple, disparate technologies, including:
 
·            Ad performance transparency.  We provide buyers with transparency into the workings of our decision engine so that they can understand what signals are driving the performance of their video ad campaigns. These insights into campaign performance can not only inform future online advertising decisions but also influence offline advertising decisions.
 
·            Viewability.  Our technology analyzes whether a video ad placement is fully, partially, or not visible to a viewer.  Our platform is also integrated with third party technology providers that provide independent metrics for measuring and validating viewability. Buyers are able to optimize delivery of their video campaigns to maximize viewability and we offer pricing models where a buyer only pays for viewable impressions.
 
·            Cross-site measurement.  Our proprietary measurement tools enable buyers to compare video inventory quality across sellers by measuring attributes such as viewability, the size of the video player and ad completion rate. When coupled with pricing information, these insights help buyers compare the relative value of video inventory across sellers.
 
·            TV-like buying and measurement.   Our buyer platform enables advertisers to buy and measure video advertising in a manner consistent with the television industry, using metrics such as gross rating points, or GRPs, which are a measure of reach and frequency among a target audience, and verify the audience they reach using Nielsen reporting.  These functions help buyers unify the planning and measurement of TV and online video advertising campaigns.
 
·                  Brand safety and anti-fraud solutions.  Our buyer platform offers advanced solutions for combating fraudulent or objectionable ad placements, including bot traffic.  Through server-to-server integrations with third party technology providers, our platform preemptively and in real-time prevents the placement of advertising to inventory that is identified as being potentially fraudulent.  We also offer solutions that block placements of advertising to brand conflicting properties or page content that is identified as being inappropriate or unsafe for the brand.
 
·                  Advanced ad formats.  Our proprietary ad formats give buyers the ability to create a more engaging experience across multiple internet-connected devices, allowing viewers to interact with an ad and explore additional content within the ad itself, driving increased awareness and time spent with an ad.
 
·                  Scale and reach.  Our buyer platform delivers scale and reach across multiple internet-connected devices, including computers, smartphones, tablets, and connected TVs, enabling buyers to use our solutions to address their online video advertising needs across screens. Our buyer platform is directly integrated with the largest video supply side platforms, enabling the dynamic purchase of individual ad impressions in an open exchange. We continuously evaluate and refine our network of sellers to ensure that buyers have access to high performing content in a brand safe environment.

·                  Proprietary pricing models.  We offer innovative brand outcome-based pricing for in-stream video advertising that allow buyers to purchase measurable brand results, such as:
 
·                  Cost per engagement, or CPE pricing, where we are compensated only when viewers actively engage with buyers campaigns, such as by interacting with the elements of the video ad through clicks or screen touches or by rolling over certain elements of the video ad for at least three seconds;
 
·                  Cost per viewable and completed, or CPV&C pricing, where we are only compensated when a video ad is both completed and viewable by the viewer for the duration of the ad;
 
·                  Cost per video completion, or CPVC, pricing, where we are compensated only when viewers complete the video ad;
 
·                  Cost per brand-shift, or CPS, pricing, where we are compensated only when a campaign results in a positive shift in the consumers favorability or intent towards a brand; and
 
·                  Cost per conquest, or CPQ, pricing, where we are compensated only when a consumers intent is shifted away from a competing brand.
 
We believe that buyers are attracted to our outcome-based pricing models because these models more closely tie advertising spend to actual campaign performance.
 
Seller Platform
 
Our seller platform, the Tremor Video SSP, helps sellers improve yield and maximize the value of their video inventory by enabling their programmatic sales efforts.
 
·                  Robust auction environment.  The Tremor Video SSP is directly integrated with the leading video demand sources, including third party DSPs and our buyer platform, creating a robust marketplace through which sellers are able to efficiently monetize their advertising inventory in an open auction real-time bidding environment.  Server-to-server integrations with third party DSPs are multi-faceted and often require several months of testing and technical trouble-shooting to ensure that the third party DSP is able to access the full functionality of our platform.  These server-to-server integrations significantly reduce latency and response time.
 
·                  Private marketplaces.  The Tremor Video SSP enables sellers to establish private marketplaces with buyers.  Private marketplaces can be transacted through invite only auctions, where select buyers are given the opportunity to bid on a curated set of publisher inventory at a pre-negotiated price on a non-guaranteed basis.  For instance, a buyer can access a private marketplace on the Tremor Video SSP that consists of sellers that have been specifically selected because they are likely to have a high number of viewable impressions.  In addition, private marketplaces can directly connect a given buyer to a seller on our Tremor Video SSP, allowing them to efficiently transact on a guaranteed or non-guaranteed basis without the need for manual insertion orders.
 
·                  Inventory management tools.  We provide sellers with the tools and controls to manage their inventory across multiple devices and platforms.  These tools enable sellers to establish supply hierarchies and demand tiers, set minimum price floors, and define advertiser and category level black and white lists to manage potential sales channel conflicts.
 
·                  Advanced real-time reporting.  Real-time reporting provides up-to-the-second data, allowing sellers to effectively monitor buyers buying patterns and make instant changes to take advantage of market dynamics and maximize their yield.
 
Clients
 
Buyer Platform
 
We maintain close relationships directly with brand advertisers and we consider them to be our clients, as the video ad campaigns we run are ultimately those of the advertiser and we work closely with them to execute their campaigns. However, we primarily market and sell our buyer platform to advertising agencies, including agency trading desks, which often plan and execute programmatic transactions on behalf of an agency.

Buyers are able to access our buyer platform as a managed service, with our team of specialists managing the execution of an advertising campaign, from advising on pre-flight planning through post-campaign reporting and analysis. In addition, buyers can transact directly on our buyer platform through the Tremor Video DSP.   The Tremor Video DSP can be accessed on a self-service basis or at varying levels of managed service, depending on the preferences of the buyer.
 
Revenue contribution from individual brand advertisers varies from period to period.  We do not believe our business is substantially dependent upon any individual advertiser as no individual advertiser represented more than 10% of our revenue in 2016, 2015 or 2014.
 
Seller Platform
 
Sellers own or operate websites and applications through which video advertisements can be delivered to consumers as they navigate across screens, including computers, smartphones, tablets and connected TVs.  Sellers provide us with the content, or video advertising inventory, within which video advertising campaigns are delivered on our buyer platform.  Sellers also utilize the Tremor Video SSP as a yield-optimization and supply management tool to improve their selling efforts.
 
The Tremor Video SSP helps sellers improve their yield and maximize the value of their video inventory by enabling their programmatic sales efforts.  Sellers can sell their video inventory through an open exchange, where demand sources bid on inventory in a robust auction environment, or through private marketplaces so that only a selected buyer or buyers have the opportunity to purchase video ad inventory.  We provide sellers with the tools and controls to manage their inventory across multiple devices and platforms.  These tools enable sellers to establish supply hierarchies and demand tiers, set minimum price floors, and define advertiser and category level black and white lists to manage potential sales channel conflicts.  Real-time reporting provides up-to-the-second data, allowing sellers to effectively monitor buyers buying patterns and make instant changes to take advantage of market dynamics and maximize their yield.
 
In order to increase spend running through our Seller Platform, we maintain close relationships with the third party DSPs through which buyers transact.  Third party DSPs purchase advertising inventory on the Tremor Video SSP through server-to-server integrations.  Server-to-server integrations with third party DSPs are multi-faceted and often require several months of testing and technical trouble-shooting to ensure that the third party DSP is able to access the full functionality of our platform.  Campaigns running through third-party DSPs do not utilize our technology for optimizing campaign delivery or making bidding decisions; rather, the DSP will bid on inventory using its own decision engine.  While the third-party DSP is responsible for bidding decisions, the overall direction of the advertising spend is typically determined by the advertiser or advertising agency.
 
Technology and Development
 
We have incurred substantial technology and development expenses developing, maintaining and improving the technology that underlies our buyer and seller platforms.  We believe that technology innovation is key to our success and we intend to continue to invest in the development of new feature sets and functionalities as well as enhancements to our existing product suite.  As of December 31, 2016, we had a total of 103 employees engaged in technology and development functions. For 2016, 2015, and 2014, our total technology and development expenses were $21.0 million, $20.2 million, and $17.0 million, respectively.
Sales
 
As of December 31, 2016, we had total sales and marketing staff of 192 employees.  For 2016, 2015, and 2014, our total sales and marketing expenses were $48.4 million, $48.9 million, and $42.6 million, respectively.
Buyer Platform
 
Our sales strategy is focused on targeting the most video ready brand advertisers, including those advertisers that are large traditional television advertising spenders.  We have developed and will continue to develop preferred relationships with key agency holding companies, advertising agencies and agency trading desks that position us to benefit from increased online video spending. Brand advertisers purchasing decisions typically are made and coordinated by their advertising agencies and require input from multiple constituencies and the sales process therefore can be time-consuming. We have invested significant resources in establishing relationships with brand advertisers, advertising agencies and agency trading desks.
 
Our buyer focused sales force is generally structured around core vertical markets, including automotive, consumer packaged goods, entertainment, technology and telecommunications, retail and financial services.  In addition, certain members of our sales team are focused on establishing relationships with key decision makers within the largest advertising agencies and agency trading desks, in particular as relates to our programmatic offering.  Our sales team is supported by engineers with deep technical expertise.

Sales executives and account managers are assigned to specific advertisers to oversee relationships.  For managed service campaigns, our team of specialists provides guidance throughout the campaign process from launch to post campaign review, and our creative team will often work with advertisers to create innovative ad campaigns that are specifically suited for in-stream video viewing and optimizing viewer engagement.
 
We generally locate sales and marketing personnel across the United States to align with the geographies of buyers and the vertical markets that we serve.
 
Seller Platform
 
Our seller initiatives utilize a full-service development and support strategy. Our seller focused sales team is responsible for ensuring that we are meeting the ongoing needs of our sellers throughout the duration of the relationship, and is supported by engineers with deep technical expertise. We invest significant time in identifying and cultivating relationships with sellers to ensure they understand the potential benefits of monetizing their inventory with us, and in order to secure access to premium advertising inventory for buyers.
 
Our seller team is focused on fostering adoption and overall market awareness of the Tremor Video SSP solution.   We also maintain a sales team that is focused on identifying and increasing spend from third-party DSPs that transact on the Tremor Video SSP.  Our team of technical account managers monitors third-party DSP bidding activities and provides recommendations that inform their trading practices, including insights around bidding behaviors and forecasting tools that assist in media planning.  Our sales team also collaborates with DSPs to create private marketplaces with select sellers on the Tremor Video SSP through custom deal configurations.
 
The relationship building process can be time consuming and we have invested significant resources in establishing relationships with our seller partners.
 
Competition
 
We operate in a dynamic and competitive market, influenced by trends in both the overall advertising market as well as the online video advertising industry. The competitive dynamics of our market are unpredictable because our market is in an early stage of development, rapidly evolving, fragmented and subject to potential disruption by new technological innovations. We compete with large online video publishers such as Google, Inc. and Facebook, Inc. that offer video advertising services as part of a larger solution for digital media buying, as well as advertising technology companies, advertising networks, demand side platforms, supply side platforms and exchanges. We also compete for advertiser spending with large sellers who rely on their own sales organizations to attract buyers across their properties. In the traditional media space, our primary competitors for advertising spend are mainly TV broadcasters, radio broadcasters and print media publishers. Many of these competitors have significant client relationships, much larger financial resources and longer operating histories than we have.
 
With respect to our buyer platform, we believe that we compete for advertising spend primarily on the basis of: proven technology and optimization capabilities; pricing, quality and scale of online video inventory; depth and breadth of relationships with buyers; all-screen capabilities; brand-centric measurement; our ability to combat fraudulent placements and ensure brand safety; and our ability to ensure viewability and transparency into ad performance and placement.   With respect to our seller platform, we believe that we compete primarily on the basis of the speed and ease of use of our platform, the quality of tools that we provide to sellers to control their inventory and maximize yield, our ability to provide real-time reporting and analytics, and our ability to provide demand to sellers at scale, including demand through our buyer platform.
 
We believe that we compete favorably with respect to all of these factors and that we are well positioned as a leading provider of software solutions for video advertising effectiveness.
 
Intellectual Property
 
Our ability to protect our intellectual property and our technology will be an important factor in the success and continued growth of our business. We rely on a combination of trade secrets, copyrights, patents and trademarks, as well as contractual protections, to establish and protect our intellectual property and protect our proprietary technology.  We currently own three issued U.S. patents that expire in 2027, 2028 and 2031, respectively, and one granted European patent, which we registered in France, Germany and Great Britain, that expires in 2029. Additionally, we currently own three pending U.S. patent applications that we are currently prosecuting with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, although there can be no assurance that any of these patent applications will ultimately be issued a patent.  We register certain domain names, trademarks and service marks in the United States and in certain locations outside the United States. We also rely upon common law protection for certain marks, such as Tremor Video. We generally enter into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our employees and contractors, and confidentiality agreements with parties, with whom we conduct business in order to limit access to, and disclosure and use of, our proprietary information. We also use measures designed to control access to our technology and proprietary information. We view our trade secrets and know-how as a significant component of our intellectual property assets, which we believe differentiate us from our competitors.

Despite our efforts to preserve and protect our intellectual property, our efforts may not prevent the misappropriation of our intellectual property or technology, or deter independent development of similar intellectual property or technology by others. Policing unauthorized use of our technology and intellectual property is difficult. Third-parties may attempt to copy, reverse engineer or otherwise obtain our proprietary technology, or otherwise violate our intellectual property rights. Unauthorized disclosure by our employees, contractors or other third-parties could also occur. Effective intellectual property protection may not be available in the United States or other jurisdictions in which we operate and the efforts we have taken to protect our proprietary rights may not be sufficient or effective. Any impairment or loss of our intellectual property, or any inability to enforce our intellectual property rights effectively, could harm our business or our ability to compete. Also, protecting our technology and intellectual property is costly and time-consuming. Any unauthorized disclosure or use of our intellectual property or technology could make it more expensive for us to do business and could harm our operating results.
 
Additionally, we expect that products in our industry may be subject to third-party infringement lawsuits as the number of competitors grows and the functionality of products in different industry segments overlaps.  From time to time, we face claims by third-parties that we infringe upon or misappropriate their intellectual property rights, and we may be found to be infringing upon or to have misappropriated such rights. We cannot assure you that we are not infringing or violating any third-party intellectual property rights. Such claims may be made by competitors or other entities. In the future, we, or our clients, may be the subject of legal proceedings alleging that our solutions or underlying technology infringe or violate the intellectual property rights of others.
 
Governmental Regulation; Industry Alliances
 
We are subject to numerous U.S. and foreign laws and regulations that are applicable to companies engaged in the online video advertising business, including video advertising on mobile devices. In addition, many areas of law that apply to our business are still evolving, and could potentially affect our business to the extent they restrict our business practices or impose a greater risk of liability. We are aware of several ongoing lawsuits filed against companies in our industry alleging various violations of privacy or data security related laws.
Privacy
 
Privacy and data protection laws and regulations play a significant role in our business. In the United States, at both the state and federal level, there are laws that govern activities such as the collection, use and disclosure of data by companies like us. Online advertising activities in the United States have primarily been subject to regulation by the Federal Trade Commission, or the FTC, which has regularly relied upon Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act, or Section 5, to enforce against unfair and deceptive trade practices. Section 5 has been the primary regulatory tool used to enforce against alleged violations of consumer privacy interests. In addition, our solutions reach devices and users throughout the world, including in Australia, North America, South America, Europe and Asia. As a result, some of our activities may also be subject to the laws of foreign jurisdictions. In particular, European data protection laws can be more restrictive regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of data than those in the United States. As we continue to expand into other foreign countries and jurisdictions, we may be subject to additional laws and regulations that may affect how we conduct business.
 
Additionally, U.S. and foreign governments and relevant self-regulatory bodies have enacted, considered or are considering legislation or regulations that could significantly restrict industry participants ability to collect, augment, analyze, use and share anonymous data, such as by regulating the level of consumer notice and consent required before a company can employ cookies or other electronic tools to track people online or by redefining the types of information that constitute personal information and non-personal information.  The European Union, or EU, and some EU member states have already implemented legislation and regulations requiring advertisers to obtain specific types of notice and consent from individuals before using cookies or other technologies to track individuals and their online behavior and deliver targeted advertisements.  We sometimes use precise location information for the purpose of better targeting online or mobile advertisements.  The use of precise location information is of significant interest to regulators and legislators and new regulations or legislation may impose additional restrictions and/or costs upon us in the future.  It remains a possibility that additional legislation and regulations may be passed or otherwise issued other than in relation to precise location information in the future. We also participate in industry self-regulatory programs under which, in addition to other compliance obligations, we provide consumers with notice about our use of cookies and our collection and use of data in connection with the delivery of targeted advertising and allow them to opt-out from the use of data we collect for the delivery of targeted advertising. The rules and policies of the self-regulatory programs that we participate in are updated from time to time and may impose additional restrictions upon us in the future.
 
Any failure, or perceived failure, by us to comply with U.S. federal, state, or international laws or regulations pertaining to privacy or data protection, or other policies, self-regulatory requirements or legal obligations could result in proceedings or actions against us by governmental entities or others.

Advertising
 
Even though we generally receive certain contractual protections from our buyers with respect to their video ads, we may nevertheless be subject to regulations concerning the content of ads. Federal and state laws governing intellectual property or other third-party rights could apply to the content of ads we place. Laws and regulations regarding unfair and deceptive advertising, sweepstakes, advertising to children, and other consumer protection regulations, may also apply to the ads we place on behalf of clients.
Industry Alliances
 
Given the developmental stage of video advertising, industry practices are rapidly evolving. We are participating members of the Digital Advertising Alliance, or DAA, including the DAA Principles and Communications Advisory Committee, which oversees the DAA and its working groups. We also participate in a wide range of Interactive Advertising Bureau (IAB) committees, councils and working groups, as well as other industry groups that are focused on establishing best practices for the online video advertising industry.
Employees
 
As of December 31, 2016, we had 328 employees, of which 103 were primarily engaged in technology and development functions, 192 were engaged in sales and marketing functions, and 33 were engaged in general and administrative functions. Substantially all of these employees are located in the United States. None of our employees are represented by a labor union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We consider our relationship with our employees to be good.
