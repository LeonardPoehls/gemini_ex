Item 1. Business
Business of Company
 
We were incorporated on January 2, 2013 under the laws of the State of Nevada. Our principal executive offices are located at One International Place, Suite 1400, Boston, MA 02110. Our telephone number is 617-535-7788. Our fiscal year end was February 28/29 but on February 11, 2016, our Board of Directors approved a change in the fiscal year end from a fiscal year ending on February 28 or 29 (as the case may be) to March 31, effective beginning with fiscal year 2016.
 
We began filing our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q based on the new fiscal year-end beginning with the first quarter of fiscal year ended March 31, 2017. Therefore, we reported the first quarter of fiscal year ended March 31, 2017 as the three-month period ended June 30, 2016.
 
In addition, our Consolidated Statements of Operations, and Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows also included a one-month period ended March 31, 2016.
 
The change to our fiscal year did not impact our fiscal year results for the year ended February 29, 2016. However, the change impacts the prior year comparability of each of the fiscal quarters and annual period in 2016 in future filings.
 
We believe this change will provide numerous benefits, including aligning our reporting periods to be more consistent with peer companies and improving comparability between periods.
 
On March 30, 2017, our name was changed from Luckycom Inc. to Luckycom Pharmaceuticals Inc. and again on April 11, 2018, our name was changed to Luckwel Pharmaceuticals Inc. In connection with the most recent name change, on April 13, 2018, our common stock began trading on the OTC Pink under its new ticker symbol “LWEL” and ceased trading under the ticker symbol “LCOM”. Also on April 13, 2018, we increased the number of our authorized shares of common stock from 100,000,000 to 200,000,000.
 
On December 13, 2017, Mr. Kingrich Lee, on behalf of the Company, sold to Ms. Lijian Li, his sister, 10,000 (100%) shares of stock of the Company’s wholly-owned Hong Kong subsidiary, Luckycom Limited at a purchase price of HKD 1 (approximately $0.13) per share aggregating to HKD 10,000 (approximately $1,281). The disposal loss recorded from the sale was $4,123.
 
On May 3, 2018, we entered into an Intellectual Property Sale and Purchase Agreement (the “Agreement”) with Luckwel Asia Limited (the “Luckwel Asia”, formerly known as Essential Choice Ventures Ltd)) to purchase from Luckwel Asia the intellectual property rights to five (5) drugs, comprising three generic medicines used to treat hypertension and high cholesterol and two advanced drug candidates - KL008 for treatment of hypertension and KL009 for treatment of high cholesterol in various stages of being developed and manufactured. Luckwel Asia is a British Virgin Islands corporation whose shareholders comprise Kingrich Holding Ltd, a Cayman Islands corporation (60%), Goldvito Ltd, Seychelles corporation (20%) and Morgold Ltd, a Seychelles corporation (20%). Mr. Kingrich Lee, our Chief Executive Officer and majority shareholder is the sole shareholder of Kingrich Holding Ltd and his two sisters are each the sole shareholder of each of Goldvito Ltd and Morgold Ltd. Pursuant to the Agreement, we paid US$40,000 and issued an aggregate 125,000,000 newly issued restricted shares of our common stock as consideration. The stock issuance was made in reliance on the exemption from registration afforded by Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act as provided in Rule 506(b) of Regulation D and Regulation S promulgated thereunder. The stock issuance was not conducted in connection with a public offering, and no public solicitation or advertisement was made or relied upon by any investor in connection with the stock issuance.
 
We are presently still a shell company and have not begun operations. We plan to launch the commercial batch production of the three generic drugs acquired on May 3, 2018 by December 2018 provided we are able to secure sufficient funding:

1. | WELVASC (Amlodipine Besylate Tablets) 
---+-----------------------------------------------
2. | WELTOR (Atorvastatin Calcium Tablets) 
3. | WEDUET (Amlodipine / Atorvastatin Tablets) 

 
As reflected in the accompanying financial statements, we have no source of revenues and need additional cash resources to maintain our operations. Our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent on our ability to raise additional capital or obtain necessary debt financing. There is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. We are presently dependent on our controlling shareholder to provide us funding for our daily operation and expenses, including professional fee and fees charged by regulators, although he is under no obligation to do so.
 
If we do not have sufficient working capital to pay our operating costs for the next 12 months, we will require additional funds to pay our legal, accounting and other fees associated with our Company and our filing obligations under United States federal securities laws, as well as to pay our other accounts payable generated in the ordinary course of our business.
 
Sales and Marketing
 
Given our current stage of development, we have not yet established commercial organization or distribution capabilities, nor have we entered into any partnership or co-promotion arrangements with an established pharmaceutical company. We plan to build up an international network after we achieve our financial targets.
Competition
 
The industry we plan to be in is highly competitive and subject to rapid and significant technological change. Key competitive factors affecting the commercial success of our products are likely to be efficacy, safety and tolerability profile, reliability, convenience of dosing, price and reimbursement. Many of these companies have substantially greater financial, marketing, and human resources than we do (including, in some cases, substantially greater experience in clinical testing, manufacturing, and marketing of pharmaceutical products).
Employees
 
We do not have any employees, other than Mr. Kingrich Lee.
