Item 1. Business.
Overview
 
Our mission is to help TV broadcasters and media companies transform their traditional business from just delivering content over-the-air via broadcast television to distributing content in multi-platform, digital formats on new platforms such as mobile, tablets, desktop and other connected devices. Our core product is a white-labeled software platform that enables media companies to publish their official content onto multiscreen devices, increase social interaction on those multiscreen experiences, and enable digital advertising. The platform consists of a CMS platform, native mobile and over-the-top (“OTT”) applications, responsive web framework, digital video solutions and digital advertising solutions. We generate revenues by charging monthly recurring software licensing fees, variable usage fees for our platform and sharing digital advertising revenue with our customers.
 
Our platform is currently being used by approximately 200 U.S. local news stations, mostly affiliated with large broadcasting networks such as NBC, CBS, FOX and ABC. We plan to enhance our platform in the future by expanding our offerings to other media verticals and international markets, together with investments into channel partnerships, sales and marketing, enhanced data analytics and innovative advertising products.
 
History and Corporate Structure
 
Capital Pool Company
 
We were originally incorporated pursuant to the Business Corporations Act (Ontario) (the “OBCA”) on June 7, 2013, under the name WB III Acquisition Corp. We completed our initial public offering on October 17, 2013, and were listed on the TSX Venture Exchange Inc. (“TSX-V”) as a CPC pursuant to Policy 2.4 - Capital Pool Companies of the TSX-V. As a CPC, our principal business was to identify and evaluate opportunities for the acquisition of assets or businesses for the completion of a qualifying transaction and, once identified and evaluated, to negotiate the acquisition, subject to shareholder and TSX-V approval.
Reverse Triangular Merger with TicToc (the “Qualifying Transaction”)
 
On September 30, 2014, we entered into a letter of intent with TicToc Planet, Inc., a Delaware Corporation (“TicToc”) incorporated in September 2012. On December 8, 2014, we entered into a merger agreement with our then wholly-owned subsidiary, WB III Subco Inc., and TicToc, pursuant to which we agreed to complete a qualifying transaction with TicToc by way of a “reverse triangular merger” (the “Qualifying Transaction”). On December 22, 2014, pursuant to articles of amendment, we changed our name to “Frankly Inc.” On December 23, 2014, we completed the Qualifying Transaction, which resulted in a reverse takeover of Frankly Inc. by the shareholders of TicToc, whereby WB III Subco Inc. merged with and into TicToc, TicToc changed its name to Frankly Co. and the security holders of Frankly Co. received securities of Frankly Inc. in exchange for their securities of Frankly Co.
Acquisition of Gannaway Web Holdings, LLC
 
On July 28, 2015, we signed an agreement (the “Unit Purchase Agreement”) to purchase the outstanding units of Gannaway Web Holdings, LLC, operating as Worldnow, for total consideration of $45 million. On August 25, 2015 (the “Closing Date”), the Company completed this acquisition of Worldnow. Subsequent to the acquisition, Worldnow changed its name to Frankly Media LLC (“Frankly Media”). Through the acquisition of Frankly Media, we became a software-as-a-service (“SaaS”) provider of content management and digital publishing software, also offering related digital advertising services for local media sites on the web and mobile.

Continuation as British Columbia Corporation
 
On July 11, 2016, we continued the Company as a British Columbia corporation under the Business Corporations Act (British Columbia) (the “BCBCA”).
 
Our Products and Services
 
Our product offerings have evolved as our business has grown and changed. From February 2013 through August 2015, we developed mobile applications and a next generation server platform. During this time, we launched, developed and marketed a consumer focused Frankly Chat mobile application, as well as a white-labeled, business-to-business mobile communication platform via a software development kit (“SDK”) that was used by retailers. The mobile app and SDK business are no longer a material part of our business but the technology became the foundation for our current platform. Through the acquisition of Frankly Media in August 2015, we leveraged our existing mobile and platform expertise to become a SaaS provider of content management for broadcasters and media companies. Today, we provide a white-labeled, integrated software platform to broadcasters and media companies. These customers use our technology to get their content onto multiscreen devices, increase social interaction on those multiscreen experiences, and enable digital advertising.
 
Our current platform consists of the following offerings and features:
 
CMS platform connected white-labeled application frameworks. Our white-labeled application frameworks for mobile applications, connected TV applications and desktop and mobile websites connect back into our CMS platform. They simplify the distribution of content across multiple platforms. Our mobile framework is an Android or iOS mobile application framework that enables our customers to easily publish their official mobile apps to their audience. Our native connected TV framework is an Apple TV, Roku and FireTV application framework that enables our customers to easily publish their official connected TV apps to their audience. We also provide a responsive web framework which is a white-labeled desktop and mobile web, collectively, a responsive web, framework that enables our customers to easily publish their official Internet homepages.
 
Robust VoD and live video solution. Our Video-On-Demand (“VoD”) live video solution ingests live video content into our on-premise server that encodes, transcodes and enables digital VoD clipping and live video publishing in an integrated format that eliminates the need for customers to deal with multiple vendors.
 
Digital advertising solutions. Our digital advertising solutions include both programmatic (automated) and direct agency sales efforts to place digital advertising onto our customer’s digital properties in return for a revenue share of the advertising dollars. We also provide local ad sales products and consulting and support services in exchange for monthly fees, and charge our customers for the use of our ad serving platform to serve ads for local and national advertising campaigns. The array of advertising products and services we offer provides our customers with turnkey access to the latest advertising solutions and simplifies the complicated task of monetizing their online properties.
 
Data-as-a-service. Our newest Data-as-a-service product leverages a Data Management Platform (“DMP”) offering our customers access to targeted audience data and user segments in order to increase targeting and higher advertising rates to advertisers on their digital properties. We plan to continue to develop this product to enable our customers to have actionable data to drive increased audience engagement and enhanced user experience.
 
We designed our platform and offerings to integrate into a holistic and unified platform with one seamless workflow, allowing our broadcasters and media customers to save time, achieve operational efficiency and to save on costs associated with managing an increasingly complex digital landscape. Our platform is designed to enable our customers to manage the full scope of their digital businesses from management, publishing and monetization in one place.
 
Customers and Customer Contracts
 
We enter into written contracts with our customers pursuant to which we provide access to our online, software-as-a-service, content management platform. These contracts typically cover the use of the platform and ancillary services such as delivery and storage of video content, and access to ad-serving and analytics functionality. Many of these agreements also grant us the right to sell online advertising inventory on behalf of the customer pursuant to a revenue sharing arrangement with the customer. Our agreements are generally for a three-year term and do not provide for early termination rights. We bill our customers monthly or quarterly for the fees associated with the software license, and monthly in arrears for variable usage fees incurred by a customer’s use of our platform. We generally make advertising revenue share payments to our customers on a quarterly basis. As of March 31, 2018, we had approximately 200 TV stations as customers.

While we have a diversified customer base, and are seeking to further diversify our customer base, our two largest customers, Raycom Media, Inc. (“Raycom) and Gray Television Group, Inc. accounted for, individually, 19% and 14% of revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016, respectively, and 19%, and 19% of revenue for the year ended December 31, 2017, respectively, and, collectively, for 38% of our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2017. Raycom is a customer of our content management platform and mobile apps and is our largest shareholder and creditor. Gray Television Group, Inc. is a customer of our advertising services.
 
Market Opportunity
 
The current global broadcast and media market participants are facing changes to their market landscape as their audiences are increasingly consuming their content via new platforms and devices. Mobile phones, tablets, connected TV, social media including Facebook, Twitter and Snapchat, and new internet-enabled devices, are beginning to take market share from the traditional television over-the-air broadcasts, radio and print publications.
 
According to Devoncroft’s 2016 NAB research report (the “Devoncroft Report”), the global media market for technology products and services in 2015 was approximately $49 billion and the majority of these products focused on the TV, over-the-air broadcast market. Given the increasing amounts of time the media market’s audience now spends on media consumption through mobile, Internet, and IP connected devices, broadcasters and media companies must also shift their expenditure dollars to their digital platforms. We believe that this shift will accelerate rapidly given today’s quick proliferation of always-on mobile devices and the availability of technology infrastructure to support a substantial digital business for the broadcast and media markets. According to the Devoncroft Report, there is a structural shift happening now in the industry toward IP technology.
 
As an increasing number of consumers have abandoned cable and over the air access to television programming in favor of online and mobile access, the Big Broadcast 2015 survey cites the overwhelming majority of technology decision-makers in U.S. local news and media groups in stating they will spend more on cloud-based service providers than on other technology categories. The new, younger audience for local news and media content demand social networking and multiscreen experiences. Millennials are consuming and sharing content through new platforms like Snapchat, BuzzFeed and other digital platforms instead of watching, listening to or reading traditional TV or print media. The U.S. local news and media markets have been rapidly adopting OTT publishing and native mobile platforms designed to reach end users on new devices. Local broadcasters are launching their own branded OTT apps to stay ahead of the curve as cable TV subscriptions fall and streaming subscriptions rise. According to Parks Associates, 36% of U.S. broadband households have at least one streaming media player, up from 27% last year. In late 2015, Apple launched the App Store on Apple TV so that media providers can participate in this industry shift. OTT is a fragmented space with many connected TV platforms available to users. However, we believe traditional media companies are at a disadvantage in this cord-cutting, mobile-first and connected devices trend as their consumers continue to flock to the internet and mobile devices. Traditional media companies have no information about their audience beyond age and gender while digital companies such as Netflix, Hulu and HBO Go have direct relationships and deep knowledge of their audience which allows them to have customer information, which in the case of Netflix and Hulu includes email and phone number, as well as billing information users used to sign-up for their services. In addition, traditional media companies have too many systems to effectively manage their digital presence and often lack the skilled personnel required to keep up with the web, mobile, advertising, data analytics and social media demands of their audience.
 
We believe the leading market sector for further development is the digital advertising sector both in terms of technology and market size. EMarketer projects worldwide mobile internet ad spending will increase from $19.2 billion in 2013 to $65.5 billion in 2019. In the 2016 edition of Kleiner, Perkins, Caufield and Byers’ annual Internet Trends report, Mary Meeker reported a $22 billion market opportunity in the transition from television to mobile advertising. Local media companies are looking for a better solution to run their digital advertising business, and the overall mobile advertising sector is developing quickly, especially with capabilities to hyper-target local advertising based on data and mobility.
 
We believe our broad reach among local media and our technology can benefit from the future development of the digital advertising markets and we expect to grow along with the digital success of our customers. Our capability to provide our media company customers with a one-stop shop to meet their digital platform needs will become more valuable as they continue to develop and grow the digital aspects of their businesses in response to the changing preferences of their audience customer base. We believe there are significant opportunities to increase the distribution of our products and services in this space.

Strategy 
 
We have a three-pronged growth strategy:
 
● First, we plan to continue to invest in developing our products so we can meet our local broadcasting market customers’ needs with an enhanced, integrated and holistic workflow. We will continue to enhance our current experience in responsive web, native applications, OTT apps and video solutions, and expand into new, emerging platforms where the audience consumes media through new IP-enabled experiences such as Amazon’s Alexa, connected/self-driving cars, artificial intelligence, and new social platforms such as Snapchat, Periscope and Reddit. We believe the value of our core strength in multi-point content ingestion into our consolidated CMS platform and our ability to push out this content on our multi-faceted publishing platform will continue to grow for our customers as we help them meet their challenges in engaging users in a multi-screen/device landscape.
 
● Second, we are planning to expand our industry verticals to other local media and programmers such as newspapers, radio and bloggers and to national media and programmers, cable channels, film distributors and sports and entertainment content providers, all of which have a growing need for an integrated digital and monetization platform. Our primary customers in this market today are local news broadcasters and media groups in the U.S. However, we see opportunities for growth and expansion in to adjacent verticals such as other local media such as newspapers, radio stations and local bloggers, and international media customers in the future. Whereas traditional media relied on a single medium delivered by only one platform such as television, digital media has become the great equalizer. Digital media puts media providers, including newspapers, TV stations, and Hollywood and Silicon Valley content providers, on the same playing field and forces them to compete for an audience. We believe that our integrated platform can enable anyone, from a single-individual blogger to a multi-network programmer, to manage and operate their digital business seamlessly and profitably. We plan to accelerate our target market expansion with the help of strategic partners who will resell and cross-sell our platform through our channel sales strategy, which relies on leveraging our partners’ customer relationships and sales resources to sell our own products. This will enable us to expand our sales presence efficiently and help us scale sales without incurring significant additional overhead expenses.
 
● Third, we believe a massive transformation is underway in the use of advertising dollars. Advertising dollars are shifting toward digital and we plan to invest and grow our data and advertising business lines by more aggressively deploying capital and assuming more calculated advertising inventory risk to grow our revenues. According to Mary Meeker’s 2016 State of the Internet report, mobile alone accounts for more than $20 billion of incremental opportunity given the misallocation of advertising dollars versus audience time spent across different platforms. We believe the increased ability to collect data and target advertising in the digital domain will shift the media industry from the legacy TV broadcasting structure where the media content platform and advertising are separate operations to a new digital framework where the content and advertising platforms are tightly coupled. We believe we are uniquely and strategically poised to capture this convergence of the business operations of content and advertising through our integrated platform and capabilities. This uniqueness is achieved as in addition to our content platform, our advertising capabilities include both the team (an established team of advertising technologists and business development professionals) and the advertising technology and partners (such as Google, Rubicon, OpenX, Krux, among others), which all take time, money and expertise to build. We currently have commercial relationships with Google, Rubicon, OpenX and Krux. Google, Rubicon and OpenX provide us with access to large competitive marketplaces in which to locate the highest bidders for our advertising inventory. Google and its affiliates also supply us with ad-serving technology, which we resell to our customers, and advertising analytics tools. We use Krux for data enhancement to help increase revenue we receive on advertising sales.
 
Research and Development
 
In order to support our growth strategy, we plan to continue to invest in research and development. We believe this is an important way to ensure the competitiveness of our product and to take advantage of emerging market opportunities. While we don’t singularly rely on any specific equipment or particular technology, we plan to continue to invest in each area of our product suite, including our CMS platform, video solutions, OTT and mobile app frameworks, our data infrastructure and our advertising technologies. We use a combination of in-house development and external, third-party developers for this development effort because we believe the combination of in-house and third-party development allows us to manage costs and to efficiently develop products. We capitalize our development costs according to our accounting principles, and currently capitalize at the rate of approximately $4 million per year to fund product development. We anticipate these investments will continue and grow as we increase our revenues, but we will be monitoring them closely to ensure cost discipline as market dynamics fluctuate.

Competition
 
We have a diverse set of competitors across the different aspects of our business. In the local broadcast arena, our chief competitor is Nexstar Broadcasting’s subsidiary Lakana (NASDAQ: NXST), which is owned by a larger broadcasting group which provides it with a captive customer base of TV stations owned by its parent company and significant industry contacts. Lakana has slightly more CMS customers than we do, in part due to the fact that it is owned by a large broadcasting group that operates approximately 170 television stations. We are not aware of Lanaka’s revenues or other resources, but we believe Lakana has access to financing from its parent entity and derives other benefits of being owned by a large public company. For more generalized CMS offerings, we compete against Wordpress VIP and other open source platforms. Open source platforms utilize a developer community in which product innovation and advancements are crowdsourced rather than developed in-house as we do. Having the development of our platform in-house gives us full control of development and we are able to provide products and services that are more closely tailored to the needs of our customers. For video solutions, we compete against industry participants including Brightcove (NASDAQ: BCOV), Neulion (TSE: NLN), MLB Advanced Media and Google’s newly acquired video solutions company Anvato (NASDAQ: GOOG). These video solution companies are larger publicly listed companies with significantly larger research and development budgets. Each of these entities is larger than we are, and serves customers in many areas outside of the broadcast television market. On mobile app frameworks, we compete with Verve, Accedo and Newscycle’s recently acquired DoApps, all of which offer their products and services to the broader market, including television broadcasters. On advertising solutions, we compete against a variety of advertising programming and agency businesses that provide their services to the broader market, including the television broadcasters. The providers of mobile apps and advertising services have the advantage of being focused on singular product lines, however, we offer the advantage of convenience by offering these products and services as integrated components of our product and service offering. In addition, some larger broadcasters have opted to build in-house solutions across one or more of these areas. While such solutions may be specifically tailored to the particular requirements of that broadcaster, we believe our integrated platform provides advantages in cost of operation and access to our development and technology resources.
 
We believe we are different from our competitors in that we are able to offer a very comprehensive platform that integrates web, mobile apps, OTT apps, video management, advertising and data services, all in one. Therefore, given the growing fragmentation and complexity of multi-platform digital operations, we are well positioned as a one-stop solution for broadcasters and media companies to scale their digital businesses with a fully integrated workflow that enables them to focus on their core business of content creation instead of having to spend time and resources on technology management. Our integrated offering enables us to build our involvement with our customers and reduce the potential of our customers to move to one of our competitors over time as the cost of switching providers for our services will increase with each new offering to our overall platform.
 
Seasonality
 
Our business is generally not impacted by seasonality, with the exception of our advertising revenue. Revenues from our advertising products and services experience some seasonality as they are dependent on website traffic and market price for advertising inventory both of which are usually low at the beginning of the year and high at the end of the year and during the fall and winter holiday seasons.
Intellectual Property 
 
Our success depends in part upon our ability to use and protect our core technology and intellectual property. Our principal technology is the software we use to operate our SaaS content management system. The code for this software is maintained in object code format on secure servers under our control and is not exposed to users or otherwise made available for use in third-party environments. For protection, we also rely on U.S. federal, state, international and intellectual property law rights, as well as contractual restrictions. We control access to our services, proprietary technology and intellectual property through license and other business agreements, confidentiality procedures, non-disclosure agreements with third parties and by entering into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with employees and independent contractor agreements and professional services agreements with consultants, independent contractors and professional services providers. Where appropriate, we pursue the registration of designs, copyright, domain names, trademarks and service marks in the U.S. and in other jurisdictions.
 
In addition, our success is dependent on other identifiable intangible properties, such as the Frankly brand name and reputation. Our business model is contingent on maintaining and expanding our customers and advertisers. Accordingly, protecting and enhancing the goodwill in the Frankly reputation and brand is crucial to our success.
 
We have an issued U.S. patent that protects a specific aspect of frame accurate web editing for our video solution which expires on January 18, 2032. This patent is not material to our present or expected future business.
 
In connection with the $14.5 million credit facility (the “Credit Facility”) we entered into pursuant to a credit agreement dated August 31, 2016, as amended on December 20, 2016, March 30, 2017, May 25, 2017, October 25, 2017 and December 27, 2017 (the “Credit Agreement”) with Raycom, Frankly Media has entered into an Intellectual Property Pledge Agreement pursuant to which it has granted a security interest in all of its intellectual property to Raycom and Frankly Media has deposited its intellectual property in escrow accounts for the benefit of Raycom.

Government Regulation
 
As a host of online websites and a distributor of online advertising, we are subject to various federal and state regulations that apply to online activities. Principally, we are subject to FTC regulations regarding online privacy and truth in advertising; we are subject to the CAN-SPAM Act, which addresses the sending of commercial email messages and the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), which address communications with and collection of information from internet users who are under 13 years old. In some instances, FCC regulations governing closed captioning apply to video content displayed online by our customers. We do not interact with banking or other sensitive personal information of online users, we limit our collection and use of personally identifiable information, and we employ online privacy policies and terms of service. To date, compliance with applicable regulation has not materially affected our business.
Employees
 
As of December 31, 2017, we had 77 employees excluding full-time consultants and contractors. None of the Company’s employees are represented by a labor union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement. The Company has not experienced any work stoppages and considers its relations with its employees to be good.
Property 
 
Our registered office in British Columbia is located at 2900-550 Burrard Street, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada V6C 0A3. Our corporate headquarters is located at 27-01 Queens Plaza North, Suite 502, Long Island City, New York 11101. The Company does not own real property and leases the real property it occupies, which is sufficient to meet the Company’s current needs.
Legal Proceedings 
 
On July 21, 2017, a complaint was filed by Gannaway Entertainment, Inc. (“GEI”), Albert C. Gannaway III, and Samantha Gannaway, and was served on August 4, 2017, captioned Gannaway Entertainment, Inc., Albert C. Gannaway III, Samantha Gannaway V.S. Frankly Inc., Steve Chung, SKP America, LLC, JJR Private Capital Limited Partnership, Ron Schmeichel, Louis Schwartz in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California against Frankly, our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Operating Officer and others alleging violations of U.S. securities laws, fraud and breach of fiduciary duties, and seeking in excess of $15 million in damages, arising out of our acquisition of Gannaway Web Holdings, LLC from GEI and other parties in 2015. On March 12, 2018, the plaintiffs in the GEI complaint voluntarily terminated their case. On March 15, 2018, the plaintiffs in the GEI complaint re-filed their complaint in state court. We are reviewing the complaint with our counsel and believe that the claims are without merit. We intend to defend the claims vigorously.
 
We and our affiliates may be involved, from time to time, in legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business.
 
Enforcement of Civil Liabilities
 
We are a British Columbia corporation with a registered and records office in British Columbia, Canada. Certain claims may be brought against us in British Columbia. However, it may be difficult for an investor to bring an original action against us or our officers and directors in British Columbia predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the U.S. federal securities laws. Further, it may be difficult for an investor to bring an action against us or our officers and directors in the U.S. to enforce a judgment obtained in British Columbia. Additionally, it may be difficult for an investor to bring an action in British Columbia to enforce a judgment obtained in a U.S. court against us or our officers or directors.
 
Our U.S. subsidiaries are organized under the laws of the state of Delaware. Substantially all of our assets and all of the assets of our U.S. subsidiaries are located in the U.S. Furthermore, most of our and our U.S. subsidiaries’ current officers and directors reside in the U.S.
 
While British Columbia law provides for reciprocal enforcement of judgments from certain enumerated U.S. states, there is uncertainty as to whether British Columbia courts would: (i) enforce judgments of United States courts obtained against us, our U.S. subsidiaries or our, or our U.S. subsidiaries’, directors and officers predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the United States federal securities laws, or (ii) assume jurisdiction of original actions brought in British Columbia against us, our U.S. subsidiaries, or our, or our U.S. subsidiaries’, directors and officers predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the U.S. federal securities laws, as such judgments and laws may, amongst other things, conflict with Canadian laws.
