AMITIZA (lubiprostone)
 
AMITIZA is a ClC-2 chloride channel activator developed for the treatment of constipation. AMITIZA acts with a dual mechanism of action, increasing intestinal fluid secretion while also stimulating recovery of mucosal barrier function. AMITIZA has been approved for three indications that cover distinct patient types: chronic idiopathic constipation (CIC), irritable bowel syndrome with constipation (IBS-C), and opioid-induced constipation (OIC). Since 2006, AMITIZA has been dispensed over 10 million times.
 
Chronic Idiopathic Constipation (CIC)
 
Constipation is characterized by infrequent and difficult passage of stool and becomes chronic when a patient suffers specified symptoms for over 12 non-consecutive weeks within a 12-month period. Chronic constipation (CC) is idiopathic if it is not caused by other diseases or by use of medications. Symptoms of CIC include straining, hard stools, bloating and abdominal pain or discomfort. Some patients suffering from occasional constipation may be treated with lifestyle modification, dietary changes and increased fluid and fiber intake, although there is very limited well-controlled clinical trial data in support of these alternatives in CIC or IBS-C patients. For patients who fail to respond to these approaches, physicians may recommend laxatives, most of which are available over-the-counter (OTC), i.e., without a prescription, for acute use. These agents are generally not approved for long-term use by CIC or IBS-C patients nor is such use supported by long-term, well-controlled clinical trial data.
 
A study published in The American Journal of Gastroenterology in September 2011 estimates that approximately 14% of adults over 15 years of age, or over 30 million people, in the U.S., suffer from CIC. By the time most CIC patients seek care from a physician they have typically tried dietary and lifestyle changes, as well as a number of available OTC remedies, and remain unsatisfied. Commonly used OTC medications include laxatives, stool softeners and fiber supplements.
 
Irritable Bowel Syndrome with Constipation (IBS-C)
 
IBS is a disorder of the intestines with symptoms that include severe cramping, pain, bloating and changes of bowel habits, such as diarrhea or constipation. Patients diagnosed with IBS are commonly classified as having one of four forms: IBS-C, IBS with diarrhea, mixed-pattern IBS alternating between constipation and diarrhea, and unspecified irritable bowel syndrome. Currently, IBS in all its forms is considered to be one of the most common gastrointestinal disorders. Like CIC, some patients suffering from IBS-C may be treated with dietary measures, such as increasing fiber and fluid intake; if these measures prove ineffective, laxatives are frequently used for the management of this condition, though they are not approved for IBS-C.
 
Opioid-Induced Constipation (OIC)
 
OIC is a common adverse effect of chronic opioid use. Binding of opioids to peripheral opioid receptors in the gastrointestinal tract results in reduction of secretion of electrolytes, such as chloride, and subsequent reduction in small intestinal fluid. In addition, activation of enteric opioid receptors results in abnormal gastrointestinal motility. Together, these processes result in OIC, which is characterized by infrequent and incomplete evacuation of stool, hard stool consistency, and straining associated with bowel movements.
 
Current treatment options for OIC include the use of stool softeners, enemas, suppositories and peristaltic stimulants such as senna, which stimulate muscle contractions in the bowel. Additionally, the standard prescription option for OIC is osmotic laxatives. The effectiveness of these products for the treatment of OIC is limited due to the severity of the constipation caused by opioids. In addition, physicians often cannot prescribe peristaltic stimulants for the duration of narcotic treatment because of the potential for dependence upon these stimulants. Opioid drugs are known to suppress firing of secretomotor neurons in the gut which reduces intestinal fluid secretion resulting in drier, harder stools. Lubiprostone works locally in the gut to reestablish fluid secretion thus alleviating OIC. As a result, we believe that AMITIZA holds a competitive advantage over drugs that do not work through this mechanism of action. Additionally, the mechanism of action for AMITIZA is different and unique versus other products that are currently approved for OIC, which are all peripherally acting mu-opioid receptor antagonists (PAMORAs). This also allows AMITIZA to offer a unique option for treating this specific type of constipation.
 
There are more than 200 million prescriptions for opioid use in the U.S. annually, and a substantial number of these prescriptions are for non-cancer chronic pain. Market research indicates that there are approximately 2.5-4.5 million moderate to severe sufferers of OIC, and 40-80% of patients taking opioids chronically for non-cancer pain report constipation in the U.S.
 
United States and Canada
 
AMITIZA is marketed in the United States for the three gastrointestinal indications described above under a collaboration and license agreement, or the North America Takeda Agreement, with Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited, or Takeda. Under the North America Takeda Agreement, we are primarily responsible for clinical development activities, while Takeda is responsible for commercialization of AMITIZA in the United States and Canada. Takeda is required to provide a minimum annual commercial investment during the current term of the North America Takeda Agreement and may reduce the minimum annual commercial investment when a generic equivalent enters the market. In October 2015, Health Canada approved AMITIZA for CIC in adults. In October 2014, we signed an amendment, or the Takeda Amendment, to the North America Takeda Agreement, which among other things, extended the term of the North America Takeda Agreement beyond December 2020. During the extended term beginning in January 2021, we will share with Takeda the annual net sales revenue on branded AMITIZA products. More information on our collaboration with Takeda in North America is found under the heading “North America Takeda Agreement.”

We have also partnered with Par Pharmaceuticals, Inc., or Par, and Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories, Ltd., or Dr. Reddy’s, in connection with the settlement of patent litigation in the United States related to our AMITIZA 8 mcg and 24 mcg soft gelatin capsule products. Under our agreement with Par, we granted Par a non-exclusive license to market Par’s generic version of lubiprostone 8 mcg and 24 mcg soft gelatin capsules in the United States for the indications approved for AMITIZA beginning January 1, 2021, or earlier under certain circumstances. Beginning on January 1, 2021, Par will split with us the gross profits of the licensed products sold during the term of the agreement, which continues until each of our related patents has expired. Under our agreement with Dr. Reddy’s, we granted Dr. Reddy’s a non-exclusive license to market Dr. Reddy’s generic version of lubiprostone 8 mcg and 24 mcg soft gelatin capsules in the United States for the indications approved for AMITIZA. This license does not begin until more than six years from November 9, 2016, or earlier under certain circumstances. Dr. Reddy’s will pay to us a share of net profits of generic lubiprostone products sold during the term of the agreement, which decreases over time and ends when all of our related patents have expired. In the event that either Par or Dr. Reddy’s elect to launch an authorized generic form of lubiprostone, we have agreed to supply such product under the terms of a manufacturing and supply agreement at a negotiated price.
 
Japan 
 
In Japan, AMITIZA is the only prescription medicine for chronic constipation, excluding constipation caused by organic diseases, and is marketed under a license, commercialization and supply agreement, or the Japan Mylan Agreement, originally entered into with Abbott Laboratories, Inc., or Abbott. In February 2015, Mylan purchased Abbott’s non-U.S. developed markets specialty and branded generics business, as a result of which Mylan acquired the rights to commercialize AMITIZA in Japan. We did not experience any significant changes in the commercialization of AMITIZA in Japan as a result of the transfer of the Japan Mylan Agreement from Abbott to Mylan. According to epidemiology data from Japan’s Ministry of Health. Labour and Welfare (MHLW), millions of people in Japan may live daily with the pain and discomfort of CC, yet not seek physician care. Medical attention could mean early diagnosis and effective, long-term treatment. It is estimated that approximately 14.3% of the Japanese population, or over 18 million people, suffer from CC.
People’s Republic of China 
 
In May 2015, we entered into an exclusive license, development, commercialization and supply agreement, or the China Gloria Agreement, with Harbin Gloria Pharmaceuticals Co., Ltd., or Gloria, for AMITIZA in the People’s Republic of China. We will be the exclusive supplier of AMITIZA to Gloria at an agreed upon supply price. Under the China Gloria Agreement, Gloria is responsible for all development activities and costs, as well as commercialization and regulatory activities, for AMITIZA in the People’s Republic of China. Upon entering into the China Gloria Agreement, we received an upfront payment of $1.0 million. In June 2015, the China Food and Drug Administration accepted an Investigational New Drug, or IND, application for a pivotal trial of AMITIZA in patients with CIC, as a result of which we received an additional payment of $500,000 from Gloria. In addition to the $1.5 million in payments received and recognized as revenue through June 2015, we are eligible to receive an additional payment in the amount of $1.5 million upon the occurrence of a specified regulatory or commercial milestone event.
Other Global Markets 
 
In October 2014, we entered into an exclusive license, development, commercialization and supply agreement, or the Global Takeda Agreement, for lubiprostone with Takeda. Under the Global Takeda Agreement, Takeda develops and markets AMITIZA globally except in the United States, Canada, Japan and the People’s Republic of China. We supply Takeda with the clinical and commercial product at a negotiated price. Takeda currently markets AMITIZA for CIC and OIC in Switzerland and currently markets AMITIZA for CIC in the United Kingdom. Takeda became the marketing authorization holder in Switzerland in April 2015, in the United Kingdom, Austria, Belgium, Germany, Netherlands, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg and Spain during 2016. More information on our collaboration with Takeda in global markets is found under the heading “Global Takeda Agreement.”
 
Before the execution of the Global Takeda Agreement, we retained full rights to develop and commercialize AMITIZA for the rest of the world’s markets outside of the United States, Canada and Japan. In the United Kingdom, we received approval in September 2012 from the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency for the use of AMITIZA to treat CIC. We made AMITIZA available in the United Kingdom in the fourth quarter of 2013. In July 2014, National Institute of Health and Care Excellence published the technology appraisal guidance recommending the use of AMITIZA in the treatment of CIC and associated symptoms in adults who have failed laxatives. In January 2015, we successfully completed the European mutual recognition procedure for AMITIZA for the treatment of CIC in select European countries, resulting in marketing authorizations in these countries.

In Switzerland, AMITIZA was approved to treat CIC in 2009. In 2012, we reached an agreement with the Bundesamt fur Gesundheit (BAG), the Federal Office of Public Health in Switzerland, on a reimbursement price for AMITIZA in Switzerland, and began active marketing in the first quarter of 2013. In February 2014, the BAG revised several reimbursement limitations with which AMITIZA was first approved for reimbursement and inclusion in the Spezialitätenliste (SL) to allow all Swiss physicians to prescribe AMITIZA to patients who have failed previous treatments with at least two laxatives over a nine-month period. In July 2014, AMITIZA was approved for the treatment of OIC in chronic, non-cancer adult patients by the Swissmedic, the Swiss Agency for Therapeutic Products, and in October 2015, the BAG added this indication to the SL.
 
In October 2015, Takeda obtained approval of the clinical trial application, or CTA, for AMITIZA for the treatment of CIC and IBS-C in Russia that was submitted in June 2015. In December 2015, a CTA was filed for AMITIZA for the treatment of CIC, IBS-C and OIC in Mexico and South Korea. Takeda initiated phase 3 registration trials in Russia in March 2016 and in South Korea and Mexico in May 2016. Takeda submitted a new drug application, or NDA, for the treatment of CIC, IBS-C, and OIC in Israel in June 2015, which was approved in July 2016, and an NDA for the same indications in Kazakhstan in December 2015. Additional NDA submissions have been made by Takeda in Singapore in May 2016, and South Africa and Indonesia in June 2016.
 
A study published in The American Journal of Gastroenterology in September 2011 estimates that approximately 16% of adults over 15 years of age, or over 42 million people, in Northern Europe suffer from CIC.
 
In a study conducted in ten European countries, including Switzerland, the results of which were published in Alimentary Pharmacology and Therapeutics in 2012, approximately 28% of the participants suffering from constipation for at least 6 months were dissatisfied with their current treatment options using laxatives. Of that group, approximately 83% were interested in seeking alternative methods to relieve their constipation.
 

RESCULA (unoprostone isopropyl)
 
RESCULA is a Big Potassium (BK) channel activator used to lower intraocular pressure (IOP). In October 2015, we acquired R-Tech Ueno, Ltd., or R-Tech, a global biopharmaceutical company focused on the research and development of drugs for inflammatory conditions, oncology and ophthalmology. Pursuant to the acquisition, we acquired global rights to RESCULA. In the United States, we ceased marketing RESCULA in the fourth quarter of 2014 and no product was made available after the March 2015 expiration date. In May 2015, we returned all licenses for unoprostone isopropyl to R-Tech. In June 2016, we completed the withdrawal of the marketing authorization for RESCULA in the United States. RESCULA is being commercialized by Santen Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd in Japan, and Sinphar Pharmaceutical, Co., Ltd and Zuellig Pharma Inc. in Taiwan.
 
Our Clinical Development Programs
 
Lubiprostone

Alternate Formulation
 
We are developing an alternate formulation of lubiprostone for both adult and pediatric patients who are unable to take or do not tolerate capsules and for naso-gastric tube fed patients. It is estimated that approximately 40% of American adults have difficulty swallowing pills. Of those who have experienced difficulty swallowing pills, approximately 14% have delayed taking doses of their medication, 8% have skipped a dose and 4% have discontinued using their medication. In addition, the current formulation of pills is not amenable for administration to young children (6 months and older). Takeda has agreed to fund 100% of the costs, up to a cap, of this alternate formulation work. We initiated the phase 3 program of the alternate formulation of lubiprostone in adults in the second half of 2016 and, if the program is successful, we intend to file an NDA in the United States for the alternate formulation for adults in the second half of 2017.
Pediatric Functional Constipation
 
The phase 3 program required to support an application for marketing authorization of lubiprostone for pediatric functional constipation comprises four clinical trials. The first two trials, one of which was recently completed, test the soft gelatin capsule formulation of lubiprostone in patients 6 to 17 years of age. The first of these trials was a pivotal 12-week, randomized, placebo-controlled trial which was initiated in December 2013 and completed enrollment in April 2016. The second trial is a follow-on, long-term safety extension trial that was initiated in March 2014. In November 2016, we announced that the phase 3 trial of AMITIZA in pediatric functional constipation in children 6 to 17 years of age failed to achieve its primary endpoint of overall spontaneous bowel movement, or SBM, response. The trial achieved statistical significance for some secondary endpoints, notably overall SBM frequency, straining, and stool consistency. In addition, in this study lubiprostone was well tolerated. We have entered into a process with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, and other constituencies, and as a result of initial discussion with the FDA will submit an sNDA in the second half of 2017. Additionally, after further consultations with the FDA to better determine the doses and endpoints that should be studied, the phase 3 program for the alternate formulation of lubiprostone described above will be followed in mid-2018 with a phase 3 program in patients 6 months to 6 years of age using the alternate formulation. Takeda has agreed to fund 70% of the costs, up to a cap, of this pediatric functional constipation program.

Constipation in children has similar characteristics to those of constipation in adults; symptoms include infrequent bowel movements, hard stools, large diameter stools and painful passage of stools. Children may also experience fecal retention due to withholding, since there is a tendency to avoid defecation and withhold bowel movements as a result of the pain experienced from the passage of large stools. This withholding of bowel movements can result in episodes of fecal incontinence. The Rome III diagnostic criteria for childhood functional constipation dictate that such symptoms occur at least once per week for at least 2 months prior to diagnosis. Furthermore, ninety percent of pediatric constipation is functional constipation and it occurs in all age groups. An analysis of longitudinal data in the U.S. showed that over the last decade there has been a nearly 4-fold increase in rates of constipation. Nevertheless, the estimates of the prevalence rate of functional constipation in the pediatric population worldwide have varied greatly, from 4% to 37%. Regardless of this wide range of estimated prevalence, only 50-70% of children with functional constipation achieve long-term improvement with the current treatments, indicating a need for better treatments.
 
VAP-1 Inhibitors
 
In 2016, we discontinued our VAP-1 Inhibitor RTU-1096 development program and our VAP-1 Inhibitor RTU-009 program.
 
CPP- 1X/Sulindac Combination Product
 
In January 2016, we entered into an option and collaboration agreement under which CPP has granted us the sole option to acquire an exclusive license to commercialize CPP-1X/sulindac combination product in North America. This product is currently in a Phase 3 clinical trial being conducted by CPP for the treatment of familial adenomatous polyposis, or FAP. Under our agreement with CPP, we have the exclusive option to license this product for North America. There are currently no approved treatments for FAP. The ongoing Phase 3 study is a 150-patient, three-arm, double-blind, randomized trial of the combination agent and the single agent comparators. Enrollment in the study has completed and the results from a Phase 3 futility analysis are expected to be available mid-2017. The trial is expected to conclude in 2019.

Intellectual Property
 
Our success depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain proprietary protection for the technology and know-how upon which our products are based, to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of others and to prevent others from infringing our proprietary rights.
 
We hold ownership rights to develop and commercialize our products and product candidates covered by patents and patent applications. Our portfolio of patents includes patents or patent applications with claims directed to compositions of matter, including both compounds and pharmaceutical formulations, methods of use, or a combination of these claims, and methods of manufacturing the compounds. Depending upon the timing, duration and specifics of FDA approval of the use of a compound for a specific indication, some of our U.S. patents may be eligible for a limited patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Act. Similar extensions to patent term may be available in other countries for particular patents in Sucampo’s portfolio.
 
As of December 31, 2016, the patent rights relating to lubiprostone include compositions of matter, methods of use and methods of manufacturing, and several of the U.S. patents are listed in the U.S. FDA Orange Book. Patents have been granted in the U.S., Europe, Japanese and other countries relating to pharmaceutical formulations, manufacturing, dosing regimens and therapeutic uses. Many of the U.S. patents in the lubiprostone portfolio expire between 2020 and 2027. Many of the corresponding foreign patents expire between 2020 and 2026. Several other patents have later termination dates.
 
As of December 31, 2016, the patent rights relating to unoprostone isopropyl include compositions of matter, methods of use and methods of manufacturing. However, RESCULA is not covered by patents in Japan, the largest market for the product. Two U.S. patents cover the product, which was discontinued by Sucampo in the U.S. The U.S. patent relating to compositions of matter expires in 2018 and the patent relating to method of use expires in 2021. Corresponding foreign patents also expire in this time frame.
 
We are actively seeking to augment our portfolio of compounds by focusing on the development of new chemical entities, or NCEs, which have not previously received FDA approval. Upon approval by the FDA, NCEs are entitled to market and data exclusivity in the U.S. with respect to generic drug competition for a period of five years from the date of FDA approval, even if the related patents have expired. We are also engaged in patent lifecycle management strategies for our marketed products.

Manufacturing
 
Following the acquisition of R-Tech Ueno in October 2015 we obtained direct control and management of the production and supply chain of commercial quantities of AMITIZA and RESCULA as well as preclinical or clinical supplies of the other compounds that we are testing in our development programs. Our manufacturing network is a combination of owned assets and external suppliers. There are existing supply agreements between R-Tech and our external suppliers to ensure continued supply of our products.
Competition
 
AMITIZA (lubiprostone)
 
In the U.S., an estimated 40-50 million patients who suffer from constipation that is idiopathic in nature or a consequence of other conditions such as IBS or chronic opioid use. Many patients are currently treated for CIC, IBS-C or OIC with a variety of medications. Over-the-counter (OTC) medications are available and are generally intended to provide relief for occasional constipation. Prescription products are also available and are generally intended to provide relief for chronic constipation. As such, the U.S. constipation market is expansive and diverse with a multitude of products intended to treat a large heterogeneous patient population.
 
The prescription chronic constipation market can generally be bifurcated into two categories: 1) generic laxatives and 2) branded products. Generic laxatives make up roughly 80%-90% of the total prescription volume while branded prescriptions have grown to represent 10%-20% of the prescription market. The branded prescription products are briefly described below:
 

· | AMITIZA (lubiprostone): AMITIZA, is approved by the FDA for the treatment of CIC (from an unknown cause; not constipation due to another condition or treatment), IBS-C and CIC. AMITIZA softens the stool by increasing its water content, so the stool can pass easily. AMITIZA is taken twice daily.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Linzess (linaclotide): Linzess is approved for CIC and IBS-C. This drug is a capsule taken once daily and helps relieve constipation by helping bowel movements occur more often. It is not approved for use in those age 17 years and younger. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | Trulance (Plecanatide): Trulance is approved (but not yet launched as of early March, 2017) for CIC. This drug is a capsule that can be taken once daily for use in adults, and is a similar mechanism as Linzess (guanylate cyclase type-C agonist).


· | Lactulose: Lactulose, a prescription laxative for chronic constipation, draws water into the bowel to soften and loosen the stool.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Polyethylene glycol (PEG): PEG is an osmotic laxative for chronic constipation and causes water to remain in the stool, which results in softer stools.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Movantik (naloxegol): Movantik is approved for OIC. This drug works by binding to mu-receptors in the brain and other parts of the central nervous system to block pains signals as well as bind to mu-receptors in the bowel which may cause OIC.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Relistor, oral and injectable (methylnaltrexone bromide): Relistor is approved for OIC. Similar to Movantik, this product works by decreasing the constipating effects of opioids by inhibiting opioids from binding to mu-receptors in GI tract.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
At this time AMITIZA is the only branded product that has a unique mechanism of action. AMITIZA is also the only branded product on the market today to be indicated in three separate indications for CIC, IBS-C and OIC.

Additionally, there are several 5-HT Receptor agonists in various stages of development as well (Resolor/Shire Phase III in CIC, YKP-10811/SK Biopharma in CIC Phase II)
 
RESCULA (unoprostone isopropyl)
 
RESCULA (unoprostone isopropyl) is approved for Ocular Hypertension and Open-Angle Glaucoma and is currently marketed in several global regions including Japan and Taiwan. RESCULA was originally launched in Japan in 1994 and is no longer covered by patent or regulatory exclusivity in Japan. RESCULA is no longer commercialized in the U.S.
 
According to recent market data in Japan, the glaucoma treatment market grew 0.9% to ¥105.7 billion. Treatments for glaucoma represent the largest segment of Japan’s prescription ophthalmic pharmaceutical market, accounting for approximately 33% of the total. Increased intraocular pressure is a significant risk factor resulting in damage to the optic nerve. This can lead to visual field loss and in some cases, blindness. Glaucoma is the most common cause of blindness in people with ophthalmic disease in Japan. The glaucoma market is expected to expand in the future, mainly due to the increase in patient numbers owing to population aging.
 
RESCULA faces many competitors which promote products for primary-angle glaucoma (PAOG), and ocular hypertension. There are several products in the regions where RESCULA is marketed that have become generic and have therefore had an impact on the usage of prostaglandins as first line therapy. Other competitive products include latanaprost and travoprost, ophthalmic solutions and suspensions and generic beta blockers. Prostaglandin analogues continue to have strong first line market share followed by generic beta blockers. Our competitors are also developing additional pipeline products for PAOG and ocular hypertension.
 
Product Candidates
 
We face similar competition from approved therapies and potential pipeline products for the diseases and conditions potentially addressed by our product candidates, and are likely to face competition for any other product candidates we may elect to develop in the future.
Government Regulation
 
Government authorities in the U.S., at the federal, state and local level, and in other countries extensively regulate the research, development, testing, approval, manufacturing, labeling, post-approval monitoring and reporting, packaging, promotion, storage, advertising, distribution, marketing and export and import of pharmaceutical products such as those we are developing. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources.

United States Government Regulation
 
In the U.S., the FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, as amended, and implements regulations. The FDA has jurisdiction over all of our products and administers requirements covering the safety, effectiveness, manufacturing, quality control, distribution, labeling, marketing, advertising, dissemination of information, post-marketing study, and pharmacovigilance of our pharmaceutical products. Information that must be submitted to the FDA in order to obtain approval to market a drug varies depending upon whether the drug is a new product whose safety and efficacy have not previously been demonstrated in humans or a drug whose active ingredients and certain other properties are the same as those of a previously approved drug. The results of product development, preclinical studies and clinical trials must be submitted to the FDA as part of the approval process. The FDA may deny approval if the applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied, or it may require additional clinical data or analyses or even an additional clinical trial. Even if such data are submitted, the FDA may ultimately decide that the application does not satisfy the criteria for approval.
 
Obtaining FDA approval for new products and manufacturing processes can take a number of years and involve the expenditure of substantial resources. To obtain FDA approval for the commercial sale of a therapeutic agent, the potential product must undergo testing programs on animals, the data from which is used to file an investigational NDA with the FDA. In addition, there are three phases of human testing following Good Clinical Practices (GCP) guidelines:
 

Phase 1 consists of safety tests with human clinical evaluations, generally in normal, healthy volunteers;
Phase 2 programs expand safety tests and measure efficacy along with dose finding evaluations and are
conducted in volunteers with a particular disease condition that the drug is designed to treat; and
Phase 3 programs are greatly expanded clinical trials to determine the effectiveness of the drug at a
particular dosage level in the affected patient population.

 The data from these clinical tests are combined with data regarding chemistry, manufacturing and animal pharmacology and toxicology, and are then submitted to the FDA in the form of an NDA. The preparation of an NDA requires the expenditure of substantial funds and the commitment of substantial resources.
 
Failure to comply with the applicable FDA requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or following approval may result in administrative or judicial sanctions. These sanctions could include the FDA’s imposition of a hold on clinical trials, refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, civil penalties or criminal prosecution. Any agency or judicial enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on our business.
 
The FDA extensively regulates all aspects of manufacturing quality under its current good manufacturing practice (cGMP) regulations. The FDA inspects the facility or the facilities at which drug products are manufactured. The FDA will not approve the product unless cGMP compliance is satisfactory. If the FDA determines the application, manufacturing process or manufacturing facilities are not acceptable, it will outline the deficiencies in the application and often will request corrective actions including additional validation or information.
 
The pharmaceutical testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort and financial resources. Data obtained from clinical activities are not always conclusive and may be susceptible to varying interpretations, which could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval. The FDA may not grant approval on a timely basis, or at all. We may encounter difficulties or unanticipated costs in our efforts to secure necessary governmental approvals, which could delay or preclude us from marketing our products. The FDA may limit the indications for use or place other conditions on any approvals that could restrict the commercial application of the products. After approval, some types of changes to the approved product, such as manufacturing changes and additional labeling claims, are subject to further FDA review and approval.
 
Post-Approval Requirement
 
After regulatory approval of a product is obtained, we are obligated to comply with a number of post-approval requirements. For example, the FDA may require post marketing, or phase 4 clinical trials to assess additional elements of the product’s safety or efficacy. In addition, holders of an approved NDA are required to report certain adverse drug reactions and production problems to the FDA, to provide updated safety information and to comply with requirements concerning advertising and promotional labeling for their products. The FDA periodically inspects manufacturing facilities to assess compliance with cGMP, which imposes certain fiscal, procedural, substantive and record-keeping requirements.
 

13
--

 

We rely substantially on third parties for the performance of certain activities related to the production, packaging and distribution of our drug products for clinical and commercial use. Future FDA inspections may identify compliance issues at our facilities or at the facilities of our manufacturers that may disrupt production or distribution, or require substantial resources to correct. In addition, discovery of problems with a product or the failure to comply with applicable requirements may result in restrictions on a product, manufacturer or holder of an approved NDA, including withdrawal or recall of the product from the market or other voluntary, FDA-initiated or judicial action that could delay or prohibit further marketing. Newly discovered or developed safety or effectiveness data may require changes to a product’s approved labeling, including the addition of new warnings, precautions and contraindications. Also, new government requirements, including those resulting from new legislation, may be established that could delay or prevent regulatory approval of our products under development.
 
Regulation Outside of the United States
 
In addition to regulations in the U.S., we are subject to a variety of regulations in other jurisdictions most notably by the Health Canada in Canada, European Medicines Agency (EMA) in the E.U., Swissmedic in Switzerland and the MHLW in Japan. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we must obtain approval by the comparable regulatory authorities of countries outside the U.S. before we can commence clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries. The requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary greatly from country to country, and the time for approval is country dependent and may be longer or shorter than that required by the FDA.
Canada
 
In Canada, the new drug approval process is similar to that in the U.S. The process is divided into four phases: preclinical studies, clinical trials, new drug submission and marketing. Health Canada regulates the clinical trials and grants market authorization based on an assessment of the safety, efficacy and quality of drug products. In addition to approval of new drugs, the federal government also regulates drug pricing through the Patented Medicines Prices Review Board (PMPRB).
Europe
 
In Europe, medicinal products are governed by a framework of E.U. directives which apply across all E.U. member states. To obtain regulatory approval of a drug under the E.U. regulatory system, we may submit an MAA, either under a centralized, decentralized, or mutual recognition procedure (MRP). The centralized procedure, which is compulsory for medicines produced by certain biotechnological processes and optional for those which are innovative, provides for the grant of a single marketing authorization that is valid for all E.U. member states. The decentralized procedure provides for a member state, known as the reference member state, to assess an application, with one or more concerned, member states subsequently approving that assessment. The MRP provides approval in one country and then allows for a request from subsequent countries to mutually recognize the original country’s approval. The E.U. also governs among other areas, the authorization and conduct of clinical trials, the marketing authorization process for medical products, manufacturing and import activities, and post-authorization activities including pharmacovigilance. The E.U. has established regulations on pediatric medicines which impose certain obligations on pharmaceutical companies with respect to the investigation of their products in children.
Japan
 
In Japan, pre-marketing approval and clinical studies are required for all pharmaceutical products. The regulatory requirements for pharmaceuticals in Japan have in the past been so lengthy and costly that it has been cost-prohibitive for many pharmaceutical companies. Historically, Japan has required that pivotal clinical data submitted in support of a NDA be performed on Japanese patients. Recently, however, as a part of the global drug harmonization process, Japan has signaled a willingness to accept U.S. or E.U. patient data when submitted along with a bridging study, which demonstrates that Japanese and non-Japanese subjects react comparably to the product. This approach, which is executed on a case-by-case basis, may reduce the time required for approval and introduction of new products into the Japanese market. To obtain manufacturing/marketing approval, we must submit an application for approval to the MHLW with results of nonclinical and clinical studies to show the quality, efficacy and safety of a new drug. A data compliance review, GCP on-site inspection, cGMP audit and detailed data review are undertaken by the PMDA. The application is then discussed by the committees of the Pharmaceutical Affairs and Food Sanitation Council (PAFSC). Based on the results of these reviews, the final decision on approval is made by MHLW. After the approval, negotiations regarding the reimbursement price with MHLW will begin. The price will be determined within 60 to 90 days unless the applicant disagrees, which may result in extended pricing negotiations.

Regulation of the Health Care Industry
 
In addition to the regulatory approval requirements described above, we are or will be directly or indirectly through our customers, subject to extensive regulation of the health care industry by the federal and state government and foreign countries in which we may conduct our business. The laws that directly or indirectly affect our ability to operate our business include the following:

The federal Medicare and Medicaid Anti-Kickback laws, which prohibit persons from knowingly and willfully
soliciting, offering, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce either the referral
of an individual, or furnishing or arranging for a good or service, for which payment may be made under federal healthcare programs
such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs;
Other Medicare laws, regulations, rules, manual provisions and policies that prescribe the requirements
for coverage and payment for services performed by our customers, including the amount of such payment;
The federal False Claims Act which imposes civil and criminal liability on individuals and entities who
submit, or cause to be submitted, false or fraudulent claims for payment to the government;
The False Claims Act which prohibits knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a
material fact or making any materially false statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items
or services;
The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), which prohibits certain payments made to foreign government
officials;
State and foreign law equivalents of the foregoing and state laws regarding pharmaceutical company marketing
compliance, reporting and disclosure obligations; and
The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA), which among
other things changes access to healthcare products and services; creates new fees for the pharmaceutical and medical device industries;
changes rebates and prices for health care products and services; and requires additional reporting and disclosure.

 If our operations are found to be in violation of any of these laws, regulations, rules or policies or any other law or governmental regulation, or if interpretations of the foregoing change, we may be subject to civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, exclusion from the Medicare and Medicaid programs and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations.
 
Pharmaceutical Pricing and Reimbursement
 
In the U.S. and other countries, sales of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale will depend in part on the availability of reimbursement from third-party payers. Third-party payers include government health administrative authorities, managed care providers, pharmacy benefit managers, private health insurers and other organizations. These third-party payers are increasingly challenging the price and examining the cost-effectiveness of medical products and services. In addition, significant uncertainty exists as to the reimbursement status of newly approved healthcare product candidates. We may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the cost-effectiveness of our products. Our products may not be considered cost-effective. Adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development.
United States
 
Federal, state and local governments in the U.S. continue to work towards significant legislation aimed to limit the growth of healthcare costs, including the cost of prescription drugs. Following the U.S. Supreme Court decision in June 2012 upholding the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act there has been an increase in the pace of regulatory issuances by those U.S. government agencies designated to carry out the extensive requirements of the ACA. These regulatory actions are expected to have both positive and negative impacts on the U.S. healthcare industry, although uncertainty remains regarding the ACA’s ultimate effects. This legislation has both current and long term impacts on us. The provisions of the U.S. Healthcare Reform Act are effective on various dates over the next several years.
 
Medicaid is a joint federal and state program that is administered by the states for low income and disabled beneficiaries. Under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, we are required to pay a rebate for each unit of product reimbursed by the state Medicaid programs. The amount of the rebate for each product is set by law as the greater of 23.1% of the average manufacturer price (AMP) or the difference between AMP and the best price available from us to any customer (with limited exceptions). The rebate amount must be adjusted upward if AMP increases more than inflation (measured by the Consumer Price Index - Urban). The adjustment can cause the rebate amount to exceed the minimum 23.1% rebate amount. The rebate amount is calculated each quarter based on our report of current AMP and best price for each of our products to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services. The requirements for calculating AMP and best price are complex. We are required to report any revisions to AMP or best price previously reported within a certain period, which revisions could affect our rebate liability for prior quarters. In addition, if we fail to provide information timely or we are found to have knowingly submitted false information to the government, the statute governing the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program provides for civil monetary penalties.

Medicare is a federal program that is administered by the federal government that covers individuals age 65 and over as well as those with certain disabilities. Medicare Part D provides coverage to enrolled Medicare patients for self-administered drugs (i.e., drugs that do not need to be injected or otherwise administered by a physician). Medicare Part D is administered by private prescription drug plans approved by the U.S. government and each drug plan establishes its own Medicare Part D formulary for prescription drug coverage and pricing, which the drug plan may modify from time-to-time. The prescription drug plans negotiate pricing with manufacturers and may condition formulary placement on the availability of manufacturer discounts. Manufacturers, including us, are required to provide a 50% discount on brand name prescription drugs utilized by Medicare Part D beneficiaries when those beneficiaries reach the coverage gap in their drug benefits.
 
Our products are subject to discounted pricing when purchased by federal agencies via the Federal Supply Schedule (FSS). FSS participation is required for our products to be covered and reimbursed by the Veterans Administration (VA) Department of Defense, (DoD), Coast Guard, and Public Health Service (PHS). Coverage under Medicaid, the Medicare Part B program and the PHS pharmaceutical pricing program is also conditioned upon FSS participation. FSS pricing is negotiated periodically with the Department of Veterans Affairs. FSS pricing is intended not to exceed the price that we charge our most-favored non-federal customer for a product. In addition, prices for drugs purchased by the VA, DoD (including drugs purchased by military personnel and dependents through the TriCare retail pharmacy program), Coast Guard, and PHS are subject to a cap on pricing equal to 76.0% of the non-federal average manufacturer price, or non-FAMP. An additional discount applies if non-FAMP increases more than inflation (measured by the Consumer Price Index - Urban). In addition, if we fail to provide information timely or we are found to have knowingly submitted false information to the government, the governing statute provides for civil monetary penalties in addition to other penalties available to the government.
 
To maintain coverage of our products under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, we are required to extend discounts to certain purchasers under the PHS pharmaceutical pricing program. Purchasers eligible for discounts include hospitals that serve a disproportionate share of financially needy patients, community health clinics and other entities that receive health services grants from the PHS.
 
Canada
 
The purpose of the PMPRB is to ensure that prices of patented and non-patented medicines are not excessive. Accordingly, the PMPRB monitors and reports prices of non-patented drugs and publishes annual reports on the prices using international median prices as a benchmark. The PMPRB does not set drug prices, analyze relative cost effectiveness or value of new drugs or take an active role in formulary listing and reimbursement pricing as these responsibilities are assumed either by the provinces and territories. In order to determine whether the price for a given drug is “excessive”, new drugs are labelled in one of three categories: Category 1 refers to line extensions of existing medicines. The price of a Category 1 drug is presumed excessive if it does not bear a reasonable relationship to the price of other medicines of the same strength sold by the patentee; Category 2 refers to breakthrough or substantial improvements over existing drugs. The price of a Category 2 drug is presumed excessive if it exceeds the prices of all the medicines in the same therapeutic class or the median of the prices in seven countries (France, Germany, Italy, Sweden, Switzerland, the U.K. and the U.S.). Category 3 refers to new chemical entities offering moderate, little or no therapeutic improvement. The price of a Category 3 drug is presumed excessive if it exceeds the prices of all the medicines in the same therapeutic class. The PMPRB also monitors the price of existing drugs, which is considered excessive if it exceeds the increase in the general Canadian Consumer Price Index. When manufacturers set the price of a patented medicine too high, the PMPRB first attempts to have the manufacturer reduce the price voluntarily. Barring this, it can hold a public hearing into the price following which it can order the manufacturer to reduce the price, withdraw the manufacturer’s market authorization, or impose a fine equal to or double the amount of the excessive increase in price.
Europe
 
Different pricing and reimbursement schemes exist in other countries. In Europe, governments influence the price of pharmaceutical products through their pricing and reimbursement rules and control of national health care systems that fund a large part of the cost of such products to consumers. The approach taken varies from state to state. Some jurisdictions permit products to be marketed only after a reimbursement price has been agreed. Other states allow companies to fix their own prices for medicines, but monitor company profits. In some cases, pharmacoeconomic analyses from clinical studies and other available resources are used to establish pricing using risk-benefit comparisons with currently available products.
 
In the U.K., pharmaceutical companies set their own price, and then national bodies (e.g., NICE and Scottish Medicines Consortium), sub-national bodies (e.g., Greater Manchester Medicines Management Group and London Procurement Partnership), or local bodies (e.g., Clinical Commissioning Groups and Health Boards) will determine if a medicine is cost-effective. The national and sub-national bodies advise local bodies, which are greatly influenced by a NICE endorsement; however, ultimately the decision to pay for a medicine is made at a local level in the U.K.
 
In Switzerland, the Swiss health care system is a compulsory private system where patients pay a monthly variable fee to a registered health insurance fund. All insurers reimburse against a common national formulary, the SL. The BAG makes the decisions on reimbursement and pricing of all prescription drugs in the market with their review taking three to four months. For new drugs, it is not uncommon for there to be several rounds of review. It also conducts regular price reviews of the drugs on the formulary. The Federal Commission on drugs or Arzneimittelkommission (EAK) is a body assisting the BAG with expert advice. Once a product is approved the BAG, in consultation with EAK, decides whether or not the drug will appear on the SL. After EAK’s evaluation of a drug, BAG and EAK decide on the maximum price in the market. The criteria used are:
 

Internal comparison with reimbursed and non-reimbursed therapeutic equivalents,
External cross country comparison (reference countries: Denmark, Germany, the U.K. and the Netherlands),
and
Cost benefit analysis

Japan
 
In Japan, pricing is established utilizing various information including reference prices from other international markets. However, the MHLW biannually reviews the pharmaceutical prices of individual products. In the past, these reviews have resulted in price reductions. We expect similar price reviews in the future, in line with the government’s previously announced plan for controlling health care costs. It is not possible to predict the outcome of these reviews, and it is possible that Japanese authorities will again reduce drug reimbursement rates, which could adversely affect the reimbursement levels for our products or product candidates.
Regulation Pertaining to Sales and Marketing
 
We are subject to various federal and state laws pertaining to health care “fraud and abuse,” including anti-kickback laws and false claims laws. Anti-kickback laws generally prohibit a prescription drug manufacturer from soliciting, offering, receiving, or paying any remuneration to generate business, including the purchase or prescription of a particular drug. Although the specific provisions of these laws vary, their scope is generally broad and there may be no regulations, guidance or court decisions that clarify how the laws apply to particular industry practices. There is therefore a possibility that our practices might be challenged under the anti-kickback or similar laws. False claims laws prohibit anyone from knowingly and willingly presenting, or causing to be presented for payment to third party payers (including Medicare and Medicaid), claims for reimbursed drugs or services that are false or fraudulent, claims for items or services not provided as claimed, or claims for medically unnecessary items or services. Our activities relating to the sale and marketing of our products may be subject to scrutiny under these laws. Violations of fraud and abuse laws may be punishable by criminal or civil sanctions, including fines and civil monetary penalties, and exclusion from federal health care programs (including Medicare and Medicaid). Federal and state authorities are paying increased attention to enforcement of these laws within the pharmaceutical industry and private individuals have been active in alleging violations of the laws and bringing suits on behalf of the government under the federal False Claims Act. If we were subject to allegations concerning, or were convicted of violating, these laws, our business could be harmed.
 
Laws and regulations have been enacted by the federal government and various states to regulate the sales and marketing practices of pharmaceutical manufacturers. The laws and regulations generally limit financial interactions between manufacturers and health care providers or require disclosure to the government and public of such interactions. The laws include federal “sunshine” provisions enacted in 2010 as part of the comprehensive federal health care reform legislation. The sunshine provisions apply to pharmaceutical manufacturers with products reimbursed under certain government programs and require those manufacturers to disclose annually to the federal government (for re-disclosure to the public) certain payments made to physicians and certain other healthcare practitioners or to teaching hospitals. State laws may also require disclosure of pharmaceutical pricing information and marketing expenditures. Many of these laws and regulations contain ambiguous requirements. Given the lack of clarity in laws and their implementation, our reporting actions could be subject to the penalty provisions of the pertinent federal and state laws and regulations. Outside the U.S., other countries have implemented requirements for disclosure of financial interactions with healthcare providers and additional countries may consider or implement such laws.
 
Other Regulations
 
Foreign Anti-Corruption
 
We are subject to various federal and foreign laws that govern our international business practices with respect to payments to government officials. Those laws include the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act which prohibits U.S. companies and their representatives from paying, offering to pay, promising, or authorizing the payment of anything of value to any foreign government official, government staff member, political party, or political candidate for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or to otherwise obtain favorable treatment or influence a person working in an official capacity. In many countries, the health care professionals we regularly interact with may meet the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) definition of a foreign government official. The FCPA also requires public companies to make and keep books and records that accurately and fairly reflect their transactions and to devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls.
 
The laws to which we are subject also include the U.K. Bribery Act 2010 (Bribery Act) which proscribes giving and receiving bribes in the public and private sectors, bribing a foreign public official, and failing to have adequate procedures to prevent employees and other agents from giving bribes. U.S. companies that conduct business in the U.K. generally will be subject to the Bribery Act. Penalties under the Bribery Act include potentially unlimited fines for companies and criminal sanctions for corporate officers under certain circumstances.
 
Other Laws
 
Our present and future business has been and will continue to be subject to various other laws and regulations. Various laws, regulations and recommendations relating to safe working conditions, laboratory practices, the experimental use of animals, and the purchase, storage, movement, import and export and use and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances used in connection with our research work are or may be applicable to our activities. Certain agreements entered into by us involving exclusive license rights may be subject to national or international antitrust regulatory control, the effect of which cannot be predicted. The extent of government regulation, which might result from future legislation or administrative action, cannot accurately be predicted.

We are not authorized to issue additional shares of class B common stock except in limited circumstances. As a result of the conversion, there is now only a single class of outstanding common stock, class A common stock, which is entitled to one vote per share.
