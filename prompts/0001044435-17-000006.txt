ITEM 1. | Business.

Overview
We are a Delaware corporation, originally founded in 1992 as a Texas corporation and we operated under the name Active Power, Inc. until we changed our name to P10 Industries, Inc., in November 2016.
On June 15, 2016, our board of directors determined that we should pursue a strategy of protecting our U.S. federal tax benefits of approximately $235.5 million and research and development credit carry-forwards of approximately $4.1 million, each as of December 31, 2015, discontinue our then current unprofitable operations, seek to monetize certain intellectual property rights related to patents that did not relate to our core business and make acquisitions of profitable operations that could utilize our tax benefits. On June 17, 2016, we announced that our board of directors had adopted a rights agreement and declared a dividend of one right for each issued and outstanding share of our common stock, which was designed to protect our tax benefits.
On September 29, 2016, we entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement with Langley Holdings plc, a United Kingdom public limited company, and Piller USA, Inc., a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Langley. In this annual report, we refer to Langley and its subsidiaries, including Piller USA, Inc. (now Piller Power Systems, Inc.), collectively as Langley. The agreement provided, among other things, that Langley would purchase from us substantially all of our assets and operations for a nominal purchase price plus the assumption of all of our indebtedness, including bank debt, liabilities and customer, employee and purchase commitments going forward. The sale of substantially all of our assets to Langley was approved by the holders of a majority of our outstanding shares of common stock at a special meeting of our stockholders held on November 16, 2016.
On November 19, 2016, we completed the sale of substantially all of our assets and operations to Langley. Pursuant to the terms of the purchase agreement, after the closing of the disposition of our assets, we retained approximately $1.6 million in cash, which equaled the amount by which the value of the acquired assets exceeded the assumed liabilities on our balance sheet by more than $5 million at closing. We also retained certain intellectual property rights related to our patents that are not related to the purchased assets. Langley assumed the lease obligations for our engineering facility, but our landlord refused to approve a sublease of our headquarters facility to Langley. However, Langley agreed to close on the sale without the sublease of that facility. As a result, we are still obligated to make payments under the lease for our headquarters, although Langley is currently making payments to us in the same amount. Following the sale of our assets to Langley, we changed our name from Active Power, Inc. to P10 Industries, Inc.

This annual report on Form 10-K discusses our business for a majority of our fiscal year ended December 31, 2016, which consisted primarily of designing, manufacturing, selling and servicing our UPS products, which was sold to Langley. We refer to this business in this annual report on Form 10-K as our Discontinued Operations.
We are now considered a shell company, as defined in Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act. Being a shell company means that we have no or nominal operations, our assets solely consist of cash and nominal other assets, and our business will be primarily to monetize our retained intellectual property and to make acquisitions of profitable operating companies to create positive cash flow, which we believe will ultimately result in increasing the value of our company in the future.
In connection with the asset sale to Langley, we notified The NASDAQ Stock Market, or NASDAQ, on November 21, 2016 that, upon the closing under the purchase agreement, we had disposed of substantially all of our assets, and had no significant continuing operations. On December 1, 2016, we filed with the SEC a Notification of Removal from Listing and/or Registration under Section 12(b) of the Exchange Act on Form 25 to delist the shares of our common stock from NASDAQ and the deregistration of our common stock under Section 12(b) of the Exchange Act. On that day, our common stock was suspended on NASDAQ and, since that date, our common stock has been traded solely on the OTC Pink Market operated by OTC Markets Group. On January 15, 2017, we filed with the SEC a Certification and Notice of Termination of Registration under Section 12(g) of the Exchange Act on Form 15. Shortly after filing this annual report, we intend to file with the SEC a Certification and Notice of Suspension of Duty to File Reports under Sections 13 and 15(d) of the Exchange Act on Form 15, after which we will suspend filing current and periodic reports with the SEC under the Exchange Act. Our common stock will continue to be traded on the OTC Pink Market under the symbol PIOI, but our stockholders will not be able to access the financial and other information regarding our business in the same detail as they have in the past. We intend on providing quarterly summarized financial data and annually audited US GAAP financial statements, which will be made available on our corporate website.

Business Plan
Subsequent to the sale of substantially all of our assets, we have focused our efforts on preserving cash by reducing overhead expenses and transitioning away from compliance obligations as a public company subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act. We have also spent our efforts on negotiating with the landlord of our headquarters facility and Langley to terminate our obligations under the lease for that facility, which obligations have made it difficult for us to obtain the financing necessary to move forward with our acquisition strategy discussed below.
We are pursuing our new strategy of monetizing our non-core intellectual property and making acquisitions of profitable businesses to create positive cash flow, which we believe will ultimately result in increasing the value of our company in the future. We are seeking financing from third parties to fund our acquisition of profitable businesses. We have been in discussions with several such potential investors, but we have no current immediate sources of funding for our new strategy, partly due to our continuing lease obligations. In addition, we have been involved in activities ranging from initial verbal discussions to the review of technical and financial data and other due diligence reviews with prospective acquisition candidates, but we currently have no acquisition targets identified. However, until such time as we are able to consummate a financing, and an acquisition of a profitable business, claims, liabilities and expenses such as payroll for the two executive employees, directors’ and officers’ insurance, taxes, legal, accounting and consulting fees and miscellaneous administrative expenses, will continue to be incurred as we continue to pursue our new strategy. We are also potentially liable for all future lease payments under the lease for our headquarters facility. These expenses could be material and much higher than currently anticipated and, in any event, will reduce or eliminate the amount of assets available for ultimate distribution to our stockholders.  As a result, if we do not obtain investment financing and enter into an acquisition, and terminate our obligations under the headquarters lease, we may need to proceed with a dissolution and distribution of our remaining assets in accordance with applicable law. We cannot be sure that we can obtain the financing necessary to complete any acquisitions, or obtain such financing on reasonable terms. Any such financing could result in dilution to our existing stockholders. Also, despite our stockholders rights plan, and our best efforts, the issuance of equity securities in any such financing could result in a “change in control” under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code, which could result in the loss of some or all of our tax benefits. Finally, if the operations we acquire do not generate a net profit, we will not be able to realize the value of our tax benefits.
Following the asset sale, we retained 18 U.S. patents and three foreign patents that were not of use to the business we sold. The amounts that we incurred in developing these patents were fully expensed prior to the asset sale to Langley. We retained a patent consulting firm to review and analyze these patents, after which the consulting firm identified some evidence of potential use of our patented technology in several products. Our patent consulting firm is now in the process of doing an analysis with the goal of recommending a plan for monetization of our patents, which may include selling the patents, entering into to licensing arrangements or a combination of both. There is a risk that we may never be able to realize any value from these patents.
Discontinued Operations; Cessation of UPS Business
Prior to November 19, 2016, when we sold substantially all of our assets, we designed, manufactured, sold, and serviced flywheel-based uninterruptible power supply (“UPS”) products that use kinetic energy to provide short-term power as a cleaner alternative to electro-chemical battery-based energy storage. We also designed, manufactured, sold, and serviced modular infrastructure solutions (“MIS”) that integrate critical power components into a pre-packaged, purpose built enclosure that may include our UPS products as a component. Our products and solutions were based on our patented flywheel and power electronics technology and are designed to ensure continuity for data centers and other mission critical operations in the event of power disturbances.
The UPS products and solutions are designed to deliver continuous conditioned power during short-term power disturbances and outages, such as voltage sags and surges, and to provide ride-through power in the event of a utility failure, supporting operations until utility power is restored or a longer term alternative power source, such as a diesel generator, is started. 
The MIS products integrate critical power components into a pre-packaged, purpose built enclosure that can be deployed by customers indoors or outdoors.

The assets that we sold to Langley included all of our accounts receivable, customer contracts, equipment, intellectual property (other than the non-core intellectual property we retained), name and website, permits, office and equipment leases, the stock of our subsidiaries, other contracts and other rights. In addition, upon closing of the asset sale, all of our employees ceased employment with us and were hired as employees of the acquirer. At closing, Langley assumed substantially all of our liabilities related to these assets and the business that we sold. These liabilities included our accounts payable, obligations under one of our facility leases, obligations under our contracts, non income tax liabilities, the remaining obligations under our revolving line of credit with Silicon Valley Bank, which was repaid and terminated at closing, and all employee-related liabilities. The landlord of our corporate headquarters facility in Austin, Texas refused to consent to a sublease of that facility in connection with the asset sale. As a result, we currently retain all obligations under that lease. In addition, the landlord has notified us that it considers us in breach of the lease agreement for the facility. We are currently in negotiations with Langley, the landlord and other potential tenants in an effort to reduce our obligations under the lease. At closing of the asset sale, we had approximately $1.6 million in cash, representing the amount by which the value of the acquired assets exceeded the assumed liabilities on our balance sheet by more than $5.0 million at closing. We have no indemnification obligations under the purchase agreement, and there is no escrow account for the net cash retained by us. We refer to the business we sold to Langley as our discontinued operations.
We are currently in negotiations with Langley, the landlord and other potential tenants in an effort to reduce our obligations under the lease. We are also in discussions with a potential investor that has indicated that it is contemplating an investment in shares of our common stock. However, the investor has indicated that it would be a condition to the closing of its investment that we make a filing under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code pursuant to a prepackaged plan. The prepackaged plan would provide for the issuance of the shares of our common stock to the potential investor in a manner which would not make the rights under our stockholders rights plan exercisable. In addition, the prepackaged plan would also provide for the settlement our lease obligation. We do not have a definitive agreement with the potential investor, and we cannot assure you that the transactions described above will be consummated.
Employees
As of December 31, 2016, we had two executive employees.
