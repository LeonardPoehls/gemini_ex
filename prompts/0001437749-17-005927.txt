Item 1. BUSINESS.
Our Company
 
Ignite Restaurant Group, Inc. (referred to herein as the “Company,” “Ignite,” “we,” “us” or “our”) is a diversified restaurant company that operates a portfolio of two restaurant brands, Joe’s Crab Shack (“Joe’s”) and Brick House Tavern + Tap (“Brick House”). Both of our restaurant brands offer a variety of high-quality food and beverages in a distinctive, casual, high-energy atmosphere, and operate in a diverse set of markets across the United States and internationally. As of January 2, 2017, we operated 112 Joe’s and 25 Brick House restaurants in 32 states. We currently have three Joe’s franchised restaurants in Dubai, U.A.E. 
 
The first Joe’s restaurant was opened in Houston, Texas in 1991. On October 13, 2006, in connection with the purchase by JCS Holdings, LLC, an entity controlled by J.H. Whitney VI, L.P., of 120 Joe’s restaurants, we changed our name to Joe’s Crab Shack Holdings, Inc. In 2008, we developed our second brand, Brick House. On July 7, 2009, with the addition of the Brick House brand, we changed our name to Ignite Restaurant Group, Inc. On April 9, 2013, we completed our acquisition of Romano’s Macaroni Grill (“Macaroni Grill”). On April 17, 2015, we completed the sale of Macaroni Grill. Unless specifically stated, all discussions regarding Ignite consolidated operations exclude Macaroni Grill.
 
J.H. Whitney VI, L.P., an affiliate of J.H. Whitney Capital Partners, LLC, owns approximately 66.1% of our total outstanding common stock as of January 2, 2017.
 
Recent Developments
 
On April 3, 2017, we announced the following developments relating to our business:
 
Sale of Our Business
 
Our Board of Directors, working together with our management team and our financial advisor, has commenced a process to pursue the sale of our business, which could be sold as an entirety or through the separate sales of our two restaurant brands, Joe’s Crab Shack and Brick House Tavern + Tap. There can be no assurance that the process that we are undertaking will be successful. In addition, we cannot predict the terms or timing of any transaction that we may undertake or whether any such transaction will result in any proceeds for the holders of our common stock. 
Changes in Senior Management Team
 
Robert S. Merritt, who has served on our Board of Directors since March 2014 and as Chief Executive Officer since November 2015, will resign from those positions after the filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, but will continue to serve as a consultant to the Company. Jonathan Tibus, a Managing Director with Alvarez & Marsal, has been elected our Chief Executive Officer. Most recently, Mr. Tibus served as CEO of Last Call Operating Co., which owned and managed over 80 restaurants under the brand names of Champps, Bailey’s, and Fox & Hound. He also recently served as Chief Restructuring Officer (CRO) to Quiznos, a sandwich restaurant franchisor with over 2,000 domestic and international stores, and as Chief Operating Officer (COO) to Max & Erma’s, a $150 million chain of casual dining restaurants. In addition, Brad Leist, our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, has been promoted to the additional position of Chief Administrative Officer, and Steve Metzger, our Vice President and General Counsel, has been promoted to Senior Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary of the Company. 
The Forbearance Agreement

On March 31, 2017, we entered into an agreement with certain of the lenders and the Administrative Agent (collectively, the “Forbearing Lenders”) under our 2014 Credit Facility, whereby the Forbearing Lenders agreed to, among other things, forbear from taking any action to enforce certain of their rights or remedies under the 2014 Credit Facility with respect to certain defaults, events of default, and anticipated events of default (the “Forbearance Agreement”). The Forbearance Agreement is effective until the earliest of (i) May 9, 2017, or (ii) the occurrence or existence of any default or event of default other than defaults, events of default and anticipated events of default that are subject to the Forbearance Agreement. Should we be in default of the Forbearance Agreement or should the required lenders and the Administrative Agent not agree to further extend such Forbearance Agreement, the Administrative Agent and lenders would be free to exercise any rights and remedies with respect to such defaults and events of defaults pursuant to the terms of the 2014 Credit Facility.
 Our Restaurants
 
Joe’s Crab Shack
 
Joe’s is a come-as-you-are, family restaurant that offers guests an environment that is laid-back, comfortable, fun, and energetic. Most locations offer an outdoor patio for guests to enjoy eating and drinking and a children’s playground as part of the “I’m relaxed” restaurant experience. Joe’s also has many locations that are located on waterfront property. Interior design elements include a nautical, vacation theme to invoke memories of beach vacations and a genuine crab shack experience. Table tops are decorated with art to prompt dinner conversation, while picnic tables across the patio and interior help guests feel the relaxed tropical vacation experience. Joe’s restaurants are largely free-standing and average 8,000 square feet with over 200 seats. Most Joe’s bars are separated from the dining area to provide for a distinct place to grab a drink while waiting for a table. Many of our restaurants also include a small gift shop where guests can purchase souvenirs to commemorate their dining experience. Our current restaurant prototype, introduced in fiscal year 2010, contemporizes many of our key brand elements, while maintaining our authentic crab shack appeal.
 
Joe’s restaurants perform well in targeted markets with high population density and a propensity for seafood, as well as “destination” markets with national and regional tourist attractions, both of which are key characteristics of our site selection strategy.
 
Brick House Tavern + Tap
 
Brick House is a trend-forward “next generation bar & grill” set in an inviting, comfortable and modern venue that provides a distinctive guest experience. Brick House’s interior décor includes custom lighting, dark mahogany woods, open sight lines, HD TVs, and an inviting fireplace. The interior design of Brick House consists of diverse seating and gathering areas where guests can pick multiple ways to enjoy their experience. In addition to a traditional dining room and bar area, Brick House also offers large communal tables and a section of leather recliners positioned in front of large HD TVs, where guests receive their own TV tray for dining. Each restaurant has a state-of-the-art entertainment package and provides guests with a clear line of sight to HD TVs from every seat, making Brick House restaurants an ideal gathering place for sports enthusiasts. Outdoor seating is also available on the patio or around an open fire pit at nearly all locations. Both food and beverages are served by personable and engaging service staff. The typical Brick House restaurant is approximately 8,500 square feet and averages approximately 250 seats, which includes both traditional tables and unique seating options.

 Menu and Menu Development
 
We are focused on elevating our high-quality food and beverage offerings. Born out of consumer insights, our in-house Marketing and Culinary departments continually create new food and beverage products for Joe’s and Brick House, which are intended to exceed guest expectations. A variety of research tools are used to identify opportunities and evaluate current offerings, including segmentation and core menu studies, brand screens, social media and in-restaurant surveys. We use a third party econometric consulting firm to provide statistical analysis around pricing, allowing us to make fact-based decisions on pricing and menu engineering.
Joe’s Crab Shack
 
Joe’s aims to offer signature, craveable items to its guests. For example, we have shifted the menu mix at Joe’s by focusing on entrées featuring crab over the last several years. Crab is strategically positioned center stage in our menu through the Steampots and Buckets of Crab categories, highlighting the importance of the menu item. Joe’s Steampots and Buckets of Crab allow guests to choose between seasonal varieties of crab (Queen, Snow, Dungeness and King) and whole lobster. Steampots, our bestselling item, are overflowing with generous portions of crab seasoned to our guest’s tastes, other seafood, red potatoes, sausage and a fresh ear of corn. Our Buckets of Crab allow guests to pair their favorite crab with several distinctive seasonings ranging from BBQ to Chesapeake Style or Garlic Herb. Joe’s also leverages its crab-forward menu with other craveable crab items, including Made-From-Scratch Crab Cakes, Crab Nachos and Crazy Good Crab Dip. As a result of this strategy, entrées at Joe’s featuring crab comprise approximately 47% of total food revenues. We believe this crab-focused menu mix has contributed to increases in guest satisfaction and gross profit dollars. In addition to our core crab-focused menu, Joe’s also offers a broad range of seafood entrées like Southern Stuffed Shrimp, Cedar Roasted Salmon and Redfish ‘N Lobster, plus hand-breaded traditional platters including East Coast Platter and Shrimp Sampler. Joe’s also offers several “out of water” options such as Herb Chicken and Joe’s Steak Deal. In addition, alcoholic beverages have significantly evolved to support the elevated food strategy, with vacation-style drinks, including the Shark Bite, Category 5 Hurricane and Mason Jar cocktails emerging as guests’ top choices.
 
Joe’s menu includes more than 12 items made with Lobster, Queen, Snow, Dungeness, or King Crabs sourced from government regulated and sustainable fisheries. Our current menu offers 12 appetizers, including Great Balls of Fire, Crab Nachos and Crazy Good Crab Dip, and over 40 entrées, including Steampots, Buckets of Crab, East Coast Platter and several “out of water” options. For fiscal year 2016, Joe’s average check was $25.86, lunch and dinner represented 26% and 74% of revenue, respectively, and revenue distribution was 86% food, 13% alcohol and 1% retail. Prices currently range from $7.59 to $49.99 for items on Joe’s menu, including appetizers ordered as entrées and entrées that are good for more than one person.
 
New menu roll-outs occur in April/May and October/November. For all new menu roll-outs, new product launches are combined with a new menu design and updated pricing to reflect the current economic environment, as well as the current strategic marketing and creative plan. A menu change typically includes the introduction of new menu items and recipe enhancements while maintaining a balance of about 75 total menu items, including appetizers and lunch only items. Menu items are added or removed only after thorough testing and analysis, which includes guest satisfaction feedback.
 
Brick House Tavern + Tap
 
The Brick House food and beverage menu was created to make the brand feel aspirational while inherently approachable. We believe Brick House’s elevated menu has “changed the game” for the bar and grill customer by offering an innovative premium food selection, along with more than 80 varieties of beer and specialty cocktails made by our bar experts.
 
Brick House offers its guests a broad selection of scratch-made, chef-inspired, contemporary tavern food. Brick House’s menu includes 15 appetizers, 35 entrées, seasonal specials, brunch, dessert and specialty cocktails. Unique handcrafted appetizers include Deviled Eggs, Hickory Smoked Sockeye Salmon and Duck Wings. Brick House offers an array of burgers, including the Bison Burger, chargrilled and topped with jalapeño cilantro mayo and candied slab bacon. Guests can also choose from a broad selection of homemade entrées such as Drunken Chops, Chicken Pot Pie, Chicken & Waffles, our Southern Fried Chicken Sandwich, and our Brick Pizzas. In addition, Brick House’s burgers, including the Farmhouse Burger and the Black & Bleu Burger, offer guests a distinct take on the traditional burger. Brick House’s beverage selection includes imported and domestic beers along with hand-pulled cask beer. Beer is served in vessels unique to our industry such as Brick House’s signature tap-at-your table beer bongs. All Brick House restaurants have a full bar that supports a variety of liquor drinks, wine and beer cocktails like Fiery Apple Cider and the Shandy as well as specialty cocktails like the Twisted Old Fashioned, Apples N’ Oranges and St. Bubbles. For fiscal year 2016, Brick House had four full day parts with lunch, afternoon, dinner and late night accounting for 21%, 25%, 39% and 15%, respectively, and Brick House’s revenue distribution was approximately 60% food and 40% alcohol. Brick House’s entrées range in price from $8.00 to $26.00, including appetizers ordered as entrées.
 
Continuous menu innovation is a key strategy for Brick House. We revise the Brick House menu twice a year with design, pricing and product offerings assessed before each menu implementation. New menu offerings are created to reinforce differentiation in our appetizers, entrées and beverage offerings as part of our effort to provide our guests with exceptional food. Testing of new menu items is executed in-restaurant before a new item is rolled out system-wide.

Marketing
 
Our marketing strategy is fact-based, using consumer insights to build brand affinity and drive menu optimization. Our marketing expenditures were 3.6%, 4.7% and 4.5% of revenues for the fiscal years 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
 
In 2016, Joe’s Crab Shack deployed a strategic mix of advertising that included 14 weeks of national television, 32 weeks of digital radio and 53 weeks of paid search.  These activities were supplemented with social media outreach, database marketing, local restaurant marketing and added value media.  In 2017, based on insights to the way our guests consume media, we are migrating toward a comprehensive digital strategy that will more efficiently reach consumers who live, work and play within our restaurants’ trading areas.  This will provide 52 weeks of media support, including search, video, radio, banner ads, mobile and social.  Our marketing efforts are designed to increase value perceptions and build frequency across dining occasions.  Examples of our value proposition include All-You-Can-Eat Shrimp on Wednesdays, Build Your Own Boil and the expansion of our lunch menu to new markets.
 
Marketing for Brick House Tavern & Tap continued to focus on menu innovation and weekly specials, as well as local activities, television viewing events and holiday celebrations supported by social media, digital advertising and additional customer engagement.  Examples of initiatives include traveling trays to go, Happiness Hours, and promotions around holidays and viewing events, such as St. Patrick’s Day, March Madness and football. 
 
Guest Satisfaction
 
We use third party vendors to systematically gather, record and analyze key guest data for all of our brands. Our marketing research tools include:
 

• | AAU, or attitude, awareness and usage surveys; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------
• | third party analysis of guest sentiment from social media; and
• | core menu studies. 

   
We use the insights gathered from market research and data analytics to support strategic and tactical decisions. We embrace and rely on the use of market research as a tool to better understand our business and drive improved performance. These market research and data analytics provide us with critical guest feedback that guide us to change or refine individual menu items and implement operational initiatives to drive positive results on “Satisfaction,” “Likely to Return” and “Likely to Recommend” metrics. Our AAU also guides us on changes to perception and awareness of our brands when considering shifts in our marketing and advertising strategies and tactics. We believe improved performance of our menu items, in our restaurants and in the effectiveness of our advertising is driven by understanding guest feedback and making changes accordingly.
 
Restaurant Operations
 
While our brands have independent field operations, we maintain a shared services platform, which handles many of the administrative functions for both Joe’s and Brick House. The Operations department is currently headed by our interim Chief Operating Officer (“COO”) who handles both brands. We believe this provides a scalable infrastructure, which will allow us to efficiently adapt as our business changes and increase our profitability.
Joe’s Crab Shack
 
Joe’s operations are led by two Regional Vice Presidents. Each Regional Vice President oversees six to seven Directors of Operations, who typically manage eight to fifteen restaurants. Restaurant-level management at Joe’s typically includes a General Manager, an Executive Kitchen Manager, a Restaurant Manager and Flex Managers, as needed. The Flex Manager is an hourly employee that is properly trained and may be called upon to perform a managerial role. Our restaurant managers have bonus programs that are based on sales and restaurant-level profits.
 
Joe’s manager training program is designed to train and educate managers at all levels, from the hourly Flex Manager to the General Manager. This comprehensive program is eight weeks in length and covers all aspects of the restaurant, including front-of-house and back-of-house functions as well as back office training. Our certified trainer training program is designed to develop hourly training specialists that reside in a restaurant or market to oversee the training programs in that area. To become a certified trainer, candidates must be a fully validated hourly team member with recommendations from their General Manager and Director of Operations. Through the training process, both hourly and management trainees will attend classroom sessions, take examinations, watch videos and work alongside a certified trainer or a highly trained individual that reports back to the certified trainer on performance and progress. Because Joe’s is committed to the responsible service of alcohol, we have developed an in-house certification program that educates our restaurant personnel on the responsible service of alcoholic beverages. All team members are required to complete this certification bi-annually.

Brick House Tavern + Tap
 
The Brick House team has one Regional Vice President who oversees three Directors of Operations who, in turn, each manage six to eleven restaurants. Typical restaurant management includes a General Manager, a Service Manager, an Executive Chef and an Executive Beverage Manager. Brick House managers have bonus programs that are based on sales and restaurant-level profits.
 
Our training programs are eight weeks for all salaried managers and five days for all hourly positions. Our new hire training program is conducted by in-house trainers who have been certified by our area training coordinator. At the end of training, there is a comprehensive test and an on-the-job training validation that must be completed before team members are allowed to work independently. Because Brick House is committed to the responsible service of alcohol, we have developed an in-house certification program that educates our restaurant personnel. All team members are required to complete this certification bi-annually.
 
Shared Services
 
Our brands are supported by our Restaurant Support Center (“RSC”) located in Houston, Texas. The RSC provides support services to both brands including accounting, real estate and development, human resources, legal, purchasing and information systems. We believe our RSC allows us to leverage our scale and share best practices across key functional areas that are common to all of our brands.
Site Selection
 
We focus our development strategy for Joe’s on new locations in narrowly defined geographic regions with high population density and a propensity for seafood and in close proximity to regional and national tourist attractions. Our development strategy for Brick House is largely intended to focus on opening new locations in the top 50 designated market areas across the country. We take an analytical, data-driven approach to selecting new sites, which is largely based upon, but not limited to, the following criteria:

• | with respect to Joe’s, attractiveness of locations from a regional/national and/or “destination market” perspective;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | local market demographics and psychographic profiles;
--+------------------------------------------------------


• | characteristics similar to our most successful existing restaurants;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------


• | regional consumer trends and preferences;
--+------------------------------------------


• | local performance of nationally branded peers;
--+-----------------------------------------------


• | vehicle traffic patterns, visibility and access;
--+-------------------------------------------------


• | occupancy rates and other performance data from local hotels and other retail establishments, offices and other establishments that draw restaurant traffic;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | available square footage, parking and lease economics;
--+-------------------------------------------------------


• | local investment and operating costs; and
--+------------------------------------------


• | development and expansion constraints.
--+---------------------------------------

   Restaurant Development and Economics

During 2016, we opened three Brick House restaurants, which were conversions from Joe’s restaurants. Our incremental capital investment, which includes build-out costs and cash pre-opening costs, amounted to $9.9 million for restaurants opened in 2016. Factors contributing to the fluctuation in capital investment per location include size of the property, geographical location, type of construction, cost of liquor and other licenses, and concessions received from landlords. Conversions of other existing restaurants to Joe’s or Brick House typically require less capital investment than newly developed and built restaurants. During the past three fiscal years, we have converted three Macaroni Grill restaurants to Brick House restaurants, and three Joe’s restaurants to Brick House restaurants.
 
We target steady state new restaurant average unit volumes of approximately $3.9 million for Joe’s and $3.2 million for Brick House. We also enter into new restaurant development with planned cash-on-cash returns, which is defined as restaurant-level profit per restaurant divided by total build-out costs and cash pre-opening costs, to exceed our cost of capital. For 2017, we do not plan on opening any new restaurants.
 
Performance of any new restaurant location will usually differ from its originally targeted performance due to a variety of factors, and these differences may be material. New restaurants typically encounter significant guest traffic and high sales in their initial months, which may decrease over time. Furthermore, average sales volumes of our new restaurants are impacted by a range of risks and uncertainties beyond our control, including those described under the caption “Risk Factors.”
 
Purchasing and Distribution
 
Our dedicated purchasing team sources, negotiates and purchases all food supplies, operating supplies, and all restaurant equipment, furniture and fixtures. We have developed an extensive network of suppliers, with many relationships dating back over many years. We maintain relationships with many suppliers and have the ability to shift purchasing among suppliers, should more favorable terms become available in the market. In addition, we maintain multiple approved suppliers for all key components of our menu to mitigate risk and ensure supply. Suppliers are chosen based upon their ability to provide (i) a continuous supply of product that meets all safety and quality specifications, (ii) logistics expertise and freight management, (iii) product innovation, (iv) customer service, (v) transparency of business relationship and (vi) competitive pricing. Specified products are distributed to all restaurants through a national distribution company under a negotiated contract. This distributor delivers products directly to our restaurants either two or three times per week depending on restaurant requirements. Produce is purchased locally from an approved supplier network to maximize operating efficiencies and to ensure freshness and product quality.
 
Historically, our top selling menu items are based on Queen Crab, Snow Crab, Dungeness Crab, King Crab, whole lobster and shrimp, which collectively accounted for approximately 45% to 50% of our total food purchases in previous fiscal years. We have established long-term relationships with key seafood vendors and usually source product directly from producers to get advantageous product access at the most competitive prices. As market conditions warrant, we can use these relationships to lock in forward pricing for six to 18 months. Pricing agreements are entered into for a minimum volume of product and are structured around current and historical prices and the projected menu mix. We employ a team at the RSC that is solely responsible for actively managing these purchases.
 
In addition to using fixed price purchases, our Joe’s menu provides inherent flexibility to help manage food cost. Crab is deliberately placed center stage as a defining item to the Joe’s experience. Joe’s Steampot and Buckets of Crab offerings allow guests to choose between four varieties of crabs (Queen, Snow, Dungeness and King) and lobster. Each of these species has multiple fisheries and seasons. Besides the ability to direct guests to other crab varieties, Steampots, the top selling item on the menu, provide additional product flexibility. The Steampot is a variety of both shellfish and non-seafood items served together in a simmering pot that have individual ingredients that can be adjusted based on prevailing market prices and general input availability. We believe this strategy greatly reduces our reliance on individual inputs and is largely opaque to the guest. We have the ability to adjust menu prices very quickly, if necessary.
 
Crab is harvested during seasons and in accordance with regulations which are determined by various regulatory agencies. The master distributor fulfills restaurant orders by delivering crab, which our restaurants store until preparation for service to the guest. We believe our strong supplier relationships, coupled with the inherent flexibility of our menu, minimizes our exposure to seafood supply chain shortages and market price increases. Cost of sales as a percentage of revenues for fiscal year 2016, 2015 and 2014 were 32.7%, 31.4% and 32.5%, respectively. In fiscal year 2016, our top three suppliers accounted for approximately 31% of our total food purchases. 

Food Safety
 
We have food safety and quality assurance programs which are designed to ensure that our restaurant team members and managers are trained in proper food handling techniques. Our restaurants operate in various municipalities, which require us to have systems in place to adhere to various local standards. With the goal of achieving industry leadership in the area of restaurant food safety and sanitation, we have implemented a national operating standard, which includes comprehensive, unannounced inspections by a third party service provider. Restaurant managers receive feedback and coaching as an integral part of the semi-annual visits to each restaurant.

We require all of our suppliers to adhere to strict Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points, or HACCP, quality control and environmental standards in the development, harvest, catch, and production of food products. We require chemical, physical and microbiological testing of seafood and other commodities for conformance to safety and quality requirements.
 
All potential suppliers are required to meet our specified minimum standards to achieve approved supplier status for the Ignite system.
 
Information Systems and Restaurant Reporting
 
All of our restaurants use computerized management information systems, which are designed to improve operating efficiencies, provide restaurant and RSC management with timely access to financial and operating data, and reduce administrative time and expense. Our integrated management information systems platform is a combination of in-house and third party systems. The major management information systems are divided by function:

• | restaurant point-of-sale;
--+--------------------------


• | restaurant back-of-house;
--+--------------------------


• | financial;
--+-----------


• | payroll/human resources; and
--+-----------------------------


• | internal operational reporting.
--+--------------------------------

 
All of our restaurants are equipped with computerized point-of-sale (“POS”) and back-of-house systems. We use a third-party vendor for our restaurant POS system. We have the ability to generate weekly and period-to-date operating results on a company-wide, brand-wide, regional and/or individual restaurant basis. Together, this allows us to closely monitor sales, food and beverage costs and labor and operating expenses at each of our restaurants. Our POS system runs on non-proprietary hardware with open architecture, an intuitive touch screen interface and integrated credit and gift card processing. Our back-of-house systems include a kitchen display system for all of our restaurants. These back-of-house systems also run on non-proprietary hardware with open architecture.
 
Our accounting department uses a standard, integrated reporting system to prepare period and year-to-date profit and loss statements, which provide a detailed analysis of sales and costs, and which are compared to budgets and to prior periods. Additionally, we outsource certain payroll functions and use a third-party human resources information system. This system supports standard payroll functions as well as recruiting, hiring, promotion, and benefits administration.
 
Enhancing the security of our financial data and other personal information remains a high priority for us. We continue to innovate and modernize our technology infrastructure to provide improved efficiency, control and security. Our ability to accept credit cards as payment in our restaurants and for online gift card orders depends on us remaining compliant with standards set by the PCI Security Standards Council (“PCI”). The standards set by PCI contain compliance guidelines and standards with regard to our security surrounding the physical and electronic storage, processing and transmission of individual cardholder data. We maintain security measures that are designed to protect and prevent unauthorized access to such information. 
 
 Employees
 
As of January 2, 2017, we employed approximately 7,000 employees, of whom approximately 105 were RSC, executive management and multi-unit restaurant management personnel, approximately 430 were restaurant-level management personnel and the remainder were hourly restaurant personnel. During 2016, total employee counts ranged from 10,000 during peak summer season to 7,000 during the winter. None of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements, and we believe we have good relations with our employees.
Competition
 
The restaurant industry is fragmented and intensely competitive. We believe guests make their dining selection based on a variety of factors such as menu offering, taste, quality and price of food offered, perceived value, service, atmosphere, location and overall dining experience. Our competitive landscape includes nationally-branded restaurant chains as well as regional and local restaurant operators.
  
 
6



For Joe’s, our primary competitors in the casual seafood segment include Red Lobster, Bonefish Grill, Landry’s Seafood and Bubba Gump Shrimp Company. Joe’s is America’s only national crab house. Red Lobster is our only large-scale, nationally branded seafood competitor. Brick House competes in the bar and grill segment with brands such as BJ’s Restaurant and Brewhouse, Buffalo Wild Wings and Yard House. Both brands also compete with a broader range of other casual dining restaurant brands such as The Cheesecake Factory, Applebee’s, Chili’s, T.G.I. Friday’s, Texas Roadhouse and Outback Steakhouse.
 
Seasonality
 
There is a seasonal component to Joe’s business which typically peaks in the summer months (June, July and August) and slows in the winter months (November, December, January). Because of the seasonality of our system-wide business, results for any fiscal quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be achieved for future fiscal quarters or for the full fiscal year.
Trademarks and Service Marks
 
Our registered trademarks and service marks include Joe’s Crab Shack® and logo design, and Brick House Tavern + Tap® and logo design. We have used or intend to use all the foregoing marks in connection with our restaurants and our franchised locations. We believe that our trademarks and service marks have significant value and are important to our brand-building efforts and identity and the marketing of our restaurant brand.
Licensing and Franchising Arrangements
 
We currently have three Joe’s franchised locations in operation in Dubai, U.A.E. 
 
Our franchising arrangements provide revenue to us through initial franchising fees, ongoing royalties and marketing fees and all start-up costs paid by the franchisee. Our franchising agreements also require and any future agreements will continue to require the franchisee to operate restaurants in accordance with certain defined operating procedures, adhere to our established menus and meet applicable quality, service, health and cleanliness standards.
 
We believe that international franchising presents an opportunity to provide higher returns on investment, while significantly reducing the capital and infrastructure required to own and operate international restaurants. Our international franchising program provides us with the capability to seek further expansion in international markets with our brands. We seek franchising partners that have adequate financial resources, the ability to build out a market, an established customer-facing interface and a track record of successful brand stewardship and awareness. 
 
Government Regulation
 
We are subject to a variety of federal, state and local laws. Each of our restaurants is subject to permits, licensing and regulation by a number of government authorities, relating to alcoholic beverage control, health, safety, sanitation, building and fire codes, including compliance with the applicable zoning, land use and environmental laws and regulations. Difficulties in obtaining or failure to obtain required licenses or approvals could delay or prevent the development of a new restaurant in a particular area.
 
Alcoholic beverage control regulations require each of our restaurants to apply to a state authority and, in certain locations, county or municipal authorities for a license that typically must be renewed annually and may be revoked or suspended for cause at any time. Alcoholic beverage control regulations affect many aspects of restaurant operations, including minimum age of patrons and employees, hours of operation, advertising, trade practices, wholesale purchasing, inventory control and handling, storage and dispensing of alcoholic beverages.
 
We are subject in certain states to “dram shop” statutes, which generally provide a person injured by an intoxicated person the right to recover damages from an establishment that wrongfully served alcoholic beverages to the intoxicated person. We carry liquor liability coverage as part of our comprehensive general liability insurance policy.
 
Our restaurant operations are also subject to federal and state laws governing employment (including the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 and the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986) regarding such matters as the minimum hourly wage, unemployment tax rates, sales tax and similar matters. Significant numbers of our service, food preparation and other personnel are paid at rates related to the federal minimum wage, which currently is $7.25 per hour. The tip credit allowance is the amount an employer is permitted to assume an employee receives in tips when the employer calculates the employee’s hourly wage for minimum wage compliance purposes. Increases in the federal or state minimum wage, directly or by either a decrease in the tip credit amount or an insufficient increase in the tip credit amount to match an increase in the federal minimum wage, would increase our labor costs.

In addition, our restaurants must comply with the applicable requirements of the ADA and related state accessibility statutes. Under the ADA and related state laws, we must provide equivalent service to disabled persons and make reasonable accommodation for their employment, and when constructing or undertaking significant remodeling of our restaurants, we must make those facilities accessible.
 
We are also subject to laws and regulations relating to nutritional content, nutritional labeling, product safety, menu labeling and other regulations imposed by the FDA, including the Food Safety Modernization Act. Regulations relating to nutritional labeling may lead to increased operational complexity and expenses and may impact our sales.
 
Litigation
 
Occasionally, we are a defendant or otherwise involved in lawsuits arising in the ordinary course of our business including claims resulting from “slip and fall” accidents, “dram shop” claims, construction-related disputes, employment-related claims, and claims from guests or employees alleging illness, injury or other food quality, health or operational concerns. When the potential liability can be estimated and the loss is considered probable, we record the estimated loss. Due to uncertainties related to the resolution of lawsuits and claims, the ultimate outcome may differ from our estimates. As of the date of this report, we do not believe the potential exposure with respect to any of these pending lawsuits and claims will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Refer to “Legal Proceedings” in Item 3 for additional disclosure.
