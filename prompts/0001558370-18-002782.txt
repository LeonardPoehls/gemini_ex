     Proposed Transaction with an Affiliate of the Company’s Executive Chairman Gregory H. Sachs
     On April 2, 2018, the Company entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”) with SCG Digital, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (“Parent”), SCG Digital Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (“Merger Sub”) and SCG Digital Financing, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and an affiliate of Parent, solely for the purposes of Sections 6.19, 8.03 and 8.04 of the Merger Agreement. Under the terms, and subject to the conditions, of the Merger Agreement, Merger Sub will be merged with and into the Company, with the Company continuing as the surviving corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (the “Merger”). Shareholders of the Company’s common stock (other than Parent and its affiliates and rollover shareholders that enter into agreements with Parent to contribute shares of Company common stock to an affiliate of Parent prior to the closing of the Merger) will receive $1.27 in cash per share in the Merger. Shareholders of the Company’s common stock (other than Parent and its affiliates and rollover shareholders that enter into agreements with Parent to contribute shares of Company common stock to an affiliate of Parent prior to the closing of the Merger) will receive $1.27 in cash per share in the Merger. Parent is owned by SCG Digital Holdings, Inc., a Delaware corporation and an affiliate of Gregory H. Sachs, the Company’s Executive Chairman (collectively, the “Sponsor”).
 Mr. Sachs and certain of his affiliates have entered into a voting agreement (the “Voting Agreement”) with the Company and agreed, among other things, to vote his shares of the Company’s common stock in favor of adoption and approval of this Agreement and to take certain other actions in furtherance of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement.  All members of the Board of Directors of the Company in attendance at the meeting approved the Merger Agreement on the unanimous recommendation (with Mr. Sachs recusing himself and one member unable to attend the final meeting due to a personal matter) of a Special Committee comprised entirely of independent directors of the Company (the “Special Committee”).
 The Merger Agreement contains a “go shop” provision pursuant to which the Company has the right to solicit and engage in discussions and negotiations with respect to competing proposals through May 17, 2018 (the “Initial Go Shop End Date”); provided that such end date may be extended at the election of the Company (upon written notice to Parent) at any time prior to the Initial Go Shop End Date until June 1, 2018 (such period commencing with the Execution Date, as may 

 
  1

 
be extended, the “Go-Shop Period”). After the conclusion of the Go-Shop Period, the Company may continue discussions with any “Excluded Person”, defined as a party that submits (and has not withdrawn) a written proposal during the Go-shop Period that the Special Committee determines in good faith, after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel, is, or would reasonably be expected to lead to, a “Superior Proposal,” as defined in the Merger Agreement and with whom the Company remains in continuous active discussions.
 Except with respect to Excluded Persons, after the conclusion of the Go-Shop Period, the Company will be subject to a “no-shop” restriction on its ability to solicit third-party proposals, provide information and engage in discussions with third parties. The no-shop provision is subject to a “fiduciary-out” provision that allows the Company to provide information and participate in discussions with respect to third party proposals submitted after the conclusion of the Go-Shop Period and with respect to which the Special Committee has made the determinations previously described.
 The Company may terminate the Merger Agreement under certain circumstances, including if its Board of Directors determines in good faith that it has received a Superior Proposal, and otherwise complies with certain terms of the Merger Agreement. In connection with such termination, a termination fee, as well as reimbursement for certain fees and expenses up to an “Expense Make Whole Threshold” may be payable by the Company to Parent in the following circumstances: (i) if such termination occurs before the Initial Go Shop End Date, the Company will not be required to pay a termination fee, (ii) if the Go Shop Period is extended and the Merger Agreement is terminated by the Company before the Non-Solicitation Start Date so that the Company can enter into an alternative acquisition agreement with an Excluded Person, then the Company will be required to pay a fee of $150,000 and (iii) if the Merger Agreement is terminated by the Company or Parent in certain other circumstances more fully set forth in the Merger Agreement, then the Company will be required to pay a fee of $500,000.  In the event that the Merger Agreement is terminated by the Company due to a material breach of the Merger Agreement by Parent or Merger Sub or in the event that Parent or Merger Sub fail to consummate the Merger when otherwise obligated to do so pursuant to the terms and conditions thereof, the Merger Agreement provides for Parent to pay to the Company a penalty loan of $1 million (the “Penalty Loan”) upon termination of the Merger Agreement.
 Consummation of the Merger is subject to various conditions, including adoption of the Merger by a vote of a majority of the minority shareholders of the outstanding shares of the Company’s common stock (other than any rollover investors, shareholders affiliated with Parent and the Company’s executive officers) and other customary closing conditions described in the Merger Agreement, and other customary closing conditions. The parties expect to close the transaction during the second quarter of 2018. 
 In connection with the Merger Agreement, on April 2, 2018, the Company and certain of its subsidiaries (the “Borrowers”) entered into the Subordinated Loan and Security Agreement (the “Subordinated Loan Agreement”) with SCG Digital Financing, LLC (the “Subordinated Lender”), pursuant to which the Subordinated Lender agreed to make available to the Borrowers a bridge loan (the “Bridge Loan”) in the principal amount of $2 million.  The Subordinated Lender is an affiliate of Mr. Sachs.  If the Penalty Loan is funded pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, the Penalty Loan will also be a credit extension under the Subordinated Loan Agreement and subject to its terms (the Penalty Loan together with the Bridge Loan, the “Subordinated Loans”). The Subordinated Loans are secured by a second priority lien in all of the assets of the Borrowers. The Bridge Loan matures on the later of April 2, 2019 or, if the Penalty Loan is funded, one year following the funding of the Penalty Loan, at which time all outstanding principal and interest on the Subordinated Loans are due.  No principal payments are required under either the Bridge Loan or the Penalty Loan prior to maturity and, except in limited circumstances, no principal payments are permitted prior to the first anniversary of the closing date.  Interest on the Bridge Loan accrues at a per annum cash interest rate equal to 8.0% above the prime rate plus 2.0% paid-in-kind and interest on the Penalty Loan will accrue at a per annum paid-in-kind interest rate equal to 5% above the prime rate. If the Bridge Loan is prepaid prior to the stated maturity date thereof, the Borrowers are obligated to pay a prepayment premium equal to the interest the loans would have accrued if they had remained outstanding through maturity.  During an event of default, the rate of interest on the Subordinated Loans would increase to 2.5% above the otherwise applicable rate, until such event of default is cured or waived. All accrued and unpaid cash interest is payable quarterly on the last day of each fiscal quarter.
 Upon the occurrence of certain events (including the failure of the Company’s unaffiliated shareholders to approve the Merger), the Subordinated Lender has the right to convert principal and accrued interest outstanding under the Bridge Loan into shares of Series A Preferred Stock of the Company on the terms set forth therein.
 The Subordinated Loans are subordinated to the obligations under the Amended and Restated Loan and Security Agreement (the “Restated Loan Agreement”) dated October 13, 2017 with Silicon Valley Bank (the “Bank”) pursuant to 

 
  2

 
a Subordination Agreement dated as of April 2, 2018.
 On April 2, 2018, the Borrowers also entered into the First Amendment (the “First Amendment”) to the Restated Loan Agreement with the Bank. Pursuant to the First Amendment, the minimum EBITDA covenant in the Restated Loan Agreement was amended and the Bank consented to the incurrence of certain subordinated debt pursuant to the Subordinated Loan Agreement (as defined above) by the Company and certain of its subsidiaries, among other things.
     The Special Committee engaged Lake Street Capital Markets LLC (“Lake Street”) to provide a fairness opinion to the Special Committee. On April 2, 2018, Lake Street delivered an opinion to the Special Committee that as of the date of the opinion, the merger consideration to be received by holders of the Company’s common stock is fair to such holders (other than the holders of Company common stock that are affiliates of Parent) from a financial point of view. 
 History
     We were incorporated in Delaware on January 5, 2011 as a “blank check company” for the purpose of effecting a business combination with one or more businesses. On April 8, 2013, we consummated the acquisition of RMG Networks Holdings, Inc., f/k/a Reach Media Group Holdings, Inc. (“Reach Media Group”), which became our Media business, pursuant to a merger agreement, dated as of January 11, 2013, as amended. On April 19, 2013, we consummated the acquisition of RMG Enterprise Holdings Corporation, f/k/a Symon Holdings Corporation (“Symon”), which became our Enterprise Solutions business, pursuant to a merger agreement, dated as of March 1, 2013. As a result of the Reach Media Group and Symon acquisitions, Reach Media Group and Symon became our subsidiaries, and the businesses and assets of Reach Media Group, Symon and their subsidiaries became our only operations. Symon was considered to be our predecessor for accounting purposes. On July 1, 2015, we sold the assets of our Airline Media Network to an unaffiliated third party, effectively exiting what were the legacy operations of our Media business.     Industry
     We believe digital signage in business environments allows companies to engage targeted audiences, such as employees and consumers, more effectively than traditional communications. The digital signage industry is comprised of software, hardware, content, and professional services that create solutions for business customers. Frost & Sullivan, in its 2015 Analysis of the Global Digital Signage Systems Market report, estimated that the market for digital signage system technology in 2014 was approximately $1.5 billion and expects the market to grow from 2014 to 2020 at a compound annual growth rate of 13.2%. Others, such as IHS, Inc. estimate that aggregate global digital signage expenditures, including ancillary components, approached $14 billion in 2014.
     As digital signage systems have evolved, they have become more cost effective and are able to provide richer media content. The initial costs of planning and deploying digital signage infrastructure have dropped, reducing a significant barrier to growth. Today’s solutions support remote manageability, energy efficiency and the ability to process and blend rich media content. We believe customers are increasingly recognizing the flexibility and cost-effectiveness digital signage can provide compared to other forms of communication.
     A key market driver that is dramatically impacting the traditional digital signage industry and driving increased utilization of digital signage solutions is a demand for real-time information. Because of increased technology enablement, both organizations and individual consumers expect information to be more available and timely. Digital signage solutions are increasingly providing organizations with multiple ways of distributing and collecting data in real time, often in an interactive manner.
     Competitive Strengths
     We believe that the following factors differentiate us from our competitors and position us for continued growth:
     We provide dynamic “real time” business data visualization. Differentiated from digital signage solutions that only offer the capability to place a set loop of content onto one or a few display endpoints, we offer solutions to dynamically visualize critical business data and content that help companies track and measure their operations or communicate with target audiences more efficiently and effectively. Our technology platforms and integrated solutions can interface with a customer’s disparate business systems, assemble data, apply business logic and display the output in real-time on thousands of end points across a multinational network.

     Our products can be easily adapted to satisfy a wide array of customer applications. Our solutions encompass a full array of key consumer-facing, corporate and advertising network types. We believe our solutions add significant value and provide a definable return on investment across a diverse set of business applications such as real-time reporting and alerting for contact centers, supply chain warehousing and manufacturing. Other enterprise uses include company news and “real time” information for employee or corporate communications. Our products are also commonly used in public-facing environments, such as retail operations, hotels, convention centers, hospitals, universities, casinos and government facilities. Our enterprise software suite incorporates leading network security features and is both robust and scalable. Our solutions meet the requirements of many of the largest financial services and telecommunications companies in the United States. Our data-integration components ensure that nearly any external source can be leveraged in a solution, including databases, telephony, interactive kiosks, POS, RSS and web content, among others.
     We offer comprehensive, configurable solutions and not just individual solution components. One key to our market leadership is our robust software suite that offers flexibility for nearly any client application. This includes installations ranging from a single display to many hundreds or even thousands of end-points. This platform allows us to build, manage, maintain and monetize comprehensive visual communication solutions for our customers. To accomplish this, we approach the market with a full complement of integrated ready-to-use technologies, including our proprietary software and software-embedded appliances, and a wide range of proprietary and third-party flat screen displays, kiosks, video walls, mobile devices and other digital signage endpoints. We also provide a wide range of professional services including installation and training, software and hardware maintenance and support, and creative content. We are typically the prime source for technical resources for implementations that feature our proprietary software and software-embedded appliances. We maintain strong customer support groups in the United States and internationally offering around-the-clock client support. In addition, we have a full-time multinational team of content writers, video producers, graphic designers and editors who develop both original and subscription content as required by customers.
     We are trusted by some of the largest organizations in the world. Some of the largest and most demanding organizations, including a majority of Fortune 100 companies, count on our solutions every day to inform, educate and motivate their employees and customers and to build their brands. Because of our products’ abilities to integrate with mission critical software applications, our solutions are required to pass a higher level of security testing. We have found that add-on sales opportunities and customer longevity are very high when our hardware and software have been authorized by customers to work behind their firewalls. Being a trusted solution provider to large multi-national corporations also affords us the opportunity to efficiently cross sell throughout a customer’s global footprint and sell solutions for additional application areas into a single organization.
     We serve customers through a multinational footprint. We have offices or personnel focused on developing business located in North America, Europe, and the Middle East. We service thousands of customers worldwide and estimate that hundreds of thousands of people globally view our content each day on our customers’ installations. Our multinational presence enables us to satisfy the worldwide requirements of our multi-national customers and to pursue market opportunities in high-growth geographies outside of North America. To efficiently utilize our multinational footprint, we have well-established relationships with leading business partners and resellers around the world.

          Products and Solutions
     We provide enterprise communication solutions that empower organizations to visualize critical business data to better run their businesses. Our proprietary software platform seamlessly integrates with our customers’ existing mission critical departmental applications and offers premise-based or hosted content management, content subscription services and mobility solutions. We work closely with leading global technology partners, developing proprietary technical interfaces.
     Our solutions portfolio, comprised of solutions for contact center, internal communications, supply chain and consumer-facing retail, financial services, higher education and hospitality applications are offered through our Enterprise Server Software platform and our newly-released KorbytTM Software platform.
     Enterprise Server Software Platform
     Our enterprise server software platform solutions are primarily offered with perpetual use software licenses and annual maintenance & support contracts and are generally on-premises deployments within our customers’ networks. Substantially all of our historical revenue has been generated from our enterprise server software platform. Solutions are assembled from the following product components:
     Enterprise Server (“ES”) is a robust software application server used to collect content (data, video, graphics, and text) from various application and other data sources, organize the content according to business rules and distribute the content to a variety of end-points, including our proprietary media players, PCs and mobile devices. Our data collectors connect ES with customers’ enterprise applications to retrieve real-time data. Our data collectors give us a distinct advantage by being able to deliver solutions more quickly, less expensively and with higher quality than the competition.
     Design Studio (“DS”) is a software offering that is installed on the client’s PC (DS) and used to design the look, feel, function and timing of how content is played on end-point displays. The software features a set of pre-designed templates that can be combined with external content feeds that are provided by us or other external content providers.
     InView™ software is a fully integrated internal communications software product delivering real-time business data and other content across all employee devices, including desktop, laptop, mobile and tablet. InView is a messaging platform that enables real time communication of rich media, including business data, to all or a subset of connected corporate users. Automatic message delivery ensures employees are aware of critical events, for example call volumes spikes or emergency weather conditions, allowing them to quickly respond with appropriate actions to exceed established company goals.
     Korbyt™ Software Platform
     We released our Korbyt Software Platform in the fourth quarter of 2017. Our Korbyt software platform solutions are primarily offered through a subscription model and have the flexibility of being deployed in the cloud, on-premises or in a hybrid environment. Our Korbyt cloud offering utilizes a multi-tenant architecture, which enables us to run a single instance of our software code, add subscribers with minimal incremental expense and deploy new applications and upgrades quickly and efficiently. Solutions are assembled from the following product components:
     Korbyt™ Signage gives companies the power to communicate more effectively with seamless content creation and distribution across digital signage networks. Korbyt Signage provides end users with an easy to use, browser-based content authoring tool, an intuitive content management system and enterprise scalable device management and alerting features.

     KorbytGO™ provides companies with a mobile app platform that enables organizations to connect with their employees, managers and leadership through a mobile phone, a device that is readily used and preferred by employees. Employers are able to communicate in real-time to keep employees up to date on company initiatives, key performance indicators, benefits information, safety announcements and more. Key features include a dynamic company newsfeed, personalized messaging capabilities based on the employee’s preferences, built-in shift scheduling and employee chat applications, user generated content publishing, and advanced audience analytics for administrators included automatic employee groups and messaging based on a user’s behavior in the application.
     Hardware and Subscription Products:
     Subscription Content Services provides syndicated “business-appropriate” news and current information, created by our editors. In addition, weather, stock information, airport flight data and over 100 ticker feeds allow clients to customize the desired output in almost any manner they require. This service is hosted by us, and it complements customers’ messaging by keeping their audience engaged with fresh news and information throughout the day.
     Media Players/Smart Digital Appliances (“SDA”) are media players with our software pre-loaded that function as the content storage and rendering hardware between our ES or Korbyt content engine and the visual display end-points (LED displays, HD TVs or PCs). SDAs “pull” content and content rules and parameters from ES or Korbyt and then render the content on the displays according to established rules and layouts.
     Electronic Displays (“ED”) include a line of displays designed by us, such as door displays that are architected to work seamlessly with our content management software. We also offer a large portfolio of third-party displays from some of the most recognizable brands in screen and electronic display technology.
     RMG MAX LED (“MAX”) includes a line of customizable LED display solutions for indoor and outdoor market applications. RMG’s MAX series offers full custom LED solution that scale to HD-quality image support, 4K and beyond, in addition to delivering embedded audio, energy efficiency, low heat emissions and an industry-leading 1.2mm pixel pitch. RMG MAX LED visual solutions integrate with RMG’s current software and creative content media players to further leverage the strength of existing platforms. 
     Multinational Sales Model
     We sell products and services through a multinational professional sales force, as well as through a select group of resellers and local partners. In North America, approximately 91% of sales were generated solely by our sales team, with approximately 9% through resellers in the year ended December 31, 2017. Outside of the United States, the situation is reversed, with approximately 70% of sales coming from the reseller channel. Overall, approximately 70% of global sales were derived from direct sales, with the remaining 30% generated through indirect partner channels.
     Our multinational sales team includes approximately 41 sales representatives and sales support staff as of December 31, 2017. The sales representatives each have multiple years of specific experience in selling complex enterprise technology solutions. The sales team is supported in the pre-sales process by a team of highly skilled subject matter experts and sales engineers, who help to present solutions that meet each customer’s specific needs. In general, the sales compensation structure for the sales staff is approximately half base salary and half commissions. The amount of payment of commissions is dependent on representatives reaching their quarterly and annual sales objectives. In addition, commissions are modified by the overall profitability of the mix of products that are sold. Our resellers globally are generally supported by one or more of our sales team members to assist them with proposing unique solutions for clients and prospects.
     Customers
     Customers around the world purchase our enterprise communication solutions including software, hardware and services. For larger customers, a master services agreement is individually negotiated when necessary. Upon approval of the customer’s or reseller’s credit, customers purchase a solution which includes licensed software, hardware, installation services, training services, maintenance services and/or content services. Maintenance and content services are sold on an annualized basis, creating an annuity income stream and a close business relationship. Our resellers purchase products and 

 
  6

 
services from us to resell to their clients. In general, we assist resellers with installation, training services and on-going support in partnership with our resellers.
     Competition
     Holding a strong, competitive position in the market for intelligent visual solutions requires maintaining a diverse product portfolio that addresses a wide variety of customer needs. We believe we have been a leading multinational provider of such products and services for more than 30 years. Our customers include many of the largest organizations in the world and, as a result, our brand is established in the geographies in which we do business. The worldwide digital signage market is vast and diverse. In addition to the scope of our product and service portfolio, we compete based upon commercial availability, price, visual performance, brand reputation and customer service. Customer requirements vary as to products and services, and as to the size and geographic location of the solutions.
     We compete with a broad range of companies, including local, national and international organizations. Some competitors offer a range of products and services; others offer only a single part of the overall digital signage solution. Though our direct competitors are numerous, diverse and vary greatly in size, we view our principal competitors as Broadsign, Four Winds Interactive, Inova, Janus Displays, Nanonation, Navori, Scala, Stratacache, Nanolumens, Visix, Social Chorus and Dynamic Signal.
     Our competitive strategy is built around our ability to provide end-to-end solutions; extensive software and hardware options; a consultative sales and partnership approach that delivers optimized customer solutions; a highly qualified staff of installation, integration and creative design professionals; seamless integration with customers’ IT infrastructure, data, and security environments; custom screen and content design; and post-sale customer service and multinational technical support. We believe that our relative size and competitive strategy gives us an advantage in the markets we serve.
     Employees
     As of December 31, 2017, we had 162 multinational employees, with 111 in our North American operations and 51 employees in our international operations. Our U.S. employees are not covered by any collective bargaining units and we have never experienced a work stoppage in the U.S. Our international employees are also not covered by any national union contracts.     Intellectual Property and Trademarks
     We rely on a combination of trademark, copyright, patent, unfair competition and trade secret laws, as well as confidentiality procedures and contractual restrictions, to establish, maintain and protect our proprietary rights. These laws, procedures and contractual restrictions provide only limited protection and any of our intellectual property rights may be challenged, invalidated, circumvented, infringed or misappropriated. Further, the laws of certain countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States and, therefore, in certain jurisdictions, we may be unable to protect our proprietary technology. We generally require employees, consultants, customers, suppliers and partners to execute confidentiality agreements with us that restrict the disclosure of our intellectual property. We also generally require our employees and consultants to execute invention assignment agreements with us that protect our intellectual property rights. Despite these precautions, third parties may obtain and use without our consent intellectual property that we own or license. Any unauthorized use of our intellectual property by third parties, and the expenses incurred in protecting our intellectual property rights, may adversely affect our business.
     As of December 31, 2017, we had two issued patents in the United States that expire in 2021. Neither of these patents are material to our business. We cannot ensure that any future patent applications will be granted or that any of our issued patents will adequately protect our intellectual property. In addition, third parties could claim invalidity or co-inventorship, or make similar claims with respect to any of our currently issued patents or any patents that may be issued to us in the future. Any such claims, whether or not successful, could be extremely costly to defend, divert management’s time, attention, and resources, damage our reputation and brand and substantially harm our business.
     We expect that we and others in the industry may be subject to third-party infringement claims as the number of competitors grows and the functionality of products and services overlaps. Our competitors could make a claim of infringement against us with respect to our products and underlying technology. Third parties may currently have, or may 

 
  7

 
eventually be issued, patents upon which our current solution or future technology infringe. Any of these third parties might make a claim of infringement against us at any time.
     Government Regulation
     We are subject to varied federal, state and local government regulation in the jurisdictions in which we conduct business, including tax laws and regulations relating to our relationships with our employees, public health and safety, zoning, and fire codes. We operate each of our offices, and distribution operations in accordance with standards and procedures designed to comply with applicable laws, codes and regulations.
     We import and export products into and from the United States. These activities are subject to laws and regulations, including those issued and/or enforced by U.S. Customs and Border Protection. We work closely with our suppliers to ensure compliance with the applicable laws and regulations in these areas.
     Available Information
     We make available free of charge on or through our Internet website our annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and all amendments to those reports as soon as reasonably practicable after such material is electronically filed with or furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC.
