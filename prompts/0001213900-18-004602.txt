Our Industry
 
Advances in technology architectures have supported the rise of cloud computing, which enables the delivery of a wide variety of cloud-based services. Today, mission-critical applications can be delivered reliably, securely and cost-effectively to our customers over the internet without the need to purchase supporting hardware, software or ongoing maintenance. The lower total cost of ownership, better functionality and flexibility of cloud applications represent a compelling alternative to traditional on-premise solutions. As a result, enterprises are increasingly adopting cloud services to rapidly deploy and integrate applications without building out their own expensive infrastructure and to minimize the growth of their own IT departments and create business agility by taking advantage of accelerated time-to-market dynamics.
 
Spending on public cloud services is expected to increase sharply this year and through 2019, according to analysts with International Data Corporation, a leading global market intelligence firm (“IDC”) and Gartner, Inc., a leading IT research and advisory company (“Gartner”). 
 
According to the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology, or the NIST, cloud computing is on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources (e.g., networks, servers, storage, applications and services) that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management and effort and service provider interaction. The NIST has identified five essential characteristics of cloud computing:
 

● | on-demand service;
--+-------------------


● | broad network access;
--+----------------------


● | resource pooling;
--+------------------


● | rapid elasticity; and
--+----------------------


● | measured service
--+-----------------

 
NFV and SDN are the popular software-based approaches that service providers are using to design, deploy and manage their networks and services. NFV is a telecom led initiative seeking to utilize standard IT virtualization technology to consolidate many telecom network equipment types onto industry standard high volume servers, switches and storage. Many industry leaders believe NFV will likely transform the entire telecom infrastructure ecosystem. In its report entitled “Network Functions Virtualization (NFV) Market: Business Case, Market Analysis and Forecasts 2015 – 2020”, published in November 2014, Mind Commerce, a business intelligence and technology insight company, estimated that the overall global market for NFV will grow at a compound annual growth rate, or CAGR, of 83.1% between 2015 and 2020, and that NFV revenues will reach $ 8.7 billion by the end of 2020.
 
Signals and Systems Telecom, a Dubai-based market intelligence and consulting firm for the worldwide telecommunications industry (“SNS Telecom”), projects exponential growth in service provider SDN and NFV investments. In its report titled ‘The SDN, NFV & Network Virtualization Ecosystem: 2015 – 2030 – Opportunities, Challenges, Strategies & Forecasts,’ SNS Telecom projects that this industry will log a 54% CAGR from 2015 to 2020, and will account for US$20 billion in revenue by 2020.
 
The SNS Telecom report states that enterprises are already aware of the several advantages offered by SDN and NFV. The deployment of these technologies is seen to be the highest in datacenter operations, telecommunications services, and enterprise IT. One aspect that makes SDN, NFV, and network virtualization much sought after is the ability of these technologies to help enterprises cope with the mounting demand for higher mobile traffic capacity. While doing so, these technologies bring down capital expenses and operating expenses, which can otherwise burden service providers. Most importantly, virtualization enables service providers to reduce their dependence on expensive and high-maintenance hardware platforms.

Network Function Virtualization. In order to enter the SDN and NFV market we developed and launched NFVGrid, an NFV orchestration platform, as part of our Network-as-a-Service (NaaS) offering. This software platform helps to manage VNFs, instantiating, monitoring, repairing them and handling billing for the services. In addition, we also released our multi-vendor VNF validation services. Through third-party VNF validation, service providers know in advance that virtual network functions are working together in a specific, dynamic, environment. Since each VNF validation is as unique as the network itself, we have created three levels of validation services that are available through annual contracts. No matter how intricate a network is, we offer the level of service needed. We offer:
