ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Corporate History
 
Medifirst Solutions, Inc. (“Medifirst” and the “Company”) was incorporated in Nevada in November 2010. Our principal executive office is located at 4400 U.S. 9 South, Suite 1000, Freehold NJ, 07726, and our telephone number is (732) 786-8044. Our website address is www.medifirstsolutions.com. The Company began as a development stage company focused on developing products within the healthcare market for both consumer and professional applications. Medifirst has had several different products and related distribution and sales services which include: its own line of disposable electronic cigarettes (“e-cigs”), Light Therapy for therapeutic healthcare use and home water machines which made water from air. In 2015, the Company made a strategic decision to add laser technology to its health and wellness division and discontinue its efforts with other products and divisions. Management believed that it was in the best interest of the Company and its shareholders to narrow its focus and business to developing its laser technology, which lasers are expected to target professionals that treat pain and inflammation, as well as cosmetic and skincare related conditions. In connection with the changed focus, the Company began to develop a product that if successfully cleared by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”), would be the first in a series of proprietary medical devices for the Company. The Company entered into an exclusive manufacturing agreement to produce what is now its hand-held mobile laser system known as “The Time Machine Program” for which the Company purchased the registered trademark. Furthermore, the Company purchased inventory from the developer of the lasers.
 
Additionally, Medifirst, through its wholly-owned subsidiary Medical Laser Manufacturer, Inc., entered into a Product and Know-How License Agreement (the “License Agreement”) with Laser Lab Corp to license the use of various intellectual property in connection with seeking regulatory approval for and marketing, distributing and selling The Time Machine Series Lasers (“TM Lasers”). The License Agreement grants a license to the Company to use various technology, trade secrets, invention records, research records, reports and data, test results, clinical studies, engineering and technical data, designs, production specifications, processes, methods, procedures, facilities and know-how related to the inventions identified in the License Agreement, which inventions include the infrared laser in the TM Lasers for which the Company previously filed a Premarket Notification 510(k) submission with the FDA. Although the License is not exclusive, Laser Lab Corp may not license the know-how or inventions to a third party and may only directly, or through its wholly-owned subsidiary, use the know-how and inventions. In addition to the license granted to the Company, the License Agreement provides for an option to license other fields of use of the infrared laser in the TM Lasers, as well as additional wavelengths and colors, allowing the Company to develop a broader range of product offerings in the future. Furthermore, Laser Lab Corp granted the Company a right of first refusal to consider matching any bona fide offer to license other technologies of Laser Lab Corp.
 
After having received clearance to market the infrared laser in the TM Lasers, the Company has completed its internal controls and procedures as required by the FDA and has initiated its sales division, which has begun soliciting sales in both the U.S. and overseas.

On August 4, 2017, the Company, through its wholly-owned subsidiary Medical Lasers Manufacturer, Inc., entered into two Master Exclusive Distribution Agreement (the “Distribution Agreement”) with AOTEX (O.S.) S.A.L. (“AOTEX”), an international distribution company based in the Middle East. Pursuant to the Distribution Agreement, the Company granted AOTEX a three-years’ exclusive right to distribute the Company’s Infrared Time Machine Laser (collectively with all accessories and carrying case sold therewith, the “Product”), in the following territories: Lebanon, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, United Arab of Emirates, Bahrain, Qatar, Oman, Jordan and Iraq (with an option to expand the territories to Egypt, Cyprus and Turkey). The exclusivity of the distribution rights under the Distribution Agreement may be revoked and the Company may terminate the Distribution Agreement, at the sole discretion of the Company, in the event that AOTEX fails to purchase an aggregate of $500,000 in Product during the first year, an aggregate of $1,000,000 in Product during the second year, and $2,000,000 in Product during the third year. After early discussions between the Company and AOTEX, it is contemplated that AOTEX will partially distributed the Product through established medical distribution companies, including Medica Group, Gulf Drug, and Arabian Ethicals. However, as of the date of this Report, AOTEX has not make any purchase of any Product and no assurances can be made that AOTEX will ever be successful in its sales efforts.
 
On August 31, 2017, the Company, through its wholly-owned subsidiary Medical Lasers Manufacturer, Inc., entered into a Master Exclusive Distribution Agreement (the “Morocco Distribution Agreement”) with Inter Equipment Medical Services Maroc (“IEMSM”), a distribution company based in Morocco. Pursuant to the Morocco Distribution Agreement, the Company granted IEMSM a three-years’ exclusive right to distribute the Company’s Infrared Time Machine Laser (collectively with all accessories and carrying case sold therewith, the “Product”), in Morocco. The exclusivity of the distribution rights under the Morocco Distribution Agreement may be revoked and the Company may terminate the Distribution Agreement, at the sole discretion of the Company, in the event that IEMSM fails to purchase an aggregate of $100,000 in Product during the first year, an aggregate of $125,000 in Product during the second year, and $150,000 in Product during the third year. The Company has begun the product registration process with authorities in Morocco and IEMSM’s distribution efforts will commence after the registration process is complete. As of the date of this Report, the Company has yet to be granted clearance to sell and no assurances can be made that the Company will ever be granted clearance to sell or, if clearance is achieved, that IEMSM will be successful in its sales efforts. 
 
On September 19, 2017, the Company amended its Articles of Incorporation to increase its authorized Common Stock to 4,000,000,000 shares. All other provisions of its Articles of Incorporation in effect prior to the amendment remain unchanged.
 
On November 24, 2017, the Company introduced the Infrared Time Machine TTML-8102000 Laser Thermal Therapeutic Device for the treatment of TMJ at the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center in New York City. According to the Mayo clinic, the temporomandibular joint (TMJ) acts like a sliding hinge, connecting your jawbone to your skull. You have one joint on each side of your jaw. TMJ disorders — a type of temporomandibular disorder or TMD — can cause pain in your jaw joint and in the muscles that control jaw movement. Pain may be due to a combination of factors, such as genetics, arthritis or jaw injury. Some people who have jaw pain also tend to clench or grind their teeth, although many people habitually clench or grind their teeth and never develop TMJ disorders. The Time Machine Laser has shown positive and often immediate results for patients who suffer from excruciating pain related to TMJ. We believe that the Time Machine Laser presents a targeted, natural, noninvasive and effective pain treatment option for patients who otherwise are reliant on drugs for immediate relief. 
 
On December 14, announced that it has signed an agreement with Life Science Quest, LLC. Life Science Quest helps businesses to promote innovative technology, unlock global market potential, and empowers their overall growth. Life Science Quest, with experience and resources across a broad spectrum of fields in health care and life sciences, provides high quality, results-oriented services to help businesses overcome barriers and maximize their potential. Life Science Quest has a vast amount of experience working in the medical and healthcare industry including an emphasis on medical devices in the China market. With the rapidly developing and growing Chinese medical device and healthcare market, a population of 1.4 billion, and millions of patients suffering from acute and chronic pain, China presents a huge new market for the lasers.
 
On February 23, 2018 the Company announced that the Infrared Time Machine TTML-8102000 Laser Thermal Therapeutic Device, will be used for a new Sleep Apnea program. Sleep Apnea Silent Sleep Rx program based in Red Bank New Jersey, will use the Time Machine Infrared Laser as part of its protocol. Sleep disorders, including Sleep Apnea, have become a significant health issue in the United States. It is estimated that 42 million Americans suffer from Sleep Apnea, with 80 percent of the cases of moderate and severe obstructive Sleep Apnea undiagnosed. Many lawmakers are proposing legislation to have state and federal transit workers and truck drivers tested for this disorder. Recently, the National Transportation Safety Board reported that the probable cause of the 2016 NJ Transit crash at the Hoboken rail terminal, in which a train accelerated as it was coming into the station, was “the engineer’s fatigue resulting from his undiagnosed severe obstructive sleep apnea.”

The Time Machine Series Laser
 
FDA 510(k) Clearance
 
On July 8, 2016, we received clearance from the FDA to market its infrared Time Machine TTML-8102000 Laser Thermal Therapeutic Device.
 
Applications
 
Indication for use: The Time Machine Series Lasers Model TTML-8102000 - 810/830nm is intended for use in temporary relief of minor muscle and joint pain, stiffness, minor arthritis pain, muscle spasm, temporary increase in local blood circulation and temporary relaxation of muscles by means of topical elevated tissue temperature from infrared spectral emissions.
 
The Company has delayed filing for FDA 510(k) clearance for the Green and Violet Laser until the Company secures the funding necessary to complete the process. The Green Laser is for aesthetic use and the Violet is anti-bacterial and anti-fungal.
 
Specifications
 
The Time Machine Infrared Laser 810/830nm operates in continuous wave mode set at a fixed frequency. The Infrared laser operates at a 810/830nm wavelength and at 2000mw, as set forth in our 510(k) submission. The Laser is hand-held and mobile. It works on rechargeable batteries, has 6,000 hours of usage against average treatments of 8 minutes for a specified area to treat and has specifications that are often found on larger more expense laser machines.
Manufacturing Agreement
 
Medifirst has entered into an exclusive manufacturing agreement allowing us to exclusively purchase various lasers in the TM Lasers having a range of wavelengths and colors, including Infrared, Green, Red, Violet, Ultra-Violet and Blue. We believe that our present manufacturing capacity at these facilities is sufficient to meet foreseeable demand for our products. We have established a quality control program, including a set of standard manufacturing and documentation procedures intended to ensure that, where required, our products are manufactured in accordance with applicable FDA regulations and the comparable requirements of the European community and other countries.
Business Plan
 
We have begun to solicit to sell our TM Infrared laser in the U.S. and international marketplace. The current strategy to rolling out the products will be multifaceted, starting with trade shows, direct sales, marketing and advertising and partnering with medical device distributors. Medifirst has implemented internal controls and procedures as mandated by the FDA, including checks and balances to be implemented prior to sale in the Company’s office, which procedures will also be put in place at the Company’s manufacturer. The Company continues to actively engage additional sales and distribution affiliates to offer our lasers in the US market. Furthermore, we expect to engage various product marketing teams to introduce our brand and products to direct and indirect customers of the TM Lasers.
 
We have started our sales initiatives from our new office space for FDA controls and procedures and for training. We are actively interviewing sales and marketing professionals on an ongoing basis to introduce the Time Machine technology to the US and international markets. As part of our sales strategy, we will highlight to the medical communities our belief that the Time Machine hand-held mobile laser unit offers a very unique, effective and affordable alternative to the extremely costly and bulky laser machines current being offered in the marketplace.

The Company has presented the Time Machine Lasers to distributors and healthcare professionals in China, Toronto, Morocco, Dubai and Paris and continues to follow up to initiate sales. In the U.S. market, the Company has enlisted sales representatives in New Jersey, Florida and New York City. Currently the Company is introducing, demonstrating and conducting training for the Lasers at the offices of its Medical Directors in New York City and Boca Raton, Florida, as well as in the corporate office in New Jersey.
 
The healthcare professionals that we believe will benefit from incorporating the TM Lasers into their practices include medical doctors, chiropractors, pain specialists, dentists, cosmetic professional as well as hospitals and surgical centers. We also believe that our lasers will be useful to medi-spas, massage therapists, electrolysis providers, physical therapists and any professional that treats pain, inflammation and scarring. Because laser regulations vary from state-to-state, healthcare professionals will need to research their state-specific compliance requirements regarding their authorized usage.
 
The Time Machine Laser Series and Program (“TMP”) will be affordable and priced very competitively, as compared to other lasers in the industry which can typically cost tens of thousands of dollars. The Company currently offers financing through a third party for as little as just over two hundred dollars a month. List price is $9,995 and the company has the flexibility to offer discounts based on volume and strategic sales. Other lasers in the marketplace list at $16,000 to over $50,000. Many of these are not mobile and all-in-one units. We believe the benefits to healthcare professionals which include our treatment protocols as well as the additional benefit of additional revenue will make us highly competitive and in high demand in the medical laser industry. For example, although each practitioner can set the rates patients pay for laser treatments, which typically can range from $600 to $2,500 for a 6 treatment package. The prices are set by the healthcare facility taking into consideration the clientele and location of the practice. The Company does offer financing through a third party financing company.
 
Benefits of the The Time Machine Program (TMP):
 

● | Offers practitioners a lucrative opportunity to generate new revenues or enhance existing revenue sources with a low-cost device that provided what we believe to be an effective laser medical technology. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Allows businesses to expand their treatment offerings and increase their clientele using what our studies have shown are effective outcomes from treatment. 
● | Allows businesses the possibility of recouping their initial investment within the first months, thereby creating a positive cash flow stream utilizing the recommended business model. 
● | Promotes and advertises the doctors locations via The Time Machine Program’s social media updates which continues to bring in new patients. 
● | Laser has pinpoint accuracy. 
● | Easy to use and operate. 
● | No incision, no redness, no swelling, no burning, no pain and no downtime. 
● | Consistent “results-pleased” patients. 
● | Increased referrals from patients. 
● | Helps patients with various pain issues: joint, neck & back, muscle & body, TMJ & jaw, sports injuries, nerve pain, neuropathy, arthritis, carpal tunnel inflammatory issues. The patient’s doctor will make the final determination on what and how to treat. 

Brand Awareness
 
The Company plans to aggressively develop a social media, internet and advertising presence to target medical professionals, as well as their perspective patients. In addition, our Sales Directors will implement and oversees a sales team to increase our exposure to patients and healthcare providers. A major component of the business roll-out includes attending major industry trade shows, where we believe we will be able to reach a high number of professionals and distribution partners. These conferences will include those in the medical industry, the beauty and spa industry, as well as alternative healthcare practices.

Medifirst plans to, when funds are available, to file for FDA 510K clearance for its Green Laser. This Laser will be used and marketed for the aesthetics market which will include non-invasive and minimally-invasive cosmetic procedures for anti-aging, wrinkles, hyper-pigmentation, skin spots, acnes and various skin related concerns. Minimally-invasive and non-invasive treatments within the cosmetic procedures industry have been, in our belief, a booming area within the laser healthcare market. The Green Laser is perfectly positioned, in our judgement, as a Laser that will be in demand especially for healthcare professionals looking for an affordable entry point into the laser market. Many of our target clients’ patients are willing to pay out-of-pocket for what we believe are highly effective, affordable and shorter-recovery-time treatments. Although we believe some applications of our future lasers may be covered by some health insurance plans, and have reimbursable provider codes, our Laser will appeal to those healthcare professionals that typically charge their patients directly for services rendered.
 
The Market
 
Laser Systems
 
According to Global Industry Analysts Inc., the global market for medical laser systems is forecast to reach US$10 billion by 2020, driven by the aging population’s shift towards minimally invasive procedures, and growing awareness over the safety of laser-based procedures. Other factors driving growth in the market include rise in age related illnesses, increasing consumer spending on non-invasive cosmetic surgeries, developments in Diode Lasers & Fiber Lasers, and expanding applications in cardiology. The United States represents the largest market worldwide.
 
Medical laser systems refer to devices that emit monochromatic light beam in a highly concentrated form for excision of tissues. Lasers are being extensively used for diagnosis and treatment of a number of diseases that were previously difficult to treat or were known to lead to significant complications using traditional procedures. Most common applications of medical laser systems include ophthalmology, oncology, cosmetic surgery, cardiology, dentistry, gynecology, dermatology, gastroenterology, diagnostics and urology. Major factors driving growth in the market include aging population, increasing focus on aesthetics, and growing awareness over the benefits of laser procedures. Rising disposable incomes particularly in developing markets and growing adoption of laser-based treatments are also factors driving growth in the market.
 
Surgical lasers represent the largest product market, supported by developments in diode lasers and fiber lasers, and well-established applications in cardiology. Growing prevalence of cardiovascular diseases is therefore expected to provide sturdy opportunities for growth in the coming years. Growing focus on aesthetics, rise in obesity, and preference for non-surgical cosmetic procedures are fueling demand for aesthetic lasers. Advancements in laser technology are resulting in lesser pain and higher surgical accuracy thereby encouraging volume growth in laser procedures. Dedicated lasers with varying active media have been developed to meet specific needs of each procedure. These advancements enable physicians to provide more favorable and noticeable results to patients, with the added benefit of quicker post surgery recovery. Non-invasive methods of body contouring and fat reduction are also gaining popularity, supported by advancements such as Transdermal Focused Ultrasound, Monopolar RF, Low level laser, High Intensity Focused Ultrasound (HIFU) and Cryolipolysis.
 
Laser and Light-Based Aesthetic Treatments
 
A laser is a device that creates and amplifies a coherent beam of light generally of one wavelength or a narrow band of wavelengths. Lasers have been used for medical and aesthetic applications since the 1960s. Intense pulsed light technology was introduced in the 1990s and uses flash lamps, rather than lasers, to generate incoherent light of multiple wavelengths, often referred to as a broadband of wavelengths. Both lasers and intense pulsed light devices can emit high energy light over varying pulse durations or time intervals.
 
By producing intense bursts of concentrated light, lasers and other light-based technologies selectively target melanin in hair follicles and pigmented lesions, hemoglobin in blood vessels and vascular lesions, water surrounding collagen in or below the dermis, ink in tattoos or fat tissue below the dermis. When the target absorbs sufficient energy, it becomes heated and/or mechanically disrupted to cause a biological reaction useful for treatment. The degree to which energy is absorbed in the skin depends upon the skin structure targeted—e.g., hair follicle or blood vessel—and the skin type—e.g., light or dark. Different types of lasers and other light-based technologies are needed to effectively treat the spectrum of skin types and conditions. As a result, an active aesthetic practice may require multiple laser or other light-based systems in order to offer treatments to its entire client base.

Different types of lasers are currently used for a wide range of aesthetic treatments. Each type of laser operates at its own wavelength, measured in nanometers, which corresponds to a particular emission and color in the light spectrum. The most common lasers used for non-invasive aesthetic treatments are:
 

● | Pulse dye lasers—may produce light of various wavelengths. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Alexandrite lasers—produce a near infrared invisible light that functions with high power at a deep penetration depth. 
● | CO2 lasers—produce infrared invisible light that creates a deep ablation region. 
● | Diode lasers—may produce light of various wavelengths. 
● | Erbium: glass lasers—produce a near infrared invisible light that functions at a deep penetration depth. 
● | Er:YAG lasers—produce a near infrared invisible light that creates a shallow ablation region. 
● | Nd:YAG lasers—produce a near infrared invisible light that functions over a wide range of penetration depths or when frequency doubled produce a green light that functions at a shallow penetration depth. 

 
In addition to selecting the appropriate wavelength for a particular application, laser and other light-based treatments require an appropriate balance among three other parameters to optimize safety and effectiveness for aesthetic treatments:
 

● | Energy level—the amount of light emitted to heat the target; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Pulse duration—the time interval over which the energy is delivered; and 
● | Spot size—the diameter of the energy beam. 

Aesthetic Market 
 
Medical Insight, an independent industry research and analysis firm, stated that in 2015 total sales of products in the professional aesthetic product market exceeded $7.6 billion and predicted that the sales would expand by 11.0% per year to $12.8 billion through 2020.
 
Key factors affecting growth rates in the markets for aesthetic treatment procedures and aesthetic laser equipment include:
 

● | improvements in overall economic conditions and an expanding physician base; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | the aging population of industrialized countries and the amount of discretionary income of the “baby boomer” demographic segment; 
● | greater anticipated growth in Asian markets; 
● | the desire of many individuals to improve their appearance; 
● | the development of technology that allows for safe and effective aesthetic treatment procedures as well as advances in treatable conditions; 
● | the impact of managed care and reimbursement on physician economics, which has motivated physicians to establish or seek to expand their elective aesthetic practices with procedures that are paid for directly by patients; and 
● | reductions in cost per procedure, which has attracted a broader base of clients and patients for aesthetic treatment procedures.

Non-Traditional Physician Customers
 
Aesthetic treatment procedures that use lasers and other light-based equipment have traditionally been performed by dermatologists and plastic surgeons. Based on published membership information from professional medical organizations, there are approximately 6,000 dermatologists and plastic surgeons in the United States. A broader group of physicians in the United States, including primary care physicians, obstetricians and gynecologists, have incorporated aesthetic treatment procedures into their practices. These non-traditional physician customers are largely motivated to offer aesthetic procedures by the potential for a reliable revenue stream that is unaffected by managed care and government-payor reimbursement economics. We believe that there are a significant number of these potential non-traditional physician customers in the United States, representing a market opportunity to be addressed by laser developers, manufacturers and suppliers like Medifirst. Medical Insight has even reported that some physicians are electing to open medical spas, often adjacent to their conventional office space, where they perform aesthetic procedures in an environment designed to feel less like a health care facility.
Competition
 
Many laser devices and procedures currently used are invasive, which results in the potential of side effects and/or down time (redness, puffiness, swelling) after the laser treatments. Additionally, many of these procedures are very expensive for both the health care professionals that must purchase the expensive laser technology and for the patients paying for procedure costs of the laser treatments. The purchase price of such lasers range from $16,000 to $50,000 (plus) per unit and the laser units are typically big, stationary machines.
 
Because we anticipate the price range of The Time Machine Lasers to be approximately $9,995 or less, each healthcare professional will be paying less than traditionally spend on laser units and will have the flexibility to pass along the lower cost of the machinery onto their patients.
 
We believe, the Time Machine Lasers will be very well received in the Laser Industry as we are not aware of other handheld laser devices for pain that have the capabilities of our TM Lasers.
 
The industry is subject to intense competition for minimally-invasive and non-invasive aesthetic procedures. We compete against products and procedures using laser, light-based, RF, ultrasound, and other aesthetic energy modalities for skin resurfacing and rejuvenation, skin tightening, body contouring, and acne treatment from companies such as Alma Laser, Clarisonic, Cutera, Cynosure, Erchonia, Lumenis, Lutronic, Palomar, PhotoMedex, MedixSysteme, Real Aesthetics, Sciton, Sybaritic, Syneron, Tria Beauty, Ulthera, Ultrashape, Zeltiq and Zeno.
 
In addition, we compete against existing and emerging treatment alternatives such as cosmetic surgery, chemical peels, microdermabrasion, Botox®, dermal fillers, collagen injections and both prescription and over the counter acne medications. Some of these alternative procedures require a lower initial capital investment by a practitioner and, in the area of acne, consumers have a wide variety of treatment choices. Some of our competitors are also publicly-traded companies and others have longer operating histories than we do. Many of them may enjoy several competitive advantages, including: greater name recognition, more extensive intellectual property protection, established relationships with practitioners and other health care professionals, established domestic and international distribution networks, broader product lines and existing treatment systems, and the ability to offer rebates or bundle products to offer higher discounts or incentives, greater experience in conducting research and development, manufacturing, clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approval for products and marketing approved products, greater financial resources for product development, sales and marketing and patent litigation. Competition among providers of laser, light-based, ultrasound, and other energy devices for the aesthetic market is characterized by intensive sales and marketing activities.
 
Government Regulation
 
Our products are medical devices that are subject to extensive regulation by government authorities in the United States and in other countries and jurisdictions, including the European Union, or EU. These governmental authorities regulate the marketing and distribution of medical devices in their respective jurisdictions. The regulations cover the entire life cycle of the product, including the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, packaging, storage, labeling, advertising and promotion of the devices. In addition, post-approval monitoring and reporting, as well as import and export of medical devices, are subject to various regulatory requirements. The processes for obtaining regulatory approvals or clearances in the United States and in foreign countries and jurisdictions, including the EU, along with subsequent compliance with applicable statutes and regulations, require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources.
Regulations Relating to Products and Manufacturing
 
Our products and research and development activities are regulated by numerous governmental authorities, principally the FDA and corresponding state and foreign regulatory agencies. Any medical device or cosmetic we manufacture and/or distribute will be subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA. The FDCA, and other federal and state laws and regulations govern the pre-clinical and clinical testing, design, manufacture, use, labeling and promotion of medical devices. Product development and approval for medical devices within this regulatory framework takes a number of years and involves the expenditure of substantial resources.

Failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements can result in fines, injunctions, civil penalties, recalls or seizures of products, total or partial suspensions of production, refusals by the U.S and foreign governments to permit product sales and criminal prosecution.
 
Review and Clearance of Medical Devices in the United States
 
The FDA strictly regulates medical devices in the United States. Under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, a medical device is defined as an instrument, apparatus, implement, machine, contrivance, implant, in vitro reagent, or other similar or related article, including a component part or accessory, which is, among other things: intended for use in the diagnosis of disease or other conditions, or in the cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease, in man or other animals; or intended to affect the structure or any function of the body of man or other animals, and which does not achieve its primary intended purposes through chemical action within or on the body of man or other animals and which is not dependent upon being metabolized for the achievement of any of its primary intended purposes. Unless an exemption applies, a new medical device may not be marketed in the United States unless it has been cleared by the FDA through filing of a 510(k) premarket notification, or 510(k), or approved by the FDA pursuant to a premarket approval application, or PMA. Both premarket notifications and premarket approval applications, when submitted to the FDA, must be accompanied by a user fee, unless exempt.
 
The information that must be submitted to the FDA in order to obtain clearance or approval to market a new medical device varies depending on how the medical device is classified by the FDA. Medical devices are classified into one of three classes depending on the level of control necessary to assure the safety and effectiveness of the device. Class I devices have the lowest level or risk associated with them, and are subject to general controls, including labeling, premarket notification and adherence to the QSR. Class II devices are subject to general controls and special controls, including performance standards. Class III devices, which have the highest level of risk associated with them, are subject to most of the aforementioned requirements as well as to premarket approval. Most Class I devices and some Class II devices are exempt from the 510(k) requirement, although manufacturers of these devices are still subject to registration, listing, labeling and QSR requirements.
 
510(k) Premarket Notification
 
A 510(k) is a premarket submission made to the FDA to demonstrate that the proposed device to be marketed is at least as safe and effective (i.e., substantially equivalent) to another legally marketed device, or predicate device, that did not require premarket approval. In evaluating a 510(k), the FDA will determine whether the device has the same intended use as the predicate device, and (a) has the same technological characteristics as the predicate device, or (b) has different technological characteristics, and (1) the data supporting substantial equivalence contains information, including appropriate clinical or scientific data, if deemed necessary by the FDA, that demonstrates that the device is as safe and as effective as a legally marketed device, and (2) does not raise different questions of safety and effectiveness than the predicate device. Most 510(k)s do not require clinical data for clearance, but the FDA may request such data.
 
The FDA seeks to review and act on a 510(k) within 90 days of submission, but it may take longer if the agency finds that it requires more information to review the 510(k). If the FDA concludes that a new device is not substantially equivalent to a predicate device, the new device will be classified in Class III and the manufacturer will be required to submit a PMA to market the product. With the enactment of the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act, or the FDASIA, a de novo pathway is directly available for certain low to moderate risk devices that do not qualify for the 510(k) pathway due to the absence of a predicate device.

Healthcare Law and Regulation
 
Healthcare providers, physicians and third-party payors may play a role in the recommendation and selection of medical devices for patients. Arrangements with providers, consultants, third-party payors and customers are subject to broadly applicable fraud and abuse, anti-kickback, false claims laws, reporting of payments to physicians and teaching physicians and patient privacy laws and regulations and other healthcare laws and regulations that may constrain business and/or financial arrangements. Restrictions under applicable federal and state healthcare laws and regulations, include the following:

● | The federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons and entities from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, paying, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, any good or service, for which payment may be made, in whole or in part, under a federal healthcare program such as Medicare and Medicaid; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | The federal civil and criminal false claims laws, including the Civil False Claims Act, and civil monetary penalties laws, which prohibit individuals or entities from, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, to the federal government, claims for payment that are false, fictitious or fraudulent or knowingly making, using or causing to made or used a false record or statement to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government. 
● | The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, which created additional federal criminal laws that prohibit, among other things, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or making false statements relating to healthcare matters; 
● | HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, and their respective implementing regulations, including the Final Omnibus Rule published in January 2013, which impose obligations, including mandatory contractual terms, with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information; 
● | The federal false statements statute, which prohibits knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing ·or covering up a material fact or making any materially false statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services; 
● | The federal transparency requirements known as the federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act, under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care Education Reconciliation Act, or the Affordable Care Act, which requires certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies to report annually to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, information related to payments and other transfers of value made by that entity to physicians and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members; and 
● | Analogous state and foreign laws and regulations, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws, which may apply to healthcare items or services that are reimbursed by non-governmental third-party payors, including private insurers. 

 
State and foreign laws also govern the privacy and security of health information in some circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts.
 
Intellectual Property
 
Patents, Proprietary Technology and Trademarks
 
Our success depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain proprietary protection for our products, technology and know-how, to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of others and to prevent others from infringing our proprietary rights. Our policy is to seek to protect our proprietary position by, among other methods, filing U.S. and foreign trademark applications, and, when it becomes applicable, patent applications related to our proprietary technology, inventions and improvements that are important to the development of our business. However, currently, our rights to our proprietary technology are in-licensed rights and not a technology that we could directly patent. We also rely on trademarks, trade secret and copyright laws and contractual restrictions to protect our proprietary technology. These legal protections afford only limited protection for our technology. We currently own the trademark for “The Time Machine Program”.
