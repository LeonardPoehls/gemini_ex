ITEM 1. BUSINESS
SUMMARY
 
Applied Minerals, Inc. (the “Company” or “Applied Minerals” or “we” or “us”) (OTCQB: AMNL) owns the Dragon Mine in central Utah. From the mine we extract, process, or have processed by a third party, halloysite clay and iron oxide for sale to a range of end markets. We market the minerals directly and through distributors and also under a profit-sharing agreement with the Kaolin business unit of BASF Corp. (“BASF”).
 
We also engage in research and development and frequently work collaboratively with potential customers, consultants, distributors, and a third party processor (BASF) to process and enhance our halloysite clay products to improve the performance of our customers’ existing and new products.
 
Halloysite 
 Our halloysite clay, which we market under the DRAGONITE™ trade name, is an aluminosilicate mineral with a hollow tubular shape. DRAGONITE can utilize halloysite’s shape, high surface area, and reactivity to add significant functionality to a number of applications.
Iron Oxide
 Our iron oxide, which we market under the AMIRON™ trade name, is a high purity product. We have sold it as an absorbent for hydrogen sulfide gas contained in natural gas.
Sales
 In 2017, we recorded revenues of $2,444,677, of which $1,011,654 was related to sales of DRAGONITE to 13 customers and $1,433,023 was related to sales of AMIRON to one customer.  
 
Characterization of the Mineralization
 
Over the last nine years, the Company has expended significant resources, including commissioning a resource study, to determine the amount, character and mineabilitiy of the mineralization of the deposits at the Dragon Mine.
 
Classification for SEC Purposes
 
The Company is classified as an “exploration stage” company for purposes of Industry Guide 7 of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) Under Industry Guide 7, companies engaged in significant mining operations are classified into three categories, referred to as “stages” - exploration, development, and production. Exploration stage includes all companies that do not have established reserves in accordance with Industry Guide 7. Such companies are deemed to be “in the search for mineral deposits.” Notwithstanding the nature and extent of development-type or production-type activities that have been undertaken or completed, a company cannot be classified as a development or production stage company unless it has established reserves in accordance with Industry Guide 7. The mineralization indicated by the resource study (described below) we have commissioned cannot be classified as a reserve for purpose of Industry Guide 7. 
 
In 2016, SEC proposed rules to modernize property disclosures for mining companies. The mineralization indicated by the resource study would not qualify as a reserve under the proposed rules.

Processing Capability
 
In 2017, we entered into a tolling agreement with BASF under which BASF will use a water-based system that will process the Company’s halloysite in accordance with the Company’s specifications, which can include eliminating impurities, such as iron oxide, and surface treating the halloysite to achieve desired effects and functionality. 
 
We have a mineral processing plant with a capacity of up to 45,000 tons of mineralization per annum for certain applications.
 
Additionally, the Company has a second processing facility with a capacity of up to 10,000 tons per annum that is dedicated to processing its halloysite resource.  Such facility can process halloysite using a dry-based, micronizing system. This dry-based system does not eliminate impurities such as iron oxide as effectively as wet processing but is useful in situations where wet processing in not necessary
 
Distribution Channels
 
The Company markets and sells its products directly and through distributors. The Company’s CEO spends a significant amount of his time on sales, marketing and product development. The Director of Sales focuses on the marketing of the Company’s DRAGONITE products. The Company also uses several leading distribution organizations, E.T. Horn, Brandt Technologies, LLC, and Azelis to market its products. The Company has a non-exclusive distribution agreement with a distributor for Taiwan and an exclusive agreement with a distributor for Japan.
 
In October, 2017, we entered into a supply agreement with the Kaolin business unit of BASF (“Supply Agreement”). The Supply Agreement provides that the Company will sell up top 15,000 tons of halloysite to BASF per year and BASF may process and/or treat and will have an exclusive license (a) to sell halloysite on a worldwide basis for use within the following third party markets: (i) paints and coatings; (ii) inks; (iii) rubbers (excludes flame retardant and wire and cable applications); (iv) adhesives; (v) paper, and (vi) ceramic honeycomb catalytic substrates and (b) to sell halloysite to other business units of BASF.
 
INFORMATION ABOUT THE COMPANY
 
Applied Minerals, Inc. (OTCQB: AMNL) owns the Dragon Mine from which we can extract halloysite clay and iron oxide, which we then process or have processed and sell. We also engage in research and development and frequently work collaboratively with potential customers, consultants, distributors, and BASF to engineer and enhance our halloysite clay and iron oxide products to improve the performance of our customers’ existing and new products.
 
The Dragon Mine is a 267-acre property located in central Utah, approximately 70 miles south of Salt Lake City, Utah.
 
We market our halloysite clay-based line of products under the tradename DRAGONITE. We market our iron oxide line of products under the tradename AMIRON.
 
Halloysite is mined and marketed by other companies, primarily by a French company, Imerys, which owns the other major halloysite mine, which is located in New Zealand.  The halloysite from that mine is sold primarily for use in ceramics and tableware.   When new management came into the Company in 2009, new management decided to focus on new, premium-priced uses of halloysite.  Those premium-priced uses had been, and continue to be, identified typically in published research.  Because the Company is primarily dedicated to new, advanced uses of halloysite that would permit the Company to charge premium prices, the sales and marketing process is one that often takes an extended period of time. 
 
The Company acquired the Dragon Mine primarily to exploit the mine’s halloysite resources. At the time that the Dragon Mine was acquired, it was assumed that the iron oxide mineralization would be useful only for steelmaking. Given historical price conditions and our method of mining (underground), sales of iron oxide for steelmaking would often not be economic and at best would yield marginal or low profits.  The iron oxide resource at the Dragon Mine has a high content of Fe2O3, The iron oxide is of high chemical purity, possesses high surface area, fine grains, dispersability, good tinting strength, enhanced color saturation, low color variation, and a low level of heavy metals content, high surface area (25 m2/g – 125 m2/g and reactivity. In November, 2015, the Company entered into an agreement to supply a customer its AMIRON iron oxide on an exclusive basis for a period of five years. The exclusivity provision is limited to the specialized catalyst application of the Customer and enables Applied Minerals to sell its iron oxide products for use in other technical applications that are not competitive with the Customer's intended field of use. An initial purchase order of $5.0 million of AMIRON products has been received and is to be delivered over the course of 18 months with deliveries commencing on December 1, 2015. Upon expiration of the initial 5-year term, the Customer has an option to extend the exclusive supply agreement for an additional 5 years by issuing an $8.0 million purchase order to be delivered over the course of the subsequent twenty-four months. In June, 2017, the Company fulfilled the $5.0 million purchase order.
 
INFORMATION ABOUT THE DRAGON MINE
 
History of the Dragon Mine
 
The Dragon Mine was first mined in the third quarter of the 19th century and has since been mined by various owners and operators. It was mined for iron oxide from the late nineteenth century until approximately 1931 and it was mined for halloysite clay from approximately 1931 to 1976. From 1949 to 1976, the halloysite was sold for use as a petroleum cracking catalyst. A fire closed the mine in 1976. No mining took place from 1976 until 2001, at which point the Company leased the property with an option to buy it. The Company purchased the property in 2005.
 
Prior to a change in management in 2009, the Company did relatively little to categorize the mineralization at the Dragon Mine or to identify and exploit markets for the minerals. Since new management was installed in 2009, the Company has used and proposes to continue to use a consulting geologist to categorize the mineralization at the Dragon Mine and management has identified, developed and exploited premium-priced markets for halloysite and iron oxide.

Resource Study of the Dragon Mine’s Mineralization
 
There are two areas of the Dragon Mine minesite at which mining can be conducted and they are referred to as the “Dragon Pit” and the “Western Area.” In addition, there are five surface piles on the site, mineralization that was left by prior operators.
 
The Company has commissioned an ongoing study (and updates in 2013 and 2016) of the mine’s “resources” that was conducted using the standards of the JORC Code of the Australasian Code for Reporting Exploration Results, Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves. We will refer to the 2013 update as the “study.” The study is not deemed final in that the Company intends to commission a further update of the study. The new update will consider new information, including the ability to wet process halloysite to eliminate substantially all iron oxide in halloysite products.  Some halloysite with higher iron oxide content was not included in the halloysite tonnage set forth in the study because a sufficient amount of iron oxide could not be processed out using dry processing.  The new update will also reevaluate data and conclusions, in part because of the consultant’s need, in connection with the most recent update, to use of a different modeling system to determine tonnage which was not reconciled with the earlier results set forth in the study, and to resolve certain problems and inconsistencies. As a result, there will be changes to the information in the study that are discussed below. So the information below should be considered preliminary. 
 
The study indicated the existence of JORC “resources” of halloysite clay and iron oxide. Under the JORC Code, resource tonnages are reported in situ (in the ground) and are not net of (i) diluting materials or (ii) losses due to the mining process or (iii) losses due to processing to turn the mined mineral into saleable product.
 
A JORC resource is defined is a “mineral deposit in such form, grade…and quantity that there are reasonable for prospects for eventual economic extraction.”   There are three levels of resources, differentiated by the level of confidence and they are in ascending order of confidence: inferred, indicated, and measured.
 
A JORC indicated resource is an economic mineral occurrence that has been sampled (from locations such as outcrops, trenches, pits and boreholes) to a point where an estimate has been made, at a reasonable level of confidence, of its contained metal, grade, tonnage, shape, densities, and physical characteristics. 
 
A JORC measured resource is an indicated resource that has undergone enough further sampling to be an acceptable estimate, at a high degree of confidence, of the grade, tonnage, shape, densities, physical characteristics and mineral content of the mineral occurrence.
 
The results of the study are summarized below. The tonnages in the Dragon Pit, the Western Area, and in Surface Pile #1 are considered “measured” resources. The tonnages in Waste Piles #2 - #5 are considered “indicated” resources.

The study was performed by Ian Wilson, PhD, our consulting geologist. Dr. Wilson supervised our drilling program. Dr. Wilson is a member of iom3 (Institute of Materials, Minerals and Mining of the UK). From 1974 to 2001 Mr. Wilson worked with English China Clays/Imerys mainly as a geologist and with management roles in Brazil, Spain, Sweden and China. Since his retirement in 2001, he has worked as an independent consultant dealing with many industrial minerals including halloysite.
 
Dragon Pit
 
The Dragon Pit area covers 4.95 acres and is mined underground. There are three separate types of mineralized material in the Dragon Pit area.
 
The first type is comprised of clay with a relatively high concentration of halloysite. The study reports the Dragon Pit contains 629,650 tons of this type of mineralized material.
 
The second type is comprised of a mix of kaolinite, illite-smectite, and halloysite clays.  The study reports the clays constitute approximately 73.4% of this mineralization, of which halloysite constitutes approximately 42.6%, kaolinite constitutes 19.2% and illite-smectite constitutes 11.6% and the Dragon Pit contains 565,575 tons of this type of mineralized material.
 
The third type of mineralized material found in the Dragon Pit is comprised of iron-bearing materials.  This mineralization contains goethite and hematite. When dehydrated, goethite be comes hematite. We will sometimes refer to either mineral or combinations of the minerals as “iron oxide.”  The study reports the mineralization is approximately 94% iron oxide, of which goethite accounts for 69.7% and hematite 24.3%; there exist separate areas of goethite and hematite but the majority of the iron-bearing mineralization in the Dragon Pit exists as a goethite-hematite mix; and the Dragon Pit contains 3,254,989 tons of this iron-bearing mineralization.
 
The table below describes the clay resource in the Dragon Pit:
 

Area | Acres | Resource Status | Clay (Tons) | Clay Type | Average Clay Content (%)
-----------+-------+-----------------+-------------+------------+-------------------------
 | | | 629,650 | Pure | Halloysite | Kaolinite | Illite-Smectite | Total
Dragon Pit | 4.95 | Measured | | Halloysite | 94.0 | N/A | N/A | 94.0 
 | | | 565,575(1) | Mixed | 42.6 | 19.2 | 11.6 | 73.4 


(1) | The amount is the result of processing to < 45 microns, which eliminated 27% of the starting unprocessed material. The material would have to be wet processed so that the >5 micron material can be removed. The pure halloysite is used in our DRAGONITE products. Mixed clays are not used in our DRAGONITE products.

The table below describes the iron oxide resource in the Dragon Pit:
 

 | | Resource | Iron Oxide | Average Content (%)
-----------+-------+----------+------------+--------------------
Area | Acres | Status | (Tons) | Hematite | Goethite | Fe2O3 | LOI (1)
Dragon Pit | 4.95 | Measured | 3,254,989 | 29.16 | 63.54 | 77.47 | 10.09 


(1) | LOI, or Loss on Ignition, is a test used in inorganic analytical chemistry, particularly in the analysis of minerals. It consists of strongly heating ("igniting") a sample of the material at a specified temperature, allowing volatile substances (such as water) to escape, until its mass ceases to change. LOI is generally described as the amount of moisture and trapped volatile oxides or carbonates present in the ore.

Western Area 
 
The Western area covers 6.33 acres and is mined underground.  There are two different types of mineralization in the Western Area.
 
One type of mineralization in the Western Area is clay. It is comprised primarily of a mix of kaolinite, illite-smectite, and halloysite clays. The study reports the clay content of this mineralization is approximately 71.4%, of which kaolinite constitutes 47.2%, illite-smectite constitutes 17.5%, and halloysite constitutes 6.7% and the Western Area contains 862,903 tons of this type of mineralization.
 
The other type of mineralization is iron bearing.  The Western Area contains goethite and hematite. The study reports the mineralization is approximately 96% iron oxide on a mineralogical basis, of which hematite accounts for 75.9% and goethite 20.1%; there exist separate areas of goethite and hematite but the majority of the iron-bearing mineralization in the Western Area exists as a goethite-hematite mix; and the Western Area contains 797,717 tons of this iron-bearing mineralization.
 
The table below describes the information from the study of the clay resource in the Western Mine:
 

 | | Resource | | Average Clay Content (%)
-------------+-------+----------+-------------+-------------------------
Area | Acres | Status | Clay (tons) | Halloysite | Kaolinite | Ilite-Smectite | Total
Western Area | 6.3 | Measured | 862,903 | 6.7 | 47.2 | 17.5 | 71.3 

 
The Western Mine clays are not used in our DRAGONITE products.
 
The table below describes the information from the study about the iron oxide resource in the Western Mine.
 

Area | Acres | Resource Status | Iron (tons) | Average Content of Hematite, Goethite, Fe2O3 and LOI (%)
-------------+-------+-----------------+-------------+---------------------------------------------------------
 | | | | Hematite | Geothite | Fe2O3 | LOI 
Western Area | 6.33 | Measured | 797,717 | 60.03 | 30.7 | 8.29 | 8.04

Surface Piles
 
There are five surface piles that were created during the mining of halloysite clay between 1949 and 1976 when the Dragon Mine’s halloysite resource was mined and sold for use as a petroleum cracking catalyst.  Any clay that contained more than a minimal threshold amount (~ 2%) of iron oxide was not usable for petroleum cracking and was discarded into one of five surface piles.
 
The following sets forth information from the study about the mineralized material by surface pile:
 

 | | | Average Clay Content (%)
-------------+-----------------+-------------+-------------------------
Surface Pile | Resource Status | Clay (Tons) | Halloysite | Kaolinite | Illite-Smectite | Total
1 | Measured | 154,500 | 41.8 | 25.8 | 9.4 | 77.0 
2 | Indicated | 127,100 | 19.0 | 33.6 | 27.8 | 80.4 
3 | Indicated | 298,900 | 9.8 | 30.7 | 24.9 | 65.4 
4 | Indicated | 33,280 | 13.2 | 31.7 | 31.8 | 76.7 
5 | Indicated | 144,100 | 13.5 | 31.8 | 36.5 | 81.8 

 
These clays are not used in our DRAGONITE products.
 
In addition to the surface pile material described above, there is a surface pile of approximately 20,000 tons of mined iron oxide on the surface of the Dragon Mine property.
 
Resource Development/Exploration Drilling Expenses
 
In 2017 and 2016, the Company spent $508,861 and $981,045, respectively, on exploration and resource development.

More Detailed Description of the Mineralization at the Dragon Mine
 
Clays.Kaolinite and halloysite are clays and members of the kaolin group of clays. Both are aluminosilicate clays. Kaolinite and halloysite are essentially chemically identical, but have different morphologies (shapes). Kaolinite typically appears in plates or sheets. Halloysite, in contrast, typically appears in the shape of hollow tubes. On average, the halloysite tubes have a length in the range of 0.5 - 3.0 microns, an exterior diameter in the range of 50 - 70 nanometers and an internal diameter (lumen) in the range of 15 - 30 nanometers. Formation of halloysite occurs when kaolinite sheets roll into tubes due to the strain caused by a lattice mismatch between the adjacent silicon dioxide and aluminum oxide layers. Halloysite is non-toxic and natural, demonstrating high biocompatibility without posing any risk to the environment.
 
Kaolinite is one of the world’s most common minerals. U.S. production in 2016 was approximately 6.1 million tons.
 
Halloysite is, by comparison, a rarer mineral and we believe worldwide production is less than 25,000 tons.
 
Illite refers to a group of clays that includes hydrous micas, phengite, brammalite, celadonite, and glauconite. Illite clays are common and large amounts are produced each year.
 
Smectite refers to a group of clays that includes montmorillonite, bentonite, nontronite, hectorite, saponite and sauconite. Smectite clays are common clay and large amounts are produced each year.
 
Iron Oxide.Hematite is the mineral form of iron oxide, which exists in a range of colors, including black to steel or silver-gray and brown to reddish brown, or red.
 
Geothite is an iron hydroxide oxide mineral, which exists in a range of colors, including yellowish to reddish to dark brown. If goethite is sufficiently heated to eliminate its contained water, it is transformed into hematite.
 
Mixtures of goethite and hematite are the color brown.
 
STATUS OF THE COMPANY FOR SEC REPORTING PURPOSES
 
The Company is classified as an “exploration stage” company for purposes of Industry Guide 7 of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
 
Under Industry Guide 7, companies engaged in significant mining operations are classified into three categories, referred to as “stages” - exploration, development, and production.
 
Exploration stage includes all companies engaged in the search for mineral deposits (that is, reserves), which are not in either the development or production stage. In order to be classified as a development or production stage company, the company must have already established reserves. Notwithstanding the nature and extent of development-type or production-type activities that have been undertaken or completed, a company cannot be classified as a development or production stage company unless it has established reserves.
 
Under Industry Guide 7, a “reserve” is “that part of a mineral deposit which could be economically and legally extracted or produced at the time of the reserve determination.” Generally speaking, a company may not declare reserves, unless, among other requirements, a competent professional engineer conducts a detailed engineering and economic study and prepares a “bankable” or “final” feasibility study that “demonstrates that a mineral deposit can be mined profitably at a commercial rate.”
 
The Company has commissioned an ongoing study described above that was conducted using the standards of the JORC Code of the Australasian Code for Reporting Exploration Results, Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves.
 
That study indicated the existence of JORC “resources” of halloysite clay and iron oxide. A JORC resource is defined is a “mineral deposit in such form, grade and quantity that there are reasonable for prospects for eventual economic extraction,” a lower standard than that used for a final feasibility study. Among the differences between resources determined under the JORC Code and Industry Guide 7 is that under the JORC Code resources are measured in situ and are not net of diluting materials and mining losses, while under Industry Guide 7, the reserves are net of diluting materials and mining losses. The results of the study do not qualify as reserves under Industry Guide 7. 
 
Despite the fact that the Company has not established reserves for purposes of Industry Guide 7, the Company has mined, processed and sold, and intends to continue to mine, process, and sell halloysite clay and iron oxide from the Dragon Mine.
 
A consequence of the absence of reserves under Industry Guide 7 is that the mining company, such as the Company, is deemed to lack an objective basis to assert that it has a deposit with mineralization that can be economically and legally extracted or produced and sold to produce revenue.
 
In 2016, SEC proposed rules to modernize property disclosures for mining companies. The mineralization indicated by the resource study would not qualify as a reserve under the proposed rules.

PROCESSING CAPABILITIES
 
In 2017, we entered into a tolling agreement with BASF Corp. (“BASF”) under which BASF will “wet process” the Company’s halloysite to comply with the Company’s specifications, which can include eliminating impurities such as iron oxide and surface treating to achieve desired effects and functionality.  The tolling agreement provides for tolling up to 15,000 tons per year. The Company has been orally assured that such capacity can be increased as reasonably necessary.
 
We have a mineral processing plant with a capacity of up to 45,000 tons per annum for certain applications. Currently, this facility is dedicated to processing our iron oxide resource. Typically, the processing involves a preliminary step of crushing the iron oxide in a crusher and a further step of pulverizing the iron oxide in our Hosokawa Alpine table roller mill. Depending on the customer’s specifications, if we need to only process the iron oxide through the preliminary step of crushing, our production capacity would be significantly greater than 45,000 tons per annum. 
 
Additionally, the Company has a second processing facility with a capacity of up to 10,000 tons per annum that is dedicated to its halloysite resource.  Such facility can “dry process” halloysite using a micronizing system.  Dry processing does not eliminate impurities such as iron oxide as effectively as wet processing but is useful in situations where wet processing in not necessary.  
 
In October, 2017, we entered into a supply agreement with the Kaolin business unit of BASF Corp. pursuant to which BASF can purchase up to 15,000 tons per year, which it can process and sell into five specified markets. As of April 17, 2018, no sales of halloysite have been made by the Kaolin business unit.
 
MINING AND PRODUCTION ACTIVITY IN 2017 AND 2016
 
The following table discloses for the twelve (12) months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively (i) the number of tons of halloysite clay and iron oxide extracted by the Company from the Dragon Mine and (ii) the number of tons of finished product produced by the Company:

 | 2017 | 2016 
-------------------------+-------+-------
Tons extracted | | 
Halloysite clay | 407 | 35 
Iron oxide | 8,704 | 8,235 
Products produced (tons) | | 
Halloysite clay | 200 | 107 
Iron oxide | 8,962 | 22,428

CUSTOMERS
 
DRAGONITE
 
At the current time, the Company is selling halloysite on an ongoing basis to four (4) customers that have commercialized products using halloysite. One customer uses our DRAGONITE halloysite to manufacture a specialty zeolite, which is used in an adsorption application, two customers use it as a binder within a ceramic application and one customer uses it as a nucleating agent in a plastic injection molding. .  Several prospective customers are conducting either commercial-scale trials or field trials for an array of products that are expected to use DRAGONITE as a functional additive. In 2017, we sold $1,011,654 of DRAGONITE.
 
There is no certainty that any potential customer that tests our products will actually become a customer on an ongoing basis. The Company currently is cautiously optimistic that additional customers will become ongoing customers with additional revenue in 2018 or early 2019.
 
AMIRON
 
In 2017, we sold $1,365,816 of iron oxide to one customer. As of the date of this report, the Company is not selling iron oxide on a continuing basis to customers.

Under the terms of the Supply Agreement, each party is reimbursed from the proceeds of sale for its direct costs and the Company and the BASF Kaolin business unit equally share the profits of any sales of halloysite by the Kaolin business unit.  The Supply Agreement has an initial term of three years and automatically renews unless one party terminates.  As of April 17, 2018, no sales of halloysite have been made by the Kaolin business unit.
 
APPLICATION MARKETS
 
The following discusses the markets into which the Company is marketing its DRAGONITE and AMIRON products. It cannot be assured that we will be successful penetrating these markets. The discussion does not discuss certain problems of selling into these markets, which are discussed elsewhere in the Business section or in the Risk Factors section.
DRAGONITE
 
The following is a description of the application markets in which the Company has commercial customers for halloysite-based DRAGONITE products:
 
Molecular Sieves and Catalysts.
 
Molecular Sieves.  DRAGONITE™ is a binder to zeolite crystals to enhance a molecular sieve’s productivity in critical functions such as drying of natural gas and air, separation of liquid from product streams, and separation of impurities from a gas stream. DRAGONITE possesses a dispersion ability that allows it to combine with the zeolite crystals without attracting to them or reducing the rate of diffusion of liquids and gases. DRAGONITE’s fine particle size, porosity, and thermal stability also ensure that adsorbates diffuse rapidly through the sieve without affecting the adsorbent blend’s physical properties.
Catalysts. DRAGONITE can be used as a catalyst and catalyst support for the hydrotreatment and hydrodemetalation of hydrocarbonaceous feedstocks.  DRAGONITE can be used to remove impurities such as metals, sulfur, nitrogen, and asphaltenes. Crude oil petroleum must be processed in order to make it into gasoline and other fuels.. Catalytic cracking involves the addition of a catalyst to speed up the cracking. The reactive nature of halloysite lends itself to being a catalyst especially for high sulfur oil. Halloysite can also be used as a support for catalysts, which are applied to the halloysite as a coating.
 
Halloysite from the Dragon Mine was mined and processed as a catalyst for petroleum cracking from 1949 to 1976.
 
Flame Retardant Additives

Flame retardant additives are widely used in flammable and flame resistant plastics and are found in electronics, building insulation, polyurethane foam, and wire and cable. 
 
Plastic manufacturers typically mix or load a small amount of flame retardant into plastic to lower the risk of flammability of their products. We believe that DRAGONITE can be used as a partial replacement for Alumina Trihydrate (ATH) and Magnesium Hydroxide (MDH) in certain applications and as a synergist to ATH and MDH in other applications.

At typical loadings, ATH and MDH can adversely affect certain mechanical properties of plastics. We believe that DRAGONITE, in conjunction with ATH and MDH, exhibits a synergistic performance. Our research and development indicates that DRAGONITE can be used to replace 50% - 75% of antimony trioxide (ATO) in plastic without affecting flame retardancy, retaining the same rating under UL 94, the Standard for Safety of Flammability of Plastic Materials for Parts in Devices and Appliances testing. 
 
We believe that in certain applications the use of DRAGONITE instead of other fire retardant products may allow a manufacturer to use less fire retardant and may, in addition, may enable the manufacturer to reduce the weight of the manufactured part. DRAGONITE-XR does not release its naturally bound water until 400°C, making it suitable for polymers processed under extreme conditions.
 
Other clays compete in the markets for partially replacing ATH, MDH, and ATO.
 
Binders for Ceramics
 
DRAGONITE is an effective binder for traditional ceramic products (any of various hard, brittle, heat-resistant and corrosion-resistant materials made by shaping and then firing a nonmetallic mineral, such as clay, at a high temperature). Binders are substances that improve the mechanical strength of green ceramic bodies so they can pass through production steps before firing without breakage. We believe that DRAGONITE, when used as a binder, also effectuates an improvement in the casting rate of the ceramic manufacturing process. This would equate to an increase in manufacturing efficiency.
Nucleation of Polymers; Reinforcement of Polymers.
 
Nucleation. Plastics and polymers are composed of long molecular chains that form irregular, entangled coils in a melted resin, the phase in which a resin is liquid and its molecules can move about freely. In semi-crystalline polymers, the chains rearrange upon freezing and form partly ordered regions. Examples of semi-crystalline polymers are polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP), Nylon 6 and Nylon 6-6. Crystallization of a polymer occurs as a result of nucleation, a process that starts with small, nanometer-sized domains upon which the polymer chains arrange in an orderly manner to develop larger crystals. The overall rate of crystallization of a polymer be can increased by a nucleating agent. In plastic molding processes, especially in injection molding, the plastic part must remain in the mold until crystallization is complete (freezing). To the extent that crystallization is accelerated, the time in the mold can be reduced, thereby resulting in productivity enhancement. We believe that DRAGONITE added to a resin at a loading of just 1% can significantly speed up the process of crystallization.
 
We believe DRAGONITE can be effective as a nucleating agent for both polyethylene and polypropylene.
 
Reinforcement Fillers. Many plastics are reinforced with a filler to enhance the mechanical properties of a polymer. Reinforced plastics, in certain instances, can compete with stiffer materials like metal while also offering an opportunity to reduce the weight of a manufactured part (“light-weighting”).
 
We believe that the utilization of DRAGONITE as a reinforcing filler can result in the improvement of one or more mechanical properties of a polymer such as modulus (the measure of how well a polymer resists breaking when pulled apart), strength (the measure of the stress needed to break a polymer), and impact resistance (the measure of a polymer’s resistance when impacted by a sharp and sudden stress).
 
Paints and Coatings
 
Halloysite has been shown to improve the adhesion and impact resistance properties of polymer-based paints and coatings. Additionally, halloysite has been shown to significantly improve the corrosion resistance of paints and coatings over synthetic anti-corrosion agents. Paints and coatings are one of the application markets on which BASF is focused as part of its Supply Agreement with the Company.
Other Opportunities.  Other potential markets that present opportunities for halloysite but as to which the Company does not have commercial customers include cement (halloysite may increase tensile strength more than twice the increase in compressive strength while reducing permeability), batteries (the silicon material in halloysite, which is an aluminasilicate, may be extracted from halloysite and used in anode in lithium ion batteries and halloysite may be used in electrolyte in batteries), and controlled release carrier in cosmetics and in other applications.
AMIRON
 
The AMIRON line of natural iron oxide-based products can be used in technical and pigmentary application markets.
 
During part of 2015, 2016 and part of 2017, the Company sold AMIRON under a supply agreement for $5 million for use as an adsorbent to remove contaminants and moisture from gases. Under the supply agreement, the Company may not sell, at least until 2020, iron oxide to others to remove hydrogen sulfide from liquids or gases).  If the other party to the transaction orders at least $5 million, the restriction of sales can be extended another five years.

THE SALES PROCESS
 
The Company sells its products using employees, agents, and distributors, selling on a global basis.
 
DRAGONITE
 The Company markets its DRAGONITE into two general types of application markets.

The first type is a market in which halloysite has not been previously used, or is to be used as an additive in substitution for another additive, to enhance a functionality of an application.  This type of market requires a number of steps to be completed before a sale can be consummated.  Like any new material that will be incorporated into a commercial manufacturing process, a significant amount of testing must be performed by a customer before DRAGONITE can be incorporated into a manufacturing process and a product. Sales of this type often require working with the potential customers’ existing formulations, which can vary from potential customer to potential customer. 
 
Working with a potential customer could include identifying a solution, such as (i) surface coating or (ii) when to introduce DRAGONITE into the formulation or (iii) the conditions under which it should be introduced or (iv) changes, deletions, additions, or substitutions involving other elements of the customer’s formulation. Without the customer’s collaboration in identifying a solution, DRAGONITE could be unsuccessful in achieving the customer’s goals. This process can take an extended period of time (years in the case of discoloration of polymers as a result of the introduction of DRAGONITE) and, in some cases, there is no solution. In this type of market, price can be an important consideration and in some cases, we are not able to compete.
 
The second type of market is one in which halloysite clay is currently being used in traditional application markets.  Within these established markets, we believe our DRAGONITE products often offers an enhanced value proposition with respect to purity and other properties sought by customers, although in some cases DRAGONITE’s purity and/or other properties may not be required or useful.  The pricing of our products relative to those of our competitors, however, will always be a significant factor in determining our ability to penetrate these markets.
 
AMIRON
 The Company encounters the same types of challenges marketing AMIRON, as it faces in marketing DRAGONITE. In particular, the Company must compete on price and quality in relation to competitive materials.
 
It cannot be assured that we will be successful in further penetrating these markets.
 
RESEARCH, DEVELOPMENT AND TESTING
 
The Company’s research and development and testing efforts are focused on the continued creation of commercial applications for our halloysite-based products and our iron oxides. The Company conducts s research and development efforts internally and occasionally through consultants. The Company is using BASF to conduct research. The Company also conducts product research and development collaboratively with distributors, customers and potential customers.
 
In 2017 and 2016, the Company spent $170,407 and  $139,539 for testing and research, respectively.
 
TRADEMARKS AND PATENTS
 
We have trademarked the name DRAGONITE and AMIRON. We believe these trademarks are important to the successful marketing of our product offering.

The Company does not believe that such regulations, including environmental regulations, have or will adversely affect the Company’s business or have a material impact on capital expenditures, earnings and competitive position of the Company.
 
We carry a Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) license (#4202383) for the Dragon Mine and report as required to MSHA. The Company is subject to extensive regulation and periodic inspections by the Mine Safety and Health Administration, which was created by the Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977. The regulations generally are designed to assure the health and safety of miners and our mine is periodically inspected by MSHA.  The Company does not believe that such regulations have or will materially adversely affect the Company’s business or have a material impact on capital expenditures, earnings and competitive position of the Company.
 
The clays that the Company mines, including halloysite, may contain various levels of crystalline silica when mined.  Crystalline silica is considered a hazardous substance under regulations promulgated by the U.S. Occupational Health and Safety Administration (OSHA) and U.S. Mine Health and Safety Administration (MSHA) and as a result is subject to permissible exposure limits (PELs), both in the mine and at the workplaces of our customers.  The Company is required to provide Safety Data Sheets (SDS) at the mine and accompanying sales of products to customers. The Company must also apply hazard warning to labels of containers of the product sold to customers, if levels of crystalline silica are present above specified thresholds.  Kaolin and halloysite are also subject to PELs.
