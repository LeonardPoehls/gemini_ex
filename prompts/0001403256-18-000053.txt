Item 1. Business
Business Description
Oz Management is a leading global institutional alternative asset manager, with approximately $33.3 billion in assets under management as of February 1, 2018. We provide asset management services through our funds, which pursue a broad range of global investment opportunities, and by developing new, carefully considered investment products. We also offer customized solutions within and across our product platforms to help our fund investors meet their investment objectives. Our funds invest across numerous asset classes and geographies, with a breadth we believe is offered by few alternative asset management firms. 
Our approach to asset management is based on the same fundamental elements that we have employed since Oz Management was founded in 1994. Our objectives are to create long-term value for our fund investors through a disciplined investment philosophy that focuses on delivering consistent, positive, risk-adjusted returns across market cycles. Our extensive experience, combined with the consistency of our approach to investing and managing risk, have been integral to the growth of our assets under management. We currently manage multi-strategy funds, dedicated credit funds, including opportunistic credit funds and Institutional Credit Strategies products, real estate funds and other alternative investment vehicles.
Multi-Strategy - Our multi-strategy funds combine global investment strategies, including long/short equity special situations, structured credit, corporate credit, convertible and derivative arbitrage, merger arbitrage and private investments. Our focus is on investing in value opportunities based on detailed, research-based analysis and thorough due diligence. Our multi-strategy funds allocate capital across strategies and geographies opportunistically based on market conditions and opportunities, with no predetermined capital allocations by strategy or asset class.
Credit - Our dedicated credit funds are comprised of opportunistic credit funds and our Institutional Credit Strategies products. Our opportunistic credit funds seek to generate risk-adjusted returns by capturing value in mispriced investments across disrupted, dislocated and distressed corporate, structured and private credit markets globally. Institutional Credit Strategies is our asset management platform that invests in performing credits via CLOs and other customized solutions for clients.
Real Estate - Our real estate funds generally make investments in commercial and residential real estate, including real property, multi-property portfolios, real estate-related joint ventures, real estate operating companies and other real estate-related assets. These funds typically seek to preserve capital and mitigate risk by limiting competitive bidding. The real estate funds focus on proprietary sourcing, discretion in deal selection, thorough due diligence, intensive asset management, multiple defined exit strategies and structured downside protection to seek and manage investments. 
We have built an experienced investment management team with a well-established presence in the United States, Europe and Asia. As of December 31, 2017, we had 483 employees worldwide, including 147 investment professionals, 22 active executive managing directors and 62 managing directors working from our offices in New York, London, Hong Kong, Mumbai, Beijing, Shanghai and Houston. Our New York office was established in 1994 and has been operational for over 20 years. Our London office, established in 1998, houses our European investment team. Our Hong Kong office, established in 2001, houses the majority of our Asian investment team. See “—Employees” for additional information on our global headcount.
We currently have two operating segments: the Oz Funds Segment and our real estate business. The Oz Funds Segment is currently our only reportable operating segment under GAAP and provides asset management services to our multi-strategy funds, dedicated credit funds and other alternative investment vehicles. Our real estate business, which provides asset management services to our real estate funds, is included within Other Operations, as it does not meet the threshold of a reportable operating segment under GAAP. See Note 16 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report for additional information regarding the Oz Funds Segment. 
Our primary sources of revenues are management fees, which are based on the amount of our assets under management, and incentive income, which is based on the investment performance of our funds. Accordingly, for any given 
5

period, our revenues will be driven by the combination of assets under management and the investment performance of our funds.
Our Assets Under Management 
Our assets under management are a function of the capital that is allocated to us by the investors in our funds and the investment performance of our funds. For additional information regarding assets under management, please see “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Assets Under Management and Fund Performance.”
Overview of Our Funds
Multi-Strategy
As of December 31, 2017, we managed approximately $13.7 billion of assets under management in our multi-strategy funds, or 42% of our total assets under management. The portfolio composition of our multi-strategy funds is determined by evaluating what we believe are the best market opportunities for each fund, consistent with each fund’s goal of generating consistent, positive, risk-adjusted returns while protecting fund investor capital. The primary investment strategies we employ in our multi-strategy funds include the following:

• | Long/short equity special situations, which consists of fundamental long/short and event-driven investing. Fundamental long/short investing involves analyzing companies and assets to profit where we believe mispricing or undervaluation exists. Event-driven investing attempts to realize gain from corporate events such as spin-offs, recapitalizations and other corporate restructurings, whether company specific or due to industry or economic conditions.


• | Structured credit, which involves investments in residential and commercial mortgage-backed securities and other asset-backed securities. This strategy also includes investments in collateralized loan obligations and collateralized debt obligations.


• | Corporate credit, which includes a variety of credit-based strategies, such as high-yield debt investments in distressed businesses and investments in bank loans and senior secured debt. Corporate credit also includes providing mezzanine financing and structuring creative capital solutions.


• | Convertible and derivative arbitrage, which takes advantage of price discrepancies between convertible and derivative securities and the underlying equity or other security. These investments may be made at multiple levels of an entity’s capital structure to profit from valuation or other pricing discrepancies. This strategy also includes volatility trades in equities, interest rates, currencies and commodities.


• | Merger arbitrage, which is an event-driven strategy involving multiple investments in entities contemplating a merger or similar business combination. This strategy seeks to realize a profit from pricing discrepancies among the securities of the entities involved in the event.


• | Private investments, which encompasses investments in a variety of special situations that seek to realize value through strategic sales or initial public offerings.

The Oz Master Fund, our global multi-strategy fund, opportunistically allocates capital between our investment strategies in North America, Europe and Asia based on market conditions and attractive investment opportunities. The Oz Master Fund generally employs every strategy and geography in which our funds invest and constituted approximately 35% of our assets under management as of December 31, 2017. Our other funds implement geographical- or strategy-focused investment programs. The investment performance for our other funds may vary from those of the Oz Master Fund, and that variance may be material. 
The chart below presents the composition, by strategy (excluding residual assets attributable to redeeming investors), of the Oz Master Fund as of January 1, 2018:
The table below sets forth, as of December 31, 2017, the net annualized return, volatility and Sharpe Ratio of the Oz Master Fund, the Oz Multi-Strategy Composite (as defined below), the S&P 500 Index and the MSCI World Index. This table is provided for illustrative purposes only. The performance reflected in the table below is not necessarily indicative of the future results of the Oz Master Fund. There can be no assurance that any fund will achieve comparable results. An investment in our Class A Shares is not an investment in any of our funds. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—An investment in our Class A Shares is not an alternative to an investment in any of our funds, and the returns of our funds should not be considered as indicative of any returns expected on our Class A Shares, although poor investment performance of, or lack of capital flows into, the funds we manage could have a materially adverse impact on our revenues and, therefore, the returns on our Class A Shares.”

(1) | The returns shown represent the composite performance of all feeder funds that comprise the Oz Master Fund since the inception of the Oz Master Fund on January 1, 1998 (collectively, the “Oz Master Fund Composite”). The Oz Master Fund Composite is calculated using the total return of all feeder funds net of all fees and expenses, except incentive income on Special Investments that could reduce returns on these investments at the time of realization, and includes the reinvestment of all dividends and other income. Performance includes realized and unrealized gains and losses attributable to Special Investments and initial public offering investments that are not allocated to all investors in the feeder funds. Investors that were not allocated Special Investments and/or initial public offering investments may experience materially different returns. The Oz Master Fund Composite is not available for direct investment.


(2) | The Oz Multi-Strategy Composite is provided as supplemental information to the Oz Master Fund Composite. The Oz Multi-Strategy Composite represents the composite performance of all accounts that were managed in accordance with our broad multi-strategy mandate that were not subject to portfolio investment restrictions or other factors that limited our investment discretion since our inception on April 1, 1994. Performance is calculated using the total return of all such accounts net of all investment fees and expenses of such accounts, except incentive income on unrealized gains attributable to Special Investments that could reduce returns in these investments at the time of realization, and the returns include the reinvestment of all dividends and other income. For the period from April 1, 1994 through December 31, 1997, the returns are gross of certain overhead expenses that were reimbursed by the accounts. Such reimbursement arrangements were terminated at the inception of the Oz Master Fund on January 1, 1998. The size of the accounts comprising the composite during the time period shown vary materially. Such differences impacted our investment decisions and the diversity of the investment strategies we followed. Furthermore, the composition of the investment strategies we follow is subject to our discretion and has varied materially since inception and is expected to vary materially in the future.


(3) | These comparisons show the returns of the S&P 500 Index (SPTR) and the MSCI World Index (GDDLWI) (collectively, the “Broader Market Indices”) against the Oz Master Fund Composite and the Oz Multi-Strategy Composite. These comparisons are intended solely for illustrative purposes to show a historical comparison of the Oz Master Fund Composite and the Oz Multi-Strategy Composite to the broader equity markets, as represented by the Broader Market Indices, and should not be considered as an indication of how the Oz Master Fund or the feeder funds will perform relative to the Broader Market Indices in the future. The Broader Market Indices are not performance benchmarks of the Oz Master Fund or the feeder funds. Neither the Oz Master Fund nor the feeder funds are managed to correlate in any way with the returns or composition of the Broader Market Indices, which are unmanaged. It is not possible to invest in an unmanaged index. You should not assume that there is any material overlap between the securities underlying the Oz Master Fund Composite or the Oz Multi-Strategy Composite and those that comprise the Broader Market Indices. The S&P 500 Index is an equity index owned and maintained by Standard & Poor’s, a division of McGraw-Hill, whose value is calculated as the free float-weighted average of the share prices of 500 large-capitalization corporations listed on the NYSE and NASDAQ. The MSCI World Index is a free float-adjusted market capitalization weighted index owned and maintained by MSCI Inc. that is designed to measure the equity market performance of developed markets. Returns of the Broader Market Indices have not been reduced by fees and expenses associated with investing in securities and include the reinvestment of dividends.


(4) | Standard Deviation is a statistical measure of volatility that measures the fluctuation of the monthly rates of return against the average return.


(5) | Sharpe Ratio represents a measure of the risk-adjusted return of the composite returns, or benchmark returns, as applicable. The Sharpe Ratio is calculated by subtracting the risk-free rate from the composite returns, or benchmark returns, as applicable, and dividing that amount by the standard deviation of the applicable returns. The risk-free rate of return used in computing the Sharpe Ratio is the one-month U.S. dollar London Interbank Offered Rate compounded monthly throughout the periods presented.

Credit
As of December 31, 2017, we managed approximately $15.7 billion of assets under management in our dedicated credit funds, or 48% of our total assets under management. Our dedicated credit funds are comprised of our opportunistic credit funds and our Institutional Credit Strategies products.
Opportunistic Credit Funds
As of December 31, 2017, we managed approximately $5.5 billion of assets under management in our opportunistic credit funds. Our opportunistic credit funds seek to generate risk-adjusted returns by capturing value in mispriced investments across disrupted, dislocated and distressed corporate, structured and private credit markets globally. As of December 31, 2017, assets under management in the Oz Credit Opportunities Master Fund, our global opportunistic credit fund, totaled $1.7 billion. The remainder of the assets under management in our opportunistic credit funds was comprised of various open-end and closed-end funds, as well as customized solutions structured to meet our fund investors’ needs. 
Institutional Credit Strategies 
As of December 31, 2017, we managed approximately $10.1 billion of assets under management in our Institutional Credit Strategies products. Institutional Credit Strategies is our asset management platform that invests in performing credits, including leveraged loans, high-yield bonds, private credit/bespoke financing and investment grade credit via CLOs and other customized solutions for clients.
Real Estate
As of December 31, 2017, we managed approximately $2.5 billion of assets under management in our real estate funds, or 8% of our total assets under management. Our real estate funds employ a situation-specific, opportunistic investment strategy, combined with a disciplined risk assessment process. These funds seek to diversify investments across geography, asset types and transaction structures to actively balance the portfolios within each of the funds. 
Other
Our other assets under management are comprised of funds that are generally strategy-specific, including our equity funds and other dedicated strategy funds. Our equity funds’ investment objective is to achieve consistent, absolute returns with low volatility primarily by seeking to exploit pricing inefficiencies in equity securities. Investment strategies include, but may not be limited to, merger arbitrage and long/short equity special situations.
Investment and Risk Management Process 
Our extensive experience and consistent approach to investing and risk management are essential to our strong performance history. Risk management is central to the investment process in all of our funds and the operations of our business. Our investment and risk management processes benefit from our dedicated and experienced investment teams operating out of our offices worldwide.
Our approach to investing and managing risk is defined by certain common elements: 

• | Proactive risk management with a focus on risk-adjusted returns. Our risk management practices are at the core of our investment philosophy, playing a crucial role in the asset allocation within our funds and in the operation of our business. Quantitative and qualitative analyses are utilized at both the individual position and total portfolio levels, and they have been integrated into our daily investment process. Our portfolio managers adhere to a research-driven, bottom-up approach to identifying and managing investments, using strong in-house investment and risk control teams. We employ a disciplined process to evaluate the risk-adjusted return on capital from existing and new investments.


• | Preservation of capital. Preservation of capital is our top priority and critical to delivering attractive returns to fund investors. Our goal is to preserve capital during periods of market decline and generate competitive investment performance in rising markets. We use sophisticated risk tools and active portfolio management to govern

9

exposures to market and other risk factors. We adhere strictly to each fund’s mandate and provisions with respect to leverage. We are knowledgeable about the risks of fund leverage, respectful of its limits, and judicious in our application.

• | Dynamic capital allocation. We allocate capital dynamically across strategies and geographies, consistent with the investment objectives for each of our funds. Opportunities and market conditions determine portfolio composition rather than preset, rigid capital allocations. At the same time, we maintain an active focus on portfolio diversification and risk management.


• | Expertise across strategies and geographies. We leverage our capital allocation philosophy and investment expertise across capital structures, industries and geographies to anticipate, identify and capitalize on investment trends across multiple disciplines. We have fostered a culture that allows us to allocate capital and evaluate investment opportunities on a firm-wide basis, focusing on the best ideas and opportunities available.

Our Fund Investors
We focus on developing and maintaining long-term relationships with a global base of institutional investors, which includes many of the largest, most sophisticated investors in the world. Excluding CLOs, we currently have over 1,200 investors in our funds, including pension funds, private banks, corporates and other institutions, fund-of-funds, foundations and endowments, and family offices and individuals. Our investors value our funds’ consistent performance history, our global investing expertise, our diverse investment strategies and our ability to develop investment capabilities in areas where we see opportunities evolve. As a result, a number of our fund investors invest in more than one of our funds.
Investments by our executive managing directors and employees collectively comprised approximately 11% of our total assets under management as of January 1, 2018. The single largest unaffiliated investor in our funds accounted for approximately 14% of our total assets under management as of January 1, 2018, and the top five unaffiliated fund investors accounted for approximately 31%. Approximately 27% of our investors were from outside North America as of January 1, 2018. These percentages, as well as those presented in the chart below, exclude assets under management in our CLOs, which are held by various types of investors. 
The following chart presents the composition of our fund investors by type across our funds as of January 1, 2018:

Competitive Environment
The asset management industry is intensely competitive, and we expect that it will remain so. We compete globally and regionally with other investment managers, including hedge funds, public and private investment firms, distressed debt funds, mezzanine funds and other CLO issuers, real estate development companies, business development companies, investment banks and other financial institutions worldwide. We compete for both investors in our funds and attractive investment opportunities based on a number of factors, including investment performance, brand recognition, business reputation, pricing, innovation, the quality of services we provide to the investors in our funds, the range of products we offer, and our ability to attract and retain qualified professionals in all aspects of our business while managing our operating costs. We face competitors that are larger than we are and have greater financial, technical and marketing resources. Certain of our competitors may continue to raise capital to pursue investment strategies that may be similar to ours, which may create additional competition for investment opportunities. In addition, some of these competitors may have higher risk tolerances or make different risk assessments than we do, or may have lower return thresholds, allowing them to consider a wider variety of investments and establish broader networks of business relationships. They may also be subject to different regulatory requirements, which may give them greater flexibility to pursue investment opportunities or attract new capital to their funds. For additional information regarding the competitive risks that we face, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—Competitive pressures in the asset management business could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.”
Competitive Strengths
Our business was built on certain fundamental elements that we believe are differentiating competitive strengths. They continue to define Oz Management today. As such, we view these elements as important to our ability to retain and attract new assets under management and, over time, increase our market share of new capital flows to the alternative asset management industry. 

• | Alignment of interests. We structure our business to align our executive managing directors’ and employees’ interests with those of the investors in our funds and our Class A Shareholders. Our 22 active executive managing directors and 62 managing directors have a compensation structure that includes receiving a portion of any bonus compensation in a combination of equity and/or deferred cash interests that vest over time. 


• | One-firm philosophy. Our “one-firm” philosophy creates a collaborative environment that encourages internal cooperation and the sharing of information, industry expertise and transaction experience gained over our history spanning over 20 years. We are a global organization and have fostered a culture that allows us to allocate capital and evaluate investment opportunities on a firm-wide basis, focusing on the best ideas and opportunities available. This collaborative approach emphasizes the success of our firm as a whole. 


• | Synergies among investment strategies. Our funds invest across a broad range of asset classes and geographies. Our investment professionals have extensive experience and many are specialized by strategy, industry sector or asset class. Our one-firm culture and collaborative approach encourage investment professionals to leverage the experience of our global investment teams across strategies and geographies. This creates synergies that add to our market insight, enhance our due diligence efforts, and improve our ability to identify attractive investment opportunities. 


• | Global presence. Our ability to opportunistically invest worldwide is an important element of diversifying our portfolios and managing risk. Our investment professionals operate from our various offices globally and have a long history of investing on an international scale. 


• | Experience. We have a history of hiring highly talented and experienced employees across all areas of our business, and developing them into senior roles as managing directors and executive managing directors. The depth and breadth of experience of our senior management team enables us to source, structure, execute and monitor a broad range of investments worldwide. 


• | Focus on infrastructure. Since our firm’s inception, we have focused on building a robust infrastructure with an emphasis on strong financial, operational and compliance-related controls. As of December 31, 2017, of the firm’s 84 active executive managing directors and managing directors, 34 are dedicated to our global infrastructure, reinforcing our commitment to this important part of our business. As a public company, we are required to identify and document key processes and controls, which are subject to independent review. Additionally, we have 

11

added a number of independent, third-party processes to our fund operations that provide independent information to our fund investors. 

• | Transparency. We believe that our fund investors should be provided with qualitative and quantitative information about our investment process, operational procedures and portfolio exposures in order to understand and evaluate our investment performance. We provide our fund investors with comprehensive reporting about each portfolio on a regular basis, and our senior management team and portfolio managers regularly meet with them to address their questions. 

Our Structure
Och-Ziff Capital Management Group LLC
Och-Ziff Capital Management Group LLC is a publicly traded holding company, and its primary assets are ownership interests in the Oz Operating Group entities, which are held indirectly through two intermediate holding companies, Oz Corp and Oz Holding. We conduct our business through the Oz Operating Group. Och-Ziff Capital Management Group LLC currently has two classes of shares outstanding: Class A Shares and Class B Shares.
Class A Shares.    Class A Shares represent Class A limited liability company interests in Och-Ziff Capital Management Group LLC. The holders of Class A Shares are entitled to one vote per share held of record on all matters submitted to a vote of our shareholders and, as of December 31, 2017, represent 35.8% of our total combined voting power. The holders of Class A Shares are entitled to any distribution declared by our Board of Directors, subject to any statutory or contractual restrictions on the payment of distributions and to any restrictions on the payment of distributions imposed by the terms of any outstanding preferred shares we may issue in the future. Additional Class A Shares are issuable upon exchange of Group A Units by our executive managing directors, as described below, and upon vesting of equity awards granted under our Amended and Restated 2007 Equity Incentive Plan or 2013 Incentive Plan.
Class B Shares.    Class B Shares have no economic rights and are not publicly traded, but rather entitle the holders of record to one vote per share on all matters submitted to a vote of our shareholders. The Class B Shares are held solely by our executive managing directors and provide them with a voting interest in Och-Ziff Capital Management Group LLC commensurate with their economic interest in our business in the form of Group A Units and Group P Units (assuming such Group P Units are participating). Each executive managing director holding Group A Units or Group P Units holds an equal number of Class B Shares. Upon a grant of Group A Units or Group P Units to an executive managing director, an equal number of Class B Shares is also granted to such executive managing director. Upon the exchange by an executive managing director of a Group A Unit or a Group P Unit for a Class A Share as further discussed below, the corresponding Class B Share is canceled.
As of December 31, 2017, the Class B Shares represent 64.2% of our total combined voting power. Our executive managing directors have granted an irrevocable proxy to vote all of their Class B Shares to the Class B Shareholder Committee, the sole member of which is currently Mr. Och, as it may determine in its sole discretion. As a result, Mr. Och is currently able to control all matters requiring the approval of our shareholders. This proxy will terminate on the “Transition Date,” which will be December 31, 2019, subject to extension if either (i) we have advised Mr. Och that he may not withdraw any capital that he may request to withdraw or (ii) Mr. Och is advised by counsel that he is prohibited by law from withdrawing any capital he has requested to withdraw. Following the termination of the proxy, each Class B Shareholder will be entitled to one vote per share held of record on all matters submitted to a vote of our shareholders.
Oz Operating Group Entities
We conduct our business through the Oz Operating Group. Historically, we have used more than one Oz Operating Group entity to segregate our operations for business, financial, tax and other reasons. We may increase or decrease the number of our Oz Operating Group entities and intermediate holding companies based on our views as to the appropriate balance between administrative convenience and business, financial, tax and other considerations.
The Oz Operating Group currently consists of OZ Management LP, OZ Advisors LP and OZ Advisors II LP. All of our interests in OZ Management LP and OZ Advisors LP are held through Oz Corp. All of our interests in OZ Advisors II LP are held through Oz Holding. Each intermediate holding company is the sole general partner of the applicable Oz Operating 
12

Group entity and, therefore, generally controls the business and affairs of such entity. The Oz Operating Group currently has the following units outstanding: Group A Units, Group B Units, Group D Units, Group P Units and Preferred Units.
The Preferred Units have an aggregate liquidation preference of $1,000 per Preferred Unit, plus accrued and unpaid distributions. After the Preferred Units liquidation preference is satisfied, the Group A Units and Group B Units have no preference or priority over other securities of the Oz Operating Group (other than the Group D Units and Group P Units to the extent described below) and, upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up, will be entitled to any assets remaining after payment of all debts and liabilities of the Oz Operating Group (together with the Group D Units and Group P Units to the extent described below).
Group A Units.    Our executive managing directors own 100% of the Group A Units, which as of December 31, 2017, represent a 58.5% equity interest in the Oz Operating Group. Currently, Group A Units are exchangeable for our Class A Shares at the discretion of the Exchange Committee (which consists of the members of the Partner Management Committee), on a one-for-one basis, subject to minimum retained ownership and vesting requirements by our executive managing directors and certain exchange rate adjustments for splits, unit distributions and reclassifications. Following the Transition Date, the Exchange Committee will be disbanded and thereafter, any of our executive managing directors may exchange his or her vested Group A Units over a period of two years in three equal installments.
Group B Units.    Each intermediate holding company holds a general partner interest and Group B Units in each Oz Operating Group entity that it controls. Our intermediate holding companies own 100% of the Group B Units, which, as of December 31, 2017, represent a 41.5% equity interest in the Oz Operating Group. The Group B Units are economically identical to the Group A Units held by our executive managing directors and represent common equity interests in our business, but are not exchangeable for Class A Shares and are not subject to vesting, forfeiture or minimum retained ownership requirements.
Group D Units.    Group D Units are non-equity, limited partner profits interests issued to certain executive managing directors that are only entitled to share in residual assets upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up, and become eligible to participate in any exchange right or tag along right in a change of control transaction to the extent that there has been a threshold amount of appreciation. The Group D Units convert into Group A Units to the extent we determine that they have become economically equivalent to Group A Units. Allocations to these interests are recorded within compensation and benefits in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss).
Group P Units.    On March 1, 2017, we issued Group P Units to certain executive managing directors. Group P Units entitle holders to receive distributions of future profits of the Oz Operating Group, and each Group P Unit becomes exchangeable for one Class A Share (or the cash equivalent), in each case upon satisfaction of certain service and performance conditions and at such time we determine that a Group P Unit has become economically equivalent to a Group A Unit. The Group P Units are entitled to share in residual assets upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up only to the extent that certain performance conditions are met and to the extent that there has been a threshold amount of appreciation. The terms of the Group P Units may be varied for certain executive managing directors. Group P Units grants are accounted for as equity-based compensation. See Note 10 to our consolidated financial statements included in this report for additional information regarding the terms of the Group P Units.
Preferred Units.  Preferred Units represent ownership interests in each of the Oz Operating Group entities and are held by certain executive managing directors (the “EMD Purchasers”). Preferred Units are a class of non-voting preferred equity interests in the Oz Operating Group entities with an aggregate liquidation preference of $1,000, plus accrued and unpaid distributions. See Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements included in this report for additional information regarding the terms of the Preferred Units.
Profit Sharing Interests (PSIs).  In 2016, we began to issue profit sharing interests (“PSIs”) to certain executive managing directors. PSIs are non-equity, limited partner profits interests in the Oz Operating Group that participate in distributions of future profits of the Oz Operating Group on a pro rata basis with the Oz Operating Group A, B and D Units and may share in residual assets upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up to the extent that there has been a threshold amount of appreciation subsequent to issuance of the PSIs. Subject to the discretion of the Chairman of the Partner Management Committee (the “PMC Chairman”), distributions on the PSIs are made in a combination of cash, Group D Units, RSUs or deferred cash interests (“DCIs”). PSIs are subject to forfeiture upon the departure of an executive managing director, and the 
13

number of PSIs held by an executive managing director can be increased or decreased each year at the PMC Chairman’s discretion.
Restricted Share Units
We grant Class A restricted share units (“RSUs”) as a form of compensation to our employees and executive managing directors. An RSU entitles the holder to receive a Class A Share, or cash equal to the fair value of a Class A Share at the election of the Board of Directors, upon completion of the requisite service period. All of the RSUs granted to date accrue dividend equivalents equal to the dividend amounts paid on our Class A Shares. To date, these dividend equivalents have been awarded in the form of additional RSUs that also accrue additional dividend equivalents. Delivery of dividend equivalents on outstanding RSUs is contingent upon the vesting of the underlying RSUs.
In 2018, we began granting Class A performance-based RSUs (“PSUs”). A PSU entitles the holder to receive a Class A Share, or cash equal to the fair value of a Class A Share at the election of the Board of Directors, upon completion of the requisite service period, as well as satisfying certain performance conditions based on achievement of targeted total shareholder return on Class A Shares. PSUs do not begin to accrue dividend equivalents until the requisite service period has been completed and performance conditions have been achieved. 
See Note 10 to our consolidated financial statements included in this report for additional information regarding RSUs and Note 17 for additional information regarding PSUs.

Regulatory Matters
Our business is subject to extensive regulation, including periodic examinations and regulatory investigations, by governmental and self-regulatory organizations in the jurisdictions in which we operate around the world. Since 1999, we have been registered with the SEC as an investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended, which we refer to as the “Advisers Act.” We are also a company subject to the registration and reporting provisions of the Exchange Act, and therefore subject to regulation and oversight by the SEC. As a company with a class of securities listed on the NYSE, we are subject to the rules and regulations of the NYSE. In addition, we are subject to regulation by the Department of Labor under the U.S. Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, which we refer to as “ERISA.” As a registered commodity pool operator and a registered commodity trading advisor, we are subject to regulation and oversight by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, which we refer to as the “CFTC.” We are also subject to regulation and oversight by the National Futures Association in the U.S., as well as other regulatory bodies.
Our European and Asian operations, and our investment activities around the globe, are subject to a variety of regulatory regimes that vary country by country, including the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority, the Securities and Futures Commission in Hong Kong and the Securities and Exchange Board of India. Currently, governmental authorities in the United States and in the other countries in which we operate have proposed additional disclosure requirements and regulation of hedge funds and other alternative asset managers.
See “Item 1A. Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—Extensive regulation of our business affects our activities and creates the potential for significant liabilities and penalties. Our reputation, business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially affected by regulatory issues,” “—Increased regulatory focus in the United States could result in additional burdens on our business” and “—Regulatory changes in jurisdictions outside the United States could adversely affect our business.”
Global Compliance Program
We have implemented a global compliance program to address the legal and regulatory requirements that apply to our company-wide operations. We have structured our global compliance program to address the requirements of each of our regulators, as described above, as well as the requirements necessary to support our global securities, commodities and loan trading operations.
16

Our compliance program includes comprehensive policies and supervisory procedures that have been designed and implemented to monitor compliance with these requirements. All employees attend mandatory annual compliance training to remain informed of our policies and procedures related to matters such as the handling of material non-public information, conflicts of interest and employee securities trading. Annual training specifically targeted at ensuring the understanding of and compliance with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the “FCPA”) and, as applicable, other foreign anti-corruption laws and regulations is mandatory for employees and executives responsible for structuring, supervising, ensuring compliance of and executing accounting functions for private deals, as well as for employees who interact with or provide reporting to investors. In addition to a robust internal compliance framework, we have strong relationships with a global network of local attorneys specializing in compliance matters to help us quickly identify regulatory changes and address compliance issues as they arise.
