BUSINESS.

BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT

Amazing Energy Oil and Gas, Co. is incorporated in the State of Nevada. Through its primary subsidiary, Amazing Energy, Inc., also a Nevada corporation, the Company operates its main business of exploration, development, and production of oil and gas in the Permian Basin of West Texas. On October 7, 2014, the Company entered into a change in control agreement with certain shareholders of Amazing Energy, Inc. The change in control agreement was the first step in a reverse merger process whereby the shareholders of Amazing Energy, Inc. would control about 95% of the shares of common stock of Amazing Energy Oil and Gas, Co., and Amazing Energy Oil and Gas, Co. would own 100% of the outstanding shares of common stock of Amazing Energy, Inc. This entire reverse merger process was completed in July of 2015.

Amazing Energy, Inc. (AEI), a wholly owned subsidiary of Amazing Energy Oil and Gas, Co., was formed in 2010 as a Texas corporation and re-domiciled to Nevada in 2011. The Company owns interests in oil and gas properties located in Texas. The Company is primarily engaged in the acquisition, exploration and development of oil and gas properties and the production and sale of oil and natural gas. Amazing Energy, LLC was formed in December 2008 as a Texas Limited Liability Company. In December of 2010, Amazing Energy, Inc. and Amazing Energy, LLC were combined as commonly controlled entities.

The following table shows the wholly owned subsidiaries of Amazing Energy Oil and Gas, Co. engaged in the oil, gas, and mining business:


Name of Subsidiary | State of Incorporation | Ownership Interest | | Principal Activity
Amazing Energy, Inc. | Nevada | | 100 | % | Oil and gas exploration, development, and products
Amazing Energy, LLC | Texas | | 100 | % | Ownership oil and gas leases 
Kisa Gold Mining, Inc. | Alaska | | 100 | % | Inactive 
Gulf South Securities, Inc. | Delaware | | 100 | % | Inactive 
Jilpetco, Inc. | Texas | | 100 | % | Operator and Oilfield services 


On July 31, 2016, we completed the acquisition of Gulf South Securities, Inc., a broker-dealer registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) and on August 31, 2016, we acquired Jilpetco, Inc., a Texas corporation engaged in the business of operating and providing oilfield services to oil and gas properties. GSSI has since allowed, on February 28, 2017, its FINRA registration to lapse and ceased operations and Amazing Energy intends to dissolve GSSI in fiscal year 2018.

Any bankruptcy, receivership or similar proceedings

There have been no bankruptcy, receivership or similar proceedings.

OUR BUSINESS

We are in the business of exploration, development, and production of oil and gas in the Permian Basin of West Texas. This basin, which is one of the major producing basins in the United States, is characterized by an extensive production history, a favorable operating environment, mature infrastructure, long reserve life, multiple producing horizons, enhanced recovery potential and a large number of operators. The Permian Basin is characterized by high oil and liquids rich natural gas, multiple vertical and horizontal target horizons, extensive production history, long-lived reserves and high drilling success rates. As of July 31, 2017 the Company has leasehold rights located within approximately 70,000 acres in Pecos County, Texas. We believe that our concentrated acreage position provides us with an opportunity to achieve cost, operating and recovery efficiencies in the development of our drilling inventory. Our activities are primarily focused on vertical development of the Queen formation over the Central Basin platform, which separates the Midland Basin from the Delaware Basin, all of which are part of the Permian Basin in West Texas. Additional drilling targets could include the Greyburg, San Andreas and Devonian zones. 

At July 31, 2017 our estimated net proved reserves were 495,968 barrels of oil equivalent (BOE). Important facts of our proved reserves at July 31, 2017 include: 

·
 62% oil and 38% gas;
 ·
 47% proved developed; 
 ·
 Reserve life of approximately 19.3 years; 
 ·
 Non-discounted future net cash flows of $9,722,900; 
 ·
 and PV-10 of $7,052,380

PV-10 is our estimate of the present value of future net revenues from proved oil, and gas reserves after deducting estimated production and ad valorem taxes, future capital costs and operating expenses, but before deducting any estimates for future income taxes. Estimated future net revenues are discounted at an annual rate of 10% to determine their present value. PV-10 is a financial measure that is not determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP), and generally differs from the Standardized Measure, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, because it does not include the effects of income taxes on future cash flows. PV-10 should not be considered as an alternative to the Standardized Measure, as computed under GAAP.

At July 31, 2017, we owned 23 oil and gas wells in the Permian Basin. During the fiscal year ended July 31, 2017, we produced 11,820 BOE (Net). Production for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2016 was 10,978 BOE (Net).

Our Business Strategy
 
-7-

We intend to increase the value of the Company by increasing reserves and production in a cost-efficient manner by pursuing the following strategies:

·
 Grow production and reserves by developing our oil-rich resource base. We intend to drill and develop our acreage base to maximize its value and resource potential. Through the conversion of our undeveloped reserves to developed reserves, we will seek to increase our production, reserves and cash flow while generating favorable returns on invested capital.

·
 Continue to drill and develop our shallow drilling play. We believe that our current acreage position (leasehold rights located within approximately 70,000 acres) provides us with the ability to continue to increase reserves and production by drilling shallow, low cost wells with joint venture investors. Typically, we strive to structure an offering in which participants/investors will carry (that is, bear the financial responsibility) for 25% of 8/8ths Working Interests. Each participant/investor is responsible for their pro-rata share of the Working Interest expenses. A Carried Working Interest is defined as a working interest which is expense-free through the stages of drilling, testing and completing a well to first sales or plugging and abandoning a well as a dry hole; participants/investors bear the portion of those costs and expenses attributable to the Carried Working Interest of the Company. The Company typically offers 75% of 8/8ths Working Interest in a drilling offering with a net revenue interest of 75%. The Carried Working Interest that the Company receives varies on the participation levels for each drilling offering. For example, if there is full participation, the Company will receive a 25% Carried Working Interest. The Company is constantly reviewing other potential acreage acquisitions, or other potential alliances with industry partners.

Our Competitive Strengths

We believe that the following strengths will help us achieve our business goals:

·
 Economically efficient drilling. Given the current relative low price for oil, we believe that we have a competitive advantage over higher risk, high cost, and deeper shale drilling operations. Most of our current wells are drilled and completed for around $275,000 or less at depths of around 2,000 feet.

·
 Oil rich resource base in one of North Americas leading resource plays. All our leasehold acreage is located in one of the most prolific oil plays in North America, the Permian Basin in West Texas. 

·
 Favorable operating environment. We have focused our drilling and development operations in the Permian Basin, one of the longest operating hydrocarbon basins in the United States, with a long and well-established production history and developed infrastructure. We believe that the geological and regulatory environment of the Permian Basin is more stable and predictable, and that we are faced with less operational risks in the Permian Basin as compared to emerging hydrocarbon basins.

·
 Experienced, incentivized and proven management team. Our management team has many years of experience in the oil and gas industry throughout Texas. Also, the Company strives to keep drilling, completion, operating expenses and general overhead to a minimum, while also providing quality services.

·
 High degree of operational control. We are the operator of 100% of our Permian Basin acreage. This operating control allows us to better execute on our strategies of enhancing returns through operational and cost efficiencies and increasing ultimate hydrocarbon recovery by seeking to continually improve our drilling techniques, completion methodologies and reservoir evaluation processes. Additionally, as the operator of all our acreage, we retain the ability to increase or decrease our capital expenditure program based on commodity price outlooks. This operating control also enables us to obtain data needed for efficient exploration of our prospects.

Markets and Customers

The revenues generated by our operations are highly dependent upon the prices, supplies and demand for oil and natural gas. Oil and natural gas are commodities, and therefore, we are subject to market-based pricing. Since our oil is sour, we receive somewhat less per barrel than the published WTI market prices, and since our natural gas is a sour gas, we are limited to selling through a sour gas transmission line and therefore are subject to a percent of proceeds (POP) gas contract with the purchaser. Overall, the prices that we receive for our oil and gas production depend on numerous factors beyond our control, including seasonality, the status of domestic and global economies, political conditions in other oil and gas producing countries, and the extent of domestic production and imports of oil.
 
-8-

For the fiscal year ended July 31, 2017, sales to Sunoco, Inc. and to Trans-Pecos Natural Gas Company, LLC accounted for approximately 79% and 21%, respectively, of our total sales of oil and gas.

Title to Properties

As is customary in the oil and natural gas industry, we initially conduct only a cursory review of the title to our properties. When we determine to conduct drilling operations on those properties, we conduct a thorough title examination and perform curative work with respect to significant defects prior to commencement of drilling operations. To the extent title opinions or other investigations reflect title defects on those properties, we are typically responsible for curing any title defects at our expense. We generally will not commence drilling operations on a property until we have cured any material title defects on such property. We have obtained title opinions on substantially all our producing properties and believe that we have satisfactory title to our producing properties in accordance with standards generally accepted in the oil and natural gas industry. Prior to completing an acquisition of producing oil and natural gas leases, we perform title reviews on the most significant leases and, depending on the materiality of properties, we may obtain a title opinion, obtain an updated title review or opinion or review previously obtained title opinions. Our oil and natural gas properties are subject to customary royalty and other interests, liens for current taxes and other burdens which we believe do not materially interfere with the use of or affect our carrying value of the properties.
Oil and Gas Leases

The typical oil and natural gas lease agreement covering our acreage position in Pecos County provides for the payment of royalties to the mineral owners for all oil and natural gas produced form any wells drilled on the leased premises. The lessor royalties and other leasehold burdens on our properties generally range from 20% to 25%, resulting in a net revenue interest to the Working Interest owners generally ranging from 75% to 80%.
Competition

The oil and natural gas industry is intensely competitive, and we compete with other companies that have greater resources. Many of these companies not only explore for and produce oil and natural gas, but also carry on midstream and refining operations and market petroleum and other products on a regional, national or worldwide basis. These companies may be able to pay more for productive oil and natural gas properties and exploratory prospects or to define, evaluate, bid for and purchase a greater number of properties and prospects than our financial or human resources permit. In addition, these companies may have a greater ability to continue exploration activities during periods of low oil and natural gas market prices. Our larger or more integrated competitors may be able to absorb the burden of existing, and any changes to, federal, state and local laws and regulations more easily than we can, which would adversely affect our competitive position. Our ability to acquire additional properties and to discover reserves in the future will be dependent upon our ability to evaluate and select suitable properties and to consummate transactions in a highly competitive environment. In addition, because we have fewer financial and human resources than many companies in our industry, we may be at a disadvantage in bidding for exploratory prospects and producing oil and natural gas properties. Further, oil and natural gas compete with other forms of energy available to customers, primarily based on price. These alternate forms of energy include electricity, coal and fuel oils. Changes in the availability or price of oil and natural gas or other forms of energy, as well as business conditions, conservation, legislation, regulations and the ability to convert to alternate fuels and other forms of energy may affect the demand for oil and natural gas.
Patents and Trademarks

The Company does not own, either legally or beneficially, any patents or registered trademarks.

Regulation

The oil and gas industry in the United States is subject to extensive regulation by federal, state and local authorities. At the federal level, various federal rules, regulations and procedures apply, including those issued by the U.S. Department of Interior, the U.S. Department of Transportation (the DOT) (Office of Pipeline Safety) and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (the EPA). At the state and local level, various agencies and commissions regulate drilling, production and midstream activities. For the state of Texas, the regulatory agency is the Texas Railroad Commission. These federal, state and local authorities have various permitting, licensing and bonding requirements. Various remedies are available for enforcement of these federal, state and local rules, regulations and procedures, including fines, penalties, revocation of permits and licenses, actions affecting the value of leases, wells or other assets, suspension of production, and, in certain cases, criminal prosecution. As a result, there can be no assurance that we will not incur liability for fines, penalties or other remedies that are available to these federal, state and local authorities. However, we believe that we are currently in material compliance with federal, state and local rules, regulations and 
 
-9-

procedures, and that continued substantial compliance with existing requirements will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position, cash flows or results of operations.

Transportation and Sale of Oil

Sales of crude oil are negotiated with Sunoco, Inc. via a crude oil purchase agreement which is subject to a month to month term, and a 30-day notice termination clause. The agreement specifies the pricing terms and transportation deductions, amongst other terms. Our sales of crude oil are affected by the availability, terms and cost of transportation.

Regulation of Production

Oil and gas production is regulated under a wide range of federal and state statutes, rules, orders and regulations. State and federal statutes and regulations require permits for drilling operations, drilling bonds and reports concerning operations. The state in which we operate, Texas, has regulations governing conservation matters, including provisions for the unitization or pooling of oil and gas properties, the establishment of maximum rates of production from oil and gas wells, the regulation of spacing, and requirements for plugging and abandonment of wells. Also, Texas imposes a severance tax on production and sales of oil, and gas within its jurisdiction. The failure to comply with these rules and regulations can result in substantial penalties. Our competitors in the oil and gas industry are subject to the same regulatory requirements and restrictions that affect our operations.
Environmental Matters and Regulation

Our oil and natural gas exploration, development and production operations are subject to stringent laws and regulations governing the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to environmental protection. Numerous federal, state and local governmental agencies, such as the EPA, issue regulations that often require difficult and costly compliance measures that carry substantial administrative, civil and criminal penalties and may result in injunctive obligations for non-compliance. These laws and regulations may require the acquisition of a permit before drilling commences; restrict the types, quantities and concentrations of various substances that can be released into the environment in connection with drilling and production activities; limit or prohibit construction or drilling activities on certain lands lying within wilderness, wetlands, ecologically or seismically sensitive and other protected areas; require action to prevent or remediate pollution (from current or former operations), such as plugging abandoned wells or closing pits; take action resulting in the suspension or revocation of necessary permits, licenses and authorizations; and/or require that additional pollution controls be installed and impose substantial liabilities for pollution resulting from our operations or related to our owned or operated facilities. Liability under such laws and regulations is often strict (i.e., no showing of fault is required) and can be joint and several. Moreover, it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third-parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the release of hazardous substances, hydrocarbons or other waste products into the environment. Changes in environmental laws and regulations occur frequently, and any changes that result in more stringent and costly pollution control or waste handling, storage, transport, disposal or cleanup requirements could materially adversely affect our operations and financial position, as well as the oil and natural gas industry in general. Our management believes that we are in substantial compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations and we have not experienced any material adverse effect from compliance with these environmental requirements. This trend, however, may not continue in the future.

Waste Handling. The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, as amended, and comparable state statutes and regulations promulgated thereunder, affect oil and natural gas exploration, development and production activities by imposing requirements regarding the generation, transportation, treatment, storage, disposal and cleanup of hazardous and non-hazardous wastes. With federal approval, the individual states administer some or all the provisions of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, sometimes in conjunction with their own, more stringent requirements. Although most wastes associated with the exploration, development and production of crude oil and natural gas are exempt from regulation as hazardous wastes under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, such wastes may constitute solid wastes that are subject to the less stringent non-hazardous waste requirements. Moreover, the EPA or state or local governments may adopt more stringent requirements for the handling of non-hazardous wastes or categorize some non-hazardous wastes as hazardous for future regulation. Indeed, legislation has been proposed from time to time in Congress to re-categorize certain oil and natural gas exploration, development and production wastes as hazardous wastes. Also, in December 2016, the EPA agreed in a consent decree to review its regulation of oil and gas waste. It has until March 2019 to determine whether any revisions are necessary. Any such changes in the laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our capital expenditures and operating expenses.

Administrative, civil and criminal penalties can be imposed for failure to comply with waste handling requirements. We believe that we are in substantial compliance with applicable requirements related to waste handling, and that we hold all necessary and up-to-date permits, registrations and other authorizations to the extent that our operations require them under such laws and 
 
-10-

regulations. Although we do not believe the current costs of managing our wastes, as presently classified, to be significant, any legislative or regulatory reclassification of oil and natural gas exploration and production wastes could increase our costs to manage and dispose of such wastes.

Remediation of Hazardous Substances. The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, as amended, which we refer to as CERCLA or the Superfund law, and analogous state laws, generally impose liability, without regard to fault or legality of the original conduct, on classes of persons who are considered to be responsible for the release of a hazardous substance into the environment. These persons include the current owner or operator of a contaminated facility, a former owner or operator of the facility at the time of contamination, and those persons that disposed or arranged for the disposal of the hazardous substance at the facility. Under CERCLA and comparable state statutes, persons deemed responsible parties are subject to strict liability that, in some circumstances, may be joint and several for the costs of removing or remediating previously disposed wastes (including wastes disposed of or released by prior owners or operators) or property contamination (including groundwater contamination), for damages to natural resources and for the costs of certain health studies. In addition, it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the hazardous substances released into the environment. During our operations, we use materials that, if released, would be subject to CERCLA and comparable state statutes. Therefore, governmental agencies or third parties may seek to hold us responsible under CERCLA and comparable state statutes for all or part of the costs to clean up sites at which such hazardous substances have been released.

Water Discharges. The Federal Water Pollution Control Act of 1972, as amended, also known as the Clean Water Act, the Safe Drinking Water Act, the Oil Pollution Act and analogous state laws and regulations promulgated thereunder impose restrictions and strict controls regarding the unauthorized discharge of pollutants, including produced waters and other gas and oil wastes, into navigable waters of the United States, as well as state waters. The discharge of pollutants into regulated waters is prohibited, except in accordance with the terms of a permit issued by the EPA or the state. Spill prevention, control and countermeasure plan requirements under federal law require appropriate containment berms and similar structures to help prevent the contamination of navigable waters in the event of a petroleum hydrocarbon tank spill, rupture or leak. The Clean Water Act and regulations implemented thereunder also prohibit the discharge of dredge and fill material into regulated waters, including jurisdictional wetlands, unless authorized by an appropriately issued permit. The EPA has also adopted regulations requiring certain oil and natural gas exploration and production facilities to obtain individual permits or coverage under general permits for storm water discharges. In addition, on June 28, 2016, the EPA published a final rule prohibiting the discharge of wastewater from onshore unconventional oil and gas extraction facilities to publicly owned wastewater treatment plants, which regulations are discussed in more detail below under the caption Regulation of Hydraulic Fracturing. Costs may be associated with the treatment of wastewater or developing and implementing storm water pollution prevention plans, as well as for monitoring and sampling the storm water runoff from certain of our facilities. Some states also maintain groundwater protection programs that require permits for discharges or operations that may impact groundwater conditions.

The Oil Pollution Act is the primary federal law for oil spill liability. The Oil Pollution Act contains numerous requirements relating to the prevention of and response to petroleum releases into waters of the United States, including the requirement that operators of offshore facilities and certain onshore facilities near or crossing waterways must develop and maintain facility response contingency plans and maintain certain significant levels of financial assurance to cover potential environmental cleanup and restoration costs. The Oil Pollution Act subjects owners of facilities to strict liability that, in some circumstances, may be joint and several for all containment and cleanup costs and certain other damages arising from a release, including, but not limited to, the costs of responding to a release of oil to surface waters.

Non-compliance with the Clean Water Act or the Oil Pollution Act may result in substantial administrative, civil and criminal penalties, as well as injunctive obligations. We believe we are in material compliance with the requirements of each of these laws.

Air Emissions. The federal Clean Air Act, as amended, and comparable state laws and regulations, regulate emissions of various air pollutants through the issuance of permits and the imposition of other requirements. The EPA has developed, and continues to develop, stringent regulations governing emissions of air pollutants at specified sources. New facilities may be required to obtain permits before work can begin, and existing facilities may be required to obtain additional permits and incur capital costs to remain in compliance. For example, on August 16, 2012, the EPA published final regulations under the federal Clean Air Act that establish new emission controls for oil and natural gas production and processing operations, which regulations are discussed in more detail below in Regulation of Hydraulic Fracturing. Also, on May 12, 2016, the EPA issued a final rule regarding the criteria for aggregating multiple small surface sites into a single source for air-quality permitting purposes applicable to the oil and gas industry. This rule could cause small facilities, on an aggregate basis, to be deemed a major source, thereby triggering more stringent air permitting processes and requirements. These laws and regulations may increase the costs of compliance for some facilities we own or operate, and federal and state regulatory agencies can impose administrative, civil and criminal penalties for 
 
-11-

non-compliance with air permits or other requirements of the federal Clean Air Act and associated state laws and regulations. We believe that we are in substantial compliance with all applicable air emissions regulations and that we hold all necessary and valid construction and operating permits for our operations. Obtaining or renewing permits has the potential to delay the development of oil and natural gas projects.

Climate Change. In December 2009, the EPA issued an Endangerment Finding that determined that emissions of carbon dioxide, methane and other greenhouse gases present an endangerment to public health and the environment because, according to the EPA, emissions of such gases contribute to warming of the earths atmosphere and other climatic changes. In May 2010, the EPA adopted regulations establishing new greenhouse gas emissions thresholds that determine when stationary sources must obtain permits under the Prevention of Significant Deterioration, or PSD, and Title V programs of the Clean Air Act. On June 23, 2014, inUtility Air Regulatory Group v. EPA, the Supreme Court held that stationary sources could not become subject to PSD or Title V permitting solely because of their greenhouse gas emissions. The Court ruled, however, that the EPA may require installation of best available control technology for greenhouse gas emissions at sources otherwise subject to the PSD and Title V programs. On August 26, 2016, the EPA proposed changes needed to bring the EPAs air permitting regulations in line with the Supreme Courts decision on greenhouse gas permitting. The proposed rule was published in the Federal Register on October 3, 2016 and the public comment period closed on December 2, 2016.

Additionally, in September 2009, the EPA issued a final rule requiring the reporting of greenhouse gas emissions from specified large greenhouse gas emission sources in the U.S., including natural gas liquids fractionators and local natural gas distribution companies, beginning in 2011 for emissions occurring in 2010. In November 2010, the EPA expanded the greenhouse gas reporting rule to include onshore and offshore oil and natural gas production and onshore processing, transmission, storage and distribution facilities, which may include certain of our facilities, beginning in 2012 for emissions occurring in 2011. In October 2015, the EPA amended the greenhouse gas reporting rule to add the reporting of greenhouse gas emissions from gathering and boosting systems, completions and workovers of oil wells using hydraulic fracturing, and blowdowns of natural gas transmission pipelines.

The EPA has continued to adopt greenhouse gas regulations applicable to other industries, such as its August 2015 adoption of three separate, but related, actions to address carbon dioxide pollution from power plants, including final Carbon Pollution Standards for new, modified and reconstructed power plants, a final Clean Power Plan to cut carbon dioxide pollution from existing power plants, and a proposed federal plan to implement the Clean Power Plan emission guidelines. Upon publication of the Clean Power Plan on October 23, 2015, more than two dozen states as well as industry and labor groups challenged the Clean Power Plan in the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals. On February 9, 2016, the Supreme Court stayed the implementation of the Clean Power Plan while legal challenges to the rule proceed. Because of this continued regulatory focus, future greenhouse gas regulations of the oil and gas industry remain a possibility. In addition, the U.S. Congress has from time to time considered adopting legislation to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases and almost one-half of the states have already taken legal measures to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases primarily through the planned development of greenhouse gas emission inventories and/or regional greenhouse gas cap and trade programs. Although the U.S. Congress has not adopted such legislation at this time, it may do so in the future and many states continue to pursue regulations to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Most of these cap and trade programs work by requiring major sources of emissions, such as electric power plants, or major producers of fuels, such as refineries and gas processing plants, to acquire and surrender emission allowances corresponding with their annual emissions of greenhouse gases. The number of allowances available for purchase is reduced each year until the overall greenhouse gas emission reduction goal is achieved. As the number of greenhouse gas emission allowances declines each year, the cost or value of allowances is expected to escalate significantly.

In December 2015, the United States participated in the 21st Conference of the Parties of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in Paris, France. The resulting Paris Agreement calls for the parties to undertake ambitious efforts to limit the average global temperature, and to conserve and enhance sinks and reservoirs of greenhouse gases. The Agreement went into effect on November 4, 2016. The Agreement establishes a framework for the parties to cooperate and report actions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Also, on June 29, 2016, the leaders of the United States, Canada and Mexico announced an Action Plan to, among other things, boost clean energy, improve energy efficiency, and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The Action Plan specifically calls for a reduction in methane emissions from the oil and gas sector by 40% to 45% by 2025.

Restrictions on emissions of methane or carbon dioxide that may be imposed could adversely affect the oil and natural gas industry. At this time, it is not possible to accurately estimate how potential future laws or regulations addressing greenhouse gas emissions would impact our business. It also remains unclear whether and how the results of the 2016 U.S. election could impact the regulation of greenhouse gas emissions at the federal and state level.


-12-

In addition, claims have been made against certain energy companies alleging that greenhouse gas emissions from oil and natural gas operations constitute a public nuisance under federal and/or state common law. As a result, private individuals may seek to enforce environmental laws and regulations against us and could allege personal injury or property damages. While our business is not a party to any such litigation, we could be named in actions making similar allegations. An unfavorable ruling in any such case could significantly impact our operations and could have an adverse impact on our financial condition.

Moreover, there has been public discussion that climate change may be associated with extreme weather conditions such as more intense hurricanes, thunderstorms, tornadoes and snow or ice storms, as well as rising sea levels. Another possible consequence of climate change is increased volatility in seasonal temperatures. Some studies indicate that climate change could cause some areas to experience temperatures substantially colder than their historical averages. Extreme weather conditions can interfere with our production and increase our costs and damage resulting from extreme weather may not be fully insured. However, at this time, we are unable to determine the extent to which climate change may lead to increased storm or weather hazards affecting our operations.

Regulation of Hydraulic Fracturing

Hydraulic fracturing is an important common practice that is used to stimulate production of hydrocarbons, particularly natural gas, from tight formations, including shales. The process, which involves the injection of water, sand and chemicals under pressure into formations to fracture the surrounding rock and stimulate production, is typically regulated by state oil and natural gas commissions. However, legislation has been proposed in recent sessions of Congress to amend the Safe Drinking Water Act to repeal the exemption for hydraulic fracturing from the definition of underground injection, to require federal permitting and regulatory control of hydraulic fracturing, and to require disclosure of the chemical constituents of the fluids used in the fracturing process. Furthermore, several federal agencies have asserted regulatory authority over certain aspects of the process. For example, the EPA has recently taken the position that hydraulic fracturing with fluids containing diesel fuel is subject to regulation under the Underground Injection Control program, specifically as Class II Underground Injection Control wells under the Safe Drinking Water Act.

In addition, the EPA plans to develop a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking by June 2018, which would describe a proposed mechanism - regulatory, voluntary, or a combination of both - to collect data on hydraulic fracturing chemical substances and mixtures. Also, on June 28, 2016, the EPA published a final rule prohibiting the discharge of wastewater from onshore unconventional oil and gas extraction facilities to publicly owned wastewater treatment plants. The EPA is also conducting a study of private wastewater treatment facilities (also known as centralized waste treatment, or CWT, facilities) accepting oil and gas extraction wastewater. The EPA is collecting data and information related to the extent to which CWT facilities accept such wastewater, available treatment technologies (and their associated costs), discharge characteristics, financial characteristics of CWT facilities, and the environmental impacts of discharges from CWT facilities.

On August 16, 2012, the EPA published final regulations under the federal Clean Air Act that establish new air emission controls for oil and natural gas production and natural gas processing operations. Specifically, the EPAs rule package includes New Source Performance standards to address emissions of sulfur dioxide and volatile organic compounds and a separate set of emission standards to address hazardous air pollutants frequently associated with oil and natural gas production and processing activities. The final rule seeks to achieve a 95% reduction in volatile organic compounds emitted by requiring the use of reduced emission completions or green completions on all hydraulically-fractured wells constructed or refractured after January 1, 2015. The rules also establish specific new requirements regarding emissions from compressors, controllers, dehydrators, storage tanks and other production equipment. The EPA received numerous requests for reconsideration of these rules from both industry and the environmental community, and court challenges to the rules were also filed. In response, the EPA has issued, and will likely continue to issue, revised rules responsive to some of the requests for reconsideration. On May 12, 2016, the EPA amended its regulations to impose new standards for methane and volatile organic compounds emissions for certain new, modified, and reconstructed equipment, processes, and activities across the oil and natural gas sector. On the same day, the EPA finalized a plan to implement its minor new source review program in Indian country for oil and natural gas production, and it issued for public comment an information request that will require companies to provide extensive information instrumental for the development of regulations to reduce methane emissions from existing oil and gas sources. These standards, as well as any future laws and their implementing regulations, may require us to obtain pre-approval for the expansion or modification of existing facilities or the construction of new facilities expected to produce air emissions, impose stringent air permit requirements, or mandate the use of specific equipment or technologies to control emissions.

Furthermore, there are certain governmental reviews either underway or being proposed that focus on environmental aspects of hydraulic fracturing practices. The EPA is currently evaluating the potential impacts of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water resources. On December 13, 2016, the EPA released a study examining the potential for hydraulic fracturing activities to impact drinking water resources, finding that, under some circumstances, the use of water in hydraulic fracturing activities can impact drinking water resources. Also, on February 6, 2015, the EPA released a report with findings and recommendations related to public concern about induced seismic activity from disposal wells. The report recommends strategies for managing and minimizing the potential for significant injection-induced seismic events. Other governmental agencies, including the U.S. Department of Energy, the U.S. Geological Survey, and the U.S. Government Accountability Office, have evaluated or are evaluating various other aspects of hydraulic fracturing. These ongoing or proposed studies could spur initiatives to further regulate hydraulic fracturing, and could ultimately make it more difficult or costly for us to perform fracturing and increase our costs of compliance and doing business.

Several states, including Texas, and local jurisdictions, have adopted, or are considering adopting, regulations that could restrict or prohibit hydraulic fracturing in certain circumstances, impose more stringent operating standards and/or require the disclosure of the composition of hydraulic fracturing fluids. The Texas Legislature adopted legislation, effective September 1, 2011, requiring oil and gas operators to publicly disclose the chemicals used in the hydraulic fracturing process. The Texas Railroad Commission adopted rules and regulations implementing this legislation that apply to all wells for which the Texas Railroad Commission issues an initial drilling permit after February 1, 2012. The law requires that the well operator disclose the list of chemical ingredients subject to the requirements of OSHA for disclosure on an internet website and file the list of chemicals with the Texas Railroad Commission with the well completion report. The total volume of water used to hydraulically fracture a well must also be disclosed to the public and filed with the Texas Railroad Commission. Also, in May 2013, the Texas Railroad Commission adopted rules governing well casing, cementing and other standards for ensuring that hydraulic fracturing operations do not contaminate nearby water resources. The rules took effect in January 2014. Additionally, on October 28, 2014, the Texas Railroad Commission adopted disposal well rule amendments designed, among other things, to require applicants for new disposal wells that will receive non-hazardous produced water and hydraulic fracturing flowback fluid to conduct seismic activity searches utilizing the U.S. Geological Survey. The searches are intended to determine the potential for earthquakes within a circular area of 100 square miles around a proposed new disposal well. The disposal well rule amendments, which became effective on November 17, 2014, also clarify the Texas Railroad Commissions authority to modify, suspend or terminate a disposal well permit if scientific data indicates a disposal well is likely to contribute to seismic activity. The Texas Railroad Commission has used this authority to deny permits for waste disposal wells.

There has been increasing public controversy regarding hydraulic fracturing with regard to the use of fracturing fluids, induced seismic activity, impacts on drinking water supplies, use of water and the potential for impacts to surface water, groundwater and the environment generally. A number of lawsuits and enforcement actions have been initiated across the country implicating hydraulic fracturing practices. If new laws or regulations that significantly restrict hydraulic fracturing are adopted, such laws could make it more difficult or costly for us to perform fracturing to stimulate production from tight formations as well as make it easier for third parties opposing the hydraulic fracturing process to initiate legal proceedings based on allegations that specific chemicals used in the fracturing process could adversely affect groundwater. In addition, if hydraulic fracturing is further regulated at the federal, state or local level, our fracturing activities could become subject to additional permitting and financial assurance requirements, more stringent construction specifications, increased monitoring, reporting and recordkeeping obligations, plugging and abandonment requirements and also to attendant permitting delays and potential increases in costs. Such legislative changes could cause us to incur substantial compliance costs, and compliance or the consequences of any failure to comply by us could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Currently, it is not possible to estimate the impact on our business of newly enacted or potential federal, state or local laws governing hydraulic fracturing.

Other Regulation of the Oil and Natural Gas Industry

The oil and natural gas industry is extensively regulated by numerous federal, state and local authorities. Legislation affecting the oil and natural gas industry is under constant review for amendment or expansion, frequently increasing the regulatory burden. Also, numerous departments and agencies, both federal and state, are authorized by statute to issue rules and regulations that are binding on the oil and natural gas industry and its individual members, some of which carry substantial penalties for failure to comply. Although the regulatory burden on the oil and natural gas industry increases our cost of doing business and, consequently, affects our profitability, these burdens generally do not affect us any differently or to any greater or lesser extent than they affect other companies in the industry with similar types, quantities and locations of production.

The availability, terms and cost of transportation significantly affect sales of oil and natural gas. The interstate transportation and sale for resale of oil and natural gas is subject to federal regulation, including regulation of the terms, conditions and rates for interstate transportation, storage and various other matters, primarily by FERC. Federal and state regulations govern the price and terms for access to oil and natural gas pipeline transportation. FERCs regulations for interstate oil and natural gas transmission in some circumstances may also affect the intrastate transportation of oil and natural gas.

Although oil and natural gas prices are currently unregulated, Congress historically has been active in oil and natural gas regulation. We cannot predict whether new legislation to regulate oil and natural gas might be proposed, what proposals, if any, might actually be enacted by Congress or the various state legislatures, and what effect, if any, the proposals might have on our operations. Sales of condensate and oil and natural gas liquids are not currently regulated and are made at market prices.

Drilling and Production. Our operations are subject to various types of regulation at the federal, state and local level. These types of regulation include requiring permits for the drilling of wells, drilling bonds and reports concerning operations. The state, and some counties and municipalities, in which we operate also regulate one or more of the following:


 | the location of wells;


 | the method of drilling and casing wells;


 | the timing of construction or drilling activities, including seasonal wildlife closures;


 | the rates of production or allowables;


 | the surface use and restoration of properties upon which wells are drilled;


 | the plugging and abandoning of wells; and


 | notice to, and consultation with, surface owners and other third parties.


State laws regulate the size and shape of drilling and spacing units or proration units governing the pooling of oil and natural gas properties. Some states allow forced pooling or integration of tracts to facilitate exploration while other states rely on voluntary pooling of lands and leases. In some instances, forced pooling or unitization may be implemented by third parties and may reduce our interest in the unitized properties. In addition, state conservation laws establish maximum rates of production from oil and natural gas wells, generally prohibit the venting or flaring of natural gas and impose requirements regarding the ratability of production. These laws and regulations may limit the amount of oil and natural gas we can produce from our wells or limit the number of wells or the locations at which we can drill. Moreover, each state generally imposes a production or severance tax with respect to the production and sale of oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids within its jurisdiction. States do not regulate wellhead prices or engage in other similar direct regulation, but we cannot assure you that they will not do so in the future. The effect of such future regulations may be to limit the amounts of oil and natural gas that may be produced from our wells, negatively affect the economics of production from these wells or to limit the number of locations we can drill.

Federal, state and local regulations provide detailed requirements for the abandonment of wells, closure or decommissioning of production facilities and pipelines and for site restoration in areas where we operate. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and many other state and local authorities also have regulations for plugging and abandonment, decommissioning and site restoration. Although the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers does not require bonds or other financial assurances, some state agencies and municipalities do have such requirements.

Natural Gas Sales and Transportation. Historically, federal legislation and regulatory controls have affected the price of the natural gas we produce and the manner in which we market our production. FERC has jurisdiction over the transportation and sale for resale of natural gas in interstate commerce by natural gas companies under the Natural Gas Act of 1938 and the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978. Since 1978, various federal laws have been enacted which have resulted in the complete removal of all price and non-price controls for sales of domestic natural gas sold in first sales, which include all of our sales of our own production. Under the Energy Policy Act of 2005, FERC has substantial enforcement authority to prohibit the manipulation of natural gas markets and enforce its rules and orders, including the ability to assess substantial civil penalties.

FERC also regulates interstate natural gas transportation rates and service conditions and establishes the terms under which we may use interstate natural gas pipeline capacity, which affects the marketing of natural gas that we produce, as well as the revenues we receive for sales of our natural gas and release of our natural gas pipeline capacity. Commencing in 1985, FERC promulgated a series of orders, regulations and rule makings that significantly fostered competition in the business of transporting and marketing gas. Today, interstate pipeline companies are required to provide nondiscriminatory transportation services to producers, marketers and other shippers, regardless of whether such shippers are affiliated with an interstate pipeline company. FERCs initiatives have led to the development of a competitive, open access market for natural gas purchases and sales that permits all purchasers of natural gas to buy gas directly from third-party sellers other than pipelines. However, the natural gas industry historically has been very heavily regulated; therefore, we cannot guarantee that the less stringent regulatory approach currently pursued by FERC and Congress will continue indefinitely into the future nor can we determine what effect, if any, future regulatory changes might have on our natural gas related activities.

Under FERCs current regulatory regime, transmission services are provided on an open-access, non-discriminatory basis at cost-based rates or negotiated rates. Gathering service, which occurs upstream of jurisdictional transmission services, is regulated by the states onshore and in state waters. Although its policy is still in flux, FERC has in the past reclassified certain jurisdictional transmission facilities as non-jurisdictional gathering facilities, which has the tendency to increase our costs of transporting gas to point-of-sale locations.

Oil Sales and Transportation. Sales of crude oil, condensate and natural gas liquids are not currently regulated and are made at negotiated prices. Nevertheless, Congress could reenact price controls in the future.

Our crude oil sales are affected by the availability, terms and cost of transportation. The transportation of oil in common carrier pipelines is also subject to rate regulation. FERC regulates interstate oil pipeline transportation rates under the Interstate Commerce Act and intrastate oil pipeline transportation rates are subject to regulation by state regulatory commissions. The basis for intrastate oil pipeline regulation, and the degree of regulatory oversight and scrutiny given to intrastate oil pipeline rates, varies from state to state. Insofar as effective interstate and intrastate rates are equally applicable to all comparable shippers, we believe that the regulation of oil transportation rates will not affect our operations in any materially different way than such regulation will affect the operations of our competitors.

Further, interstate and intrastate common carrier oil pipelines must provide service on a non-discriminatory basis. Under this open access standard, common carriers must offer service to all shippers requesting service on the same terms and under the same rates. When oil pipelines operate at full capacity, access is governed by prorationing provisions set forth in the pipelines published tariffs. Accordingly, we believe that access to oil pipeline transportation services generally will be available to us to the same extent as to our competitors.

State Regulation. Texas regulates the drilling for, and the production, gathering and sale of, oil and natural gas, including imposing severance taxes and requirements for obtaining drilling permits. Texas currently imposes a 4.6% severance tax on oil production and a 7.5% severance tax on natural gas production. States also regulate the method of developing new fields, the spacing and operation of wells and the prevention of waste of oil and natural gas resources. States may regulate rates of production and may establish maximum daily production allowable from oil and natural gas wells based on market demand or resource conservation, or both. States do not regulate wellhead prices or engage in other similar direct economic regulation, but we cannot assure you that they will not do so in the future. The effect of these regulations may be to limit the amount of oil and natural gas that may be produced from our wells and to limit the number of wells or locations we can drill.

The petroleum industry is also subject to compliance with various other federal, state and local regulations and laws. Some of those laws relate to resource conservation and equal employment opportunity. We do not believe that compliance with these laws will have a material adverse effect on us.

OSHA and Other Laws and Regulations

We are subject to the requirements of the federal Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSHA) and comparable state statutes. The OSHA hazard communication standard, the EPA community right-to-know regulations under Title III of CERCLA and similar state statutes require that we organize and/or disclose information about hazardous materials used or produced in our operations. These laws also require the development of risk management plans for certain facilities to prevent accidental releases of pollutants. We believe that we are in substantial compliance with these applicable requirements and with other OSHA and comparable requirements. 

Employees

As of July 31, 2017, we had 6 full-time employees. We regularly use independent contractors and consultants to perform various drilling and other services. None of our employees are represented by a labor union or covered by any collective bargaining agreement.
Facilities

Our corporate headquarters are located in Amarillo, Texas. We believe that our facilities are adequate for our current operations.

Insurance Matters

The oil and natural gas industry involves a variety of operating risks, including the risk of fire, explosions, blow outs, pipe failures and, in some cases, abnormally high-pressure formations which could lead to environmental hazards such as oil spills, natural gas leaks and the discharge of toxic gases. If any of these should occur, we could incur legal defense costs and could be required to pay amounts due to injury, loss of life, damage or destruction to property, natural resources and equipment, pollution or environmental damage, regulatory investigation and penalties and suspension of operations. We are not insured fully against all risks associated with our business either because such insurance is not available or because premium costs are considered prohibitive. A loss not fully covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

We reevaluate the purchase of insurance, policy terms and limits annually. Future insurance coverage for our industry could increase in cost and may include higher deductibles or retentions. In addition, some forms of insurance may become unavailable in the future or unavailable on terms that we believe are economically acceptable. No assurance can be given that we will be able to maintain insurance in the future at rates that we consider reasonable and we may elect to maintain minimal or no insurance coverage. We may not be able to secure additional insurance or bonding that might be required by new governmental regulations. This may cause us to restrict our operations, which might severely impact our financial position. The occurrence of a significant event, not fully insured against, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.

AMAZING ENERGY OIL AND GAS, CO. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
 JULY 31, 2017

NOTE 1  NATURE OF OPERATIONS

Amazing Energy Oil and Gas, Co. is incorporated in the State of Nevada. Through its primary subsidiary, Amazing Energy, Inc., also a Nevada corporation, the Company operates its main business of exploration, development, and production of oil and gas in the Permian Basin of West Texas. On October 7, 2014, the Company entered into a change in control agreement with certain shareholders of Amazing Energy, Inc. The change in control agreement was the first step in a reverse merger process whereby the shareholders of Amazing Energy, Inc. would control about 95% of the shares of common stock of Amazing Energy Oil and Gas, Co., and Amazing Energy Oil and Gas, Co. would own 100% of the outstanding shares of common stock of Amazing Energy, Inc. This entire reverse merger process was completed in July of 2015.

Amazing Energy, Inc. was formed in 2010 as a Texas corporation and then changed its domicile to Nevada in 2011. The Company owns interests in oil and gas properties located in Texas. The Company is primarily engaged in the acquisition, exploration and development of oil and gas properties and the production and sale of oil and natural gas. Amazing Energy, LLC was formed in December 2008 as a Texas Limited Liability Company. In December of 2010, Amazing Energy, Inc. and Amazing Energy, LLC were combined as commonly controlled entities.

On July 31, 2016, the Company acquired Gulf South Securities, Inc. (GSSI). GSSI was organized to be active in various aspects of the securities industry and was registered as a broker-dealer with the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The Company allowed GSSIs FINRA registration to lapse as of February 28, 2017. 

On April 15, 2016, the Company entered into an agreement with Jed Miesner, the Chairman of the Companys board of directors, to acquire all of his interest (100% of the total outstanding shares of common stock) of Jilpetco, Inc., a Texas corporation (Jilpetco) in consideration of $500,000. Jilpetco is engaged in the business of operating and providing oilfield services to oil and gas properties. As a result, Jilpetco became a wholly owned subsidiary corporation of the Company. On August 25, 2016, the foregoing agreement was amended to extend the closing date to August 31, 2016 and exclude certain property therefrom. The parties agreed to allow Jed Miesner to assign certain accounts receivable and to exclude certain personal property from the transaction. In addition, the $500,000 consideration for the acquisition is in the form of a note payable at 6% interest. (See Note 6).

Effective August 31, 2016, the Company completed the acquisition of Jilpetco. As the Company and Jilpetco were under common control at the time of the acquisition, it is required under U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (U.S. GAAP) to account for this common control acquisition similar to the pooling of interest method of accounting. Under this method of accounting, the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements as of July 31, 2016 have been recast to reflect Jilpetcos historical book basis in its assets and liabilities instead of reflecting the fair value of the assets and liabilities. The historical balances reflected herein have been adjusted and recast as if the entities had been combined as of July 31, 2015. The difference between the purchase price and historical cost of the net assets acquired was recorded as a deemed capital distribution of $423,648 as of August 1, 2016. Intercompany balances and transactions between the entities are eliminated in consolidation of the financial statements.

NOTE 2  SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Basis of presentation

This summary of significant accounting policies is presented to assist in understanding the financial statements. The financial statements and notes are representations of the Companys management, which is responsible for their integrity and objectivity. These consolidated financial statements and related notes are presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. 

The financial statements are presented on a consolidated basis and include all of the accounts of Amazing Energy Oil and Gas, Co. and its wholly owned subsidiaries, Amazing Energy, Inc., Amazing Energy LLC, Kisa Gold Mining, Inc., Gulf South Securities, Inc. and Jilpetco, Inc. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.

Going Concern

These consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally U.S. GAAP to a going concern, which assumes that the Company will be able to meet its obligations and continue its operations for its next fiscal year.

As shown in the accompanying financial statements, the Company has incurred operating losses since inception. As of July 31, 2017, the Company has limited financial resources with which to achieve the objectives and obtain profitability and positive cash flows. As shown in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and statements of operations, the Company has an accumulated deficit of $26,028,247. At July 31, 2017, the Company's working capital deficit was $819,079. Achievement of the Company's objectives will be dependent upon the ability to obtain additional financing, to locate profitable mining properties and generate revenue from current and planned business operations, and control costs. The Company plans to fund its future operations by joint venturing, obtaining additional financing from investors, and/or lenders, and attaining additional commercial production. However, there is no assurance that the Company will be able to achieve these objectives, therefore substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern exists. Although management believes that it will be able to obtain the necessary funding to allow the Company to remain a going concern through the methods discussed above, there can be no assurances that such methods will prove successful. The financial statements do not include adjustments relating to the recoverability of recorded assets nor the implications of associated bankruptcy costs should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.

Revenue and Cost Recognition

The Company uses the sales method of accounting for oil and gas revenues. Under this method, revenues are recognized based on the actual volumes of gas and oil sold to purchasers. The volume sold may differ from the volumes the Company may be entitled to, based on the Companys individual interest in the property. Periodically, imbalances between production and nomination volumes can occur for various reasons. In cases where imbalances have occurred, a production imbalance receivable or liability will be recorded when determined. Costs associated with production are expensed in the period in which they are incurred.

The Company also provides oilfield services to both related party entities and outside oil and gas well owners. Revenue and costs are recognized on an accrual basis and associated revenue and expense recognized in the period in which service was provided. 

Receivables

Oilfield service receivables are carried at original invoice amount less an estimate for doubtful accounts. Management determines the allowance by regularly evaluating individual customer receivables and considering a customers financial condition, credit history and current economic conditions. Receivables are written off when deemed uncollectible. Recoveries of receivables previously written off are recorded as income when received.

Oil and gas receivable consist of oil and natural gas revenues due under normal trade terms. Management reviews receivables periodically and reduces the carrying amount by a valuation allowance that reflects managements best estimate of the amount that may not be collectible. As of July 31, 2017, management estimated uncollectable accounts at $31,404. As of July 31, 2016, no allowance was considered necessary.

Revenue payable to interest holders

The Company provides oilfield services which includes interest owner accounting and subsequent disbursement of the interest owners pro-rata share of oil proceeds from a given lease. Generally, the pro-rata share of oil proceeds less any applicable pro-rata share of operating expenses is distributed to the interest owner within two months of sale of oil and natural gas. The revenue payable liability comprises those proceeds which have yet to be distributed to interest owners as a result of the time required to process administrative functions and process payment. 

Asset Retirement Obligations

The Company accounts for its future asset retirement obligations by recording the fair value of the liability during the period in which it was incurred. The associated asset retirement costs are capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the long-lived asset. The Company depletes the amount added to proved oil and gas property costs and gathering assets using the units-of-production method. The Company's asset retirement obligation consists of costs related to the plugging of wells, removal of facilities and equipment and site restoration on its oil and gas properties and gathering assets. The asset retirement liability is allocated to operating expense using a systematic and rational method

Use of estimates
 The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and certain assumptions that affect the amounts reported in these consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Managements estimates include estimates of impairment in carrying value of assets and liabilities, and collectability of recorded oilfield services receivables, stock based compensation, deferred income taxes, asset retirement obligations, oil and gas property ceiling tests, and depreciation, depletion and amortization. Actual results could differ from these estimates.

Risks and uncertainties
 The Companys operations are subject to significant risks and uncertainties, including financial, operational, technological, and other risks associated with operating an emerging oil and gas business, including the potential risk of business failure.

Concentration of risks
 The Companys cash is placed with a highly rated financial institution, and the Company periodically reviews the credit worthiness of the financial institutions with which it does business. At times, the Companys cash balances are in excess of amounts guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.

The Companys oil and gas revenue originated from production from its property in Texas. Each revenue stream is sold to a single customer through month to month contracts. While this creates a customer concentration, there are alternate buyers of the production in event the sole customer is unable or unwilling to purchase.

The Company sells most of its production to only two customers. As a result, during the fiscal years ended July 31, 2017 and 2016, these customers represented 50% or more of its oil and gas revenue (major customers).

Cash and Cash Equivalents

The Company considers all highly liquid investments purchased with a remaining maturity of three months or less when acquired to be cash equivalents.

Restricted Cash

As of July 31, 2017, the Company has a letter of credit in the amount of $50,000 in favor of the Texas Railroad Commission as a bond for reclamation on its oil and gas properties.
Income Taxes

The Company accounts for income taxes using the liability method. The liability method requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of (i) temporary differences between financial statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their basis for tax purposes and (ii) operating loss and tax credit carry-forwards for tax purposes. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when management concludes that it is more likely than not that a portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized in a future period.

Fair value of financial instruments

Financial instruments consist of cash and various notes payable. The estimated fair value of convertible debt, related party approximates $5.4 million at July 31, 2017 based on its common stock equivalents and exchange trading price.

Property, plant, and equipment

Property, plant, and equipment are stated at cost. Improvements which significantly increase an assets value or significantly extend its useful life are capitalized and depreciated over the assets remaining useful life. When property, plant or equipment is sold at a price either higher or lower than its carrying amount, or un-depreciated cost at the date of disposal, the difference between the sale proceeds over the carrying amount is recognized as gain, while a loss is recognized when the carrying amount exceeds the sale proceeds. Property, plant, and equipment are depreciated on a straight-line basis over their useful lives, which are typically five to seven years for equipment. 

Oil and gas properties

The Company uses the full cost method of accounting for exploration and development activities as defined by the Securities and Exchange Commission. Under this method of accounting, the costs of unsuccessful, as well as successful, exploration and development activities are capitalized as properties and equipment. This includes any internal costs that are directly related to property acquisition, exploration and development activities but does not include any costs related to production, general corporate overhead or similar activities. Gain or loss on the sale or other disposition of oil and gas properties is not recognized, unless the gain or loss would significantly alter the relationship between capitalized costs and proved reserves. Oil and gas properties include costs that are excluded from costs being depleted or amortized. Oil and natural gas property costs excluded represent investments in unevaluated properties and include non-producing leasehold, geological, and geophysical costs associated with leasehold or drilling interests and exploration drilling costs. The Company allocates a portion of its acquisition costs to unevaluated properties based on relative value. Costs are transferred to the full cost pool as the properties are evaluated over the life of the reservoir.

Depletion and amortization

The depletion base for oil and natural gas properties includes the sum of all capitalized costs net of accumulated depreciation, depletion, and amortization (DD&A), estimated future development costs and asset retirement costs not included in oil and natural gas properties, less costs excluded from amortization. The depletion base of oil and natural gas properties is amortized on a units-of-production method.

Long-Lived Assets
The Company reviews long-lived assets which include property, plant and equipment and oil and gas properties for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Events relating to recoverability may include significant unfavorable changes in business conditions or a forecasted inability to achieve break-even operating results over an extended period. The Company evaluates the recoverability of long-lived assets based upon forecasted undiscounted cash flows and reports any impairment at the lower of the carrying amount or the fair value less costs to sell.

Ceiling test

Future production volumes from oil and gas properties are a significant factor in determining the full cost ceiling limitation of capitalized costs. Under the full cost method of accounting, the Company is required to periodically perform a ceiling test that determines a limit on the book value of oil and gas properties. If the net capitalized cost of proved oil and gas properties, net of related deferred income taxes, plus the cost of unproved oil and gas properties, exceeds the present value of estimated future net cash flows discounted at 10 percent, net of related tax affects, plus the cost of unproved oil and gas properties, the excess is charged to expense and reflected as additional accumulated DD&A. The ceiling test calculation uses a commodity price assumption, which is based on an un-weighted arithmetic average of the price on the first day of each month for each month within the prior 12-month period and excludes future cash outflows related to estimated abandonment costs. The Company did not recognize impairment on its oil and gas properties during the years ended July 31, 2017 and 2016. Due to the volatility of commodity prices, should oil and natural gas prices decline in the future, it is possible that a write-down could occur. Proved reserves are estimated quantities of crude oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquids, which geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions. The independent engineering estimates include only those amounts considered to be proved reserves and do not include additional amounts which may result from new discoveries in the future, or from application of secondary and tertiary recovery processes where facilities are not in place or for which transportation and/or marketing contracts are not in place. 

The determination of oil and gas reserves is a subjective process, and the accuracy of any reserve estimate depends on the quality of available data and the application of engineering and geological interpretation and judgment. Estimates of economically recoverable reserves and future net cash flows depend on a number of variable factors and assumptions that are difficult to predict and may vary considerably from actual results. In particular, reserve estimates for wells with limited or no production history are less reliable than those based on actual production. Subsequent re- evaluation of reserves and cost estimates related to future development of proved oil and gas reserves could result in significant revisions to proved reserves. There other issues, such as changes in regulatory requirements, technological advances, and other factors, which are difficult to predict, could also affect estimates of proved reserves in the future.

Gains and losses on the sale of oil and gas properties are not generally reflected in income. Sales of less than 100% of the Companys interest in the oil and gas property are treated as a reduction of the capital cost of the field, with no gain or loss recognized, as long as doing so does not significantly affect the unit-of-production depletion rate. Costs of retired equipment, net of salvage value, are usually charged to accumulated depreciation.

Stock-based compensation 

Compensation cost for equity awards is based on the fair value of the equity instrument on the date of grant and is recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award.

Environmental laws and regulations

The Company is subject to extensive federal, state, and local environmental laws and regulations. Environmental expenditures are expensed or capitalized depending on their future economic benefit. The Company believes that it is in compliance with existing laws and regulations.

Fair value measurements
When required to measure assets or liabilities at fair value, the Company uses a fair value hierarchy based on the level of independent, objective evidence surrounding the inputs used. The Company determines the level within the fair value hierarchy in which the fair value measurements in their entirety fall. The categorization within the fair value hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Level 1 uses quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities, Level 2 uses significant other observable inputs, and Level 3 uses significant unobservable inputs. The amount of the total gains or losses for the period are included in earnings that are attributable to the change in unrealized gains or losses relating to those assets and liabilities still held at the reporting date. At July 31, 2017 and July 31, 2016, the Company had no assets or liabilities accounted for at fair value on a recurring basis.

Recent accounting pronouncements

In August 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued ASU No. 2014-15, Presentation of Financial Statements  Going Concern. The provisions of ASU No. 2014-15 require management to assess an entitys ability to continue as a going concern by incorporating and expanding upon certain principles that are currently in U.S. auditing standards. Specifically, the amendments (1) provide a definition of the term substantial doubt, (2) require an evaluation every reporting period including interim periods, (3) provide principles for considering the mitigating effect of managements plans, (4) require certain disclosures when substantial doubt is alleviated as a result of consideration of managements plans, (5) require an express statement and other disclosures when substantial doubt is not alleviated, and (6) require an assessment for a period of one year after the date that the financial statements are issued (or available to be issued). The amendments in this ASU are effective for the annual period ending after December 15, 2016, and for annual periods and interim periods thereafter. This ASU was adopted effective August 1, 2016 and did not have an effect on the Companys consolidated financial statements.

In May 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (ASU 2014-09), which supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in FASB Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 605, Revenue Recognition. The guidance requires that an entity recognize revenue in a way that depicts the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in the amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods and services. The guidance will be effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within that reporting period and is to be applied retrospectively, with early application not permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the new standard and its impact on the Companys consolidated financial statements.
 
In November 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2015-17 Income Taxes - Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes (Topic 740). The update is designed to reduce complexity of reporting deferred income tax liabilities and assets into current and non-current amounts in a statement of financial position. ASU No. 2015-17 requires the presentation of deferred income taxes, changes to deferred tax liabilities and assets be classified as non-current in the statement of financial position. The update is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016. The adoption of this update on August 1, 2017 had no impact on the consolidated financial statements.

In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09 Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting. The update simplifies the accounting for stock-based compensation, including income tax consequences and balance sheet and cash flow statement classification of awards. The update is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently considering the effects of adoption of this ASU.

In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15 Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments. The update provides guidance on classification for cash receipts and payments related to eight specific issues. The update is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of implementing this update on the consolidated financial statements.

In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-01 Business Combinations (Topic 805): Clarifying the Definition of a Business. The update clarifies the definition of a business with the objective of adding guidance to assist entities with evaluating whether transactions should be accounted for as acquisitions (or disposals) of assets or businesses. The update is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company will apply the provisions of the update to potential future acquisitions occurring after the effective date.

Other accounting standards that have been issued or proposed by FASB that do not require adoption until a future date are not expected to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements upon adoption. The Company does not discuss recent pronouncements that are not anticipated to have an impact on or are unrelated to its financial condition, results of operations, cash flows or disclosures.

NOTE 3  EARNINGS PER SHARE

Basic Earnings Per Share (EPS) is computed by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted-average number of shares outstanding during the period and includes no dilution. Diluted EPS reflects the potential dilution of securities that could occur from common shares issuable through convertible debt, convertible preferred stock and warrants.

The outstanding securities at July 31, 2017 and 2016, that could have a dilutive effect are as follows:


 | July 31, 2017 | | July 31, 2016
Conversion option on related party debt | | 12,661,985 | | 11,832,724
Convertible preferred stock | | 6,490,000 | | 6,490,000 
Warrants | | 2,674,576 | | 2,674,576 
Total potential dilution | | 21,826,561 | | 20,997,300


For the years ended July 31, 2017 and 2016, the effect of this potential dilution has not been recognized since it would have been anti-dilutive.

NOTE 4  PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT

As of July 31, 2017 and July 31, 2016, the property and equipment asset balance was composed of the following:


 | July 31, 2017 | | July 31, 2016 | 
 | | | | | (Recast) 
Drilling equipment | $ | 600,000 | | $ | 425,000 
Other equipment | | 252,204 | | | 166,480 
Less: Accumulated depreciation | | (306,392) | | | (192,403)
Total property and equipment | $ | 545,812 | | $ | 399,077 

NOTE 5  OIL AND GAS PROPERTIES 

The Company is currently participating in oil and gas exploration activities in Texas. The Companys oil and gas properties are located entirely in the United States.

The Company has leasehold rights located within approximately 70,000 contiguous acres in Pecos County, Texas, which lies within the Permian Basin. The property is located in the Northeast region of the County. The Pecos leasehold is comprised of multiple leases, and the Company has a variable working interest in twenty-three wells on these leases. The Company has drilled twenty-three wells throughout this property, with twenty-one producing and two shut-in. The oil and gas property balances at July 31, 2017 and July 31, 2016 are set forth in the table below:


 | July 31, 2017 | | | July 31, 2016 | 
 | | | | | | (Recast) | 
Proved leasehold costs | $ | 2,049,593 | | | $ | 2,477,079 | 
Cost of wells and development | | 4,920,558 | | | | 4,591,513 | 
Asset retirement obligation, asset | | 128,886 | | | | 166,103 | 
Total cost of oil and gas properties | | 7,099,037 | | | | 7,234,695 | 
Less: Accumulated depletion | | (1,179,955 | ) | | | (997,986 | )
Oil and gas properties, net full cost method | $ | 5,919,082 | | | $ | 6,236,709 | 

 For the 
year ended July 31, 2017, the Company has sold an 11% working interest in four wells and a 60% working interest in three wells for a total of $656,596 in cash to Gulf South Energy Partners, a related entity controlled by Robert Bories, a member of the Companys Board of Directors. The sale of working interests in seven wells resulted in a reduction in oil and gas properties of $656,596 for the year ended July 31, 2017. Gain or loss was not recognized on this sale since the sale did not significantly alter the relationship between capitalized costs and proved reserves.
 
NOTE 6  COMMON CONTROL ACQUISITION OF JILPETCO, INC. 

On April 15, 2016, the Company entered into an agreement with Jed Miesner, the Chairman of the Companys Board of Directors, to acquire all of his interest (100% of the total outstanding shares of common stock) in Jilpetco, Inc., a Texas corporation (Jilpetco) in consideration of $500,000. Jilpetco is engaged in the business of operating and providing oilfield services to oil and gas properties, including the Companys. 

On August 25, 2016, the foregoing agreement was amended to extend the closing date to August 31, 2016 and exclude certain property therefrom. The parties agreed to allow Jed Miesner to exclude certain oilfield service receivables for $71,745 from the transaction. In addition, the $500,000 in additional consideration for the acquisition was in the form of a note payable at 6% interest calling for monthly payments of principal and interest totaling $511,962 and maturing on December 25, 2017 (Note 8  Notes Payable, Related Parties). The Note called for five monthly payments of $50,752.49 commencing on September 25, 2016, and twelve payments of $21,517 commencing on January 25, 2017.

The Company completed the acquisition of Jilpetco on August 31, 2016 (Note 1 - Nature of Operations). As the Company and Jilpetco were under common control at the time of the acquisition, the results of operations have been combined (recast) for the Company and Jilpetco as of August 1, 2015.

Separate results for the Company and Jilpetco for the year ended July 31, 2017 and 2016 were as follows:


 | Year ended July 31, 2017 | | Year ended July 31, 2016

 The Company had federal net operating loss carry forwards of approximately $10,671,450 and $7,975,397 at July 31, 2017 and July 31, 2016, respectively. The federal net operating loss carry forwards will begin to expire in fiscal years ending July 31, 2033 through July 31, 2037. Realization of the deferred tax asset is dependent, in part, on generating sufficient taxable income prior to expiration of the loss carry forwards. The Company has placed a 100% valuation allowance against the net deferred tax asset because future realization of these assets is not assured.

Authoritative guidance for uncertainty in income taxes requires that the Company recognize the financial statement benefit of a tax position only after determining that the relevant tax authority would more likely than not sustain the position following an examination. Management has reviewed the Companys tax positions and determined there were no uncertain tax positions requiring recognition in the consolidated financial statements. Currently tax years from fiscal 2015 through 2017 remain open for examination by tax authorities. Net operating losses prior to 2015 could be adjusted during an examination of open years.

Estimated interest and penalties related to potential underpayment on any unrecognized tax benefits would be classified as a component of tax expense in the statement of operation. The Company has not recorded any interest or penalties associated with unrecognized tax benefits for any periods covered by these financial statements.

NOTE 13  COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

The Company is subject to contingencies because of environmental laws and regulations.

Legal contingency

However, on September 7, 2017, Amazing Energy LLC and Jilpetco Inc. were served with a lawsuit, being Cause No. P-7600-83-CV in the 83rd District Court in Pecos County, Texas. The nature of the litigation is that Amazing Energy & Jilpetco were joined as defendants in a case in Pecos County, Texas, between Fredrick Bartlett Wulff, Sr. et al plaintiffs and Benedum & Trees, LLC et al defendants. The suit alleges breach of lease, breach of implied duty to explore and develop, and requests a declaratory judgment that the leases are terminated, and the suit requests an accounting of lease production. The case in the early stages of discovery as to the claims against the Company. Management intends to seek an early resolution but will vigorously defend the case. It is too early in the litigation to evaluate the likely outcome or to evaluate the range of losses, as the lease interests involved are small fractional interests. In the opinion of the Companys management, none of the pending litigation, disputes or claims against it, if decided adversely, will have a material adverse effect on the Companys financial condition, cash flows or results of operations.

Lease commitments

Fair Value Measurement on a Non-Recurring Basis
 | | | Fair value for the year ended July 31, 2016
 | | | Total | | Level 1 | | Level 2 | | Level 3 
 | Preferred stock series A | $ | 445,735 | $ | - | $ | 445,735 | $ | - 
 | Common stock purchase warrants | $ | 1,058,528 | $ | - | $ | 1,058,528 | $ | - 
 | Preferred stock series B | $ | 2,476,803 | $ | - | $ | 2,476,803 | $ | - 
 | Goodwill impairment | $ | 5,965,836 | $ | - | $ | - | $ | 5,965,836


Estimated fair values during the year ended July 31, 2016 for the preferred stock and warrants were determined using a Black Scholes model with inputs as indicated in the respective footnotes referenced above. The fair value estimation of goodwill was determined by the Company based on unobservable inputs, therefore the valuation is classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. 

There were no similar transactions during the year ended July 31, 2017 which required fair value measurement on a non-recurring basis.

NOTE 19  SUPPLEMENTAL OIL AND GAS DISCLOSURES (UNAUDITED)

Costs Incurred  Costs incurred in oil and gas property acquisition, exploration and development activities, whether expensed or capitalized, are reflected in the table below for the years ended July 31, 2017 and 2016.

 | 2017 | | 2016
Development costs | $ | 370,090 | | $ | 283,750
Total costs incurred | $ | 370,090 | | $ | 283,750

 Capitalized Costs  The aggregate amount of capitalized costs related to oil and gas producing activities and the aggregate amount of the related accumulated depreciation, depletion and amortization (DD&A), including any accumulated valuation allowances, are reflected in the table below for the years ended July 31, 2017 and July 31, 2016.

 | 2017 | | 2016
Proved properties | $ | 7,099,037 | | $ | 7,243,509
Total oil and gas properties | | 7,099,037 | | | 7,243,509
Accumulated DD&A | | (1,179,955) | | | (997,986 
Net oil and gas properties | $ | 5,919,082 | | $ | 6,236,709

Proved Oil and Gas Reserve  Proved oil and gas reserves were estimated by independent petroleum engineers. The reserves were based on the following assumptions:
 ·
 Future revenues were based on an un-weighted 12-month average of the first-day-of-the-month price held constant throughout the life of the properties.
 ·
 Production and development costs were computed using year-end costs assuming no change in present economic conditions.
 ·
 Future net cash flows were discounted at an annual rate of 10%.

Reserve estimates are inherently imprecise, and these estimates are expected to change as future information becomes available.

Basis of Presentation  The proved oil and gas reserve quantities for fiscal 2017 and 2016 are based on estimates prepared by Mire & Associates, Inc., Petroleum Engineering Consultants. There are numerous uncertainties in estimating quantities of proved reserves and projecting future rates of production and the timing of development expenditures. These uncertainties are greater for properties which are undeveloped or have a limited production history, such as our properties. The following reserve data represents estimates only and actual reserves may vary substantially from these estimates. All of our proved reserves were in United States as of July 31, 2017 and 2016. Our net quantities of proved developed and undeveloped reserves of crude oil and gas and changes therein are reflected in the table below.

As of July 31, 2017, we had twenty-three wells drilled with twenty-one producing and two wells shut-in awaiting workovers.
 The proved reserves as of July 31, 2017 represent the reserves that were estimated to be recovered from twenty-three current wells. There are also seven wells planned for future drilling. All direct offset well locations in this report are proved undeveloped and are based on 10-acre drainage patterns unless current developed completions are estimated to drain an area larger than their volumetric assignment. In this case, the reserves of certain offset locations have been reduced. All locations have a scheduled Queen and/or Grayburg reservoir completion and each of these reservoir completions includes the cost of drilling a single wellbore. All reserves included in this report were estimated using either historical performance or volumetric methods.

Estimated Quantities of Net Proved Oil and Natural Gas Reserves  Estimated quantities of net proved oil and natural gas reserves are reflected in the table below for the years ended July 31, 2017 and 2016.
 
 | | 2017 | | 2016 
 | | Oil (1) | | Natural Gas (1) | | Oil (1) | | Natural Gas (1)
RESERVES: | | | | | | | | 
Beginning of year | | 436,980 | | 1,849,260 | | 357,290 | | 1,312,500 
 | Revisions of previous estimates | | (111,458) | | (638,992) | | (85,884) | | (90,208)
 | Sales of reserves | | (36,556) | | (119,157) | | - | | - 
 | Extensions, discoveries and other additions | | 22,040 | | 89,580 | | 172,970 | | 648,460 
 | Production | | (5,566) | | (37,521) | | (7,396) | | (21,492)
End of year | | 305,440 | | 1,143,170 | | 436,980 | | 1,849,260 

 (1) Oil reserves are stated in barrels; gas reserves are stated in thousand cubic feet.
 The downward revision of previous gas reserves estimates was primarily due to reassessment of reservoir mapping based on additional log analysis from drilling.

Standardized Measure of Discounted Future Net Cash Flows Relating to Proved Oil and Gas Reserves  The following information was developed utilizing procedures prescribed by Accounting Standards Codification ASC 932-235, Disclosures about Oil and Gas Producing Activities. The information is based on estimates prepared by independent petroleum engineers. The standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows should not be viewed as representative of the current value of our proved oil and gas reserves. It and the other information contained in the following tables may be useful for certain comparative purposes, but should not be solely relied upon in evaluating us or our performance.

In reviewing the information that follows, we believe that the following factors should be considered:
 ·
 future costs and sales prices will probably differ from those required to be used in these calculations;
 ·
 actual production rates for future periods may vary significantly from the rates assumed in the calculations;
 ·
 a 10% discount rate may not be reasonable relative to risk inherent in realizing future net oil and gas revenues; and
 ·
 future net revenues may be subject to different rates of income taxation.

Under the standardized measure, future cash inflows were estimated by applying year-end oil and gas prices applicable to our reserves to the estimated future production of year-end proved reserves. Future cash inflows do not reflect the impact of open hedge positions. Future cash inflows were reduced by estimated future development, abandonment and production costs based on year-end costs in order to arrive at net cash flows before tax. Future income tax expense has been computed by applying year-end statutory tax rates to aggregate future pre-tax net cash flows reduced by the tax basis of the properties involved and tax carryforwards. Use of a 10% discount rate and year- end prices and costs are required by ASC 932-235. In general, management does not rely on the following information in making investment and operating decisions. Such decisions are based upon a wide range of factors, including estimates of probable as well as proved reserves and varying price and cost assumptions considered more representative of a range of possible outcomes.

Basis of Presentation  The standardized measure data includes estimates of oil and gas reserve volumes and forecasts of future production rates over the reserve lives. Estimates of future production expenditures, including taxes and future development costs, are based on managements best estimate of such costs assuming a continuation of current economic and operating conditions. No provision is included for depletion, depreciation and amortization of property acquisition costs or indirect costs. Income tax expense has been computed using expected future tax rates and giving effect to tax deductions and credits available, under current laws, and which relate to oil and gas producing activities. The sales prices used in the calculation are the year-end prices of crude oil and natural gas, which as of July 31, 2017 and 2016 were 
$48.71 and $42.46 per barrel and 
$3.01 and $2.25 per million cubic foot of gas, respectively. Changes in prices and cost levels, as well as the timing of future development costs, may cause actual results to vary significantly from the data presented. This information is not intended to represent a forecast or fair market value of the Companys oil and gas assets, but does present a standardized disclosure of discounted future net cash flows that would result under the assumptions used.

Standardized Measure of Discounted Future Net Cash Flows  The standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows relating to proved oil and gas reserves for years ended July 31, 2017 and 2016 are as follows:
 
 | 2017 | | 2016
Future cash inflows | $ | 16,391,090 | | $ | 19,551,030 
Future production costs | | (4,979,820) | | | (7,569,270)
Future development costs | | (1,688,400) | | | (2,193,800)
Future income tax expense | | (3,403,010) | | | (3,425,783)
Discount at 10% for estimated timing of cash flows | | (1,853,862) | | | (1,733,300)
Standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows | $ | $4,465,998 | | $ | 4,628,877 


The following table presents a reconciliation of changes in the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows:
