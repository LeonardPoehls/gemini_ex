General
 
Francesca’s Holdings Corporation was incorporated in Delaware in 2007. We are a holding company and all of our business operations are conducted through our subsidiaries. Our principal executive office is located at 8760 Clay Road, Houston, Texas 77080, our telephone number is (713) 864-1358 and our fax number is (713) 426-2751. We maintain a website at www.francescas.com. We may post information that is important to our investors on our website. Information included or referred to on, or otherwise accessible through, our website is not intended to form part or be incorporated by reference into this report. Except where the context otherwise requires or where otherwise indicated, the terms “francesca’s®,” “we,” “us,” “our,” “the Company,” and “our business” refer to Francesca’s Holdings Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries as a combined entity.
 
We operate on a fiscal calendar which, in a given fiscal year, consists of a 52- or 53-week period ending on the Saturday closest to January 31st. The reporting periods contained in our audited consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K contain 53 weeks of operations in fiscal year 2017, which ended on February 3, 2018, 52 weeks of operations in fiscal year 2016, which ended on January 28, 2017, and 52 weeks of operations in fiscal year 2015, which ended on January 30, 2016.
 
Our Company
 
francesca’s® is a growing specialty retailer which operates a nationwide-chain of boutiques providing customers a unique, fun and personalized shopping experience. The merchandise assortment is a diverse and balanced mix of apparel, jewelry, accessories and gifts. As of February 3, 2018, francesca’s® operated 721 boutiques in 47 states and the District of Columbia and also served its customers through www.francescas.com, our ecommerce website.  
 
By offering a differentiated shopping experience and quality, on-trend merchandise at a compelling value, our boutiques have been successful across a wide variety of geographic markets and shopping venues. We believe we have an opportunity to grow our boutique base to more than 900 boutiques in the United States based on our flexible boutique format, the financial characteristics of our boutiques and our ongoing analysis of shopping venues that meet the criteria for our boutiques.
 
Our Competitive Strengths
 
We believe the following strengths differentiate us from our competitors and are key drivers of our success:
 

· | On-trend Merchandise Delivered at a Compelling Value. Our boutiques carry a broad and shallow selection of quality, on-trend apparel, jewelry, accessories and gifts at attractive prices that ‘surprise and delight’ our customers. Our buyers closely monitor the marketplace to identify and source proven fashion trends we believe will appeal to our core customers. We have a unique assortment as we primarily offer exclusive items under our proprietary labels. We also carry a small selection of third-party, nationally recognized brands that we use opportunistically in certain categories. We offer a broad selection of merchandise, but intentionally purchase small quantities of individual items for each boutique and we frequently replenish our boutiques with new merchandise, keeping the shopping experience fresh and exciting for our customers. The short lead times of our vendors maximizes our speed to market, as it generally takes four to twelve weeks from the time an order is placed to the time merchandise is available on the boutique floor. With these short lead times, we are able to make more informed buying decisions to meet customers’ merchandise expectations, and to react quickly to fashion trends. This approach, combined with our balanced merchandise mix of approximately 50% apparel and 50% jewelry, accessories and gifts, is designed to encourage frequent visits by our customers and mitigate the seasonal fluctuations in sales and merchandise margin.

· | Differentiated Shopping Experience. Each of our retail locations is designed and merchandised to feel like an upscale boutique. Merchandise presentations, including display windows, tables and walls, are refreshed frequently to keep our boutiques new and exciting. Each boutique feels individualized and our boutique associates strive to provide a personalized guest experience by creating a high-touch service environment which increases guest engagement and enhances the shopping experience. We believe these attributes, along with our strategy of carrying a broad selection but limited quantities of individual styles, create an atmosphere that strongly appeals to our customers and differentiates us in the marketplace.

· | Powerful Boutique Economics and Rigorous Real Estate Selection Process. Our boutique format typically works across a wide variety of shopping venues, market sizes, climates and demographics. Our boutiques average approximately 1,420 square feet, which is meaningfully smaller than most specialty retailers. The performance of our boutiques and our flexible real estate format enhance our ability to secure prominent, highly visible locations in regional malls, lifestyle centers, street locations, strip centers and outlet centers. We deploy a rigorous real estate selection process with all new boutique opportunities measured against specific financial and geographic criteria. We currently fund all of our growth from cash generated from operations, including tenant allowances. In our real estate selection process, we assess the viability of potential sites by analyzing the demographics of the trade area and the performance of the shopping venue, including selected relevant and adjacent retailers. Based on this analysis, we believe the financial characteristics of our new boutiques, coupled with our ability to operate across different shopping venues and geographies, provide us with a wide scope of new boutique opportunities and enhance our ability to profitably expand our boutique base.

· | Solid and Scalable Infrastructure. We continually invest in systems, controls and human resources to support our growth. In recent years we have made, and we continue to make, significant improvements in our ecommerce and IT systems as well as the infrastructure of our buying, planning and allocation, real estate, boutique operations, and finance departments. For instance, we believe that we have developed an integrated sourcing, distribution and merchandising process that is scalable and are investing in new systems and enhancements to existing systems. This includes buyers who work closely with an established and diverse group of vendors to identify on-trend, quality merchandise for our boutiques, as well as delivery, distribution and merchandising processes that enable us to execute a broad and shallow or scarcity merchandising approach as we grow.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Experienced Management Team with a Disciplined Operating Philosophy. Our senior management has extensive experience across a broad range of disciplines in the retail industry, including merchandising, real estate, supply chain and finance. Our management team has built a solid operating foundation based on sound retail principles that define our culture. Our disciplined operating philosophy is grounded in a relentless focus on providing great merchandise and a best-in class boutique experience supported by uncompromising site selection and continual enhancements to our infrastructure.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our Growth Strategy
 
We believe we can grow our revenues and earnings by executing on the following strategies:
 

· | Grow Ecommerce Penetration and Omni Channel Capabilities. We complement our boutiques with a growing ecommerce presence. Our ecommerce website not only generates incremental sales and profits but also builds brand awareness, drives boutique traffic and omni channel engagement, and helps us access markets where we do not currently have a boutique. Our ecommerce sales represented 7.0% and 5.0% of our net sales in fiscal years 2017 and 2016, respectively. We believe we can significantly increase our ecommerce sales penetration in the next five years. We continuously invest in marketing programs and merchandise offerings to support this growth strategy. Additionally, we are prioritizing the enhancement of our omni channel capabilities to further optimize our customers’ shopping experience. This will also provide the infrastructure framework of our long-term ecommerce strategies.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Invigorate Merchandising. We plan to drive comparable sales by featuring on-trend, quality and unique merchandise at a compelling value. We plan to continue to maintain our broad and shallow or scarcity merchandising approach and leverage a more liquid open-to-buy strategy to take advantage of fashion trends. We believe this merchandising strategy will drive units and dollars per transaction and protect margins. We are continuing to refine our buying and planning processes to improve inventory management, resulting in constant flow of newness and appropriate allocations.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Cultivate Branding and Expand Marketing. We plan to continue to strengthen, evolve and invest in the appropriate marketing programs to build traffic and increase customer loyalty. In October 2017, we completed the roll-out of our new point-of-sale software which now gives us the ability to gather guests’ emails and phone numbers. We will use this customer information to better target our core guests. This new software will also enable us to launch a nationwide customer loyalty program in fiscal year 2018.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Differentiate and Personalize Guest Experience. Our goal is to make every guest visit to francesca’s® unique by providing an experience that gives each guest a sense of discovery, reasons to return and something worth sharing with friends. Our boutique associates and our ecommerce website are keys to delivering the experience we strive to provide to our guests. Therefore, we plan to continuously enhance our training programs and invest in our ecommerce website and omni channel capabilities to further improve the shopping experience.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

· | Optimize Real Estate. We believe there is an opportunity to increase the number of boutiques we operate and enhance our existing boutiques. We believe we have the potential to grow our base to more than 900 boutiques in the United States based on our ability to open our flexible retail format in various shopping venues, in new and existing markets, the financial characteristics of our boutiques and our ongoing analysis of shopping venues that meet our criteria for our boutiques. We opened 60 new boutiques and closed 10 underperforming boutiques in fiscal year 2017. In fiscal year 2018, we expect to moderate our boutique opening plans and open approximately 35 new boutiques and close approximately 20 underperforming boutiques as we focus on improving our merchandise assortment. We regularly review our existing boutiques for improvement opportunities and potential closures for the overall health of our fleet without incurring material write-offs associated with such closures. In fiscal year 2018, we will embark upon a remodel program and expect to refresh approximately 80 to 90 of our high volume existing boutiques. We view this refresh program as a necessary investment to continually enhance the differentiated customer shopping experience we strive to achieve.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our History
 
In 1999, our Company was founded and we opened our first boutique in Houston, Texas. Initially, we focused on selling fashion jewelry, accessories and selected home décor. As our boutique base grew across the United States we expanded our merchandise offering to include apparel, which has become our largest category and, we believe a significant driver of growing customer loyalty and return visits. In July 2011, we became a publicly-traded company.
Our Market
 
Our distinct boutique environment and carefully selected, on-trend merchandise attracts a wide demographic. Our unique merchandise combination of apparel, jewelry, accessories and gifts allows us to participate in a number of large market segments. While our broad assortment appeals to women of varying ages and diverse backgrounds, from the value-conscious to the more affluent, our core guest is a fashion-conscious woman between the ages of 18 and 35. She tends to be college educated and has moderate to high disposable income. She enjoys shopping for the latest fashion and is attracted to our upscale boutique shopping environment, compelling value proposition and personalized customer service. We believe she spends a higher proportion of her income on fashion than the general population.
Our Merchandise Offering and Merchandising Strategy
 
We offer a broad and shallow selection of fashion apparel, jewelry, accessories and gifts targeted to our core customer, who seeks on-trend, quality merchandise at attractive prices. We use the term broad and shallow or scarcity to refer to a diverse merchandise assortment with relatively small quantities of each item. We have a well-balanced assortment of merchandise categories with approximately 50% of our fiscal year 2017 sales generated by non-apparel items. Our diverse merchandise contributes to the ‘treasure hunt’ atmosphere in our boutiques. We carry a broad selection but limited quantities of each style and we deliver new merchandise to our boutiques five days a week. This contributes to a sense of scarcity and newness within our boutiques, mitigates fashion risk, reduces the seasonality of the inventory and protects margins.
 
Our wide range of apparel, jewelry and accessories fills the various casual and dressy fashion needs of our customers and our selection of gifts ranges from the elegant to the irreverent. Our approximately 1,420 square foot boutiques carry in excess of 3,000 SKUs at any one time and we stock more than 12,000 different styles during the course of a year. The majority of our merchandise is sold under our proprietary labels and we also sell a select assortment of third-party, nationally recognized brands. Our ecommerce website features the same merchandise offered in our boutiques coupled with on-line exclusives. Additionally, our ecommerce inventory is now available to order in-boutique in the same transaction as in-boutique purchases or as a separate transaction. The table below shows the approximate breakdown of our fiscal year 2017 net sales by merchandise category:
 

Apparel 50% of Net Sales | Jewelry 22% of Net Sales | Accessories 15% of Net Sales | Gifts 13% of Net Sales 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+---------------------------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dresses, Fashion Tops, Sweaters, Cardigans and Wraps, Bottoms, Outerwear and Jackets, Tees and Tanks, Intimates | Necklaces, Earrings, Bracelets, Rings | Handbags, Clutches, Wallets, Shoes, Belts, Hats, Scarves, Sunglasses, Watches, Beauty, Hair Accessories | Fragrance, Candles, Bath and Body, Home Accessories, Books, Wall Art, Nail Polish, Miscellaneous Items

 
For additional information regarding net sales by merchandise category, please refer to Note 10 to our audited consolidated financial statements included in “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” in Item 8 of this Annual Report, which is incorporated herein by reference.
 
Our buying team is responsible for selecting and sourcing our merchandise. Each merchandise category has a set of dedicated buyers with oversight provided by our Chief Merchandising Officer. Our planning and allocation team assists in managing inventory levels and allocating items to boutiques and reports to the Chief Financial Officer. Both the buying and planning and allocation teams hold weekly meetings to review merchandise performance and identify new fashion trends. Our buyers also make regular trips to important industry markets and trade shows. We have access to the expertise of hundreds of designers employed by our large vendor base who provide us with a large selection of new styles for review each week. Our buyers collaborate with vendors to place special orders and to modify presented styles based on current fashion trends and their in-depth knowledge of our customers’ preferences, which means most of our merchandise is unique to francesca’s ®. Before placing an order, every item is evaluated for style, quality, fit, value and profitability to ensure it meets standards consistent with the francesca’s ® brand. In order to clear slow moving inventory, in addition to normal promotional activities, we regularly mark certain merchandise out-of-stock and dispose of such inventory at a pace suitable for our merchandising strategy.

Our Sourcing Strategy
 
Our ability to quickly make decisions on on-trend items combined with the short production lead times of our vendors maximizes our speed to market. We primarily use vendors based in the United States that source from both domestic and overseas markets and it generally takes four to twelve weeks from the time an order is placed to the time merchandise is available on the boutique floor. With these short lead times, we are able to make more informed buying decisions in terms of customers’ merchandise expectations, and to quickly react to changing fashion trends. This also supports our merchandise strategy of offering a broad but limited assortment that is consistently refreshed. Due to the limited quantity of our buys in any one style, we minimize material inventory positions in an individual style which enhances our ability to quickly deliver on-trend merchandise and reduce the risk of fashion misses.
 
We do not own or operate any manufacturing facilities. We have relationships with a diverse base of more than 400 vendors and transact business on a purchase-order-by-purchase order basis. In fiscal year 2017, we sourced approximately 96% of our merchandise from 200 vendors while our top 10 vendors sourced approximately 30% of our merchandise, with no single vendor accounting for more than 4% of our purchases. We believe that the loss of any of our current vendors would not result in a material disruption to our business.
 
We do not enter into exclusive contracts with our vendors and we continue to optimize our vendor network. This provides us with access to an even more extensive variety of merchandise from a greater number of vendors at competitive prices. We believe our vendors view us as an important customer given our market position. Our vendors utilize a network of domestic and overseas factories, providing them access to significant capacity.
 
Each of our vendors is required to adhere to our vendor standards, which are designed to ensure that our vendors conduct their business in a legal, ethical and responsible manner. This also includes the requirement that all of our vendors comply with the applicable laws and regulations of the United States, those of the respective country of manufacture or exportation and all state and local laws and regulations.
 
Our Sales Channels
 
We conduct business through our boutiques and our ecommerce website, www.francescas.com. We do not incorporate the information contained on, or accessible through, our investor relations website into this Annual Report on Form 10-K, and it should not be considered a part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Boutiques

Boutique Design and Environment
 
The differentiated shopping experience offered through our boutiques is central to the francesca’s® brand. Our boutiques are designed and merchandised to deliver a warm and inviting atmosphere that creates the sense for our customers that they are shopping in an upscale boutique. We also aim to provide a personalized in-boutique guest experience by creating a high-touch service environment with a focus on engaging, connecting and inspiring our customers. Although we strive to maintain a relatively consistent look and feel in all of our boutiques, the intricacies of each boutique’s physical properties, geographic market and shopping venue make each feel different and in tune with its local clientele.
 
Our boutiques typically range in size from 1,000 to 2,000 square feet, with an average size of 1,420 square feet. We seek locations that have a boutique front that is at least 20 feet wide, which we adorn with visually appealing architectural lighting, signage and display window presentations. Inside, we use a variety of color palettes and soft lighting. Each boutique’s merchandise presentation, including display windows, tables and walls, is refreshed frequently to keep our shopping experience new and exciting. We believe by constantly changing our visual merchandising and presentation, we give our customers a reason to shop our boutiques frequently, building customer loyalty. Our boutique managers also share best-practices with each other. We believe these grass-root interactions improve the sense of community among our boutique managers and enhance the shopping experience for our customers.
 
Staffing in our boutiques consists of a boutique manager, an assistant manager and a minimum of three part-time associates. Our compensation structure includes a bonus component payable upon the achievement of certain financial goals. We endeavor to hire boutique personnel that are friendly and customer-service driven individuals. In addition to training programs for visual merchandising, customer service and operations, boutique managers benefit from ongoing field-level support and training updates as well as guides and manuals.
 
New Boutique Economics
 
We believe that our broad and shallow or scarcity merchandising strategy and the differentiated shopping experience we provide to our customers contributes to the success of our boutiques and generates attractive economic returns. During fiscal year 2016, we opened 64 boutiques with an average size of approximately 1,597 square feet. These boutiques generated average sales of approximately $711,000 in the first year and paid back our net investment, on average, in less than 15 months. Our average pre-tax net investment consisted of $158,000 in average boutique build-out costs (net of $77,000 average tenant allowance) and $52,000 in average inventory. The payback period for boutiques opened in fiscal year 2016 was slightly longer compared to the payback period for boutiques opened in prior years primarily due to increasing boutique build-out costs, partly as a result of opening more boutiques in outlet centers, which are generally larger in size compared to boutiques in other venues.
Boutique Growth and Site Selection
 
We have consistently grown our boutique base. The table below indicates certain historical information regarding our boutiques as of the end of each of the periods indicated below:

 | Fiscal Year 2017 | | Fiscal Year 2016 | | | Fiscal Year 2015 | | Fiscal Year 2014 | Fiscal Year 2013 |

1) | Non-mall includes boutiques in lifestyle centers, street locations, strip centers and outlet centers.
---+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


2) | Average square feet per boutique is calculated by dividing total gross square feet at the end of the period by the number of boutiques open at the end of the period.
---+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


3) | Net sales per average square foot is calculated by dividing net sales for the period by the average total square feet during the period. For purposes of providing net sales per square foot measure, we use average square feet during the period as opposed to total gross square feet at the end of the period. Average square feet is calculated as (a) the sum of total gross square feet at the beginning of the period and total gross square feet at the end of each fiscal quarter within the period, divided by (b) the number of fiscal quarters within the period plus one (which, for a fiscal year, is five). There may be variations in the way in which some of our competitors and other retailers calculate sales per square foot or similarly titled measures. As a result, average square feet and net sales per average square foot for the period may not be comparable to similar data made available by other retailers.
---+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Our flexible boutique format has enabled us to successfully open boutiques across a variety of shopping venues, market sizes, climates and demographics. We believe this provides us with a wide scope of real estate opportunities and enhances our ability to profitably expand our boutique base. Based on our rigorous real estate selection process, our flexible boutique format and the financial characteristics of our boutiques, we believe the per boutique costs associated with opening new boutiques over the next twelve months should not be materially different from our current costs for opening new boutiques. We expect to fund the costs of our boutique growth through cash flow generated by our operations. We expect to open boutiques in high traffic locations within both new and existing markets and across regional malls, lifestyle centers, street locations, strip centers and outlet centers. We expect our overall boutique mix to consist of approximately 45% mall and 55% non-mall, if we are successful in opening more than 900 boutiques.
 
Our real estate committee utilizes a disciplined approach to site selection, which analyzes the prospective shopping venue for factors such as overall shopping venue productivity, competitive environment and specific sales of other retailers deemed most relevant as well as the configuration of available space for potential new boutique locations. We seek prominent locations in high-traffic areas of the shopping venue and in close proximity to other retailers targeting similar customers. We also evaluate each new boutique location based on projected sales and determine whether the capital investment and estimated boutique four-wall contribution satisfies our targeted return threshold, occupancy costs, and boutique contribution.
 
See Item 1A, “Risk Factors” for certain risks related to our boutiques growth and site selection.
 
Existing Boutiques 
 
We continuously review the overall economic performance of our boutiques. As part of our economic review process, we evaluate a variety of factors such as expected future revenue and contribution margin, applicable market conditions, our co-tenancy requirements, unamortized portion of leasehold improvements, our ability to terminate the underlying lease obligation and related cost of any such early termination. As a result of such review, we closed 10 underperforming boutiques during fiscal year 2017 and we plan to close approximately 20 underperforming boutiques in fiscal year 2018.
 
In fiscal year 2018, we will embark upon a remodel program and expect to refresh approximately 80 to 90 of our high volume existing boutiques. We view this refresh program as a necessary investment to continually enhance the differentiated customer shopping experience we strive to achieve.
 
Ecommerce
 
Our ecommerce operations consists of our www.francescas.com website. Through our website, our customers are able to purchase individual items, shop the latest jewelry, gift or fashion merchandise and special promotions, create a wish list, sign up for our customer email list, connect and follow us on social media sites such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and Pinterest, as well as obtain current information on our boutique locations. This channel enables us to further build our brand, address the growing preference for online shopping and reach customers in all areas where we currently do not have a boutique. We recognize the growing preference for online shopping and we will continue to make investments in our website and supporting functions, such as distribution, that will further enhance our customers’ shopping experience as well as establish the framework for our long-term ecommerce strategies. We believe there is significant potential to expand this channel over time. 
Omni Channel Customer Experience
 
In fiscal year 2017, we made significant investments in our technology systems and enabled certain omni channel capabilities, including “buy-online and ship-to-boutique” and “buy-in-boutique and ship-to-home,” which offer a consistent and seamless shopping experience both in-boutique or online. In fiscal 2018, we will continue to make omni channel investments that will enable us to have a holistic view of our boutique and ecommerce inventory. As a result of these efforts, we believe that the line between our boutiques and ecommerce channels are disappearing as customers increasingly interact with us both in-boutique and online. We are focused on leveraging the best of both channels to create an exceptional and seamless omni channel shopping experience for our customers.

Marketing and Advertising
 
We have historically focused on organic, viral and in-boutique marketing to increase customer loyalty and build our brand image. By locating our boutiques in prominent, high-traffic locations and our limited use of traditional radio and print advertising, we encourage people to ‘discover’ francesca’s ®. We believe that many of our customers develop a personal connection with our boutiques and become our ambassadors in the local community by spreading the word about francesca’s®. Our boutique managers are passionate about francesca’s ® and contribute to our marketing effort by participating in shopping center or community sponsored marketing events. We also use email communications, our website and, increasingly, social networking sites, such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and Pinterest and fashion related blogs to achieve our marketing goals. We plan to continue to strengthen, evolve and invest in the appropriate marketing programs to build customer loyalty. In October 2017, we completed the roll-out of our new point-of-sale software which will enable us to gather emails and phone numbers from our guests. We will use this information to appropriately tailor our branding and marketing initiatives to our core guests, as well as to help launch a nationwide customer loyalty program in fiscal year 2018.
Distribution
 
We distribute most of our merchandise from our distribution center (located within our corporate headquarters) in Houston, Texas. Our current facility occupies approximately 218,000 square feet, consisting of approximately 165,000 square feet of warehouse and distribution space, which services our boutiques and ecommerce, and approximately 53,000 square feet of office space for our corporate headquarters. Our merchandise is generally received, inspected, managed, stored and distributed through our distribution warehouse. The majority of our merchandise is pre-ticketed and pre-sorted by our vendors which allows us to efficiently ship from our distribution center directly to our boutiques, thereby reducing labor costs. Due to the relatively small size of our sales area, we ship smaller packages of fresh merchandise five days a week. Hence, we are able to utilize third party shipping vendors to effectively distribute merchandise on a continuous basis, ensuring successful execution of our broad and shallow or scarcity merchandising strategy. We believe that our current facilities will be sufficient to support our growth plans for several years.
Management Information Systems
 
Our management information technology systems provide support and timely information to our management team. We believe our current systems provide us with operational efficiencies, scalability, management control and timely reporting that allows us to identify and respond to operating trends in our business. We use a combination of customized and industry-standard software systems to support boutique point-of-sale, merchandise planning and buying, ecommerce, inventory management, financial reporting and administrative functions.
 
We are in the process of deploying a new technology suite of systems to enhance our omni channel and customer engagement capabilities as part of our long-term strategic plan. This includes replacing our legacy point-of-sale system and the introduction of a new customer relationship management system which we completed during fiscal year 2017. We also started the implementation of a new order management system and will begin implementation on a new warehouse management system for ecommerce. Both projects are expected to be completed in fiscal year 2018. We expect that these new systems will enhance our visibility into our customers’ preferences, merchandise and supply chain resulting in improved customer service, improved operational efficiency, enhanced management analytics and increased inventory synergies between our ecommerce and our boutique channels.
 
We will remain diligent in our efforts to continuously improve the functionality and performance of our existing enterprise applications and infrastructure to support the Company’s continued growth.
 
Competition
 
The women’s apparel, jewelry, accessories and gifts market is large, fragmented and highly competitive. Our largest competitors include national and regional department stores, specialty retailers, mass merchants and internet-based retailers. Due to the breadth of our merchandise, it is difficult to identify companies that compete with us in every product category. We generally compete with individual, often owner-operated specialty shops in each of the markets that we operate as well as broadly merchandised department stores and certain specialty stores. We may face new competitors and increased competition from existing competitors as we expand into new markets and increase our presence in existing markets.

The principal basis upon which we compete is by offering a differentiated shopping experience through quality, on-trend merchandise at attractive prices in a warm and inviting boutique environment with personalized customer service. Our manageable boutique size and flexible but disciplined real estate strategy provide us with a competitive advantage that is not easily replicated by our major competitors. Our success also depends in substantial part on our ability to respond quickly to fashion trends so that we can meet the changing demands of our customers.
 
Intellectual Property
 
We have registered our trademark francesca’s® with the United States Patent and Trademark Office. We own domain names, including www.francescas.com, and we own unregistered copyright rights in our website content. We believe our trademarks have value, and we diligently protect them against infringement. For instance, we have filed applications to register our trademark internationally. We will also continue to file new applications as appropriate to protect our intellectual property rights.
Regulation and Legislation
 
We are subject to labor and employment laws, laws governing advertising and promotions, privacy laws, product and other safety regulations, consumer protection regulations, environmental requirements and other laws that regulate retailers and govern the promotion and sale of merchandise and the operation of boutiques and warehouse facilities. We monitor changes in these laws and believe that we are in compliance with applicable laws in all material respects.
Insurance
 
We use insurance for a number of risk management activities, including workers’ compensation, general liability, automobile liability, cyber security and employee-related health care benefits, a portion of which is paid by the employees. We evaluate our insurance requirements on an ongoing basis and believe we maintain adequate levels of coverage.
Our Employees
 
As of February 3, 2018, we had 6,447 total employees. Of our total employees, 270 were based at our corporate headquarters in Houston, Texas, and 6,177 were boutique employees. We had 1,328 full-time employees and 5,119 part-time employees, who are primarily boutique employees. None of our employees are represented by a labor union and we have had no labor-related work stoppages as of February 3, 2018. Our relationship with our employees is one of the keys to our success and we believe that relationship is satisfactory.
Seasonality
 
Our wide-range of merchandise and our strategy of carrying a broad selection but limited quantities of each item reduce our overall seasonality relative to other specialty retailers. Nevertheless, our business is seasonal in nature and demand is generally the highest in the fourth fiscal quarter due to the year-end holiday season and lowest in the first fiscal quarter. As a result of this seasonality and generally because of variation in consumer spending habits, we experience fluctuations in net sales and working capital requirements during the year. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Seasonality” for more information.
Privacy Policy
 
In the course of our business, we collect information about our customers, including customer data submitted to us in connection with purchases of our merchandise at boutiques as well as from our ecommerce website. We respect the privacy of our customers and take steps to safeguard the confidentiality of the information that they provide to us.
