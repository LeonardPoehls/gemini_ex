ITEM 1. | BUSINESS
--------+---------

 In February 1998, HopFed Bancorp, Inc. (the Corporation) issued and sold 4,033,625 shares of common stock, par value $.01 per share (the Common Stock), in connection with the conversion of Hopkinsville Federal Savings Bank (the Savings Bank) from a federal mutual savings bank to a federal stock savings bank and the issuance of the Savings Banks capital stock to the Corporation. The conversion of the Savings Bank, the acquisition of all of the outstanding capital stock of the Savings Bank by the Corporation and the issuance and sale of the Common Stock are collectively referred to herein as the Conversion. In June of 2010, the Corporation issued and sold 3,333,334 shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share in connection with a common stock offering. In July 2010, the Corporation issued and sold an additional 250,000 shares of common stock. Both sales were completed at an offering price of $9.00 per share ($8.55 net of expenses). After underwriting fees and selling expenses, the Corporation received additional capital proceeds of approximately $30.4 million. 
 HopFed Bancorp, Inc. 
 HopFed Bancorp, Inc. was incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware in May 1997 at the direction of the Board of Directors of the Bank to serve as a savings and loan holding company of the Bank upon the acquisition of all of the capital stock issued by the Bank in the Conversion. On June 5, 2013, the Corporations bank subsidiary, Heritage Bank, changed its name to Heritage Bank USA, Inc., (the Bank), converting its charter from a federal thrift to a Kentucky state chartered commercial bank. Likewise, the Corporation converted its charter to a Federal Reserve non-member commercial bank holding company. The Corporations assets primarily consist of the outstanding capital stock of the Bank. The Corporations principal business is overseeing the business of the Bank. See Regulation  Regulation of the Company. As a holding company, the Corporation has greater flexibility than the Bank to diversify its business activities through existing or newly formed subsidiaries or through acquisition or merger with other financial institutions. The consolidated results of the Bank and the Corporation are referred to as the Company. The Companys executive offices are located at 4155 Lafayette Road, Hopkinsville, Kentucky 42240, and its main telephone number is (270) 885-1171. The Companys mailing address is P.O. Box 537, Hopkinsville, Kentucky 42241-0537. 
 Heritage Bank USA, Inc. 
 The Bank is a Kentucky state chartered commercial bank headquartered in Hopkinsville, Kentucky, with branch offices in Kentucky and Tennessee. The Kentucky locations include Hopkinsville, Murray, Cadiz, Elkton, Fulton, Calvert City and Benton. The Tennessee locations include Clarksville, Pleasant View, Ashland City, Kingston Springs and Erin. In October 2014, the Bank opened a loan production office in Nashville, Tennessee. In October 2016, the Bank opened a loan production office in Brentwood, Tennessee. The Bank was incorporated by the Commonwealth of Kentucky in 1879 under the name Hopkinsville Building and Loan Association. In 1940, the Bank converted to a federal mutual savings association and received federal insurance of its deposit accounts. In 1983, the Bank became a federal mutual savings bank. On May 14, 2002, the Bank changed its name from Hopkinsville Federal Bank to Heritage Bank. On June 5, 2013, the Bank changed its legal name to Heritage Bank USA, Inc. The primary market area of the Bank consists of the adjacent counties of Calloway, Christian, Todd, Trigg, Fulton, and Marshall located in southwestern Kentucky and Montgomery, Cheatham, Houston, Davidson, Obion and Weakley counties located in Tennessee. 
 The business of the Bank primarily consists of attracting deposits from the general public and investing such deposits in loans secured by single family residential real estate and investment securities, including U.S. Government and agency securities, municipal and corporate bonds, collateralized mortgages obligations (CMOs), and mortgage-backed securities. The Bank also originates single-family residential/construction loans and multi-family and commercial real estate loans, as well as loans secured by deposits, other consumer loans and commercial loans. The Bank emphasizes the origination of commercial and real estate loans.

Subsidiary Activities 
 The Bank owns JBMM, LLC, a wholly owned, limited liability company, owns and manages the Banks other real estate and other assets owned. The Bank owns Heritage Interim Corporation, a Tennessee corporation established to facilitate the acquisition of a bank in Tennessee. The proposed acquisition was terminated in August of 2013. The Bank owns Heritage USA Title, LLC, which sells title insurance to the Banks real estate loan customers. 
 The Bank owns Fort Webb LP, LLC, which owns a limited partnership interest in Fort Webb LP, LLC, a low income senior citizen housing facility in Bowling Green, Kentucky. The facility offers apartments for rent for those senior citizens who qualify and is managed by the Bowling Green, Kentucky Housing Authority. The Company receives tax credits and Community Reinvestment Credits for its original $420,000 investment. At December 31, 2016, the Company has no remaining balance on its books related to Fort Webb, LP, LLC. However, we anticipate that the Company will continue to receive tax benefits in the form of partnership depreciation expense for several years.

Growth Opportunities 
 For the year ended December 31, 2016, the Companys net loan portfolio balance was $604.3 million, representing an increase of $47.9 million, or 8.6%, as compared to December 31, 2015. For the six month period ended June 30, 2016, net loan growth was $4.4 million. For the six month period beginning July 1, 2016, and ended December 31, 2016, loan growth was approximately $43.5 million. 
 In 2016, the Companys loan growth largely occurred in two markets. For the year ended December 31, 2016, the Companys Christian County, Kentucky, market experienced loan growth of $31.4 million, or 30.6%. The Companys loan growth in its home market was the result of improving sentiment on the future of the economy and long term marketing efforts by our loan officers. At December 31, 2016, the Christian County, Kentucky, market had loan balances of $127.0 million. The Nashville, Tennessee, loan production office (Nashville LPO) experienced loan growth of $26.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. At December 31, 2016, the Nashville LPO had loan balances of $42.5 million.

For the year ended December 31, 2016, the Companys non-residential loan portfolio grew by $40.2 million, or approximately 18.7%, as compared to December 31, 2015. At December 31, 2016, the Companys non-owner occupied non-residential loan portfolio (NOOCRE) was $104.3 million, representing an increase of $36.9 million, as compared to December 31, 2015. At December 31, 2016, the Companys growth in NOOCRE largely occurred in the following asset categories: 
 

Asset category | 2016 Growth | 
Retail | $ | 12.6 million
Hotel | $ | 3.3 million 
Office building | $ | 5.0 million 
Warehouse / Other | $ | 8.5 million 
Construction | $ | 4.3 million 
Farmland | $ | 5.6 million 

 For the year ended December 31, 2016, the Companys multi-family and construction loan portfolios grew by $9.6 million and $4.3 million, respectively, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. At December 31, 2016, total consumer loans and loans secured by deposits totaled $8.7 million, a decline of $11.6 million as compared to December 31, 2015. The reduction in consumer loans for the year ended December 31, 2016, was largely the result of the liquidation of collateral on one large loan relationship. 
 The Company has chosen not to seek land loans to augment loan growth. At December 31, 2009, total land loans were $64.5 million, as compared to $23.8 million at December 31, 2016. At December 31, 2016, the Company has $8.2 million in land loans classified as substandard, representing 28.0% of all substandard loans and 34.4% of total land loans. At December 31, 2016, $7.7 million of land loans are in non-accrual status, representing 84.6% of total non-accrual loan balances. At December 31, 2016, the Company has chosen not to incur the additional risk associated with these types of lending relationships and remains committed to resolving the small number of adversely classified loans in our portfolio. 
 In October 2014, the Company opened a loan production office in Nashville, Tennessee (Nashville). Nashville is approximately 70 miles from the Companys headquarters and one of the fastest growing markets in the country. The Companys goal was to establish a successful loan production office and use that success to build a modest branch network into the suburban areas surrounding Nashville. As the demographic information on the following pages suggest, the Nashville MSA provides the Company with an unlimited amount of growth opportunities not found in our more rural markets. In October of 2016, the Company opened a second loan production office in the Nashville suburb of Brentwood, Tennessee (Brentwood LPO). The purpose of the Brentwood LPO is to enhance our ability to originate residential home mortgages sold on the secondary market. 
 For the year ended December 31, 2015, the Companys loan portfolio grew by $17.0 million, or 3.2%. Prior to the year ended December 31, 2015, the Companys loan growth was negative in four of the last five years. The negative loan growth was the result of several factors, including the deployment of more than 15,000 troops from nearby Fort Campbell, Kentucky to Afghanistan, which resulted in a reduced level of economic activity, lower sales for merchants, weaker demand for most goods and services and reduced tax collections. Furthermore, the deployment of troops occurred during a time of a national recession, further exasperating the weakness in the local economy 
 In response to the decline in loan demand, the Company sought to reduce the size of its balance sheet and its cost of interest bearing liabilities. At April 30, 2010, the Company had brokered deposits totaling $103.4 million as compared to $33.4 million at December 31, 2016. The Company has also reduced the balance of Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) borrowings from $81.9 million at December 31, 2010, to $11.0 million at December 31, 2016. The reduction of FHLB borrowings include early repayments of $35.9 million in borrowings on December 30, 2014, resulting in $2.5 million prepayment penalty. 
 In addition to reducing the level of wholesale funding, the Companys funding mix has significantly improved, resulting in a lower level of interest expenses. At December 31, 2016, total time deposits (including brokered) were $293.1 million, a decline of $21.6 million and $38.8 million as compared to December 31, 2015, and December 31, 2014, respectively. At December 31, 2016, the Companys time deposit balances accounted for 40.0% of total deposits as compared to 42.6% of total deposits at December 31, 2015, and 45.4% at December 31, 2014.

The Companys opportunities for improved profitability are believed to lie in a balanced growth of loans and lower cost deposits while maintaining acceptable credit standards. The Company views its core markets of Western Kentucky and Middle Tennessee as important foundations to our future. The Nashville MSA appears to provide the Company with the best opportunity for meaningful loan growth. 
 Western Kentucky 
 Small manufacturing and agri-business interests are the largest drivers of the local economy in our Western Kentucky markets. In Western Kentucky, small manufacturing typically revolves around the automotive, transportation, and chemical industries. The manufacturing sector is reasonably strong in the immediate area with most factories operating near capacity. Unemployment rates are low in many counties in Western Kentucky due largely to the rebound in automobile sales. 
 In 2016, local farmers enjoyed strong yields on their crops. However, the continued weak level of commodity prices has made it difficult for all those involved in the agri-business sector. Agri-business profitability remains marginal at best. In 2017, the agri-business community anticipates the operating conditions will remain challenging without a meaningful increase in commodity prices, which are projected to remain weak into 2018. Weak commodity prices have resulted in a stabilization of the price of agricultural land, which remain near historical highs. 
 The tables below are a summary of selected information from the 2010 U.S. Census related to the Companys current market areas. The source of our future growth projections was the 2011 Kentucky State Data Center at the University of Louisville. At December 31, 2016, Kentuckys unemployment rate was 4.8%. The unemployment data by market was obtained from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (www.bls.gov/LAU):

Clarksville, Montgomery County, Tennessee (Clarksville) 
 The Clarksville market is the largest market in which the Company has a significant retail banking presence. The Clarksville economy has several large employers and economic drivers including the United States (U.S.) Armys 101st Airborne Division with approximately 29,000 active duty military personnel and 3,900 civilian employees assigned to the division. Fort Campbell supports the third largest military population in the U.S. Army and the seventh largest in the U.S. Department of Defense. The many services available on the army installation and the communitys modest cost of living have resulted in a sizable military retirement population in the area. Clarksville is also home to Austin Peay State University, a 10,000 student public university as well as a diverse manufacturing sector. The unemployment rate for Montgomery County, Tennessee in December 2016 was 5.2%. 
 In October of 2013, Hankook Tires announced the construction of its U.S. manufacturing facility in Clarksville. Hankook, a South Korean tire company, has invested approximately $800 million in a new facility. Hankook anticipates that tire production will begin in 2017 and will result in approximately 1,800 full time jobs for the local economy. Hankook chose Clarksville due to its ideal location, strong transportation network and its proximity to automotive assembly plants owned by Nissan, Volkswagen, Toyota and General Motors. 
 The Clarksville market exhibits stronger growth and income demographics as compared to the communities in Western Kentucky. The 2010 census noted that Clarksville had a median household income of $48,930 and a $129,400 median value of owner occupied housing units. Clarksvilles demographics benefit by its proximity to the Fort Campbell Army base; its proximity to Nashville, Tennessee; and the absence of a state income tax.

 Middle Tennessee and Nashville MSA 
 Cheatham County (Cheatham) and Houston County (Houston) are located in Middle Tennessee. Both communities are rural and residents of both communities typically rely on employment opportunities in neighboring communities, as neither county has a sizeable base of manufacturing jobs. However, Cheatham is located within the Nashville MSA, and its three largest communities are an easy commute to downtown Nashville. Cheathams proximity to Nashville has resulted in higher levels of income and population growth as compared to Houston. In December of 2016, the unemployment rates in Cheatham and Houston were 4.0% and 7.2%, respectively. In December of 2016, the unemployment rates in the state of Tennessee and the Nashville MSA are 4.9% and 3.8%, respectively.

The Company opened our Nashville LPO in October of 2014 and our Brentwood LPO (located in Williamson County, Tennessee) in October of 2016. The Nashville MSA has a population of approximately 1.6 million (includes Cheatham County, Tennessee) and attractive demographics outlined below:

In addition to the Clarksville and Nashville MSA markets, management views promising opportunities for growth in the midsize metropolitan markets near the Companys current locations. Highly desirable markets include Bowling Green, Kentucky, Hardin, Kentucky, and Louisville, Kentucky. These markets provide desirable demographic and growth opportunities as compared to the Companys current footprint. As evident in the table below, Kentucky growth opportunities may be most attractive in Bowling Green, which is approximately 65 miles from the Companys corporate headquarters. The tables below include the two largest counties by population in Kentucky and other communities in Kentucky within a two-hour drive of the Companys headquarters:

2015 HopFed Bancorp, Inc. Employee Stock Ownership Plan 
 On March 2, 2015, the Company implemented the HopFed Bancorp, Inc. 2015 Employee Stock Ownership Plan (the ESOP) which covers substantially all employees who are at least 21 years old with at least one year of employment with the Company and the Bank. Bank contributions to the ESOP replaced matching and profit sharing contributions to the Heritage Bank 401(k) Plan sponsored by the Bank. All employees of the Company and its subsidiaries meeting the required service requirements participate in the ESOP. The Companys Board of Directors selected three individuals to serve as trustees. The Company has hired a directed corporate trustee to assist with the administration of the plan. The ESOP will be administered by a committee (the Committee) comprised of eleven employees approved by the Banks Board of Directors. 
 On March 2, 2015, the ESOP entered into a loan agreement with the Company to borrow up to $13.5 million to purchase up to 1.0 million shares common stock (ESOP loan). On the same date, the ESOP purchased an initial block of 600,000 shares from the Company at a cost of $7,884,000 using the proceeds of the ESOP Loan. In accordance with the ESOP loan documents, the common stock purchased by the ESOP serves as collateral for the ESOP loan. The ESOP loan is being repaid from discretionary contributions by the Bank to the ESOP and by dividends paid on unearned shares held in the trust over a period ending no later than December 9, 2026. The interest rate on the ESOP Loan is 3.0%. The administrative trustee has custody of the common shares owned by the ESOP. Common shares are allocated among participants as the ESOP loan is repaid. The ESOP shares receive dividend payments and dividends on unearned shares are used to make the ESOP loan payment. For the years ended December 31, 2016, and December 31, 2015, the Company incurred compensation expense of $553,000 and $652,000, respectively, to fund the ESOP loan payment. For the years ended December 31, 2016, and December 31, 2015, the Companys ESOP released 48,067 and 53,587 shares of stock, respectively, to individual employees participating in the plan at December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.

 Scheduled contractual principal repayments of loans do not reflect the actual life of such assets. The average life of loans is substantially less than their contractual terms because of prepayments. In addition, due-on-sale clauses on loans generally give the lender the right to declare a loan immediately due and payable in the event, among other things, that the borrower sells the real property subject to the mortgage and the loan is not repaid. The average life of mortgage loans tends to increase when current mortgage loan market rates are substantially higher than rates on existing mortgage loans and, conversely, decrease when current mortgage loan market rates are substantially lower than rates on existing mortgage loans. 
 In the last ten years, the Company has attempted to diversify its loan portfolio mix to mitigate the risk of lending in a geographically limited area. The Company uses several metrics to measure our relative success in this area. The table below identifies loan balances by type as a percentage of total consolidated risk based capital: 
 Management measures commercial real estate (CRE) concentrations as discussed in Concentrations of Commercial Real Estate Lending, Sound Risk Management Practices issued on December 12, 2006, jointly by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Federal Reserve) and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). In this guidance, the agencies make a significant distinction between owner-occupied CRE and non-owner occupied CRE. The agencies have a heightened level of concern with those loans with risk profiles sensitive to the condition of the CRE market. 
 CRE loans secured by non-farm, non-residential CRE where the primary source of repayment is the cash flow from the ongoing operations and activities conducted by the owner of the property are excluded from the guidance. The Bank has used the FDICs call report instructions to calculate that $201.6 million of our loan portfolio, or 206.2% of the Banks risk based capital, consists of properties classified as non-owner occupied commercial real estate. Non-owner occupied commercial real estate loans include all loans secured by multi-family properties, all construction and land development loans and certain other commercial real estate loans identified by regulations as non-owner occupied. Included in the definition of commercial real estate are $39.3 million in construction loans and $23.8 million in land development loans, representing 40.2% and 24.4% of the Banks risk based capital, respectively. Both of our concentration categories are within regulatory guidelines and appear reasonable to management at this time.

Originations, Purchases and Sales of Loans. The Bank generally has authority to originate and purchase loans secured by real estate located throughout the United States. Consistent with its emphasis on being a community-oriented financial institution, the Bank conducts substantially all of its lending activities inside its market area. The following table sets forth certain information with respect to loan origination activity for the periods indicated.

 Loan originations are derived from a number of sources, including existing customers, referrals by real estate agents, depositors and borrowers and advertising, as well as walk-in customers. Solicitation programs consist of advertisements in local media, in addition to occasional participation in various community organizations and events. Real estate loans are originated by the Banks loan personnel. All of the loan personnel are salaried and may receive additional compensation on a commission basis based on achieving certain performance goals. Loan applications are accepted at any of the Banks branches. 
 Loan Underwriting Policies. Lending activities are subject to written, non-discriminatory underwriting standards and to loan origination procedures prescribed by the Board of Directors and its management. Detailed loan applications are obtained to determine the ability of borrowers to repay, and the more significant items on these applications are verified through the use of credit reports, financial statements and confirmations. Loan requests exceeding loan officer limits must be approved by the Chief Credit Officer, Chief Executive Officer, the executive loan committee of the Board of Directors or the entire Board of Directors. 
 Generally, upon receipt of a loan application from a prospective borrower, a credit report and verifications are ordered to confirm specific information relating to the loan applicants employment, income and credit standing. If a proposed loan is to be secured by a mortgage on real estate, an appraisal of the real estate is undertaken by an appraiser approved by the Board of Directors and licensed or certified (as necessary) by the Commonwealth of Kentucky or the State of Tennessee. In the case of one-to-four family residential mortgage loans, except when the Bank becomes aware of a particular risk of environmental contamination, the Bank generally does not obtain a formal environmental report on the real estate. A formal environmental report may be required in connection with nonresidential real estate loans. 
 It is the Banks policy to record a lien on the real estate securing a loan and to obtain a title opinion from Kentucky and Tennessee counsel who provides that the property is free of prior encumbrances and other possible title defects. Title Insurance is generally required on all real estate loans with balances exceeding $100,000 and all one-to-four family loans that are to be sold in the secondary market. 
 
12 
 
Borrowers must also obtain hazard insurance policies prior to closing and, when the property is in a flood hazard area, pay flood insurance policy premiums. The majority of real estate loan applications are underwritten and closed in accordance with the Banks own lending guidelines, which generally do not conform to secondary market guidelines. Although such loans may not be readily saleable in the secondary market, management believes that, if necessary, such loans may be sold to private investors at a discount to par. 
 The Bank offers a residential fixed rate loan program with maturities of 15, 20, and 30 years. The majority of our fixed rate single-family loans are underwritten and closed in accordance with secondary market standards. The Bank originates these loans with intent to sell on the secondary market. However, the Bank may choose to maintain a certain percentage of these loans in our portfolio. The Bank offers both servicing retained and servicing released products in an attempt to meet the needs of our customers. Due to the increasing level of regulatory burden imposed on companies that provide servicing for single family home loans, our pricing strategy provides incentives for the vast majority of our customers to select a servicing released loan product. At December 31, 2016, the Banks 1-4 family loan servicing portfolio was approximately $19.7 million. 
 The Bank may lend up to 100% of the appraised value of the residential real property securing a mortgage loan. Under its lending policies, the Bank will originate a one-to-four family residential mortgage loan for owner-occupied property with a loan-to-value ratio of up to 95%. For residential properties that are not owner-occupied, the Bank generally does not lend more than 80% of the appraised value. For all residential mortgage loans, the Bank may increase its lending level on a case-by-case basis. At December 31, 2016, the Bank held approximately $2.5 million of 1-4 family residential mortgages with a loan to value ratio exceeding 90% without private mortgage insurance. For these loans at December 31, 2016, no loans with a loan to value exceeding 90% without private mortgage insurance is in non-accrual status and $24,000 of loans with a loan to value exceeding 90% without private mortgage insurance are past due more than 30 days but less than 89 days. 
 Under applicable law, with certain limited exceptions, loans and extensions of credit outstanding by a commercial bank to a person at one time shall not exceed 15% of the institutions unimpaired capital and surplus. Loans and extensions of credit fully secured by readily marketable collateral may comprise an additional 10% of unimpaired capital and surplus. Under these limits, the Banks loans to one borrower were limited to approximately $14.7 million at December 31, 2016. At that date, the Bank had no lending relationships in excess of the loans-to-one-borrower limit. 
 Interest rates charged by the Bank on loans are affected principally by competitive factors, the demand for such loans and the supply of funds available for lending purposes. These factors are, in turn, affected by general economic conditions, monetary policies of the federal government, including the Federal Reserve Board, legislative tax policies and government budgetary matters. 
 One-to-four Family Residential Lending. The Bank historically has been and continues to be an originator of one-to-four family residential real estate loans in its market area. At December 31, 2016, one-to-four family residential mortgage loans totaled approximately $185.1 million, or 30.3% of the Banks loan portfolio. The Bank originated approximately $54.7 million in loans that the Bank sold in the secondary market with servicing released. At December 31, 2016, the Bank had approximately $672,000 in one-to-four family residential real estate loans past due more than ninety days or in non-accrual status. At December 31, 2016, the Companys allowance for loan loss included $1.1 million for one-to-four family residential lending. 
 
13 
 
As of December 31, 2016, 64.6% of one-to-four family mortgage loans in the Banks loan portfolio carried adjustable rates or mature within one year. The Banks one to four family loan portfolio consists of closed end first and second mortgages as well as opened ended home equity lines of credit. At December 31, 2016, approximately $149.4 million of the Banks residential mortgage portfolio consisted of closed end first and junior liens. Such loans are originated for 15, 20 and 30 year terms, in each case amortized on a monthly basis with principal and interest due each month. The interest rates on adjustable rate mortgages are adjusted once per year, with a maximum adjustment of 1% per adjustment period and a maximum aggregate adjustment of 5% over the life of the loan. All adjustable rate first mortgage loans use the one-year Treasury bill constant maturity (One Year CMT). In 2004, the Bank increased its margin on its adjustable rate loans to 3.00% from 2.75%. 
 The Bank also originates fixed-rate loans for terms up to 30 years. Fixed rate loans are secured by first mortgages on one-to-four family residential real property located in the Banks market area. Because of the Banks policy to mitigate its exposure to interest rate risk through the use of adjustable rate rather than fixed rate products, the Bank does not prioritize fixed-rate mortgage loans. At December 31, 2016, $65.5 million of the Banks loan portfolio consisted of fixed-rate one-to-four family first mortgage loans that will mature after December 31, 2017. 
 At December 31, 2016, the Bank had $35.7 million in home equity lines of credit outstanding and $31.8 million of additional credit available. Typically, these loans are for a term of fifteen years and have loan to value ratio of 80% to 100%. The home equity portfolio is priced at a spread to prime, adjusted daily, depending on the customers loan to value ratio at the time of origination. Many of the home equity lines of credit require monthly interest payments with all unpaid interest and principal due at maturity. 
 The retention of adjustable rate loans in the Banks portfolio helps reduce, but does not eliminate, the Banks exposure to increases in prevailing market interest rates. However, there are unquantifiable credit risks resulting from potential increases in costs to borrowers in the event of upward re-pricing of adjustable-rate loans. It is possible that during periods of rising interest rates, the risk of default on adjustable rate loans may increase due to increases in interest costs to borrowers. Further, although adjustable rate loans allow the Bank to increase the sensitivity of its interest-earning assets to changes in interest rates, the extent of this interest sensitivity is limited by the initial fixed-rate period before the first adjustment and the lifetime interest rate adjustment limitations. This risk is heightened by the Banks prior practice of offering its adjustable rate mortgages with a 2.0% limitation on annual interest rate adjustments. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that yields on the Banks adjustable rate loans will fully adjust to compensate for increases in the Banks cost of funds. 
 Finally, adjustable rate loans increase the Banks exposure to decreases in prevailing market interest rates, although the 1.0% limitation on annual decreases in the loans interest rate tends to offset this effect. In times of declining interest rates, borrowers often refinance into fixed rate loan products, limiting the Banks ability to significantly increase its interest rate margin on adjustable rate loans in a declining interest rate market. In times of increasing interest rates, the 1.0% annual cap on increases in the interest rates tends to reduce refinancing activity and reduce the Banks net interest margin. 
 Neither the fixed rate nor the adjustable rate residential mortgage loans held in the Banks portfolio are originated in conformity with secondary market guidelines issued by FHLMC or FNMA. As a result, such loans may not be readily saleable in the secondary market to institutional purchasers. However, such loans may still be sold to private investors whose investment strategies do not depend upon loans that satisfy FHLMC or FNMA criteria. Further, given its high liquidity, the Bank does not currently view loan sales as a necessary funding source. 
 Construction Lending. The Bank engages in construction lending involving loans to individuals for construction of one-to-four family residential housing, multi-family housing and non-residential real estate located within the Banks market area, with such loans converting to permanent financing upon completion of construction. The Bank mitigates its risk with construction loans by imposing a maximum loan-to-value ratio of 80% for homes that will be owner-occupied or being built on a speculative basis. 
 The Bank also makes loans to qualified builders for the construction of one-to-four family residential housing located in established subdivisions in the Banks market area. All construction loans are secured by a first lien on the property under construction. Loan proceeds are disbursed in increments as construction progresses and as inspections warrant. Construction/permanent loans may have adjustable or fixed interest rates and are underwritten in accordance with the same terms and requirements as the Banks permanent mortgages. 
 
14 
 
Such loans generally provide for disbursement in stages during a construction period of up to eighteen months, during which period the borrower is required to make payments of interest only. The permanent loans are typically 30-year adjustable rate loans, with the same terms and conditions otherwise offered by the Bank. Monthly payments of principal and interest commence the month following the date the loan is converted to permanent financing. Borrowers must satisfy all credit requirements that would apply to the Banks permanent mortgage loan financing prior to receiving construction financing for the subject property. 
 Construction financing generally involves a higher degree of risk of loss than long-term financing on improved, occupied real estate. Risk of loss on a construction loan is dependent largely upon the accuracy of the initial estimate of the propertys value at completion of construction or development and the estimated cost (including interest) of construction. During the construction phase, a number of factors could result in delays and cost overruns. If the estimate of construction costs proves to be inaccurate, the Bank may be confronted at or prior to the maturity of the loan, with a project having a value which is insufficient to assure full repayment. The ability of a developer to sell developed lots or completed dwelling units will depend on, among other things, demand, pricing, availability of comparable properties and economic conditions. The Bank has sought to minimize this risk by limiting construction lending to qualified borrowers in the Banks market area, by requiring the involvement of qualified builders, and by limiting the aggregate amount of outstanding construction loans. 
 At December 31, 2016, the Banks loan portfolio included $39.3 million of loans secured by properties under construction, including construction/permanent loans structured to become permanent loans upon the completion of construction and interim construction loans structured to be repaid in full upon completion of construction and receipt of permanent financing. At December 31, 2016, approximately $6.5 million of construction loans were for one-to-four family dwellings, approximately $8.1 million of construction loans were for multi-family dwellings and $24.7 million were for non-residential real estate. At December 31, 2016, there were no construction loans past due more than ninety days or in non-accrual status. At December 31, 2016, the Banks allowance for loan loss included $277,000 in the reserve for construction loans. 
 Multi-Family Residential and Non-Residential Real Estate Lending. The Banks multi-family residential loan portfolio consists of fixed and adjustable rate loans secured by real estate. At December 31, 2016, the Bank had $34.3 million of multi-family residential loans, which amounted to 5.6% of the Banks loan portfolio at such date. The Banks non-residential real estate portfolio generally consists of adjustable and fixed rate loans secured by first mortgages on commercial real estate, farmland, and raw land. In most cases, such property is located in the Banks market area. At December 31, 2016, the Bank had approximately $254.6 million of such loans, which comprised 41.7% of its loan portfolio. 
 At December 31, 2016, non-residential real estate loans consisted of $47.8 million in farmland, $104.2 million in non-owner occupied properties, and $78.8 million in owner occupied commercial real estate and $23.8 million in raw land. The Company currently has no land under development and all lots are completed and available for sale. At December 31, 2016, approximately $8.2 million, or 34.5% of the Companys land portfolio, are substandard. At December 31, 2016, $2.3 million, or 4.8% of the Companys farmland portfolio are substandard and $10.5 million, or 5.8% of the Companys commercial real estate portfolio, are substandard. 
 At December 31, 2016, there were $208,000 in non-residential real estate loans past due more than ninety days or in non-accrual status. At December 31, 2016, there were $7.7 million in land loans past due more than ninety days or in non-accrual status. At December 31, 2016, the Companys allowance for loan loss included $1.8 million in the reserve for land loans, $964,000 in the reserve for non-residential real estate loans and $778,000 in the reserve for loans secured by farmland. 
 At December 31, 2016, the Company has no land loans currently under development. At December 31, 2016, the inventory of land loans includes 84 fully developed lots available for sale with an aggregate loan balance of $2.2 million. The average lot had an average loan balance of approximately $26,700. Also at December 31, 2016, the Companys loan portfolio includes $14.4 million of land loans for future development currently without meaningful infrastructure in place. The Companys portfolio of land loans designated for future development represent approximately 1,198 acres of land with an average price per acre of approximately $12,000. The remaining $7.2 million in land loans are for personal and recreational purposes.

Multi-family residential real estate loans are underwritten with loan-to-value ratios up to 80% of the appraised value of the property. Non-residential real estate loans are underwritten with loan-to-value ratios up to 65% of the appraised value for raw land and 75% for land development loans. Non-residential real estate loans for agricultural and other non-residential real estate properties are underwritten with loan-to-value ratios up to 85%. 
 Multi-family residential and non-residential real estate lending entails significant additional risks as compared with one-to-four family residential property lending. Multi-family residential and commercial real estate loans typically involve larger loan balances to single borrowers or groups of related borrowers. The payment experience on such loans typically is dependent on the successful operation of the real estate project, retail establishment or business. These risks can be significantly impacted by supply and demand conditions in the market for the office, retail and residential space, and, as such, may be subject to a greater extent to adverse conditions in the economy generally. 
 To minimize these risks, the Bank generally limits itself to its market area or to borrowers with which it has prior experience or who are otherwise known to the Bank. It has been the Banks policy to obtain annual financial statements of the business of the borrower or the project for which multi-family residential real estate or non-residential real estate loans are made. At December 31, 2016, there were no multi-family loans past due more than 90 days or classified as non-accrual. At December 31, 2016, there were $208,000 in loans secured by non-residential real estate or farmland that were past due by 90 days or more or classified as non-accrual and $7.7 million in loans secured by raw land that were past due by 90 days or more or classified as non-accrual. At December 31, 2016, the Companys allowance for loan loss included $412,000 in the reserve for multi-family loans, $1.8 million in the reserve for loans secured by raw land, $778,000 in the reserve for loans secured by farmland and $964,000 in reserve for non-residential real estate loans. 
 Consumer Lending. The consumer loans currently in the Banks loan portfolio consist of loans secured by savings deposits and other consumer loans. Savings deposit loans are usually made for up to 100% of the depositors savings account balance. The interest rate is approximately 2.0% above the rate paid on such deposit account serving as collateral, and the account must be pledged as collateral to secure the loan. Interest on deposit secured loans are payable quarterly. At December 31, 2016, loans on deposit accounts totaled $2.2 million, or 0.3% of the Banks loan portfolio. Other consumer loans include automobile loans, the amount and terms of which are determined by management, and closed end home equity and home improvement loans, which are made for up to 100% of the value of the property. At December 31, 2016, all other consumer loans accounts totaled $6.6 million, or 1.1% of total loans. 
 Consumer loans may entail greater credit risk than do residential mortgage loans, particularly in the case of consumer loans that are unsecured or are secured by rapidly depreciable assets, such as automobiles. In such cases, any repossessed collateral for a defaulted consumer loan may not provide an adequate source of repayment of the outstanding loan balance as a result of the greater likelihood of damage, loss or depreciation. In addition, consumer loan collections are dependent on the borrowers continuing financial stability, and therefore are more likely to be affected by adverse personal circumstances. Furthermore, the application of various federal and state laws, including bankruptcy and insolvency laws, may limit the amount which can be recovered on such loans. At December 31, 2016, $3,000 in consumer loans are delinquent 90 days or more or classified as non-accrual and $335,000 of deposit overdrafts that re-classified as consumer loans. At December 31, 2016, the Companys allowance for loan loss included $208,000 for consumer loans. 
 In 2013, the Company instituted a centralized lending function for all residential real estate and consumer loans. The centralized process allows for a more standardized and consistent credit decision, a more efficient use of Company resources and provides for the concentration of the Companys compliance and documentation expertise. In 2015, the Company expanded the centralized documentation process to include all loan originations.

Commercial Lending. The Bank originates commercial loans on a secured and, to a lesser extent, unsecured basis. At December 31, 2016, the Banks commercial loans amounted to $88.9 million, or 14.6% of the Banks loan portfolio. The Banks commercial loans are secured by business assets or agricultural inventory. In addition, the Bank generally obtains guarantees from the principals of the borrower with respect to all commercial loans. At December 31, 2016, $19.8 million of the Banks commercial loan portfolio were loans to finance agricultural production or other loans to farmers. At December 31, 2016, there was $516,000 in commercial loans delinquent 90 days or more or classified as non-accrual. At December 31, 2016, the Companys allowance for loan loss included $593,000 in reserve for commercial loans. 
 In 2016, net charge offs totaled $829,000, or 0.15% of average loans. In 2016, the Company charged off $764,000 on one lending relationship that resulted in a foreclosure of numerous properties. The Company has placed the related assets as other real estate owned and is now actively marketing the properties. In 2015, the Company experienced an increase in net charge offs as compared to 2014. In 2015, the Companys net charge offs were $1.6 million, or 0.29% of average loan balances. In 2014, the Companys net charge offs were $120,000, which included a $1.1 million in recoveries of previously charged off loans. 
 At December 31, 2016, the Companys level of classified loans to risk based capital is 29.7%. The Company seeks to maintain a level of classified assets at or below 30% of risk based capital. We will continue to focus our efforts to reduce the level of classified assets on our land portfolio, in which two land development loans account for 28.0% of the total dollar amount of our total classified assets and 8.3% of our risk based capital. 
 Non-accrual Loans and Other Problem Assets 
 The Banks non-accrual loans totaled 1.49% of total loans at December 31, 2016. Loans are placed on a non-accrual status when the loan is past due in excess of 90 days or the collection of principal and interest is doubtful. The Bank places a high priority on contacting customers by telephone as a primary method of determining the status of delinquent loans and the action necessary to resolve any payment problem. The Banks management performs quality reviews of problem assets to determine the necessity of establishing additional loss reserves. The Banks total non-performing assets to total asset ratio was 1.49% at December 31, 2016. 
 The following table sets forth information with respect to the Banks non-accrual loans at the dates indicated.

Federal regulations require commercial banks to classify their assets based on credit quality on a regular basis. In determining the classification of an asset, the Company utilizes a Classified Asset Committee consisting of members of senior management, accounting, credit analysis, loan administration, loan review, internal audit and collections. The committee attempts to determine the value of assets that are potentially impaired as well as the accurate reporting of Troubled Debt Restructuring (TDR) assets as defined later in this report. The committees function is an important step in managements determination as to the necessary level of funding required in the Companys allowance for loan loss account. 
 An asset meeting one of the classification definitions set forth below may be classified and still be a performing loan. An asset is classified as substandard if it is determined to be inadequately protected by the current retained earnings and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged, if any. 
 An asset is classified as doubtful if full collection is highly questionable or improbable. An asset is classified as loss if it is considered uncollectible, even if a partial recovery could be expected in the future. The regulations also provide for a special mention designation, described as assets which do not currently expose a savings institution to a sufficient degree of risk to warrant classification but do possess credit deficiencies or potential weaknesses deserving managements close attention. Such assets designated as special mention may include non-performing loans consistent with the above definition. 
 Assets classified as substandard or doubtful require a savings institution to conduct an impairment test to determine if the establishment of a specific reserve against the allowance for loan loss account is necessary. Typically, the basis for a loan impairment test is the current market value of the collateral, discounted to allow for selling and carrying cost. Typically, new appraisals on 1-4 family properties are discounted 10% to 15% from the appraised value while land and commercial real estate are discounted at 15% to 25% of new appraised values depending on the perceived marketability of the property. 
 The Company requires a new appraisal for all impairment testing of collateral when the loan balance exceeds $250,000. For loans less than $250,000, the Company may choose to use an old appraisal and provide additional discounts to the appraised value in determining the amount of specific reserve required. In the last twelve months, the Company has found that appraisers face an increase in request for services and the time between a request for an appraisal and its completion is longer than normal, up to sixty days for complex multi-family or commercial properties. During the interim, the Company may use an old appraisal with larger discounts to ascertain the likelihood of a loan impairment until a current appraisal is received. 
 If an asset or portion thereof is classified loss, we establish a specific reserve for such amount. If the Company determines that a loan relationship is collateral dependent, it will charge off the portion of that loan that is deemed to be impaired. The Company defines collateral dependent as any loan in that the customer will be unable to reduce the principal balance of the loan without the complete or partial sale of the collateral. 
 State and federal examiners may disagree with managements classifications. If management does not agree with an examiners classification of an asset, it may appeal this determination to the appropriate supervisory examiner with the Kentucky Department of Financial Institutions (KDFI) and the FDIC. Management regularly reviews its assets to determine whether any assets require classification or re-classification. At December 31, 2016, the Bank had $29.3 million in loans classified as substandard. Loans classified as substandard or doubtful by the Bank meet our classification of impaired loans, as defined by ASC 942-310-45-1. At December 31, 2016, and including our most recent examination, there were no material disagreements between examiners and management regarding risk grading or the funding of the allowance for loan loss account.

Troubled Debt Restructuring 
 Due to challenges in the local and national economy that continue to persist, the Company has had more of its customers incur financial problems. These customers may request temporary or permanent modification of loans in an effort to avoid foreclosure. The Company analyzes each request separately and grants loan modifications based on the customers ability to eventually repay the loan and return to the original loan terms, the customers current loan status and the current and projected future value of the Banks collateral. Loans that are modified as a result of a customers financial distress are classified as TDRs. The classification of a loan as a TDR is important in that it indicates that a particular customer may not be past due but represents a credit weakness due to the Banks willingness to modify loan terms based on the financial weakness of the borrower. 
 
19 
 
The classification of a loan as a TDR may represent the Companys last best chance to work with a distressed customer before foreclosure proceedings begin. At December 31, 2016, the Company had $5.6 million in non-residential real estate loans classified as TDR and $815,000 in multi-family loans classified as TDRs, with all such loans reported as TDRs performing as agreed by the loans modified terms. At December 31, 2015, the Company had $5.5 million in non-residential real estate loans classified as performing TDRs. Loans classified as TDRs in both 2016 and 2015 are the result of the borrowers cash flow and the Companys concession to temporarily allow interest only payments on balances outstanding. At December 31, 2016, all non-residential real estate loans are now making monthly principal and interest payments. Of the loans classified as TDRs at December 31, 2016, $815,000 in multi-family loans are currently making interest only payments. 
 The table below provides a summary of the activity of loans classified for the year ended December 31, 2016:

 Real estate acquired by the Bank as a result of foreclosure is classified as real estate owned until such time as it is sold. The Bank generally tries to sell the property at its current market price. The current market price is determined by obtaining an appraisal prior to the acquisition of the property. When such property is acquired, it is recorded at its fair value less estimated costs of sale. In the last eighteen months, the Company has determined that properties acquired through foreclosure have experienced a significant loss in market value as compared to the market value at the time of the origination of the loan. At the time of foreclosure, the collateral is reduced in value to its fair market value less holding and selling expenses and the remaining balance is charged against the allowance for loan losses. 
 Subsequent to foreclosure, in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP), a valuation allowance is established if the carrying value of the property exceeds its fair value net of related selling expenses. The value of other real estate owned is periodically evaluated, no less than annually, to ascertain its current market value. Additional reductions in market value are recognized as an expense through a charge to losses on real estate owned. At December 31, 2016, the Banks real estate and other assets owned totaled $2.4 million.

 Allowance for Loan Losses. In originating loans, the Bank recognizes that credit losses will be experienced and that the risk of loss will vary with, among other things, the type of loan being made, the creditworthiness of the borrower over the term of the loan, general economic conditions and, in the case of a secured loan, the quality of the security for the loan. It is managements policy to maintain an adequate allowance for loan losses based on, among other things, the Banks and the industrys historical loan loss experience, evaluation of economic conditions, regular reviews of delinquencies and loan portfolio quality and evolving standards imposed by federal bank examiners and other regulatory agencies. The Bank increases its allowance for loan losses by charging provisions for loan losses against the Banks income. 
 Management will continue to actively monitor the Banks asset quality and allowance for loan losses. Management will charge off loans and properties acquired in settlement of loans against the allowances for loan losses on such loans and such properties when appropriate and will provide specific loss allowances when necessary. Although management believes it uses the best information available to make determinations with respect to the allowances for loan losses and believes such allowances are adequate, future adjustments may be necessary if economic conditions differ substantially from the economic conditions in the assumptions used in making the initial determinations. 
 The Banks methodology for establishing the allowance for loan losses takes into consideration probable losses that have been identified in connection with specific assets as well as losses that have not been identified but have occurred in the last twelve quarters. Management conducts regular reviews of the Banks assets and evaluates the need to establish allowances on the basis of this review. Allowances are established by the Board of Directors on a quarterly basis based on an assessment of risk in the Banks assets taking into consideration the composition and quality of the portfolio, delinquency trends, current charge-off and loss experience, loan concentrations, the state of the real estate market, regulatory reviews conducted in the regulatory examination process and economic conditions generally. 
 Specific reserves will be provided for individual assets, or portions of assets, when ultimate collection is considered improbable by management based on the current payment status of the assets and the fair value of the security. At the date of foreclosure or other repossession, the Bank would transfer the property to real estate acquired in settlement of loans initially at the lower of cost or estimated fair value and subsequently at the lower of book value or fair value less estimated selling costs. Any portion of the outstanding loan balance in excess of fair value less estimated selling costs would be charged off against the allowance for loan losses. If, upon ultimate disposition of the property, net sales proceeds exceed the net carrying value of the property, a gain on sale of other real estate would be recorded. 
 Financial institutions must provide adequate disclosure of the methodology used regarding maintenance of an adequate allowance for loan and lease losses and an effective loan review system. The Bank utilizes a combination of its twelve quarter loan loss history and the sum of all impairment testing completed on individually classified loans deemed collateral dependent. 
 
21 
 
The charge off history is weighted using the sum of the years digits. This method provides a 15.4% weight to the most recent quarterly losses, then 14.1% for the prior quarters losses, 12.8% for the 2nd prior quarters losses and 11.5% for the prior quarters losses and continuing for twelve quarters. Using this method, the Bank trends for increasing or decreasing levels of charge offs may materially impact the funding level of the allowance for loan loss account. Additionally, the Bank reserves the loss amount of any loans deemed to be impaired. The Bank also applies certain qualitative factors in reviewing its allowance funding, including local and national delinquency and loss trends, noted concentrations or risk and recent additions to regulatory guidance. Financial institutions regulated by the KDFI and FDIC may require institutions to immediately charge off any portion of a collateral dependent loan that is deemed to be impaired. 
 The following table sets forth an analysis of the Banks allowance for loan losses for the years indicated.

The following table sets forth the breakdown of the allowance for loan losses by loan category at the dates indicated. Management believes that the allowance can be allocated by category only on an approximate basis. The allocation of the allowance to each category is not necessarily indicative of future losses and does not restrict the use of the allowance to absorb losses in any category.

Investment Activities 
 The Company makes investments in order to maintain the levels of liquid assets required by regulatory authorities and manage cash flow, diversify its assets, obtain yield and to satisfy certain requirements for favorable tax treatment. The principal objective of the investment policy is to earn as high a rate of return as possible, but to consider also financial or credit risk, liquidity risk and interest rate risk. The investment activities of the Corporation and the Bank consist primarily of investments in U.S. Government agency securities, municipal and corporate bonds, CMOs (see definition below), and mortgage-backed securities. Typical investments include federally sponsored agency mortgage pass-through and federally sponsored agency and mortgage-related securities. Investment and aggregate investment limitations and credit quality parameters of each class of investment are prescribed in the Banks investment policy. The Corporation and the Bank perform analyses on mortgage-related securities prior to purchase and on an ongoing basis to determine the impact on earnings and market value under various interest rate and prepayment conditions. Securities purchases must be approved by the Banks Chief Financial Officer or President. The Board of Directors reviews all securities transactions on a monthly basis and the Investment Committee conducts are more detailed analysis on a quarterly basis. 
 At December 31, 2016, securities with an amortized cost of $208.7 million and an approximate market value of $209.5 million were classified as available for sale. Management presently does not intend to sell such securities and, based on the current liquidity level and the access to borrowings through the FHLB of Cincinnati, management currently does not anticipate that the Corporation or the Bank will be placed in a position of having to sell securities with material unrealized losses.

Mortgage-Backed and Related Securities. Mortgage-backed securities represent a participation interest in a pool of one-to-four family or multi-family mortgages, the principal and interest payments on which are passed from the mortgage originators through intermediaries that pool and repackage the participation interest in the form of securities to investors such as the Bank. CMOs are a variation of mortgage-backed securities in which the mortgage pool is divided into specific classes, with different classes receiving different principal reduction streams based on numerous factors, including prepayments speeds. Such intermediaries may include quasi-governmental agencies such as FHLMC, FNMA and the Government National Mortgage Association (GNMA) which guarantees the payment of principal and interest to investors. At December 31, 2016, the Company has $67.1 million in U.S. Government Agency mortgage-backed securities and $14.8 million in U.S. Agency CMO securities. At December 31, 2016, this portfolio has approximately $21.9 million that were originated through GNMA, approximately $52.8 million that were originated through FNMA, and approximately $6.8 million that were originated through FHLMC. 
 Mortgage-backed securities are typically issued with stated principal amounts and the securities are backed by pools of mortgages that have loans with interest rates that are within a range and have similar maturities. The underlying pool of mortgages can be composed of either fixed-rate or adjustable-rate mortgage loans. Mortgage-backed securities generally are referred to as mortgage participation certificates or pass-through certificates. As a result, the interest rate risk characteristics of the underlying pool of mortgages, i.e., fixed-rate or adjustable-rate, as well as prepayment risk, are passed on to the certificate holder. The life of a mortgage-backed pass-through security is equal to the life of the underlying mortgages. The actual maturity of a mortgage-backed security varies, depending on when the mortgagors prepay or repay the underlying mortgages. Prepayments of the underlying mortgages may shorten the life of the investment, thereby adversely affecting its yield to maturity and the related market value of the mortgage-backed security. 
 The yield on mortgage backed securities is based upon the interest income and the amortization of the premium or accretion of the discount related to the mortgage-backed security. Premiums and discounts on mortgage-backed securities are amortized or accreted over the estimated term of the securities using a level yield method. The prepayment assumptions used to determine the amortization period for premiums and discounts can significantly affect the yield of the mortgage-backed security, and these assumptions are reviewed periodically to reflect the actual prepayment. The actual prepayments of the underlying mortgages depend on many factors, including the type of mortgage, the coupon rate, the age of the mortgages, the geographical location of the underlying real estate collateralizing the mortgages and general levels of market interest rates. The difference between the interest rates on the underlying mortgages and the prevailing mortgage interest rates is an important determinant in the rate of prepayments. During periods of falling mortgage interest rates, prepayments generally increase, and, conversely, during periods of rising mortgage interest rates, prepayments generally decrease. If the coupon rate of the underlying mortgage significantly exceeds the prevailing market interest rates offered for mortgage loans, refinancing generally increases and accelerates the prepayment of the underlying mortgages. Prepayment experience is more difficult to estimate for adjustable-rate mortgage-backed securities. 
 The Company owns $3.4 million in securities collateralized by federally insured student loans. These securities are floating rate and are indexed to one-month libor and reset each quarter. The collateral provides approximately 97% guarantee of SLMA and current have a weighted average book value equal to 95.5% of par. Beginning January 1, 2015, Basel III placed new and excessive risk weighting requirements on specific support bonds, of which the Company sold in the first quarter of 2015. The risk weightings on the $3.4 million in bonds owned by the Company are currently 20%. 
 The Company currently owns a trust preferred security originally issued as a private placement by First Financial Services Corporation of Elizabethtown, Kentucky (FFKY). The security has a $2.0 million par value, a book value of $1.6 million and a market value of $1.8 million. On January 1, 2015, FFKY was purchased by Community Bank Shares of Indiana (CBIN). In 2015, CBIN changed its name to Your Community Bank and its NASDAQ ticker symbol to YCB.    In September 2016, Wesbanco (WSBC), a $9.8 billion commercial bank headquartered in West Virginia, purchased YCB. At December 31, 2016, all interest payments on this security are current. See Note 2 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information concerning this security.

Amortizing U.S. Agency securities owned by the Company are similar in structure to mortgage backed securities. The Company owns two types of amortizing agency securities, both of which are issued with the full faith and credit guarantee of the Small Business Administration (SBA). The Small Business Investment Corporation (SBIC) bonds include pools of SBA loans for business equipment with a ten year maturity. The Small Business Administration Participation Notes (SBAP) have a twenty year maturity and are secured by pools of commercial real estate loans guaranteed by the SBA. Both investments provide superior yields to mortgage backed securities with a credit rating equal to GNMA and superior to FHLMC and FNMA. Historically, the actual cash flows and prepayment speeds for SBIC and SBAP bonds are typically slower than similar maturities for mortgage backed securities due to the cost of refinancing SBA loans. At December 31, 2016, the Company owns $6.1 million in SBIC notes, $2.5 million in floating rate SBA pools and $48.8 million at SBAP notes. 
 The following table sets forth the carrying value of the investment securities at the dates indicated.

At such date, $9.7 million of the non-amortizing agency securities were callable and $4.1 million will mature on or before June 8, 2018, and $12.8 million were not callable and mature after June 9, 2018. In addition, approximately $57.4 million in small business administration amortizing bonds require periodic principal payments. At December 31, 2016, $24.4 million of tax free municipals and $1.1 million of taxable all municipal securities were callable between January 2017 and December 2022. The average yield for tax-free municipal bonds are quoted as a tax equivalent yield.

Deposit Activity and Other Sources of Funds 
 General. Deposits are the primary source of the Banks funds for lending, investment activities and general operational purposes. In addition to deposits, the Bank derives funds from loan principal and interest repayments, maturities of investment securities and mortgage-backed securities and interest payments thereon. Although scheduled loan repayments are a relatively stable source of funds, deposit inflows and outflows are influenced by general interest rates, and money market conditions and business cycles. Borrowings may be used on a short-term basis to compensate for reductions in the availability of funds, or on a long-term basis for general corporate purposes. The Bank has access to borrow from the FHLB of Cincinnati. The Bank may rely upon retail deposits rather than borrowings as its primary source of funding for future asset growth. 
 In 2015 and 2014, weak loan demand and high levels of liquidity made it difficult to maintain a desirable level of profitability. Therefore, management placed an emphasis on reducing the Banks interest expense. The reduction in interest expense resulted from a change in our deposit mix and overall funding mix of the Bank. First, we placed a strong marketing emphasis on non-interest bearing checking accounts. In each of the last five years, we opened more than 4,000 non-interest checking accounts. For the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, the average balance of non-interest checking accounts has increased by $12.4 million, $8.5 million and $12.5 million, respectively. 
 In 2016, the Bank has experienced meaningful loan demand for the first time in several years. In 2017, the Bank will seek to grow its interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities in a balanced manner. Loan growth above 5% will require us to increase the volumes of time deposits and other non-traditional funding sources as compared to interest bearing and non-interest bearing checking accounts. 
 Deposits. The Bank attracts deposits principally from within its market area by offering competitive rates on its deposit instruments, including money market accounts, passbook savings accounts, individual retirement accounts, and certificates of deposit which range in maturity from three months to five years. Deposit terms vary according to the minimum balance required and the length of time the funds must remain on deposit and the interest rate. Maturities, terms, service fees and withdrawal penalties for its deposit accounts are established by the Bank on a periodic basis. The Bank reviews its deposit mix and pricing on a weekly basis. In determining the characteristics of its deposit accounts, the Bank considers the rates offered by competing institutions, lending and liquidity requirements, growth goals and federal regulations. 
 At December 31, 2016, the Bank had $33.4 million in brokered deposits, or 4.6% of total deposits. At December 31, 2015, the Bank had $34.4 million in brokered deposits, or 4.7% of total deposits, The Bank utilizes brokered deposits to fill in maturity gaps in an effort to balance the amount of time deposits maturing in any one period and as an alternative source of funding. All brokered deposits are FDIC insured. 
 The Bank attempts to compete for deposits with other institutions in its market area by offering competitively priced deposit instruments that meet the needs of its customers. Additionally, the Bank seeks to meet customers needs by providing convenient customer service to the community. With the exception of brokered deposits, substantially all of the Banks depositors are Kentucky or Tennessee residents who reside in the Banks market area.

 At December 31, 2016, certificates of deposits included approximately $157.0 million of deposits greater than $100,000, as compared to $163.9 million and $169.3 million at December 31, 2015, and December 31, 2014, respectively. Certificates of deposit at December 31, 2016, included approximately $79.7 million of deposits with balances of $250,000 or more, compared to $78.8 million and $100.1 million at December 31, 2015, and December 31, 2014, respectively. Such time deposits may be risky because their continued presence in the Bank is dependent partially upon the rates paid by the Bank rather than any customer relationship and, therefore, may be withdrawn upon maturity if another institution offers higher interest rates. The Bank may be required to resort to other funding sources such as borrowings or sales of its securities available for sale if the Bank believes that increasing its rates to maintain such deposits would adversely affect its operating results. At this time, the Bank does not believe that it will need to pay above market rates to maintain such certificates of deposit. See Note 5 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

 Borrowings. Savings deposits historically have been the primary source of funds for the Banks lending, investments and general operating activities. The Bank is authorized, however, to use advances from the FHLB of Cincinnati to supplement its supply of lendable funds and to meet deposit withdrawal requirements. The FHLB of Cincinnati functions as a central reserve bank providing credit for savings institutions and certain other member financial institutions. 
 As a member of the FHLB System, the Bank is required to own stock in the FHLB of Cincinnati and is authorized to apply for advances. Advances are pursuant to several different programs, each of which has its own interest rate and range of maturities. The Bank has entered into a Cash Management Advance program with FHLB. See Note 6 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Advances from the FHLB of Cincinnati were $11.0 million at December 31, 2016. Also at December 31, 2016, the FHLB has issued letters of credit totaling $45.6 million for the benefit of municipalities to collateralize deposits. All FHLB advances and letters of credit are secured by a blanket security agreement in which the Bank has pledged its 1-4 family first mortgage loans held in the Banks loan portfolio. 
 On September 25, 2003, the Company issued $10,310,000 in floating rate junior subordinated debentures with a thirty year maturity and callable at the Companys discretion quarterly after September 25, 2008. The subordinated debentures are priced at a variable rate equal to the three month Libor (London Inter Bank Offering Rate) plus 3.10%. The most recent reset date for the interest rate on the subordinated debentures was January 12, 2017. On January 12, 2017, the three-month Libor rate was 1.02%. Therefore, the rate of the security is 4.12%. The securities are immediately callable in the event of a change in tax or accounting law that has a significant negative impact to issuing these securities. Otherwise, the securities are callable on a quarterly basis. 
 
29 
 
For regulatory purposes, subordinated debentures may be treated as Tier I capital. Federal regulations limit the use of subordinated debentures to 25% of total Tier I capital. Discussions among regulatory agencies are underway that may limit the current and future use of subordinated debentures as Tier I capital. The Companys decision to issue subordinated debentures was in part influenced by potential regulatory actions in the future. The Company anticipates above average growth to continue and anticipates a time in the future when capital ratios are lower and additional capital may be need. 
 In October of 2008, the Bank entered into an interest rate swap agreement. The agreement called for the Bank to pay a fixed rate of 7.27% until October 8, 2015, on $10 million and receive payment equal to the three month libor plus 3.10%. The Bank then completed an intercompany transaction that transferred the swap to the Company, providing an effective hedge for its variable rate subordinated debentures. The interest rate swap matured on October 8, 2015. 
 Repurchase Agreements 
 The Company offers cash management customers an automated sweep account of excess funds from checking accounts into repurchase accounts. Prior to 2011, this product was the preferred method to provide commercial deposit customers the opportunity to earn interest income on demand deposit accounts. Repurchase balances are overnight borrowings from customers and are not FDIC insured but are fully collateralized by specific securities in the Companys investment portfolio. At December 31, 2016, the Companys retail repurchase agreements total $47.7 million. 
Federal Taxation 
 The Corporation and the Bank file a consolidated federal income tax return on a calendar year basis. The Company is subject to the federal tax laws and regulations that apply to corporations generally. 
Kentucky Taxation 
 Kentucky corporations, such as the Corporation, are subject to the Kentucky corporation income tax and the Kentucky corporation license (franchise) tax. The income tax is imposed based on the following rates: 4% of the first $50,000 of net taxable income allocated or apportioned to Kentucky; 5% of the next $50,000; and 6% of taxable net income over $100,000. All dividend income received by a corporation is excluded for purposes of arriving at taxable net income. 
Tennessee Taxation 
 The Company and all subsidiaries are subject to Tennessee Franchise and Excise tax on apportioned capital and apportioned income. 
 Heritage Bank USA, Inc. 
 State banks are not subject to the Kentucky corporation tax. 
 The Commonwealth of Kentucky imposes both a Kentucky Bank Franchise Tax and Local Deposits Franchise Tax. The Kentucky Bank Franchise Tax is an annual tax equal to 1.1% of net capital after apportionment, if applicable. The value of the net capital is calculated annually by deducting from total capital an amount equal to the same percentage of total as the book value of Unites States obligations bears to the book value of the total assets of the financial institution. The Bank, as a financial institution, is exempt from both corporate income and license taxes.

Competition 
 The Bank faces significant competition both in originating mortgage and other loans and in attracting deposits. The Bank competes for loans principally on the basis of interest rates, the types of loans it originates, the deposit products it offers and the quality of services it provides to borrowers. The Bank also competes by offering products which are tailored to the local community. Its competition in originating real estate loans comes primarily from other savings institutions, commercial banks and mortgage bankers making loans secured by real estate located in the Banks market area. Commercial banks, credit unions and finance companies provide vigorous competition in consumer lending. Competition may increase as a result of the continuing reduction of restrictions on the interstate operations of financial institutions. 
 At June 30, 2016, the Bank had a 11.5% share of the deposit market in its combined markets. The Banks most significant competition across its entire market area was Community Financial Services Bank with a 10.0% deposit market share and Planters Bank of Kentucky with a 10.4% deposit market share. At June 30, 2016, U.S. Bank N/A had a 8.5% deposit market share, Branch Bank & Trust of North Carolina had a 7.5% deposit market share and Regions Bank of Birmingham, Alabama with a 7.1% deposit market share. In addition, each market contains other community banks that provide competitive products and services within individual markets. 
 The Bank attracts its deposits through its eighteen offices primarily from the local community. Consequently, competition for deposits is principally from other savings institutions, commercial banks and brokers in the local community as well as from credit unions. The Bank competes for deposits and loans by offering what it believes to be a variety of deposit accounts at competitive rates, convenient business hours, a commitment to outstanding customer service and a well-trained staff. The Bank believes it has developed strong relationships with local realtors and the community in general. 
 The Bank is a community and retail-oriented financial institution. Management considers the Banks branch network and reputation for financial strength and quality customer service as its major competitive advantage in attracting and retaining customers in its market area. A number of the Banks competitors have been acquired by statewide/nationwide banking organizations. While the Bank is subject to competition from other financial institutions which may have greater financial and marketing resources, management believes the Bank benefits by its community orientation and its long-standing relationship with many of its customers. 
 Employees 
 As of December 31, 2016, the Company and the Bank had 236 full-time equivalent employees, none of whom were represented by a collective bargaining agreement. Management considers the Banks relationships with its employees to be good.

 Limitations on Capital Distributions. The FRB has issued a policy statement on the payment of cash dividends by bank holding companies, which provides that a bank holding company should pay cash dividends only to the extent that the holding companys net income for the past year is sufficient to cover both the cash dividends and a rate of earnings retention that is consistent with the holding companys capital needs, asset quality and overall financial condition. The FRB also indicated that it would be inappropriate for a company experiencing serious financial problems to borrow funds to pay dividends. In a recent Supervisory Letter, the FRB staff has stated that, as a general matter, bank holding companies should eliminate cash dividends if net income available to shareholders for the past four quarters, net of dividends previously paid, is not sufficient to fully fund the dividend. Furthermore, under the federal prompt corrective action regulations, the FRB may prohibit a bank holding company from paying any dividends if the holding companys bank subsidiary is classified as undercapitalized. 
 Seasonality of Revenues and Expenses 
 The Companys business is not materially affected by seasonality fluctuations in our business cycle. The Companys financial health is substantially affected by the overall business cycle and market interest rates. 
 Supervision and Regulation 
 Set forth below is a brief description of certain laws that relate to the regulation of the Company and the Bank. The description does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to applicable laws and regulations. 
 Regulation of the Company 
 Under the BHCA, the Company must obtain the prior approval of the FRB before it may acquire control of another bank or bank holding company, merge or consolidate with another bank holding company, acquire all or substantially all of the assets of another bank or bank holding company, or acquire direct or indirect ownership or control of any voting shares of any bank or bank holding company if, after such acquisition, the Company would directly or indirectly own or control more than 5% of such shares. 
 Non-Banking Activities. In general, the BHCA and the FRBs regulations limit the nonbanking activities permissible for bank holding companies to those activities that the FRB has determined to be so closely related to banking or managing or controlling banks to be a proper incident thereto. A bank holding company that elects to be treated as a financial holding company, however, may engage in, and acquire companies engaged in, activities that are considered financial in nature, as defined by the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act and FRB regulations. These activities include, among other things, securities underwriting, dealing and market-making, sponsoring mutual funds and investment companies, insurance underwriting and agency activities, and merchant banking.

Source of Strength Doctrine. As a matter of policy, which has been codified by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the Dodd-Frank Act), a bank holding company registered with the Board of Governors of the FRB System (the FRB). We are subject to examination and supervision by the FRB pursuant to the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (the BHCA), and are required to file reports and other information regarding our business operations and the business operations of our subsidiaries with the FRB. 
 A bank holding company is required to serve as a source of financial and managerial strength to its subsidiary banks and may not conduct its operations in an unsafe or unsound manner. In addition, it is the policy of the FRB that a bank holding company should stand ready to use available resources to provide adequate capital to its subsidiary banks during periods of financial stress or adversity and should maintain the financial flexibility and capital-raising capacity to obtain additional resources for assisting its subsidiary banks. A bank holding companys failure to meet its obligations to serve as a source of strength to its subsidiary banks will generally be considered by the FRB to be an unsafe and unsound banking practice or a violation of the FRB regulations, or both. 
 Regulatory Capital Requirements. The FRB has adopted regulatory capital regulations pursuant to which it assesses the adequacy of capital in examining and supervising a bank holding company and in analyzing applications to it under the BHCA. The Federal Reserves regulatory capital requirements are similar to those imposed on the Bank by the FDIC. See Regulation of the Bank  Regulatory Capital Requirements. The FRB, however, has adopted a policy statement that exempts bank holding companies with less than $1.0 billion in consolidated assets that are not engaged in significant non-banking or off-balance sheet activities and that do not have a material amount of debt or equity securities registered with the SEC from its regulatory capital requirements. As long as their bank subsidiaries are well capitalized, such bank holding companies need only maintain a pro forma debt to equity ratio of less than 1.0 in order to pay dividends and repurchase stock and to be eligible for expedited treatment on applications. 
 Regulation of the Bank 
 General 
 As a Kentucky-chartered commercial bank, the Bank is subject to regulation, supervision and examination by the Kentucky Department of Financial Institutions (KDFI) and by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), which insures its deposits to the maximum extent permitted by law. The federal and state laws and regulations applicable to banks regulate, among other things, the scope of their business, their investments, the reserves required to be kept against deposits, the timing of the availability of deposited funds and the nature and amount of and collateral for certain loans. The laws and regulations governing the Bank generally have been promulgated to protect depositors and not for the purpose of protecting stockholders. This regulatory structure also gives the federal and state banking agencies extensive discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities and examination policies, including policies with respect to the classification of assets and the establishment of adequate loan loss reserves for regulatory purposes. Any change in such regulation, whether by the KDFI, the FDIC or the United States Congress, could have a material impact on the Company, the Bank and their operations.

Regulatory Capital Requirements. The FDIC has promulgated capital adequacy requirements for state-chartered banks that, like the Bank, are not members of the Federal Reserve System. Effective January 1, 2015, the regulatory capital rules were substantially revised to conform to the international regulatory standards agreed to by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision in the accord often referred to as Basel III. The final Basel III capital rule applies to all depository institutions as well as to all top-tier bank and savings and loan holding companies that are not subject to the FRBs Small Bank Holding Company Policy Statement. 
 Under the FDICs revised regulatory capital regulations, the Bank is required to meet four minimum capital standards: (1) a Tier 1 or core capital leverage ratio equal to at least 4% of total adjusted assets, (2) a common equity Tier 1 (or CET1) capital ratio equal to 4.5% of risk-weighted assets, (3) a Tier 1 risk-based ratio equal to 6% of risk-weighted assets, and (4) a total capital ratio equal to 8% of total risk-weighted assets. CET1 capital is defined as common stock instruments, retained earnings, any common equity Tier 1 minority interest and, unless the bank has made an opt-out election, accumulated other comprehensive income, net of goodwill and certain other intangible assets. Tier 1 or core capital is defined as CET1 capital plus certain qualifying subordinated interests and grandfathered capital instruments. Total capital consists of Tier 1 capital plus Tier 2 or supplementary capital items, which include allowances for loan losses in an amount of up to 1.25% of risk-weighted assets, qualifying subordinated instruments and certain grandfathered capital instruments. An institutions risk-based capital requirements are measured against risk-weighted assets, which equal the sum of each on-balance-sheet asset and the credit-equivalent amount of each off-balance-sheet item after being multiplied by an assigned risk weight. 
 
34 
 
In addition to higher capital requirements, the Basel III capital rule requires banking organizations to maintain a capital conservation buffer of at least 2.5% of risk-weighted assets over and above the minimum risk-based capital requirements. Institutions that do not maintain the required capital buffer will become subject to progressively more stringent limitations on the percentage of earnings that can be paid out in dividends or used for stock repurchases and on the payment of discretionary bonuses to senior executive management. The capital buffer requirement will be phased in over four years beginning January 1, 2016. The fully phased-in capital buffer requirement will effectively raise the minimum required risk-based capital ratios to 7% CET1 capital, 8.5% Tier 1 capital and 10.5% total capital on a fully phased-in basis. The capital conservation buffer at December 31, 2016 is 0.625%. 
 In assessing an institutions capital adequacy, the FDIC takes into consideration not only the above numeric factors but also qualitative factors, and has the authority to establish higher capital requirements for individual institutions where necessary. 
 Prompt Correction Action. Under applicable Federal statue, the federal bank regulatory agencies are required to take prompt corrective action with respect to institutions that do not beet specified minimum capital requirements. 
 The prompt corrective action regulations provide for the imposition of a variety of requirements and limitations on institutions that fail to meet the above capital requirements. In particular, the FDIC may require any savings institution that is not adequately capitalized to take certain action to increase its capital ratios. If the savings institutions capital is significantly below the minimum required levels of capital or if it is unsuccessful in increasing its capital ratios, the institutions activities may be restricted. 
 Prompt Correction Action. Under applicable Federal statue, the federal bank regulatory agencies are required to take prompt corrective action with respect to institutions that do not beet specified minimum capital requirements. Under the FDICs prompt corrective action regulations, as amended to incorporate the new regulatory capital standards implemented by the final Basel III capital rule, an institution is deemed to be well-capitalized if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of 10% or greater, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 8% or greater, a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 5% or greater, and a CET1 risk-based ratio of 6.5% or greater and is not subject to a regulatory order, agreement, or directive to meet and maintain a specific capital level for any capital measure. An institution is adequately capitalized if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of 8% or greater, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6% or greater, a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 4% or greater, and a CET1 risk-based ratio of 4.5% or greater and the institution does not meet the definition of a well-capitalized institution. An institution is under-capitalized if it does not meet one or more of the adequately-capitalized tests. An institution is deemed to be significantly under-capitalized if it has a total risk-based capital ratio that is less than 6%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio that is less than 4%, a Tier 1 leverage ratio that is less than 3%, or a CET1 risk-based ratio of less than 3%. An institution is deemed to be critically under-capitalized if it has a ratio of tangible equity, as defined in the regulations, to total assets that is equal to or less than 2%. 
 Deposit Insurance. The Banks deposits are insured to applicable limits by the FDIC. Under the Dodd-Frank Act, the maximum deposit insurance amount is $250,000. The Dodd-Frank Act increased the minimum target Deposit Insurance Fund ratio from 1.15% of estimated insured deposits to 1.35% of estimated insured deposits. The FDIC must seek to achieve the 1.35% ratio by June 30, 2020. It is intended that insured institutions with assets of $10 billion or more will fund the increase. 
 The FDIC has adopted a risk-based premium system that provides for quarterly assessments based on an insured institutions risk rating. The assessment base is the institutions average consolidated assets less average tangible equity. Prior to July 1, 2016, insured institutions were assigned to one of four risk categories based on their examination ratings and capital ratios, and annual assessment rates ranged from 2.5 to 45 basis points of an insured institutions assessment base. 
 Effective July 1, 2016, the FDIC amended its assessment regulations for banks with less than $10 billion in assets to replace the previous risk categories with updated financial ratios that are designed to better predict the risk of failure of insured institutions. The amended rules became effective during the first quarter after the reserve ratio of the Deposit Insurance Fund reached 1.15% and will remain in effect until the reserve ratio reaches 2.0%. The base deposit insurance rates for institutions with assets of less than $10 billion now range from 1.5 to 30 basis points of an institutions assessment base. Under the amended rules, the FDIC uses an institutions weighted average CAMELS component ratings and the following financial measures to determine deposit insurance assessments: Tier 1 leverage ratio; ratio of net income before taxes to total assets; ratio of non-performing loans to gross assets; and ratio of other real estate owned to gross assets. In addition, assessments take into consideration an institutions brokered deposit ratio, one-year asset growth and a loan mix index, which measures the extent to which an institutions total assets include higher risk loans.

Dividends. The KDFI limits the amount of dividends that can be paid by a state chartered commercial bank to its holding company. The limit is established by adding the current years net income plus the prior two years net income. The Bank must reduce the amount of accumulated net income over the last two years plus the current year by the amount of dividends paid to the Corporation during the same period of time. At December 31, 2016, the Bank could not pay an additional cash dividend to the Corporation without the prior approval of the KDFI. 
 Future earnings of the Bank appropriated to bad debt reserves and deducted for federal income tax purposes are not available for payment of dividends or other distributions to the Company without payment of taxes at the then current tax rate by the Bank on the amount of earnings removed from the reserves for such distributions. 
 Transactions with Affiliates and Insiders. Generally, transactions between commercial banks or its subsidiaries and its affiliates are required to be on terms as favorable to the commercial bank as transactions with non-affiliates. In addition, certain of these transactions, such as loans to an affiliate, are restricted to a percentage of the savings banks capital. Affiliates of the Bank include the Company and any company that is under common control with the Bank. In addition, a commercial bank may not acquire the securities of most affiliates. The KDFI and FDIC have the discretion to treat subsidiaries of commercial banks as affiliates on a case-by-case basis. 
 Certain transactions with directors, officers or controlling persons are also subject to conflict of interest regulations enforced by the KDFI and FDIC. These conflict of interest regulations and other statutes also impose restrictions on loans to such persons and their related interests. Among other things, such loans must generally be made on terms that are substantially the same as for loans to unaffiliated individuals. 
 Reserve Requirements. Pursuant to regulations of the FRB, all FDIC-insured depository institutions must maintain average daily reserves at specified levels against their transaction accounts. The Bank met these reserve requirements at December 31, 2016. 
 Federal Home Loan Bank System. The Federal Home Loan Bank System consists of 12 district Federal Home Loan Banks subject to supervision and regulation by the Federal Housing Finance Board (FHFB). The Federal Home Loan Banks provide a central credit facility primarily for member institutions. As a member of the FHLB, the Bank is required to acquire and hold shares of capital stock in the FHLB in an amount at least equal to 1% of the aggregate unpaid principal of its home mortgage loans, home purchase contracts, and similar obligations at the beginning of each year, or 5% of its advances (borrowings) from the FHLB, whichever is greater. The Bank was in compliance with this requirement, with a $4.4 million investment in FHLB stock at December 31, 2016.

Bank Secrecy Act. The Bank Secrecy Act, as amended by the USA Patriot Act of 2001 and its related regulations, requires insured depository institutions to have policies, procedures, and controls to detect, prevent, and report money laundering and terrorist financing. The statute and regulations also provide for information sharing, subject to conditions, between federal law enforcement agencies and financial institutions, as well as among financial institutions, for counter-terrorism purposes. Federal banking regulators are required, when reviewing bank holding company acquisition and bank merger applications, to take into account the effectiveness of the anti-money laundering activities of the applicants. The bank regulatory agencies have increased the regulatory scrutiny of Bank Secrecy Act and anti-money laundering programs maintained by financial institutions. Significant penalties and fines, as well as other supervisory enforcement action, may be imposed on a financial institution for non-compliance with these requirements. 
 Consumer Protection Laws. In connection with our deposit-taking lending and other activities, the Bank is subject to a number of federal and state laws designed to protect consumers and promote lending and other financial services to various sectors of the economy and population. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau issues regulations and standards under these federal consumer protection laws, which include, among others, the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Truth in Lending Act, the Electronic Fund Transfer Act, the Truth in Savings Act, and the Fair Credit Reporting Act. The Bank is examined by the FDIC for compliance with these consumer protection rules. 
 In addition, customer privacy statutes and regulations limit the ability of the Bank to disclose nonpublic consumer information to non-affiliated third parties. These laws require the Bank to provide notice to our customers regarding privacy policies and practices and to give our customers an option to prevent their non-public personal information from being shared with non-affiliated third parties or with our affiliates. 
 Community Reinvestment Act. All insured depository institutions have a responsibility under the Community Reinvestment Act (the CRA) and related federal regulations to help meet the credit needs of their communities, including low- and moderate-income neighborhoods. In connection with its examination of the Bank, the FDIC is required to assess our record of compliance with the CRA. Such assessment is reviewed by the FRB and/or the FDIC when the Company or the Bank makes application for approval of an expansionary proposal, such as a merger or other acquisition of another bank or the opening of a new branch office. The Bank received a satisfactory CRA rating in its most recent assessment by the FDIC.
