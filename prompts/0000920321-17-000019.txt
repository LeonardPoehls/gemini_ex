Item 1.  Business
Overview
Cenveo, Inc. ("Cenveo," the "Company," "we," "our," or "us") is a diversified manufacturing company focused on print-related products. Our broad portfolio of products includes envelope converting, commercial printing, and label manufacturing. We operate an extensive network of strategically located manufacturing facilities, serving a diverse base of customers. We operate our business in three complementary reportable segments: envelope, print and label. 
Envelope. We are the largest envelope manufacturer in North America. Our envelope segment had net sales of $865.2 million and $908.7 million and operating income of $60.7 million and $66.4 million for the years ended 2016 and 2015, respectively. Total assets for our envelope segment were $403.2 million and $445.4 million as of the years ended 2016 and 2015, respectively. Our envelope segment represented approximately 52.1% of our consolidated net sales for the year ended 2016.
Our envelope segment offers direct mail products used for customer solicitations and transactional envelopes used for billing and remittance by end users including financial institutions, insurance and telecommunications companies. We also produce a broad line of specialty and stock envelopes which are sold through wholesalers, distributors and national catalogs for the office product markets and office product superstores. 
Print. We are one of the leading commercial printers in North America. Our print segment had net sales of $493.5 million and $511.0 million and operating income of $17.6 million and $15.1 million for the years ended 2016 and 2015, respectively. Total assets for our print segment were $256.9 million and $266.1 million as of the years ended 2016 and 2015, respectively. Our print segment represented approximately 29.7% of our consolidated net sales for the year ended 2016.
Our print segment primarily caters to the consumer products, automotive, travel and leisure and telecommunications industries. We provide a wide array of print offerings to our customers including electronic prepress, digital asset archiving, direct-to-plate technology, high-quality color printing on web and sheet-fed presses, digital printing and content management. The broad selection of print products we produce includes car brochures, annual reports, direct mail products, advertising literature, corporate identity materials and brand marketing materials. Our content management business offers complete solutions, including: editing, content processing, content management, electronic peer review, production, distribution and reprint marketing.
Label. We are a leading label manufacturer and one of the largest North American prescription label manufacturers for retail pharmacy chains. Our label segment had net sales of $301.4 million and $322.1 million and operating income of $30.5 million and $39.5 million for the years ended 2016 and 2015, respectively. Total assets for our label segment were $216.6 million and $223.5 million as of the years ended 2016 and 2015, respectively. Our label segment represented approximately 18.2% of our consolidated net sales for the year ended 2016.
Our label segment produces a diverse line of custom labels for a broad range of industries including manufacturing, warehousing, packaging, food and beverage, and health and beauty, which we sell through extensive networks within the resale channels. We provide direct mail and overnight packaging labels, food and beverage labels, and shelf and scale labels for national and regional customers. We produce pressure-sensitive prescription labels for the retail pharmacy chain market. 
The primary methods of distribution of the principal products for our three segments are by freight carriers, direct shipment via express mail and the United States postal system.
Acquisitions and Divestitures
Acquisitions
On August 7, 2015, we acquired certain assets of Asendia USA, Inc., which we refer to as Asendia. The acquired assets provide letter shop, data processing, bindery and digital printing offerings.
We may, from time to time, complete acquisitions in areas we believe will strengthen our manufacturing platform, improve our operating margin performance or provide additional product offerings.
See Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion regarding our acquisitions.

Divestitures
During 2015, we began actively moving forward with our plan to review and potentially divest certain non-strategic assets that did not fit within our long-term strategy. As a result of this strategic review, during the first quarter of 2016, we completed the sale of our folded carton and shrink sleeve packaging businesses, along with our top-sheet lithographic print operation, which we refer to as the Packaging Business. The financial results of the Packaging Business have been accounted for as discontinued operations. Our historical, consolidated financial statements have been retroactively adjusted to give recognition to the discontinued operations for all periods presented. See Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion regarding our discontinued operations.
Our Business Strategy
Our business strategy has been, and continues to be, focused on improving our operating margins, improving our capital structure and providing quality product offerings to our customers. We also are continuing to review options for our non-strategic assets and product lines. We also continue to make strategic investments and focused capital expenditures. The strategic investments focus on improving our e-commerce customer experience. Our focused capital expenditures in label equipment included two new digital presses added in both 2016 and 2015 and the initiation of a multi-phased, multi-year plan to reinvest into state-of-the-art labeling equipment, which should significantly increase our capabilities, minimize machine downtime and allow for margin expansion within our label operations.
Improving Operating Margins
In 2014, we substantially completed our integration of certain assets of National Envelope Corporation, which we refer to as National, which allowed us to focus on profitability improvement and other cost reduction actions in our envelope platform throughout 2015 and into early 2016. We believe the accelerated integration plan we completed during 2014 has provided meaningful improvements in our envelope segment's operating results during 2015 and 2016, as we realized significant increases in gross profit and operating income, as compared to 2014. 
During 2016, we experienced significant sales volume decline and increased price pressures within our office product envelope and related wholesale envelope product lines due to measures undertaken by our customers in those product lines as a result of a regulatory decision mid-way through our 2016 fiscal year. In reaction to this decline and other continued marketplace challenges within our industry, we initiated a two year $50 million cost savings and profitability plan, which we refer to as the 2017 Profitability Improvement Plan, to offset the impact of these marketplace challenges and continue to improve our operating margins. With this plan, we expect higher restructuring, impairment and other charges primarily resulting from severance expense, facility rationalization costs and impairments associated with equipment footprint reductions. We believe these incremental charges will ultimately be offset by improved gross profit margins and lower selling, general and administrative expenses as we operate through 2017 and into 2018; however, this cannot be assured. These actions are aimed to reduce our fixed cost infrastructure, back office headcount and further streamline our geographic footprint. We believe that despite the facility rationalization, we will still be able to serve our national customer base with less facilities at the same or improved service levels that they are used to receiving from us. 
Improving our Capital Structure
Since the beginning of 2012, we have been focused on improving our capital structure through a number of initiatives including working capital improvements, exiting underperforming or non-strategic businesses, and taking advantage of strategic refinancing opportunities and attractive leveraged loan and high yield debt market conditions. We have been able to accomplish this while reinvesting cash into our businesses via three acquisitions and focused capital expenditures. In connection with these activities, through the end of 2016, we continued to successfully reduce our outstanding debt and weighted average interest rate, which we believe will result in annual cash interest savings of approximately $40 million in 2017 as compared to 2012. Additionally, we have called for redemption during the first quarter of 2017 the remaining $20.5 million of our 11.5% senior notes due 2017, which we refer to as the 11.5% Notes. That addresses all but $5.5 million of our debt maturing in 2017. We expect that remaining $5.5 million of our 7% senior exchangeable notes due 2017, which we refer to as the 7% Notes, will be addressed prior to or at maturity in May of 2017. These redemptions or retirements will be made using cash flow from operations or availability under our asset-based revolving credit facility due 2021, which we refer to as the ABL Facility.

Provide Quality Product Offerings
We conduct regular reviews of our product offerings, manufacturing processes and distribution methods to ensure that they meet the changing needs of our customers. We are also investing in digital and variable technology in particular, as we have seen increased customer demand for these technologies. Additionally, we have expanded our managed services portfolio and integrated customer supply chain capabilities via strategic investments in information technology and knowledge product specialists. By expanding our product offerings, we intend to increase cross-selling opportunities to our existing customer base and mitigate the impact of any decline in a given market or product.
Our Industry
The overall industry for print-related products is highly fragmented with excess capacity. We face price sensitivity and price pressures in many of our businesses. In the envelope market, we compete primarily with a few multi-plant and many single-plant companies servicing regional and local markets. In the commercial printing market, we compete against a few large, diversified and financially stronger printing companies, as well as smaller regional and local commercial printers, many of which are capable of competing with us on volume, price and production quality.  
The information set forth below is applicable to the operating environments within all our segments. 
Raw Materials
The primary materials used in our businesses are paper, ink, film, offset plates and chemicals, with paper accounting for the majority of total material costs. We purchase these materials from a number of key suppliers and have not experienced any significant difficulties in obtaining the raw materials necessary for our operations. However, in times of limited supply, we have occasionally experienced minor delays in delivery. We believe we purchase our materials and supplies at competitive prices, primarily due to the size and scope of our purchasing power; however, our businesses are sensitive to pressure related to increases in the cost of materials used in the production of our products. 
Patents, Trademarks and Trade Names
Our sales do not materially depend upon any single patent or group of related patents; however, we do market products under a number of trademarks and trade names. We also hold or have rights to use various patents relating to our businesses. Our patents expire between 2018 and 2032 and our trademarks expire between 2017 and 2030. 
Seasonality
Our envelope market and certain segments of the direct mail market have historically experienced seasonality with a higher percentage of volume of products sold to these markets during the third and fourth quarters of the year, primarily related to back-to-school campaigns and holiday purchases. 
Our print plants experience seasonal variations. Revenues associated with consumer publications, such as holiday catalogs and automobile brochures tend to be concentrated from July through October. Revenues associated with the educational and scholastic market and promotional materials tend to decline in the summer. As a result of these seasonal variations, some of our print operations operate at or near capacity at certain times throughout the year. 
Our custom label business has historically experienced a seasonal increase in net sales during the first and second quarters of the year, primarily resulting from the release of our product catalogs to the trade channel customers and our customers’ spring advertising campaigns. Our prescription label business has historically experienced seasonality in net sales due to cold and flu seasons, generally concentrated in the fourth and first quarters of the year. As a result of these seasonal variations, some of our label operations operate at or near capacity at certain times throughout the year. 
Backlog
Backlog generally is not considered a significant factor in our business due to the relatively short delivery periods and frequent inventory turnover many of our businesses experience. Our backlog of customer orders to be produced or shipped was approximately $87.4 million and $104.9 million as of the years ended 2016 and 2015, respectively.

Competition
We compete with a few multi-plant and many single-plant companies which primarily service regional and local markets in selling our envelope products. We also face competition from alternative sources of communication and information transfer such as electronic mail, the internet, interactive television and electronic retailing. Although these sources of communication and advertising may eliminate some domestic envelope sales in the future, we believe we will experience continued demand for envelope products due to: (i) the ability of our customers to obtain a relatively low-cost information delivery vehicle that may be customized with text, color, graphics and action devices to achieve the desired presentation effect; (ii) the ability of our direct mail customers to penetrate desired markets as a result of the widespread delivery of mail to residences and businesses through the United States Postal Service; and (iii) the ability of our direct mail customers to include return materials inside their mailings. Principal competitive factors in the envelope business are quality, service and price. Although all three factors are equally important, various customers may emphasize one or more over the others. 
In selling our commercial print product offerings, we compete with large multinational commercial printing companies, as well as regional and local printers. The commercial printing industry continues to have excess capacity, and is highly competitive in most of our product categories and geographic regions. This excess capacity has resulted in a competitive pricing environment, in which companies have focused on reducing costs in order to preserve operating margins. Competition is based largely on price, quality and servicing the special requirements of customers. We believe this environment, combined with recent economic trends, will continue to lead to more consolidation within the commercial print industry as companies seek economies of scale, broader customer relationships, geographic coverage and product breadth to overcome or offset excess industry capacity and pricing pressures.
In selling our printed labels products, we compete with other label manufacturers with nationwide locations as well as regional and local printers that typically sell within a few hundred mile radius of their plants. Printed labels competition is based mainly on quick-turn customization, quality of products, pricing and customer service levels.
Employees
We employed approximately 7,300 people worldwide as of the year ended 2016, approximately 23% of whom were members of various local labor unions. Collective bargaining agreements, each of which cover the workers at a particular facility, expire from time to time and are negotiated separately. Accordingly, we believe no single collective bargaining agreement is material to our operations as a whole.
Environmental Regulations
Our operations are subject to federal, state, local and foreign environmental laws and regulations, including those relating to air emissions, waste generation, handling, management and disposal, and remediation of contaminated sites. We have implemented environmental programs designed to ensure that we operate in compliance with the applicable laws and regulations governing environmental protection. We believe we are in substantial compliance with applicable laws and regulations relating to environmental protection, and we do not anticipate material capital expenditures will be required to achieve or maintain compliance with environmental laws and regulations. However, there can be no assurance that newly discovered conditions, or new laws and regulations or stricter interpretations of existing laws and regulations, will not result in increased compliance or remediation costs.

The following presents a list of our executive officers, their age, present position, the year elected to their present position and other positions they have held during the past five years. Robert G. Burton, Jr. and Michael G. Burton are the sons of Robert G. Burton, Sr. There are no undisclosed arrangements or understandings pursuant to which any person was selected as an officer.
