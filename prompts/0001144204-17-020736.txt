Our Market Opportunity
 
U.S. government defense and national security spending, incorporating multiple federal agencies and departments, is driven by a complex range of persistent and evolving threats to the U.S. homeland and to its interests overseas. Over the last decade, the U.S. government has realigned the strategic priorities of the U.S. national security community, its capabilities and posture to achieve a sustainable balance between the ability to face down conventional threats from opposing states, the ability to combat non-state actors or asymmetric threats, and the ability to defeat threats from new technologies. These efforts have been concentrated on counter-terrorism, stabilizing fragile regions of strategic importance to the U.S., and counterinsurgency. Most recently and as emphasized in the 2016 Cyber National Action Plan, these efforts also addressed cybersecurity, one of the most important challenges we face as a nation.

In each case, emphasis has been given to developing new technologically-driven capabilities to strengthen operational decision making through improved information and intelligence, deliver precision in offensive operations in complex environments, and strengthen both defensive and offensive capabilities in the cyber domain.
 
In the March 2013 Worldwide Threat Assessment report to the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, the Director of National Intelligence, James R. Clapper, listed the cyber threat as the number one strategic threat to the United States, placing it ahead of terrorism for the first time since the attacks of September 11, 2001. Since then, the cyber threat has remained the number one strategic threat to the United States, as reported in the February 2015 Worldwide Threat Assessment. Over the past few years the number of cyber-attacks perpetrated by criminals, hackers and foreign nations against the U.S. Government’s networks has risen sharply. Potential state and non-state adversaries conduct malicious cyber activities against U.S. interests globally and in a manner intended to test the limits of what the U.S. and the international community will tolerate. Actors may penetrate U.S. networks and systems for a variety of reasons, such as to steal intellectual property, disrupt an organization’s operations for activist purposes, or to conduct disruptive and destructive attacks to achieve military objectives.
 
Since developing its first cyber strategy in 2011, the Department of Defense (DoD) has made significant investment and progress in building its cyber capabilities, developing its organizations and plans, and fostering the partnerships necessary to defend the country and its interests. However, as potential adversaries have also invested significantly in advancing their cyber capabilities, additional investment by the DoD will be needed to counter potential cyberattacks against the United States. As a reflection of our nation’s investment in cyber defense, U.S. Cyber Command is building a Cyber Mission Force of 133 teams assembled from 6,200 military, civilian, and contractor support personnel from across the military departments and defense components.  The Cyber Mission Force, which will be fully operational in 2018, is already employing capabilities in support of U.S. Government objectives across the spectrum of cyber operations.


U.S. national security is entrusted to a wide range of government organizations, including the Department of Defense, Department of State (DoS), Department of Homeland Security (DHS), and the Intelligence Community (IC).
 
The FY 2017 President’s DoD budget request accounts for approximately 15% of the total budget authority requested by the current Administration. The FY 2017 DoD budget request is $582.7 billion, including a base budget of $523.9 billion and $58.8 billion for overseas contingency operations, representing an increase in the DoD base budget of $2.2 billion from the 2016 enacted DoD base budget of $521.7 billion. The DoD projects the base budget will increase to $570.0 billion by 2020.
 
The President’s 2017 Budget requests $35.2 billion in base funding for the Department of State and the United States Agency for International Development, an $8 billion reduction from the 2016 annualized CR level.  The Budget also requests $14.9 billion as Overseas Contingency Operations funding for extraordinary costs, primarily in war areas like Syria, Iraq, and Afghanistan, for an agency total of $50.1 billion.
 
The President’s 2017 Budget requests $40.6 billion in net discretionary budget authority for DHS, a $.6 billion decrease from the 2016 annualized CR level.  The Budget would allocate an additional $6.7 billion for the Disaster Relief Fund (DRF) requested separately from discretionary amounts.  DHS has stated that safeguarding and securing cyberspace is a key focus area for the department, the FY 2017 budget request supports the DHS’s two primary cyber acquisition programs: $274.8 million for the Continuous Diagnostics and Mitigation program which provides hardware, software, and services designed to support activities that strengthen the operational security of federal “.gov” networks.  It would also allocate $471.1 million for the National Cybersecurity Protection System (NCPS), commonly referred to as EINSTEIN, to continue to combat intrusions, enhance information sharing, and deploy analytical capabilities to secure the Federal civilian information technology enterprise.
 
U.S. national security activities are also conducted by the U.S. Intelligence Community, a group composed of 17 agencies, departments, organizations, and branches of the U.S. military, which are organized to gather, analyze, and distribute intelligence. For FY 2017, the collective base budget request of the IC included $16.8 billion for the Military Intelligence Program (MIP) and $53.5 billion for the National Intelligence Program (NIP). The FY 2017 budget allocations represent a decrease over the FY 2016 budget estimates for the MIP of $1.1 billion and NIP of $.4 billion respectively. Key NIP initiatives include improving integration of programs spread across the 17 IC elements, expanding the use of shared IT capabilities, continuing to support the protection and security of the critical networks that facilitate IC information-sharing, and ensuring that mission-critical intelligence information flows anywhere and anytime it is required.

Below is an outline of the key areas of capability that we believe the U.S. government will continue to prioritize as critical to its defense and national security strategies and that we believe will drive continued growth in our target markets.

IT Systems and Support Spending
 
The operations of U.S. defense and federal agencies and the national security community demand a wide variety of technology-based systems and information that are increasingly integrated with support services and solutions in order to successfully offer a range of capabilities that support specific essential missions. These areas include, but are not limited to, C4ISR (command, control, communications, computers, intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance), information technology and related services, and other key support services.
 
Military operations and the modern warfighter rely on integrated technology platforms comprised of C4ISR systems and related information technology architectures (Mission IT). These platforms link networks of signals and sensors to people and platforms, providing greater interoperability within and between allied defense forces, enabling intelligent decision making, and delivering more operationally and cost-effective solutions to the defense and national security communities. In addition, the continuous reliance on C4ISR systems and Mission IT demands the frequent maintenance and upgrade of the platforms. The federal government procures systems and software engineering, integration, and technology development services to ensure that the technology is able to perform effectively, address evolving and complex challenges, and be customized for specific missions.
 
Information technology in the federal government spans a variety of initiatives in addition to areas focused on mission-oriented defense and national security, such as the growth and management of the significant administrative IT backbone of the defense and intelligence communities, which enables more routine but necessary communication. In addition, there is a complex systems architecture for managing the health and welfare of personnel. Furthermore, technology advancements have enabled new capabilities in information sharing which DoD and federal agencies are seeking. These agencies are focused on expanding, upgrading, and integrating their IT architecture to enhance information security, facilitate information sharing, increase efficiency, and mitigate costs.
 
Critical to supporting a wide range of government organizations, including the DoD, DHS, DoS and the Intelligence Community, in their national security initiatives, are the products and services related to information technology. According to the Federal Chief Information Officer, the total federal IT budget request for FY 2017 is approximately $81.6 billion, including the DoD addressable IT budget request of $44.9 billion, representing an overall decrease of 5.9% from the FY 2016 DoD IT budget request of $47.7 billion. 
 
For a discussion of the budget’s cybersecurity-related information technology priorities, see “—Cybersecurity and Secure Information Systems” below.


Due to an emphasis on cost effective federal IT spending, agencies have increased their use of agile development practices and evidence in the IT portfolio illustrates that agile projects have been nearly twice as likely to deliver on time as those using traditional development techniques, and have been 40% more likely to deliver planned capabilities on budget.
 
Cybersecurity and Secure Information Systems
 
Cyber attacks target networks and attempt to disrupt or sabotage information and control systems. Cyber attacks targeting networks to access sensitive data, disrupt systems and operations, and sabotage critical infrastructure are increasing in both frequency and sophistication, with perpetrators able to operate individually or in organized cells from anywhere in the world as part of terrorist, criminal or state networks. In recognition of these dynamics and the threats they pose to U.S. national security, the U.S. government is channeling greater resources into the drive to identify the sources of such attacks and develop and implement effective counter-measures. Although this drive is not simply a matter of technology, we believe that the development of advanced technological responses will remain the key element of defending networks, systems and critical infrastructure. In April 2015, the DoD outlined a new comprehensive cyber strategy with the purpose of guiding the development of DoD’s cyber forces and strengthening its cyber defense and cyber deterrence posture. The DoD’s cyber strategy focuses on building cyber capabilities and organizations for three principal cyber missions: (1) defend DoD networks, systems and information; (2) defend the U.S. and its interests against cyber attacks of significant consequence; and (3) provide integrated cyber capabilities to support military operations and contingency plans.

In FY 2017, the President’s budget proposes approximately $19 billion in cybersecurity funding to enhance America’s cyber capabilities. This represents a more than 35 percent increase from FY 2016 in overall Federal resources for cybersecurity, a necessary investment to secure our Nation in the future.  The 2017 budget calls for $3.1 billion for a fund to replace IT legacy systems, and $62 million for bolstering the federal cyber workforce through training and scholarships and other educational initiatives.  Of the $19 billion in cybersecurity requested in fiscal 2017, more than a third or $7 billion will go to the Pentagon.  In addition, the $3.1 billion IT Modernization Fund request would provide funding for projects that target agencies with the biggest cyber security and IT concerns, and look to capitalize on shared services such as cloud infrastructure.


Competitive Strengths
 
Agile Technology Development Tailored to Customer Needs
 
Our innovative approach to technology development gives us the ability to adapt quickly to customer needs in a rapidly evolving technology environment. Many larger prime contractors can have difficulty incorporating newer, disruptive technologies because their business models rely on larger programs of record and multi-year technology development cycles to support larger overhead. Our approach enables us to create and deploy the most effective and cost-effective solution. In a changing procurement climate, this type of creativity and agility is critical. In addition to being more innovative and adaptive than many larger players, we believe we are also more stable and established than many small businesses in the Defense Technology market. Customers require financial and operational stability, especially in mission-critical contexts, and we have an established, trusted record of high-level performance that spans four decades. Additionally, many smaller businesses do not have the talent or the infrastructure to support programs that require world-class capabilities to protect national security interests.
Established, Long-Standing Customer Relationships
 
The Company has developed trusted, enduring relationships across an exceptionally broad customer base in the defense, national security and federal/civilian landscape, which is a testament to our customers’ sustained confidence in our capabilities and our commitment to exceptional delivery. Our average period of continuous performance across our customer base is over a decade. We have worked with the U.S. Army for 18 years, the Department of State continuously for more than 21 years, the Department of Defense for over 18 years, the Department of the Treasury for over 16 years, and key elements of the Intelligence Community for over 13 years.
Diverse Contract Base
 
In addition to a diverse customer base, the Company is positioned on a wide range of contract vehicles, atypically broad for a company our size. We have positions on NETCENTS II, ITES-2, EAGLE II, CIO-SP3, SPAWAR ICO, GSA Alliant, and another large classified ID/IQ, as well as numerous single awards. Our breadth and diversity of contract vehicles provides our customers with various options to procure the solutions they require.
Strong Backlog and New Business Pipeline


We had backlog of $290 million on active contracts as of December 31, 2016, of which $75 million was funded and $215 million was unfunded, spanning more than 69 discrete contracts or task orders. Because we perform tasks that are essential to the day-to-day operations and core missions of our customers, the budgets for our business are well protected and growing. Additionally, we have a current pipeline of more than $3.5 billion of potential new business opportunities that we are currently pursuing or prospecting.
Experienced and Proven Leadership Team and Highly Skilled Workforce
 
The Company’s directors and officers have combined experience spanning many years of acquiring, leading and growing operating companies addressing US national security priorities, and working at senior levels in the US government’s defense and national security communities. Our workforce is staffed by highly skilled, qualified professionals, 84% of which have security clearances, with over 44% holding clearances to Top Secret and above. Over many years, the workforce has consistently earned the trust and confidence of key elements of the U.S. government’s national security community responsible for handling much of the nation’s most sensitive and mission-critical information.

Our Growth Strategy
 
Having established a strong platform in the mid-tier market, our objective is to consolidate, grow, and re-position the business as a technology innovator and provider of advanced solutions in the area of cybersecurity, agile software development, and integrated intelligence and data analytics in order to realize a premium valuation as the leading agile and sustainable mid-tier market player. Achieving this objective requires a detailed strategy to drive stronger organic growth in higher margin, high-growth market areas, and accelerate growth through strategic acquisitions using our proprietary mergers and acquisitions pipeline.
Organic Growth
 
We believe that the Company is well positioned to achieve strong platform growth, combining our significant, differentiated capabilities with our extensive network of government and industry relationships and experience of managing continuous operating improvements to enhance profitability and customer performance. The Company expects to achieve stronger organic growth through deeper and broader client relationships, a sustained emphasis on business efficiencies and the accelerated development of new solutions and capabilities.

Key areas of organic improvement to realize this growth include:
 
Business Development
 
 The following areas of customer requirement have been prioritized for opportunity capture, each with significant alignment to current programs and capabilities; Software Development, Modernization and Enhancement (DME), Cyber Protection and Computer Network Defense (CND), and medium to large IT support services.
 
In addition, the Company has achieved greater alignment between its business development processes and human capital to allow for a more focused and effective application of resources against these identified opportunities. On September 12, 2016, Phillip E. Lacombe began employment as the Company’s President and Chief Operating Officer replacing the retiring Paul Fernandes. Mr. Lacombe is a seasoned industry executive with over 20 years of leadership experience in the defense and national security technology sector. In addition, Business Development personnel have been centralized under a single reporting line with direct oversight by the new Senior Vice President of Business Development. Our growing pipeline of opportunities has highlighted the need for additional resources to ensure effective capture management. Several suitably qualified senior business development specialists were recruited during 2016 and early 2017. Finally, the capture management process itself has been re-invigorated with focused opportunity reviews conducted by senior management to ensure full alignment of effort and seamless functional support across the business.
 
Optimize Operational Efficiency
 
Immediately following the Business Combination, the Company completed a reorganization of its operations into the three competency-based Sectors – Cyber Security and Secure Information Systems (CSIS); Software Development Systems and Services (SDDS), and Intelligence and Analytics (IA). This organizational realignment has allowed us to deliver our solutions more efficiently across all the markets we serve and reduce cost in overhead and G&A. We expect to leverage these changes to improve margins and increase the opportunities for our senior management team to be more connected with our customers to deepen relationships and drive cross selling opportunities.
 
12



Significant Cross-Selling Opportunities
 
 Significant opportunities exist for the Company’s differentiated capabilities to be marketed and sold across adjacent clients in the defense, federal civilian, and intelligence communities. The creation of the Cyber Security and Secure Information Systems (CSIS), Software Development Systems and Services (SDSS) and Intelligence and Analytics (IA) Sectors has allowed for a much more effective segmentation of the pipeline. A renewed focus on identifying where in Government our capabilities are in significant and growing demand has encouraged greater creativity and market shaping to exploit cross-selling opportunities across multiple agencies.
 
Continue to Shift Services to Higher-End Solutions
 
The Company has charted a clear path that leverages current capabilities and contract vehicles to allow greater access to customers requiring higher-end, higher value solutions. Specifically, our strategic emphasis on Software DME, particularly where we can apply our proprietary agile software development methodology, Cadence, and urgent US Army and US Air Force requirements for Cyber Protection and Computer Network Defense solutions contracted through our NETCENTS 2 and ITES-2S contracts will allow us to enhance the value of the solutions we provide. This approach will also allow us to increase the amount and scale of higher margin work by broadening and deepening our penetration of currently under-developed customer sets through smart cross-selling.
 
13


Inorganic Growth
 
The Company intends to accelerate growth through acquisitions, and plans to build differentiated capabilities and new customers and contracts, with a focus on complementary, high-end technologies. We have established detailed plans to maximize leverage as a public company to accelerate growth through the acquisition of differentiated capabilities to achieve new customer penetration and enhance the sophistication of our offerings to existing customer sets. These plans include:
Pending PSS Acquisition
 
On February 18, 2017, the Company entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”) to acquire PSS Holdings, Inc. (“PSS”) for approximately $119.5 million in cash, subject to certain adjustments based upon closing working capital, plus a portion of the value of certain tax benefits as they are realized after the closing. The purchase price will also be increased by an additional $20,000 per day if the merger is consummated after March 31, 2017 and certain conditions to the obligations of the Company to close are otherwise satisfied, such increase applicable for each day after March 31, 2017 that such conditions are so satisfied.
 
PSS is a privately-held government services business that provides products and services in information technology, engineering, and program management, and is a leading provider of advanced computing, analytics, program and acquisition management, cyber and software solutions to key defense, intelligence and federal civilian customers, working with over 25 government agency partners. Upon consummation of the merger contemplated by the Merger Agreement (the “merger”), PSS will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company.
 
The consummation of the merger is subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, including receipt of certain required third party consents. If any condition to the merger is not satisfied or waived, the merger will not be completed. In addition, the Company intends to fund the merger consideration through a combination of equity and debt financing. We do not presently have commitments for such financing. To the extent the merger is not completed due to our inability to obtain financing for the merger, we may be required to pay a termination fee of $625,000 to PSS.
 
On April 13, 2017, the Company received a letter from PSS purporting to terminate the Merger Agreement, unless we notify PSS that we are prepared to close and schedule the closing of the merger for no later than April 23, 2017. The Company does not believe the purported termination of the Merger Agreement is valid, and the Company is evaluating its alternatives and rights under the Merger Agreement.
  
Pursuing additional strategic, capability-enhancing acquisitions 

We will continue to pursue selective strategic acquisitions that expand our platform of capabilities and solutions. This will include companies that are leaders in supporting the US intelligence and defense community, as well as technologies and solutions in high performance computing, cloud computing, data analytics and cybersecurity.  We are also interested in identifying firms possessing demonstrated capability and innovation that are critical to (1) the transformation of the Defense and Intelligence Community’s cyber and intelligence operations and (2) improving the overall cybersecurity posture of the Federal, Defense and Intelligence Community and commercial critical infrastructure enterprises.


Add IP and Complementary, Differentiated Capabilities
 
In addition to the proposed acquisition of PSS, the Company plans to target mergers and acquisitions opportunities with strong intellectual property and differentiated capabilities complementary to our platform, with a focus on high-end technologies that will scale and command premium valuations, including mobile application development, mobile technology systems, agile software development and advanced data analytics.Expand Customer and Contract Vehicle Base
 
The Company intends to place emphasis on acquiring businesses that will give it access to key new customers and large contract vehicles.

We derive our revenue primarily from contracts with U.S. government agencies, where we provide our services and solutions under three types of federal government contracts: time-and-materials, cost-plus, and firm fixed-price.
 
For the year ended December 31, 2016, we derived approximately 34%, 37%, and 29% of our revenue from time-and-materials, cost-plus fixed fee, and firm fixed-price contracts, respectively, and approximately 87% of our revenue was derived from contracts in which we were the prime contractor with the remaining 13% being derived from contracts in which we were a subcontractor. In 2016, our largest single-contract award accounted for approximately 20% of our total revenue, and our top five largest contracts accounted for 58% of  total revenue.
 
In 2016, approximately 53% of our revenue was derived from stand-alone contracts, 26% from Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPAs) and General Services Administration (GSA) schedules, and 21% from agency-sponsored Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) contracts. The aggregate contract ceiling value across active ID/IQs, GSA schedules and stand-alone contracts is more than $168 billion (excluding unlimited ceiling vehicles).
 
Backlog
 
We define total backlog as the amount of revenue we expect to realize (i) over the remaining base contract performance period and (ii) from the exercise of option periods that we reasonably believe will be exercised, in each case from signed contracts in existence as of the measurement date. We also include in backlog our estimates of revenue from future delivery orders on requirements and ID/IQ contracts for which we have an established pattern of revenues. At times, our estimates of future revenue on such contracts are less than the contract ceiling. Our estimates are based on our experience using such vehicles and similar contracts.
 
We define funded backlog as the portion of our total backlog for which funding is currently appropriated and obligated to us under a signed contract or task order by the purchasing agency, or otherwise authorized for payment to us by a customer upon completion of a specified portion of work. Our funded backlog does not include the full potential value of our contracts, because Congress often appropriates funds to be used by an agency for a particular program or contract only on a yearly or quarterly basis, even though the contract may call for performance over a number of years. As a result, contracts typically are only partially funded at any point during their term, and all or some of the work to be performed under the contracts may remain unfunded unless and until Congress makes subsequent appropriations and the procuring agency allocates funding to the contract. Unfunded backlog is total backlog minus funded backlog.
 
As of December 31, 2016, our total backlog was $290 million, of which $75 million was funded and $215 million was unfunded. As of December 31, 2016, we expect to recognize approximately 45% or $131 million of our backlog as revenue in 2017.
 
Regulatory Matters
 
We must comply with laws and regulations relating to the formation, administration, and performance of U.S. Government contracts. The Federal Acquisition Regulation, or FAR, which mandates uniform policies and procedures for U.S. Government acquisitions and purchased services, governs the majority of our contracts. Individual agencies also have acquisition regulations that provide implementing language for the FAR or that supplement the FAR.
 
Other federal regulations require certification and disclosure of cost or pricing data in connection with contract negotiations for certain types of contracts, define allowable and unallowable costs, govern reimbursement rights under cost-based contracts, and restrict the use, dissemination and exportation of products and information classified for national security purposes. 
 
Additionally, federal government contracts, by their terms, generally can be terminated at any time by the federal government, without cause, for the convenience of the federal government. If a federal government contract is so terminated, we would be entitled to receive compensation for the services provided and costs incurred through the time of termination, plus settlement expenses and a negotiated amount of profit. Federal government contractors who fail to comply with applicable U.S. Government procurement-related statutes and regulations may be subject to potential contract termination, suspension and debarment from contracting with the U.S. Government, or other remedies. See “Risk Factors” for a description of the various risks we may face regarding laws and regulations relating to U.S. Government Contracts.
 
Employees
 
As of December 31, 2016, we had 940 full-time and part-time employees. Security clearances are held by approximately 84% of our employees with over 44% of those clearances at the level of Top Secret or above. None of our employees are subject to collective bargaining agreements.

Intellectual Property
 
We do not fund or invest into any material research and development initiatives. Our technology development, integration and implementation services within the cybersecurity, software development and intelligence and analytics business areas are not generally dependent upon any codified intellectual property of our own. We claim a proprietary interest in certain service offerings, approaches, methodologies and know-how. We do not consider our business to be materially dependent on the protection of such proprietary methodologies. Additionally, we have a number of trade secrets that contribute to our success and competitive positioning, and we endeavor to protect this information. While protecting trade secrets and proprietary information is important, we are not materially dependent on any specific trade secret or group of trade secrets. Other than licenses to commercially available third-party software, we have no licenses to intellectual property that are significant to our business.
Legal Proceedings
 
The Company is from time to time subject to various claims and lawsuits incidental to our business. In the opinion of management, these claims and suits, individually or in the aggregate, will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements, results of operations or liquidity.
