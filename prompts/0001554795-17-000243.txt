History
 
The Company is currently in the business of acquiring companies and technologies engaged in the development, production, sales and marketing of CBD related products and processes
 
On April 1, 2015 the Company entered into a Share Exchange Agreement with Freedom Feed & Seed Inc. (the “FSF Share Exchange Agreement”). Pursuant to the Share Exchange Agreement, the Company acquired 75,000 (100%) shares of common stock of FSF from FSF (the “FSF Shares”) and in exchange issued 31,429,000 restricted shares of its common stock to the FSF Shareholders (the “MYHI Shares”). As a result of the Share Exchange Agreement, FSF became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. The Share Exchange Agreement contained customary representations, warranties and conditions to closing. The transaction closed on May 19, 2015.
 
Subsequent to the above transaction, FSF and MYHI enter into a Rescission Agreement (the "RA") on June 30, 2015 rescinding the Exchange Agreement. As provided in the RA all MYHI shares issued to FSF were to be returned to MYHI and cancelled and MYHI was to return all FSF shares received to FSF. FSF had until August 1, 2015 to return the MYHI shares, at which point the RA granted the Secretary of MYHI the power to cancel the shares in total as attorney-in-fact for the holders of the MYHI shares. As of March 31, 2016, none of the shares had been cancelled. On April 25, 2016, 28,604,173 of the shares were returned and cancelled. A hold has been placed on the remaining 2,824,827 outstanding shares by our transfer agent.
 
On May 22, 2015 the Company completed the acquisition of Greenlife Botanix ("Greenlife") as detailed in the First Amendment to the Shareholder Agreement dated February 8, 2015. The Company issued 10,000,000 restricted shares of its common stock to the shareholders of Greenlife in exchange for their 100% interest in Greenlife. The shares were valued at the market value on the date of issuance, $0.23, for a total consideration of $2,300,000. The amount paid for Greenlife was recorded as Goodwill due to the start up nature of Greenlife and the minimal net assets of Greenlife at the time of acquisition, see the table below. Subsequent to the purchase of Greenlife the Company entered into a rescission agreement with Freedom Seed and Feed, "FSF", which impaired the integration of Greenlife and FSF into a fully integrated cosmetic company. Due to the rescission of FSF and the remarketing of the Greenlife product line the Company evaluated the book value of the asset and elected to impair the Goodwill value of Greenlife and expensed the $2,300,000 book value in the year ended March 31, 2016.
