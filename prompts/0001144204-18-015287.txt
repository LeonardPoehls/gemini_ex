--------+---------

Overview of Our Business
 
We are a customer focused, national supplier of high-quality consumer tissue products. We produce bulk tissue paper, known as parent rolls, and convert parent rolls into finished products, including paper towels, bathroom tissue and paper napkins. We generally sell excess parent rolls not required by our converting operation to other converters. Our integrated manufacturing facilities have flexible production capabilities, which allow us to produce high quality tissue products within short production times for customers in our target regions. This vertical integration, a low variable cost per unit, and the use of operating leverage, we believe, all provide a competitive advantage from a cost standpoint. We predominately sell our products under private labels to our core customer base in the “at home” market, which consists primarily of dollar stores, discount retailers and grocery stores that offer limited alternatives across a wide range of products. Our focus historically has been the dollar stores (which are also referred to as discount retailers) and the broader discount retail market because of their overall market growth, consistent order patterns and low number of stock keeping units (“SKUs”). The “at home” tissue market consists of several quality levels, including a value tier, premium tier and ultra-premium tier. To a lesser extent, we service customers in the “away from home” market, which includes companies in the janitorial market and food service market. Most of the products we sell in the “away from home” market are included in the value tier. While we expect to continue to service this market in the near term, we currently do not consider the “away from home” market a growth vehicle for us.
 
Our facilities have been designed to have the flexibility to produce and convert parent rolls across different product tiers and to use both virgin and recycled fibers to optimize quality and costs. We own an integrated facility in Pryor, Oklahoma with modern paper making and converting equipment, which primarily services the central United States. In 2015, we introduced a new paper machine and an additional converting line at our Pryor facility for an investment of approximately $39 million. The new paper machine provides approximately 17,000 tons of parent roll capacity, resulting in total annual parent roll capacity of approximately 74,000 tons at our Pryor facility. The additional converting line added 12,500 tons of capacity, for a total of 82,500 tons of annual converting capacity at our Pryor facility. In June 2014, we expanded our geographic presence to service the west coast of the United States through a strategic transaction with Fabrica de Papel San Francisco, S.A. de C.V. (“Fabrica”), one of the largest tissue manufacturers by capacity in Mexico (the “Fabrica Transaction”). The Fabrica Transaction provided us exclusive access to Fabrica’s U.S. customers, enabling us to further penetrate the region, and the supply agreement (“Supply Agreement”) we entered into with Fabrica has provided access to up to 19,800 tons of product each year at cost.
 
As part of our strategy to be a national supplier of high quality consumer tissue products, we constructed a world-class integrated tissue operation in Barnwell, South Carolina, for a total investment of approximately $165 million. We believe that this new facility allows us to better serve our existing customers in the Southeastern United States, while also enabling us to penetrate new customers in this region. The facility is designed to provide highly flexible, cost competitive production across all quality tiers with estimated parent roll capacity of 35,000 to 40,000 tons per year and estimated converting capacity of 30,000 to 32,000 tons per year. The paper machine utilizes a highly versatile process capable of producing all quality grades, including ultra-premium tier products. The first converting line was operational in the first quarter of 2016 and the second converting line was operational in the third quarter of 2016. The paper machine and de-inking plant were operational in the second half of 2017.
 
The Tissue Industry
 
Annual sales of the overall tissue market is approximately $15.3 billion, which consists of bath tissue, paper towels, facial tissues and paper napkins. Bath tissue represents the largest segment, accounting for 53% of the overall market followed by paper towels at 33%, facial tissue at 10% and paper napkins at 4%. The overall U.S. tissue industry has historically grown in line with population growth, or approximately 1%. The private label segment of the market has grown above the industry average as a result of taking share from the branded segment. Market share gains in the private label tissue market have been driven, in part, by increased efforts by retailers to compete, using their own brands. Also, improvements in tissue quality by private label manufactuerers have made it more competitive and an attractive value proposition relative to branded tissue products. IRI Worldwide estimates that the private label segment of the tissue market grew 4.4% in 2017 (on a dollar sales basis) versus a decline of 1.8% for branded tissue.

Private label tissue accounts for approximately 26% of the overall market, with annual sales of $4 billion. Branded tissue products account for the other 74%, or annual sales of $11.3 billion. In dollar sales, the market share of private label in bath tissue, paper towels, facial tissue and paper napkins is approximately 21.4%, 31.0%, 23.9% and 54.4%, respectively.
 
The tissue industry is made up of the “at home” market, which represents the consumer retail segment, and the “away from home” segment, which represents tissue products used in establishments such as retail stores, offices buildings, hotels and food service establishments. There are approximately eight million tons of capacity in the U.S. market, two-thirds of which supply the “at home” market and the other third supplying the “away from home” market.
 
The quality tiers in the “at home” tissue market consists of value, premium and ultra-premium. While the overall tissue market is growing around 1%, the ultra-premium segment is growing much faster. The five-year CAGR for the ultra-premium segment is estimated to be around 12%.
 
Converted Products
 
The capacity of our twelve converting lines in Pryor, Oklahoma and two converting lines in Barnwell, South Carolina, are highly dependent upon the mix of products produced (e.g. bath tissue versus paper towels versus napkins) and the configuration of products produced (e.g. one roll pack versus multi-roll packs, the size of multi-roll packs (6-count versus 8-count versus 12-count), and sheet counts), and other factors affecting effective operational efficiencies. We have increased our capabilities to emboss, print, and scent our converted products as part of our innovation strategy.
Parent Rolls
 
We purchase various types of fibers to manufacture bulk rolls of tissue paper, called "parent rolls," which we then convert into a broad line of finished tissue products. The fiber we source to manufacture our parent rolls consists primarily of pre-consumer recycled grades, with a lesser amount consisting of virgin kraft grades. As we continue our efforts to expand our product offerings into the higher quality tiers of the market, the percentage of virgin kraft grades that we purchase will likely increase. Our paper mill in Pryor has a pulping process, which takes recycled fibers and kraft fibers and processes them for use in our three paper machines. Our pulping operation has the ability to selectively process our mixed basket of fibers to achieve maximum quality and to control costs. In 2015, we replaced two of our older paper machines in Pryor with a new paper machine, which increased our tissue paper making capacity from approximately 57,000 tons to approximately 74,000 tons, depending upon the mix of paper grades produced. The new machine also reduced our manufacturing costs, improved product quality and increased manufacturing flexibility.
 
Generally, our parent roll production operation runs on a 24/7 operating schedule. Parent rolls we produce in excess of converting production requirements are sold, subject to other inventory management considerations, on the open market. Our strategy is to sell all of the parent rolls we manufacture as converted products (such as paper towels, bathroom tissue and napkins), which generally carry higher margins than non-converted parent rolls. Parent rolls are a commodity product and thus are subject to market pricing. We plan to continue to sell any excess parent roll capacity on the open market as long as market pricing is profitable. When converting production requirements exceed paper mill capacity, we supplement our paper making capacity by purchasing parent rolls on the open market, which we believe has an unfavorable impact on our gross profit margin.
 
Customers
 
We supply both large national customers and regional customers while targeting high growth regions of the United States and high growth distribution channels. Our largest customers are Dollar General, Walmart (including Sam’s Club) and Family Dollar (including its parent, Dollar Tree). Sales to these three customers represented approximately 67% of our converted product sales in 2017.

Our products are a daily consumable item. Therefore, the order stream from our customer base is fairly consistent with limited seasonal fluctuations. Changes in the national economy do not materially affect the market for our products due to their non-discretionary nature and high degree of household penetration; however, discount stores, a principal element of our customer base, may have higher sales during economic downturns. Demand for tissue typically grows in line with overall population, and our customers are typically located in regions of the U.S. where the population is growing faster than the national average. Private label markets have been growing as more consumers watch for value; however, competition between brand names and private labels continue a give and take.
 
We focus our sales efforts on areas within approximately 500 miles of our manufacturing facilities, as we believe this radius maximizes our freight cost advantage. Our target region around our Oklahoma facility includes the lower Mid-West. The Fabrica Transaction allowed us to more effectively service customers that are located in the Southwest. We believe our manufacturing facility in Barnwell, South Carolina will help us meet the growing demand in the Southeast. Demand for tissue in the “at home” tissue market has historically been closely correlated to population growth and, as such, performs well in a variety of economic conditions. Our expanded target region has experienced strong population growth in the past years relative to the national average, and these trends are expected to continue.
 
Our products are sold primarily under our customers’ private labels and, to a lesser extent, under our brand names such as Orchids Supreme, Clean Scents, Tackle®, Colortex®, My Size®, Velvet®, and Big Mopper®. The Fabrica Transaction gave us the exclusive right to sell products under Fabrica’s brand names in the United States, including under the names Virtue®, Truly Green®, Golden Gate Paper® and Big Quality®. All of our converted product net sales are derived through truckload purchase orders from our customers. Parent roll net sales are derived from purchase orders that generally cover a one-month time-period. We do not have supply contracts with any of our customers, which is the standard practice within our industry.
 
In 2017, we generated net revenue of $162.5 million, of which 92% came from the sale of converted products and 8% came from the sale of parent rolls. Our converted product revenue consisted of 54% from paper towels, 43% from bathroom tissue, and 3% from paper napkins. In 2017, approximately 67% of our converted product net revenue came from our three largest customers. The balance of 2017 converted product net sales came from other discount retailers, grocery stores, grocery wholesalers and cooperatives, convenience stores, janitorial supply companies and companies in the food service market.
 
Our profitability depends on several key factors, including but not limited to:
 

● | the types and costs of fiber used in producing paper;
--+------------------------------------------------------


● | the volume of converted products produced and sold;
--+----------------------------------------------------


● | the efficiency of operations in both our paper mills and converting faciliites;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | freight costs;
--+---------------


● | the market price of our products;
--+----------------------------------


● | the cost of energy;
--+--------------------


● | the costs of labor and maintenance;
--+------------------------------------


● | financial leverage undertaken, inclusive of its impacts upon interest expense and debt service; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | capital spending requirements, inclusive of impacts upon depreciation
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------

 
The private label tissue market is highly competitive, and many discount retail customers are extremely price sensitive. As a result, it is difficult to affect price increases. We expect these competitive conditions to continue.
 
History
 
We were formed in April 1998 following the acquisition of our present facilities located in Pryor, Oklahoma and subsequently changed our name to Orchids Paper Products Company. In July 2005, we completed our initial public offering, and in July 2009, we completed a follow-on stock offering. In 2014, in conjunction with the Fabrica Transaction, we acquired certain papermaking and converting assets located in Mexicali, Mexico, as well as Fabrica’s U.S. business. In April 2015, we completed a follow-on stock offering. The proceeds of $32.1 million were used to help fund the construction of our greenfield site in Barnwell, South Carolina. Additionally, in May 2017, we established an "at the market" stock offering program ("ATM Program") through which we may, from time to time, issue and sell shares of our common stock having an aggregate gross sales price of up to $40.0 million. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we realized net proceeds of $5.0 million under the ATM Program, which were used for general corporate purposes. As of December 31, 2017, $34.7 million of common stock remained available for issuance under the ATM Program.

Competitive Conditions
 
We believe the principal competitive factors in the markets in which we operate are product-quality attributes, brand-recognition, price, customer service, positive customer-relationships, low cost, investing capital wisely in modern equipment and technologies, a strategically located manufacturing footprint, innovation to differentiate our products, an experienced management team with a proven track record, a broad line of product offering, and flexible converting capabilities. This flexibility allows us to meet the particular demands of individual retailers. We believe the product quality attributes that can be produced from our converting lines, new processes on our newest paper machines and other new product development initiatives will allow us to effectively compete in the higher tier markets.
 
Competition in the tissue market is significantly affected by geographic location, as freight costs represent a material portion of end-product costs. We believe it is generally economically feasible for us to ship within an approximate 900-mile radius of the production site; however, we primarily focus on an approximate 500-mile radius, as we believe this radius maximizes our freight cost advantage over our competitors. In our markets, we believe there are the following significant private-label competitors: Georgia Pacific, Cascades, Sofidel, Clearwater Paper Corporation, Kruger Inc., Resolute Forest Products, Royal Paper, and Asia Pulp and Paper.
 
The private label tissue market is highly fragmented. Large capital expenditures required to establish a paper mill and converting facility and difficulties in obtaining environmental and local permits for parent roll manufacturing facilities may discourage new entrants into the market. A number of competitors have announced their own capacity expansions, principally in structured tissue, intended to service the ultra-premium market. Population growth and other trends may consume the added capacity within the next three years, but the greater impact may be upon the ultra-premium products and their margins, a market that Orchids has only been servicing on the West Coast, prior to constructing its Barnwell, South Carolina, facility. The Barnwell, South Carolina, facility is the only private-label manufacturer, of whom we are aware, using a relatively new ultra-premium tissue capability developed by Valmet Corporation (“Valmet”) that is expected to produce a higher-quality structured tissue at a lower cost than the new tissue technology (“NTT”) and a comparable high-quality structured tissue at a lower cost than the through air drying (“TAD”) technology announced by others.
 
Product Overview
 
We offer our customers an array of private label products, including bathroom tissue, paper towels and paper napkins, across the value, premium and ultra-premium market segments. In 2017, 53% of our converted product case shipments were paper towels, 44% were bathroom tissue and 3% were paper napkins. Of our converted products sold in 2017, 74% were packaged as private label products in accordance with our customers' specifications. The remaining 26% were packaged under our brands and those licensed from Fabrica. We have not actively promoted our brand names and do not believe our brand names have significant market recognition. However, we are continuing to introduce and expand upon our brand-lines and we hope to increase our market recognition through innovation and future promotions. Our core customer base consists of discount retailers (including dollar stores). We also sell our products to mass merchandisers, club stores, grocery stores, grocery wholesalers and cooperatives, convenience stores, janitorial supply stores and stores in the food service market. Our recent growth has come from diversifying our customers base by providing products for all market tiers, principally to mass merchandiser and club stores. We believe we were among the first to focus on serving customers in the discount retail channel and we have benefited from their increased emphasis on consumables, such as tissue products and the expansion of their private label product line into higher tiers as part of their merchandising strategies. By seeking to provide improved product quality, consistently competitive prices, and superior customer service, we believe we have differentiated ourselves from our competitors and generated positive relationships with our customers. In 2017, approximately 55% of our converted product net sales were derived from sales to the discount retail channel.
 
With strategic capital investments and new product development work on our paper machines and converting equipment, we are increasingly able to provide higher quality products and broaden our product offering into the higher tier markets through improved quality of paper, increased packaging configurations, enhanced graphics, improved embossing, and use of scents. Part of our strategy to optimize converted product sales is to increase our sales of premium and ultra-premium tier products, as these products typically have a higher gross margin than value tier products. Prior to the completion of the Barnwell, South Carolina paper mill, we only had the capability to manufacture a relatively small volume of structured tissue / ultra-premium products through the Supply Agreement with Fabrica. With the completion of the mill at the Barnwell, South Carolina facility, we expect to be able to produce and sell 35,000 tons, or more, of the best ultra-premium grade paper at relatively higher margins in 2018.
 
Our ability to increase sales depends significantly upon ramping-up new business already promised and our ability to win new private label bids and grow our own brands. We have been successfully bidding, with new and existing retailers, into new distribution channels and into premium and ultra-premium tier markets. We are focusing on diversifying our customer base and reducing customer concentration.

Our largest customers in 2017 were Dollar General, Walmart (including Sam’s Club) and Family Dollar (including its parent, Dollar Tree). Sales to these three customers represented approximately 67% of our converted product sales in 2017. The following provides additional details regarding our relationships with our largest customers:
 
Dollar General. Dollar General is our largest customer, accounting for approximately 31% of our converted product net sales in 2017. With 2016 annual revenue of $22 billion and more than 14,000 stores in 44 states, Dollar General is among the largest discount retailers in the United States. We currently supply value tier and premium tier products to Dollar General.
Walmart / Sam’s Club. Walmart and its stores, including Sam’s Club, is our second largest customer, accounting for approximately 20% of our converted product net sales in 2017. Walmart significantly increased its business with Orchids in mid-2017. With 2016 annual revenue in excess of $480 billion, Walmart is a leading retail and wholesale provider, serving customers under 59 banners in 28 countries and e-commerce websites in 11 countries. We currently supply value tier and premium tier products to Walmart. We currently supply ultra premium products to Sam’s Club.
Family Dollar / Dollar Tree. Family Dollar along with its parent company, Dollar Tree, is our third largest customer, accounting for approximately 16% of our converted product net sales in 2017. Dollar Tree is a leading operator of discount variety stores, operating from over 14,300 retail stores under its two banners – Dollar Tree and Family Dollar. Family Dollar operates almost 8,000 stores in 46 states. Family Dollar currently has eleven distribution centers throughout the United States. We currently supply value tier and premium tier products to Family Dollar.
Sales and Marketing Team
 
We maintain an internal sales team of approximately seven employees led by our Vice President of Sales and Marketing. Our sales staff directly services eight customers representing approximately 75% of our converted product sales in 2017 and indirectly services all other customers by supervising our network of approximately 40 brokers. Our sales staff and broker network are instrumental in establishing and maintaining strong relationships with our customers. Our management team recognizes that these brokers have relationships with many of our customers, and we work with these brokers in an effort to increase our business with these accounts. Our sales and marketing organization seeks to collaborate with our brokers to leverage these relationships. With each of our key customers, however, our senior management team participates with the independent brokers in all critical customer meetings to establish and maintain direct customer relationships.
 
A majority of our brokers provide marketing support to their retail accounts, which includes shelf placement of products and in-store merchandising activities to support our product distribution. We generally pay our brokers commissions ranging from 1% to 3% of the sales they generate. Commissions totaling $0.8 million and $1.1 million were paid in the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
 
The Company undertakes various promotional programs, but has historically not used advertising extensively to either its customers or to consumers.
 
Manufacturing
 
We own and operate a paper mill, converting facility and a finished goods warehouse, located in Pryor, Oklahoma. Additionally, we own a new world-class integrated tissue operation in Barnwell, South Carolina, which began converting production during 2016 and mill and de-inking operations in the second half of 2017. As a result of the Fabrica Transaction, we own papermaking and converting assets in Mexicali, Mexico, which are operated by Fabrica under a lease agreement (“Equipment Lease Agreement”).
 
Our paper mills produce parent rolls that are then converted into tissue products at our converting facilities or are sold to other converters. The paper mill facilities produce paper made primarily using recycled industrial / pre-consumer and post-consumer fiber. We utilize high grades of recycled fiber along with a basket of other fibers, including virgin bleached pulp kraft fiber such as northern bleached softwood, eucalyptus and northern bleached hardwood, to produce our parent rolls. The mix of fiber used is dependent upon the attributes required for the particular grades of product. As we continue our efforts to gain converted product business in the higher quality premium and ultra-premium tier markets, we expect to increase our use of virgin bleached pulp kraft fiber. However, new de-inking and other technologies in which we have invested or in which we are investing may permit the use of an increased percentage of recycled fiber in the higher-grade papers in the future. Our parent roll production capacity has typically exceeded the demands upon our converting operations and excess parent rolls are sold into the open market.

We convert parent rolls into finished tissue products at our converting facilities. The converting process, which varies slightly by product category, generally includes embossing, laminating, and perforating or cutting the parent rolls as they are unrolled; pressing two or more plies together in the case of multiple-ply products; printing designs for certain products and cutting into rolls or stacks; wrapping in polyethylene film; the addition of scents to the core when specified, and packing in corrugated boxes or on display-ready pallets for shipment.
 
One of the key advantages of our converting plants is their flexible manufacturing capabilities, which enables us to provide our customers with a variety of package sizes and format options and enables our customers to fit products into particular price categories.
 
Pryor, Oklahoma Facility
 
Our Pryor, Oklahoma facility is housed on a 36-acre property and includes two paper mill facilities totaling 162,000 square feet. The original mill building is approximately 135,000 square feet and houses two paper machines and related processing equipment. The newer facility is approximately 27,000 square feet and houses one paper machine, with an adjacent 29,400 square foot parent roll warehouse. Generally, our Oklahoma paper mill operates 24 hours a day, 363 days a year, with a two-day annual planned maintenance shutdown and has an annual paper making capacity of approximately 74,000 tons.
 
In our 300,000 square-foot Oklahoma converting facility, we operate our higher-speed, more flexible converting lines 24 hours a day 7 days a week and utilize our other converting lines as needed. We believe this schedule allows us to provide world-class customer service while optimizing our operating costs. In 2015, we installed an additional high-speed, flexible converting line. The converting facility, which has an annual converting capacity of approximately 82,500 tons, produced approximately 51,000 tons, in 2017, under available capacity as we utilized additional capacity at our Barnwell facility to meet demand.
 
Our 245,000 square foot finished goods warehouse is located adjacent to our converting facility and has the capacity to hold approximately 600,000 cases of finished product. Our targeted finished goods inventory level is three to four weeks of sales. We utilize third party warehousing from time to time to accommodate changes in inventory carry levels to support customer shipment requirements.
 
Mexicali, Mexico Assets
 
The papermaking and converting equipment we own in Mexico, which had a net book value of $5.7 million at December 31, 2017, is operated by Fabrica under the Equipment Lease Agreement entered into in conjunction with the Fabrica Transaction. In accordance with the terms of the transaction, Fabrica has discretion on the most effective manner in which to use these assets. Fabrica may use these assets to provide parent rolls or products under the Supply Agreement or may utilize its other assets to produce products purchased under the Supply Agreement, depending on quality requirements and machine capabilities. The terms of the Supply Agreement allow us to purchase up to 19,800 annual tons of converted products from Fabrica.
Barnwell, South Carolina Facility
 
Our Barnwell, South Carolina facility is housed on an 86-acre property. In 2016, we completed a 300,000 square foot converting facility, housing two converting lines with an annual converting capacity between 30,000 and 32,000 tons. The first converting line began producing converted products in the first quarter of 2016, and the second converting line began production in the third quarter of 2016. The converting facility produced approximately 19,000 tons in 2017.
 
A 115,000 square foot paper mill with one tissue paper machine and related processing equipment, which has an annual paper making capacity between 35,000 and 40,000 tons, was completed near the end of second quarter 2017. The facility also includes a recycling / de-inking plant, which was completed near the end of fourth quarter 2017. Additionally, the property includes storage space for raw materials and finished goods. The mill produced approximately 9,300 tons of tissue paper during its ramp-up in 2017.

Distribution
 
Our products are delivered to our customers in truckload quantities. For our facilities in Oklahoma and South Carolina, many of our larger customers arrange for transportation of our products to their distribution centers at their cost. For our remaining customers, we arrange for third-party freight companies to deliver the products. In 2017, changes in our customer mix, including the addition of new customers, resulted in a higher percentage of third-party freight shipments to customers, which increased our freight costs. Expected freight costs are included in quoted prices to customers. In 2017, Fabrica arranged for and Orchids paid for third-party freight companies to deliver shipments under the Supply Agreement.
Raw Materials and Energy
 
In our Oklahoma facility, the principal raw materials used to manufacture our parent rolls are fiber, primarily recycled fibers and to a lesser extent virgin kraft fibers, and water. Currently, recycled fiber accounts for a majority of the fiber used to produce our parent rolls. The pulping process at the paper mill is currently configured to primarily process a particular class of recycled fiber known as SBS paper. Pursuant to an exclusive supply agreement, Dixie Pulp and Paper, Inc. supplies all of our recycled fiber needs under an evergreen contract. Under the terms of the contract, unless either party gives notice at least ninety days prior to the anniversary date of the agreement, the term automatically extends for successive one-year periods under the original five-year term. This agreement is intended to ensure our long-term supply of quality recycled fiber on terms that we believe are reasonable. If we were unable to purchase a sufficient quantity of SBS paper, we could reconfigure our pulping plant to process other forms of fiber, or we could use an alternative type of fiber with our existing pulping process. Reconfiguring our pulping plant would require additional capital expenditures, which could be substantial. Purchasing alternative types of fiber could result in higher fiber costs. We use virgin kraft fibers in the production of premium and ultra- premium tier products. As our business in the ultra-premium market segment grows, we expect our consumption of virgin kraft fiber will increase.
 
Energy is a key cost factor in our business operations. Electricity for all facilities is being provided by local public utilities. We use natural gas to fire boilers to supply our own steam to our mills. We utilize third-party energy suppliers to purchase all of our natural gas requirements through a combination of fixed price contracts and at-market purchases. At our Pryor facility, we have a variable-rate natural gas contract with three fixed-rate tiers that reduce the volume that we receive under the variable-rate portion of the agreement. At our Barnwell facility we have a fixed-rate natural gas contract with three tiers. These commitments are summarized below:

Backlog
 
Our tissue products generally require short production times. Customers provide orders committing to purchases typically a few weeks in advance of the requested shipment date. Typically, we have a backlog of approximately two weeks of sales. As of December 31, 2017, our backlog of customer orders was approximately 790,000 cases, or approximately $10.6 million, of finished converted products and approximately 500 tons of parent rolls, or approximately $0.5 million. As of December 31, 2016, our backlog of customer orders was approximately 615,000 cases, or approximately $8.0 million, of finished converted products and 100 tons of parent rolls, or approximately $0.1 million.
Trademarks and Trade Names
 
We sell some of our tissue products under our various brand names, including Orchids Supreme®, Clean Scents®, Tackle®, Colortex®, My Size®, Velvet®, and Big Mopper®. We also sell tissue products under brand names licensed from Fabrica, such as, Virtue®, Truly Green®, Golden Gate Paper® and Big Quality®. Our brand names are trademarked with the United States Patent and Trademark Office. We intend to renew our registered trademarks prior to expiration. We do not believe these trademarks are presently significant corporate assets.
Employee and Labor Relations
 
As of December 31, 2017, we had 472 full-time employees of whom 268 were union hourly employees, 103 were non-union hourly and 101 were non-union salaried employees. Of our employees, 438 were engaged in manufacturing and production and 34 were engaged in sales, clerical and administration. This includes 119 employees in Barnwell, all non-union. Fabrica supplies all labor, material, etc. in Mexicali for production under the Supply Agreement, so we have no employees in Mexico. Our hourly employees in Oklahoma are represented under collective bargaining agreements with the United Steel, Paper and Forestry, Rubber, Manufacturing, Energy, Allied Industrial & Service Workers International Union Local 5-930 and Local 5-1480 at the mill and converting facility, respectively.
 
In 2015, we negotiated a new three-year contract with our hourly employees at the Pryor mill, which expired in February 2018. We are currently in negotiations and expect to have a new agreement in place by the end of the second quarter of 2018.
 
In 2012, we negotiated a new four-year contract with our hourly employees in the Pryor converting plant, which expired on June 25, 2016. Since that time, we have been operating under the terms of an interim agreement while working to finalize a new contract, however to date negotiations have not produced a new agreement. The union has pursued several charges directly through the National Labor Relations Board (“NLRB”) as opposed to the grievance and arbitration process required by the collective bargaining agreements. These charges were consolidated by the NLRB with other charges made by the union and a hearing was held in June of 2017. To the extent of any adverse rulings following this initial administrative hearing, we are pursuing appeals in the appropriate course. Hearing on a second set of consolidated charges is set for hearing on April 3rd, 2018. The parties are in the process of negotiating settlement of these claims in connection with ongoing collective bargaining agreement negotiations, for which a federal mediator has also been appointed to assist. Operations at our Pryor facilities have not been disrupted due to these negotiations.
 
We have not experienced a work stoppage in the last ten years, and, other than as described above, no material grievance proceedings, material arbitrations, labor disputes, strikes or labor disturbances are currently pending or threatened against us. We believe we have good relations with our union employees at our facilities in Pryor.
 
Environmental, Health and Safety Matters
 
Our operations are subject to various environmental, health and safety laws and regulations promulgated by federal, state and local governments. These laws and regulations impose stringent standards on us regarding, among other things, air emissions, water discharges, use and handling of hazardous materials, use, handling and disposal of waste, and remediation of environmental contamination. Since our products are made primarily from SBS paper, we have not made extensive use of chemicals.
 
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (the "EPA") requires that certain pulp and paper mills meet stringent air emissions and waste water discharge standards for toxic and hazardous pollutants. These standards are commonly known as the "Cluster Rules." Our operations are not subject to the current Cluster Rules. If, however, due to a revision in the rules or a change in our operations we were to become subject to the Cluster Rules, we might need to incur significant capital expenditures in order to become compliant.

We believe our manufacturing facilities are in compliance in all material respects with all existing federal, state and local environmental regulations, but we cannot predict whether more stringent air, water and solid waste disposal requirements will be imposed by government authorities in the future. Pursuant to applicable federal, state and local statutes and regulations, we believe that we possess, either directly or through the Oklahoma Ordinance Works Authority ("OOWA") and the City of Barnwell, all of the environmental permits and approvals necessary for the operation of our Oklahoma and South Carolina facilities.
 
OOWA, the operator of the industrial park in which we operate in Oklahoma, holds the waste water permit that covers our Oklahoma facilities and controls, among other things, the level of biological oxygen demand ("BOD") and total suspended solids ("TSS") we are allowed to send to the OOWA following pre-treatment at our facility. The OOWA reduced our BOD and TSS limits effective with a permit issued August 1, 2007. We have invested capital in recent years to improve the capability and increase capacity in our Oklahoma waste water treatment facility and believe our facility is well suited to meet our current permit limits.
 
The City of Barnwell (the “City”) holds the waste water permit that covers our South Carolina facilities and controls, among other things, the level of TSS we are allowed to send to the City following pre-treatment at our facility. We believe our South Carolina facility is engineered to well suit our permit limits once our paper machine begins operating in 2017.
 
Our assets in Mexicali are operated by Fabrica under the Equipment Lease Agreement entered into as part of the Fabrica Transaction. In accordance with the terms of this agreement, Fabrica has indemnified us from and against any and all claims, actions, suits, losses, damage, demands and liabilities of every nature in any way arising directly or indirectly from the use, possession, maintenance, operations or control of the equipment located in Mexico, including environmental matters.
