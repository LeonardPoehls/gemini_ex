ITEM 1. BUSINESS
   We were incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on February 3, 1999. We were organized primarily for the purpose of establishing a website information system specializing in the medical industry. This concept was terminated by management during the latter part of the year 2000 and all rights to the Company's previous website (www.txsave.com ) were transferred to the Company's former President, Irving Abrams.
  In January 2001, we acquired from James J. Reidy an exclusive license to patents relating to technology that produces pure drinking water directly from the air. At this time, we entered into a consulting agreement with Mr. Reidy who was going to assist the Company in arranging for the manufacture and sale of WaterStar machines that were based on the acquired technology. .In March 2002, we decided to abandon this business.
 
 On April 5, 2002, we entered into a Stock Exchange and Merger Agreement with Gold Entertainment Group, Inc. (the "Company"). In connection with this merger, our previous management team resigned and a new management team, consisting of Hamon Francis Fytton and Dan Boyer joined our company. 

 New management intends to engage in the business of providing pre-paid Internet access cards to be marketed through retail locations. It further intends to establish a network of distributors to market a variety of the Company's pre-paid Internet access cards through their existing channels. To accomplish this, the Company intends to build on existing relationships with potential distributors and to focus on strategic partnerships for distribution, marketing and billing systems. The Company took initial steps to develop this business during the fiscal year ended January 31, 2003. 

 Employees
  As of January 31, 2004, we did not have any employees. Hamon Frances Fytton, the Chief Executive Officer of Gold Entertainment, has been providing and overseeing all business activities of the company.
