General
Overview
We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing innovative medicines to broadly address multiple forms of dementia and related neurological disorders. We are developing a pipeline of late- and early-stage product candidates that focuses on the cognitive, functional and behavioral aspects of debilitating conditions such as Alzheimer's disease and Lewy body dementia and other neurological disorders. Our vision is to become the leading biopharmaceutical company focused on neurology, with an initial emphasis on the treatment of dementia by addressing multiple forms and aspects of this condition. Our near-term focus is to develop our lead product candidate, intepirdine, a selective 5-HT6 receptor antagonist, for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease and dementia with Lewy bodies, or DLB, and to develop our second product candidate, nelotanserin, a highly selective 5-HT2A receptor inverse agonist, for the treatment of visual hallucinations in patients with Lewy body dementia, or LBD, movement disorder symptoms in patients with DLB and REM behavior disorder, or RBD, in patients with LBD. In addition, we are developing two other product candidates- RVT-103, a combination of donepezil and a peripheral muscarinic receptor antagonist, and RVT-104, a combination of rivastigmine and a peripheral muscarinic receptor antagonist as potential treatments for patients with Alzheimer's disease or DLB. We intend to evaluate the safety and efficacy of RVT-103 and RVT-104 both alone and in combination with intepirdine.

Intepirdine
Overview
Our lead product candidate, intepirdine, is currently being developed for the treatment of mild-to-moderate Alzheimer’s disease and DLB. We acquired the worldwide rights to intepirdine from Glaxo Group Limited and GlaxoSmithKline Intellectual Property Development Limited, collectively GSK, under an asset purchase agreement entered into in December 2014, or the GSK Agreement.
Mechanism of Action
Intepirdine is an orally administered potent antagonist of the 5-HT6 receptor. By antagonizing the 5-HT6 receptor, intepirdine promotes the release of key neurotransmitters, including acetylcholine. These neurotransmitters are believed to be critical for alertness, memory, thought and judgment, which are the key components of cognition and function that are impaired in patients with dementia.
We believe that intepirdine's action as a 5-HT6 receptor antagonist supports its use in combination with cholinesterase inhibitors. While cholinesterase inhibitors help prevent the breakdown of acetylcholine, 5-HT6 receptor antagonists promote the release of multiple neurotransmitters, including acetylcholine. Therefore, when used in combination with one another, we believe that 5-HT6 receptor antagonists and cholinesterase inhibitors may increase the concentration of acetylcholine through distinct and complementary mechanisms. 5-HT6 receptors are primarily localized to the central nervous system, or CNS, particularly in regions of the brain that modulate cognition, and may impact cognition and neuronal function in multiple ways. Because 5-HT6 receptor antagonists work primarily within the CNS, we believe they may not significantly increase levels of acetylcholine outside of the CNS, and therefore may not exacerbate the peripheral side effects that are commonly associated with cholinesterase inhibitors. Intepirdine also exhibits activity as an antagonist of the 5-HT2A receptor which may further contribute to the mechanism of action of intepirdine in Alzheimer's disease and DLB.
Intepirdine for the Treatment of Alzheimer’s Disease 
Medical Need
Alzheimer’s disease, the most common form of dementia, is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that results in significant impairments in cognition, function and behavior. According to the Alzheimer’s Association, Alzheimer’s disease affects approximately 5.5 million people in the United States. It is estimated that between 70% and 90% of Alzheimer’s disease patients age 65 and older are classified as having mild-to-moderate Alzheimer’s disease. No new chemical entity has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, for the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease since 2003.
Clinical Development
We are currently developing intepirdine for use in combination with cholinesterase inhibitors, the current standard of care for Alzheimer's disease. Cholinesterase inhibitors are the only class of drugs approved by the FDA for the treatment of patients with mild Alzheimer's disease. Donepezil, a generic drug also marketed under the trade name Aricept by Eisai Co., Ltd. and Pfizer, Inc., is the most commonly used cholinesterase inhibitor and is the background medication for all patients in our ongoing Phase 3 program in Alzheimer's disease for intepirdine. Based on preclinical and clinical data collected to date, we believe and continue to investigate how intepirdine, when used in combination with donepezil, may work additively or synergistically to increase the concentration of acetylcholine, potentially leading to improved cognition and function in patients with Alzheimer's disease.

We believe intepirdine, if approved, has the potential to be both a first-in-class and a best-in-class 5-HT6 receptor antagonist for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease based on its safety, tolerability and efficacy results for up to 48 weeks, as observed in a 684-subject, randomized, placebo-controlled Phase 2b trial conducted by GSK. We believe this is significant, in part, because currently marketed Alzheimer's disease drugs were approved on efficacy data of 28 weeks or less. Furthermore, we believe intepirdine has a number of potentially favorable characteristics as a product candidate for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease, including once daily dosing, a low potential for drug interactions, and an ability to be administered with or without food.
Prior to our acquisition of intepirdine in December 2014, GSK conducted 13 clinical trials for intepirdine involving over 1,250 individuals treated with intepirdine, which included healthy subjects as well as subjects with mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's disease. Since our acquisition of intepirdine, we have completed eight additional clinical studies and increased the number of individuals treated with the product candidate to more than 1,400. In GSK's Phase 2b clinical trial of 684 subjects with mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's disease, subjects who received 35 mg intepirdine in combination with donepezil achieved a 1.50 point benefit (p-value = 0.013) versus the donepezil-only group at 24 weeks following treatment initiation as measured by the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-cognitive, or ADAS-cog, subscale (pre-specified co-primary endpoint). Statistically significant improvements in cognition were also observed at 12 and 48 weeks following initiation of treatment, compared to subjects who received donepezil alone. In addition, subjects who received 35 mg intepirdine in combination with donepezil achieved a 2.00 point (p-value = 0.024) benefit versus the donepezil-only group at 24 weeks following initiation of treatment as measured by the Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study Activities of Daily Living, or ADCS-ADL scale, a commonly used scale evaluating a subject's ability to perform a list of daily activities. A patient's ADCS-ADL score is evaluated based on information obtained from that patient's caregiver. Statistically significant improvements of activities of daily living were also observed at 12 and 36 weeks following the initiation of treatment, compared to subjects who received donepezil alone. GSK’s other pre-specified co-primary endpoint in the 684-patient Phase 2b clinical trial was Clinical Dementia Rating Sum of Boxes, or CDR-SB, a composite scale with certain components that evaluate cognition and other components that assess function, at 24 weeks following treatment. While the 35 mg intepirdine dose group achieved statistically significant improvement in the CDR-SB at 12 weeks and was numerically superior at 24 weeks and further time points, the benefits at 24 weeks and beyond were not statistically significant compared to the donepezil-only group. We have chosen the ADAS-cog and ADCS-ADL as the co-primary endpoints for our ongoing Phase 3 trial in patients with mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's disease, the MINDSET study, which is being conducted pursuant to our Special Protocol Assessment, or SPA, agreement with the FDA.
Intepirdine was observed to be well-tolerated by subjects in all 21 clinical trials completed to date. In the 684-subject Phase 2b adjunctive therapy study, the proportion of subjects who experienced drug-related adverse events was lower in the group that received 35 mg intepirdine with donepezil than in the group that received placebo with donepezil, at 24 weeks (6% versus 9%) and 48 weeks (7% versus 13%). There were no drug-related serious adverse events in the intepirdine groups at 24 or 48 weeks. One patient in the placebo group experienced aphasia at 24 weeks, which was determined to be a drug-related serious adverse event. Falls were reported by fewer patients in both the 35 mg intepirdine group (2%) and the 15 mg intepirdine group (2%) compared to the placebo group (6%). There were no notable differences between the intepirdine and placebo groups in vital sign changes, electrocardiogram changes or significant changes in laboratory parameters, and there was no evidence of significant liver toxicity.
Intepirdine MINDSET Phase 3 Study
In October 2015, we commenced a global, multi-center, double-blind, placebo-controlled confirmatory Phase 3 clinical study of intepirdine, which we refer to as the MINDSET study, for the treatment of patients with mild-to-moderate Alzheimer’s disease. Patient recruitment for the MINDSET study was completed in January 2017, with a total of 1,315 patients ultimately randomized. The MINDSET study is evaluating the safety, tolerability and efficacy of intepirdine over a 24-week period and compares 35 mg, once-daily oral doses of intepirdine to placebo in patients with mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's disease on a background of stable donepezil therapy. The primary endpoints of the study are changes in scores on the ADAS-cog, and the ADCS-ADL scales, which have been used as endpoints supporting regulatory approval of currently-marketed Alzheimer's disease treatments in the United States and Europe. We have received an SPA from the FDA which states that the design and planned analysis of the MINDSET study adequately address the objectives necessary to support an application for marketing approval. The MINDSET study seeks to confirm the results of the prior 684-subject Phase 2b adjunctive therapy study conducted by GSK. We expect to report topline results of the MINDSET study in late September 2017. 
Intepirdine MINDSET Open-Label Extension Study
Subjects completing the MINDSET Phase 3 study are eligible to enter a 12-month open-label extension, or OLE, safety study. In the OLE study, other medications for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease, including memantine and other cholinesterase inhibitors, may be administered in combination with intepirdine. To date, we have observed approximately 95% rollover of eligible, completing patients from the MINDSET study into the OLE study.

Intepirdine for the Treatment of Dementia with Lewy Bodies
Medical Need
In addition to evaluating intepirdine in patients with mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's disease, we are also developing intepirdine to address other forms of dementia, such as DLB. DLB, a subset of LBD, is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder pathologically characterized by the aggregation of alpha-synuclein and other proteins in the brain, known as Lewy bodies, causing disruption in cognition, function and behavior. DLB is the second most prevalent cause of neurodegenerative dementia in elderly patients. We estimate that DLB affects approximately 1.1 million people in the United States. In addition to suffering from deficits and fluctuations in cognition, DLB patients often suffer from visual hallucinations; parkinsonism, a constellation of motor symptoms often found in patients with Parkinson’s disease and related movement disorders, including tremor, bradykinesia, and stiffness; sensitivity to neuroleptic (antipsychotic) medications; and RBD, a condition in which patients physically act out their dreams.
DLB patients are often treated off-label with cholinesterase inhibitors. Cholinergic neurotransmission is thought to be even more dysfunctional in DLB than in Alzheimer’s disease. This suggests that neurotransmitter-targeted therapies that work by increasing the inter-synaptic concentration of acetylcholine, much like intepirdine in Alzheimer’s disease, may also be effective in improving cognition and function in DLB patients. While cholinesterase inhibitors are not approved by the FDA or the European Medicines Agency, or the EMA, for the treatment of DLB, donepezil was approved in September 2014 in Japan for this indication. We believe that the addition of a 5-HT6 receptor antagonist, such as intepirdine, may help improve cognition in DLB patients by promoting the synaptic release of acetylcholine. In addition, intepirdine has antagonist activity against the 5-HT2A receptor, which has been implicated in the pathophysiology of visual hallucinations and other behavioral disturbances affecting patients with DLB. We believe that intepirdine has the potential to be the first drug approved by the FDA and EMA for the treatment of DLB.
Clinical Development
In the first quarter of calendar year 2016, we began a Phase 2b clinical trial of intepirdine, called the HEADWAY-DLB study, in patients with DLB on a background of stable standard of care therapy. In addition to the 35-mg dose of intepirdine that is being studied in the MINDSET study, we are evaluating a 70-mg dose of intepirdine in this trial, a higher dose which we believe could have greater activity against the 5-HT2A receptor to potentially address visual hallucinations and behavioral disturbances in this patient population. This decision was supported by a safety and food-effect study testing the 70-mg dose that we completed in 2015. In September 2016, we received Fast Track designation from the FDA for intepirdine for the treatment of DLB. We completed recruitment for the Phase 2b HEADWAY-DLB study in April 2017 and expect to report results from the HEADWAY-DLB trial in the fourth quarter of calendar year 2017. If the results of the HEADWAY-DLB study are favorable, we believe that it, in combination with data from our studies in Alzheimer’s disease, could serve as the basis for seeking approval of intepirdine for DLB.
Intepirdine for Gait and Balance in Alzheimer's Disease, Dementia with Lewy Bodies and Parkinson's Disease Dementia
Medical Need
In addition to evaluating intepirdine in patients with mild-to-moderate Alzheimer’s disease and DLB, we are also evaluating the effects of intepirdine on gait and balance in patients with Alzheimer's disease, DLB and Parkinson's disease dementia. In addition to cognitive deficits, these patients often present with a history of defined gait impairment.
Falls are a significant issue in the elderly, and 35% and 40% of community-dwelling generally healthy adults over age 65 fall each year. Falls can also impose a significant economic burden on the healthcare system in addition to the serious morbidity and mortality with which they are associated. It is estimated that the annual direct medical costs for fall injuries are approximately $31 billion. Patients with dementia are more prone to falls due to impaired cognition and gait.
Clinical Development
In September 2016, we initiated a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled Phase 2 crossover study of intepirdine to evaluate its effects on gait and balance in patients with Alzheimer's disease, DLB and Parkinson's disease dementia. We intend to enroll approximately 40 patients in this Phase 2 study and will seek to further explore the reduced rate of falls observed with intepirdine treatment in the prior 684-patient Phase 2b study in mild-to-moderate Alzheimer’s disease in patients on background of stable donepezil therapy. We expect to report results from the Phase 2 gait and balance study in calendar year 2017.

Nelotanserin
Overview
In October 2015, we acquired from our parent company, Roivant Sciences Ltd., or RSL, the global rights to nelotanserin, a highly selective inverse agonist of the 5-HT2A receptor. Initially, we are investigating and developing nelotanserin to address visual hallucinations in patients with LBD and RBD in patients with LBD. Nelotanserin has been evaluated in eight clinical studies to date with over 800 human subjects exposed to the drug candidate and has been observed to be well tolerated.
Mechanism of Action
Nelotanserin reduces the activity of the 5-HT2A receptor. The 5-HT2A receptor has been linked to neuropsychiatric disturbances including visual hallucinations and sleep disturbances and the antagonism of 5-HT2a receptors has been shown to improve parkinsonism. In in vitro studies, nelotanserin did not antagonize the dopamine D2 receptor. Antagonism of the D2 receptor in LBD patients can lead to severe side effects including increased parkinsonism, worsening of cognition, heavy sedation, and symptoms resembling neuroleptic malignant syndrome which can be fatal.
Nelotanserin for Visual Hallucinations in Lewy Body Dementia 
Medical Need
LBD includes two similar conditions, DLB and Parkinson’s disease dementia. There is significant overlap in the pathology and clinical presentation of both conditions; however, the primary difference generally depends on the timing of the onset of cognitive decline relative to the onset of movement-related symptoms. In DLB, the cognitive decline typically occurs before or within one year of the onset of movement disorder symptoms. In Parkinson's disease dementia, movement disorder symptoms typically precede cognitive decline by more than one year. The Lewy Body Dementia Association estimates that there are 1.4 million patients with LBD in the United States.
LBD patients suffer from frequent visual hallucinations, which are often treated with off-label atypical antipsychotic medications such as quetiapine. Use of atypical antipsychotic medications, which have activity against the dopamine D2 receptor, can lead to increased or possibly irreversible parkinsonism in LBD patients and a life threatening side-effect resembling neuroleptic malignant syndrome. We believe that there is a need for new therapeutic options that can reduce visual hallucinations in LBD patients without risk of these severe side effects.
Clinical Development
In January 2016, we initiated a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, cross-over Phase 2 clinical study of nelotanserin in approximately 20 patients with either DLB or Parkinson's disease dementia who had experienced frequent visual hallucinations. In February 2017, we reported preliminary results from a planned interim analysis of the first 11 patients to complete this pilot study. Among these patients, we observed a statistically significant 8.73 point difference in change from baseline at week 4 of a pre-specified primary endpoint of Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) Parts II+III (p-value = 0.012) during periods in which patients received nelotanserin, as compared to periods during which those same patients received placebo. On the UPDRS Part II, which measures activities of daily living, there was a 1.11 point difference from placebo (p-value = 0.434). On the UPDRS Part III, which measures motor function, there was a 7.92 point difference from placebo (p-value = 0.005). Safety analysis included measurement of the incidence of adverse events. In the interim analysis, secondary endpoints evaluating visual hallucinations did not demonstrate statistically significant differences for nelotanserin relative to placebo. Based on these preliminary results, we plan to expand patient recruitment beyond the 20 patients already randomized, in order to confirm the treatment benefits observed in the interim results from this ongoing study. We expect to report results from the expanded study in the second half of 2017.
Nelotanserin for Parkinsonism in Dementia with Lewy Bodies
Medical Need
Parkinsonism is a core feature of LBD, which includes patients diagnosed with both Parkinson’s disease dementia and DLB. Treatment with dopaminergic agents (such as L-DOPA and/or dopamine agonists) is common for patients with Parkinson’s disease, but dopaminergic therapy can exacerbate neuropsychiatric symptoms in patients diagnosed with DLB. We believe that there is a need for new therapeutic options for DLB patients that can reduce the burden of motor symptoms without increasing the risk of neuropsychiatric side-effects.
Clinical Development
If we are able to confirm the UPDRS improvements observed in DLB patients in the interim results of our ongoing Phase 2 clinical study of nelotanserin, we intend to discuss with the FDA the use of UPDRS as a potential registrational endpoint for the treatment of parkinsonism in patients with DLB. Depending on the FDA feedback, we would potentially pursue a Phase 3 program with nelotanserin in this indication.

Nelotanserin for REM Behavior Disorder in Lewy Body Dementia 
Medical Need
RBD is a common clinical feature of LBD, and is a condition in which patients can physically act out their dreams, impacting their quality of life and endangering themselves and their bed partners. While off-label treatment of RBD with benzodiazepines is common, this class of drugs is associated with concerning side effects in patients with dementia, including sedation, worsening of cognition and increased risk of falls. We believe that there is a need for new therapeutic options that can reduce the frequency of RBD without sedating patients or worsening cognition in patients with dementia.
Clinical Development
In March 2016, we initiated a four-week double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled Phase 2 study in patients with DLB and Parkinson's disease dementia suffering from RBD. This study will utilize objective measures of efficacy as assessed in a sleep-lab setting. We expect to receive results from this study in the second half of calendar year 2017.
Nelotanserin Lewy Body Dementia Open-Label Extension Safety Study
Subjects completing either of the nelotanserin Phase 2 studies in LBD described above are eligible to enter a six-month OLE safety study. To date, three subjects in the OLE study exhibited elevated liver function test levels that led to discontinuation of the study drug. Two subjects normalized their liver function test levels after they were taken off the study drug, and an independent Data Monitoring Committee (“DMC”) after reviewing their data recommended continuing both of the nelotanserin Phase 2 studies and the OLE safety study with additional monitoring. Follow-up liver function test assessments and DMC review are planned for the third subject.
RVT-103 and RVT-104
Overview
In August 2016, we and Qaam Pharmaceuticals LLC, or Qaam, entered into an exclusive license agreement under which we in-licensed the rights to develop and commercialize RVT-103 and RVT-104, which are product candidates that combine cholinesterase inhibitors with peripherally acting quaternary amine muscarinic receptor antagonists such as glycopyrrolate or trospium. These combinations could provide a means to mitigate the known peripheral side effects of cholinesterase inhibitors and may also allow higher than currently approved doses of cholinesterase inhibitors such as rivastigmine, which may improve treatment of symptoms of neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease and LBD.
Mechanism of Action of RVT-103 and RVT-104
Cholinesterase inhibitors are dose-limited by their gastrointestinal tolerability profile, which limits patient adoption and compliance. Muscarinic receptor antagonists in combination with cholinesterase inhibitors may reduce the gastrointestinal side effects of cholinesterase inhibitors and may also potentially allow higher than currently approved doses of cholinesterase inhibitors to be used.
RVT-103 is a combination of donepezil with a peripherally acting quaternary amine muscarinic receptor antagonist. Quaternary amine muscarinic receptor antagonists are believed to have minimal-to-no CNS penetration, which is important as it may help limit peripheral cholinergic side effects, while having only a minimal impact on the cholinergic system in the brain, potentially avoiding unwanted falls and confusion.
RVT-104 is the combination of high-dose rivastigmine and a peripherally acting quaternary amine muscarinic receptor antagonist. Rivastigmine has shown greater efficacy at higher-than approved doses that were not well tolerated. Unlike donepezil, which only inhibits the acetylcholinesterase enzyme, rivastigmine also inhibits the butylcholinesterase enzyme, which is also involved in the breakdown of acetylcholine. Thus, there is reason to believe that higher doses of rivastigmine could potentially lead to better efficacy because, in addition to blocking acetylcholinesterase, the activity of butylcholinesterase is also addressed.
RVT-103 and RVT-104 in Alzheimer's Disease and Dementia with Lewy Bodies
Medical Need
Cholinesterase inhibitors are the standard of care in both Alzheimer’s disease and DLB. Despite their widespread use, many patients cannot tolerate the cholinesterase inhibitors because of their cholinergic side effects such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhea. We believe that drugs that can mitigate these cholinergic side effects will allow more patients to receive optimal cholinesterase inhibitor therapy.

Clinical Development
We are initially developing RVT-103, a combination of a peripheral muscarinic receptor antagonist and donepezil, as a potential treatment for patients with Alzheimer's disease, with the ultimate goal of creating a triple combination of intepirdine, a peripheral muscarinic receptor antagonist and donepezil. We conducted a proof-of-concept clinical study designed to characterize the pharmacokinetic profile, safety and tolerability of 5 mg donepezil plus placebo versus 10 mg of donepezil when given concomitantly with one of three different regimens including either glycopyrrolate or trospium. The study measured patient nausea in 48 healthy, elderly subjects using a Visual Analog Scale (VAS) at baseline and once every two hours for eight hours after dosing on Days 1, 3, 7 and 10. On Day 10, the last day of dosing, subjects in the arms receiving 10 mg of donepezil plus either glycopyrrolate or trospium had achieved a 67% to 95% percent reduction in nausea relative to the 5 mg donepezil plus placebo arm, as measured by the peak mean change from baseline on the VAS. Based on these results, we plan to meet with the FDA to discuss additional studies that could support registration of RVT-103. We also plan to initiate a pilot study in the second half of calendar year 2017 for RVT-104, a proposed combination of a higher than currently approved dose of rivastigmine and a peripheral muscarinic receptor antagonist as a potential treatment for patients with Alzheimer's disease and DLB.

Services Agreements with Roivant Sciences, Inc. and Roivant Sciences GmbH
In October 2014, we and our wholly-owned subsidiary, Axovant Sciences, Inc., or ASI, entered into a services agreement with Roivant Sciences, Inc., or RSI, a wholly-owned subsidiary of RSL, pursuant to which RSI provides us with services in relation to the identification of potential product candidates and project management of clinical trials, as well as other services related to our development, administrative and financial functions. In February 2017, in connection with the contribution and assignment of all of our intellectual property rights to Axovant Sciences GmbH, or ASG, we amended and restated this services agreement effective as of December 13, 2016, as a result of which ASG was added as a recipient of services from RSI. In addition, ASG also entered into a separate services agreement with Roivant Sciences GmbH, or RSG, a wholly-owned subsidiary of RSL, effective as of December 13, 2016, for the provision of services by RSG to ASG in relation to the identification of potential product candidates and project management of clinical trials, as well as other services related to development, administrative and financial activities. Under the terms of both services agreements, we are obligated to pay or reimburse RSI and RSG for the costs they, or third parties acting on their behalf, incur in providing services to us or ASG, including administrative and support services as well as research and development services. In addition, we are obligated to pay to RSI and RSG at a pre-determined mark-up on the costs incurred directly by RSI and RSG in connection with any general and administrative and research and development services provided directly by RSI and RSG. 
Our Strategy 
Our goal is to become the leading biopharmaceutical company focused on neurology, with an initial emphasis on the treatment of dementia by addressing multiple forms and aspects of this condition.
The key elements of our strategy to achieve this goal include: 

• | Rapidly advancing intepirdine for the treatment of mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's disease. In October 2015, we commenced a global, multi-center, double-blind, placebo-controlled confirmatory Phase 3 clinical study of intepirdine, in patients on a background of stable donepezil therapy, called MINDSET, for the treatment of mild-to-moderate Alzheimer’s disease. We expect to report results from the MINDSET study in late September 2017. If the results of the MINDSET study are positive, our plan is to submit a new drug application, or NDA, with the FDA for the regulatory approval and commercialization of intepirdine in the United States, followed by a marketing authorization application, or MAA, with the EMA.


• | Developing intepirdine for the treatment of DLB. In the first quarter of calendar year 2016, we began a Phase 2b clinical trial of intepirdine, called the HEADWAY-DLB study, in patients with DLB on a background of stable standard of care therapy. In addition to the 35 mg dose of intepirdine that is being studied in the MINDSET study, we are evaluating a 70 mg dose of intepirdine in this trial, which we believe could have greater activity against the 5-HT2A receptor, which may help address visual hallucinations and behavioral disturbances in this patient population. We expect to report results from the HEADWAY-DLB study in the fourth quarter of calendar year 2017. If the results of this study are favorable, we believe that those results, in combination with positive MINDSET study results, could serve as the basis to seek regulatory approval of intepirdine for the treatment of DLB.


• | Developing nelotanserin for the treatment of Lewy Body Dementia. In January 2016, we initiated a Phase 2 clinical study of nelotanserin in patients with either DLB or Parkinson’s disease dementia who experience frequent visual hallucinations. In March 2016, we initiated a second Phase 2 study of nelotanserin in patients with either DLB or Parkinson’s disease dementia suffering from RBD. We are also exploring the potential use of nelotanserin to improve parkinsonism in DLB patients.


• | Acquiring or in-licensing late-stage product candidates for the treatment of neurological disorders in a capital-efficient manner. We intend to identify, acquire, develop and commercialize novel product candidates for the treatment of neurological disorders, including dementia. Our targeted approach to acquisition and licensing transactions reflects our goal to be the leading biopharmaceutical company focused on neurology, with an initial emphasis on the treatment of dementia by addressing multiple forms and aspects of this condition. In evaluating product acquisition candidates, we focus on candidates that are in late-stage development that offer improved solutions to patients and leverage our business infrastructure. In addition, our acquisition strategy has been to acquire global rights for these compounds wherever possible.


• | Maximizing the commercial potential of our product candidates. We plan to directly commercialize our product candidates in the United States and the European Union. In other markets for which commercialization may be less capital efficient for us, we may selectively pursue strategic collaborations with third parties in order to maximize the commercial potential of our product candidates.

Sales and Marketing 
We are in the process of building our own marketing, sales and distribution capabilities. In order to commercialize our product candidates, if approved for commercial sale, we must either develop a sales and marketing infrastructure or collaborate with third parties that have sales and marketing experience. We plan to directly commercialize our product candidates in the United States and Europe. In other markets for which commercialization may be less capital efficient for us, we may selectively pursue strategic collaborations with third parties in order to maximize the commercial potential of our product candidates. 
Manufacturing 
We are building teams with drug formulation and manufacturing expertise but do not own or operate, facilities for product manufacturing, storage and distribution, or testing. While intepirdine was being developed by GSK, it was also being manufactured by GSK. We expect that the drug substance transferred from GSK under the GSK Agreement will be sufficient for us to complete our ongoing Phase 3 pivotal program, and we have contracted with third parties to fill, finish, supply, store and distribute the drug product for this program. We also will rely on third-party manufacturers to supply us with sufficient quantities of intepirdine to be used, if approved, for the commercialization of intepirdine. If we are unable to initiate or continue our relationship with one or more of these third-party contractors, we could experience delays in our development efforts as we locate and qualify new manufacturers. 
Under the Arena Development Agreement, we are obligated to obtain all clinical and commercial supplies of nelotanserin exclusively from Arena, and we are completely dependent upon Arena to manufacture or otherwise procure sufficient quantities of nelotanserin for our planned clinical trials and, if nelotanserin is approved, for commercial sale. We do not have any right, even if Arena fails to satisfy its supply obligations, to manufacture nelotanserin ourselves or to engage a contract manufacturer to make it for us.
Manufacturing of any product candidate is subject to extensive regulations that impose various procedural and documentation requirements, which govern recordkeeping, manufacturing processes and controls, personnel, quality control and quality assurance, among others. We expect that all of our contract manufacturing organizations, or CMOs, will manufacture intepirdine and Arena will manufacture or procure nelotanserin and other products under current Good Manufacturing Practice, or cGMP, conditions. cGMP is a regulatory requirement for the production of pharmaceuticals to be used in humans. 
Competition 
We consider our most direct competitors with respect to intepirdine to be other companies developing 5-HT6 receptor antagonists, including Acorda Therapeutics, Avineuro and Suven Life Sciences. The 5-HT6 receptor antagonists being developed by these companies are all in Phase 2 clinical trials or earlier stages of development for cognitive disorders.
We consider our most direct competitor with respect to nelotanserin to be Acadia Pharmaceuticals, which is developing pimavanserin, a 5-HT2A receptor inverse agonist that received FDA approval in April 2016 for the treatment of hallucinations and delusions associated with Parkinson's disease psychosis. We believe the FDA approval of pimavanserin adds further validation to the therapeutic relevance of 5-HT2A as a potential target for the treatment of visual hallucinations.
In addition to other 5-HT6 receptor antagonists and 5-HT2A receptor inverse agonists in active development, we are aware of many biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies as well as academic institutions, government agencies and private and public research institutions that are developing, and may in the future develop and commercialize, products for Alzheimer's disease, Lewy body dementia and other cognitive disorders.
Drug development is highly competitive and subject to rapid and significant technological advancements. Our ability to compete will significantly depend upon our ability to complete necessary clinical trials and regulatory approval processes, and effectively market any drug that we may successfully develop. Our current and potential future competitors include pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions and government agencies. The primary competitive factors that will affect the commercial success of any product candidate for which we may receive marketing approval include efficacy, safety and tolerability profile, dosing convenience, price, coverage and reimbursement. Many of our existing or potential competitors have substantially greater financial, technical and human resources than we do and significantly greater experience in the discovery and development of product candidates, as well as in obtaining regulatory approvals of those product candidates in the United States and in foreign countries. Our current and potential future competitors also have significantly more experience commercializing drugs that have been approved for marketing. Mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries could result in even more resources being concentrated among a small number of our competitors. 
13

Accordingly, our competitors may be more successful than us in obtaining regulatory approval for therapies and in achieving widespread market acceptance of their drugs. It is also possible that the development of a cure or more effective treatment method for Alzheimer's disease or dementia with Lewy bodies or treatments for other related disorders by a competitor could render our product candidates non-competitive or obsolete or reduce the demand for our product candidates before we can recover our development and commercialization expenses. 
Intellectual Property 
Our commercial success depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain proprietary protection for intepirdine, nelotanserin, any of our future product candidates, novel discoveries, product development technologies and other know-how. Our commercial success also depends on our ability to operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of others and our ability to prevent others from infringing our proprietary rights. Our policy is to seek to protect our proprietary position by, among other methods, filing U.S. and foreign patents and patent applications related to our proprietary technology, inventions and improvements that are important to the development and implementation of our business. We also rely on trademarks, trade secrets, copyrights, know-how, continuing technological innovation and potential in-licensing and acquisition opportunities to develop and maintain our proprietary position.
While we seek broad coverage under our existing patent applications, there is always a risk that an alteration to the process of obtaining patents or changes to the patent law in the U.S. or elsewhere may provide sufficient basis for a competitor to challenge or avoid infringement of our patents. In addition, patents, if granted, expire and we cannot provide any assurance that any patents will be issued from our pending or any future applications or that any potentially issued patents will adequately protect our intellectual property.
Individual patents extend for varying periods depending on the date of filing of the patent application or the date of patent issuance and the legal term of patents in the countries in which they are obtained. Generally, patents issued for regularly filed applications in the United States are granted a term of 20 years from the earliest effective filing date. In addition, in certain instances, a patent term can be extended via a Patent Term Adjustment, or PTA, to recapture a portion of the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, or the USPTO, delay in issuing the patent as well as a portion of the term effectively lost as a result of the FDA regulatory review period via a Patent Term Extension, or PTE. However, as to the FDA component, the PTE period can be applied to only one patent, cannot be longer than five years and the total patent term including the PTE period must not exceed 14 years following FDA approval of an NDA. The duration of foreign patents varies in accordance with provisions of applicable local law, but typically is also 20 years from the earliest effective non-provisional filing date. The actual protection afforded by a patent varies on a product by product basis, from country to country and depends upon many factors, including the type of patent, the scope of its coverage, the availability of regulatory-related extensions, the availability of legal remedies in a particular country and the validity and enforceability of the patent. The patent term of a European patent is 20 years from its filing date; however, unlike in the U.S., a European patent is not granted PTA for delays at the European Patent Office. However, the European Union does have a compensation program similar to the U.S.’s PTE called Supplementary Patent Certificate, or SPC, that would effectively extend patent protection for up to five years on one patent and the total patent term including the SPC must not exceed 15 years following the EMA granting of marketing authorization. Other major markets, including Japan, have similar patent term extension provisions and we intend to seek patent term extensions in those countries that have such programs. 
As of March 31, 2017, we are the sole owner of six granted U.S. patents, and approximately one hundred patents or pending patent applications in numerous foreign jurisdictions including Japan, China, Germany, France, Italy, the United Kingdom, Spain, Canada, Russia, India, Australia and South Korea relating to intepirdine. Our patents and patent applications cover the intepirdine molecule and analogs thereof as a composition of matter, as well as its use alone or in combination with other pharmaceutical agents. These patents and applications start to expire in 2023. The U.S. composition of matter patent for intepirdine naturally expires in 2024 inclusive of PTA and we expect the term of this patent to be extended up to five years to 2029 with PTE. We also own several pending U.S., corresponding Patent Cooperation Treaty, or PCT, applications and other foreign applications.  These applications, if granted, would extend the patent life for certain uses of intepirdine alone or in combination with other pharmaceutical agents to between 2028 and 2037.
14

In October 2015, we assumed RSL’s rights and obligations under the development, marketing and supply agreement with Arena, or the Arena Development Agreement for nelotanserin. Pursuant to the Arena Development Agreement, we have the exclusive right to commercialize and distribute nelotanserin worldwide. Arena is prohibited from granting licenses to third parties to develop, commercialize, or distribute nelotanserin. We have the exclusive first rights to bring any action with respect to infringement by any third party of the patents covered under the Development Agreement. The patents include issued U.S. and foreign patents and pending patent applications that cover nelotanserin and analogues thereof as a composition of matter as well as methods of use in major markets, including the United States, Japan, China, Germany, France, Italy, the United Kingdom, Spain, Canada, Russia, India, Australia and South Korea, and have applications pending in a number of other jurisdictions. These patents and applications start to expire in 2024. The U.S. composition of matter patent for nelotanserin naturally expires in 2028 inclusive of PTA and we expect the term of this patent to be extended up to five years with PTE. We also own several pending U.S., corresponding PCT applications and foreign applications directed to uses of nelotanserin alone or in combination with other pharmaceutical agents, which, if granted, would extend the patent life of certain uses of nelotanserin to between 2036 and 2037.
Furthermore, we rely upon trade secrets and know-how and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position. We seek to protect our proprietary information, in part by using confidentiality agreements with our commercial partners, collaborators, employees and consultants and invention assignment agreements with our employees. We also have confidentiality agreements and invention assignment agreements with our commercial partners and selected consultants. These agreements are designed to protect our proprietary information and, in the case of the invention assignment agreements, to grant us ownership of technologies that are developed through a relationship with a third party. These agreements may be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors. To the extent that our commercial partners, collaborators, employees and consultants use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting know-how and inventions.
Our commercial success will also depend in part on not infringing the proprietary rights of third parties. It is uncertain whether the issuance of any third-party patent would require us to alter our development or commercial strategies, or our drugs or processes, obtain licenses or cease certain activities. Our breach of any license agreements or failure to obtain a license to proprietary rights that we may require to develop or commercialize our future drugs may have an adverse impact on us. If third parties prepare and file patent applications in the United States that also claim technology to which we have rights, we may have to participate in interference proceedings in the USPTO to determine priority of invention.
Government Regulation 
FDA Drug Approval Process 
In the United States, pharmaceutical products are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, and other federal and state statutes and regulations, govern, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, storage, recordkeeping, approval, labeling, promotion and marketing, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, sampling and import and export of pharmaceutical products. Failure to comply with applicable U.S. requirements may subject a company to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as FDA refusal to approve pending NDAs, warning or untitled letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, civil penalties and criminal prosecution. 
We cannot market a new drug product candidate in the United States until the drug has received FDA approval. The steps required before a new drug may be marketed in the United States generally include the following:

• | completion of extensive pre-clinical laboratory tests, animal studies, and formulation studies in accordance with the FDA's Good Laboratory Practice, or GLP, regulations;


• | submission to the FDA of an investigational new drug application, or IND, for human clinical testing, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;


• | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with Good Clinical Practice, or GCP, requirements to establish the safety and efficacy of the drug for each proposed indication;


• | submission to the FDA of an NDA after completion of all pivotal clinical trials;


• | satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of sites involved in our clinical trials;


• | satisfactory completion of an FDA pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the active pharmaceutical ingredient, or API, and finished drug product are produced and tested to assess compliance with cGMPs; and

15


• | FDA review and approval of the NDA prior to any commercial marketing or sale of the drug in the United States.

Satisfaction of FDA pre-market approval requirements typically takes many years and the actual time required may vary substantially based upon the type, complexity and novelty of the product or disease. 
Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry, formulation and toxicity, as well as animal trials to assess the characteristics and potential safety and efficacy of the product. The conduct of the preclinical tests must comply with federal regulations and requirements, including GLP regulations. The results of preclinical testing are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND along with other information, including information about product chemistry, manufacturing and controls and a proposed clinical trial protocol. Long-term preclinical tests, such as animal tests of reproductive toxicity and carcinogenicity, may continue after the IND is submitted. 
A 30-day waiting period after the submission of each IND is required prior to the commencement of clinical testing in humans. If the FDA has neither commented on nor questioned the IND within this 30-day period, the clinical trial proposed in the IND may begin. If the FDA raises concerns or questions about the conduct of the trial, such as whether human research subjects will be exposed to an unreasonable health risk, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding FDA concerns or questions before clinical trials can proceed. 
Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational new drug to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of a qualified investigator. Clinical trials must be conducted in compliance with federal regulations, including GCP requirements, as well as under protocols detailing the objectives of the trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. Each protocol and subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. 
The FDA may order the temporary, or permanent, discontinuation of a clinical trial at any time, or impose other sanctions, if it believes that the clinical trial either is not being conducted in accordance with FDA requirements or presents an unacceptable risk to the clinical trial patients. The study protocol and informed consent information for patients in clinical trials must also be submitted to an institutional review board, or IRB, for approval at each site at which the clinical trial will be conducted. An IRB may also require the clinical trial at the site to be halted, either temporarily or permanently, for failure to comply with the IRB's requirements, or may impose other conditions.
Clinical trials to support NDAs for marketing approval are typically conducted in three sequential phases, but the phases may overlap. In Phase 1, the initial introduction of the drug into healthy human subjects or patients, the drug is tested to assess pharmacological actions, pharmacokinetics, metabolism, side effects associated with increasing doses and, if possible, early evidence on effectiveness. Phase 2 usually involves trials in a limited patient population to determine metabolism, pharmacokinetics, the effectiveness of the drug for a particular indication, dosage tolerance and optimum dosage, and to identify common adverse effects and safety risks. If a compound demonstrates evidence of effectiveness and an acceptable safety profile in Phase 2 evaluations, Phase 3 clinical trials, also called pivotal trials, are undertaken to obtain the additional information about clinical efficacy and safety in a larger number of patients, typically at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites, to permit the FDA to evaluate the overall benefit-risk relationship of the drug and to provide adequate information for the labeling of the drug. In most cases, the FDA requires two adequate and well controlled Phase 3 clinical trials to demonstrate the efficacy of the drug. A single Phase 3 clinical trial with other confirmatory evidence may be sufficient in rare instances where the study is a large multicenter trial demonstrating internal consistency and a statistically very persuasive finding of a clinically meaningful effect on mortality, irreversible morbidity or prevention of a disease with a potentially serious outcome and confirmation of the result in a second trial would be practically or ethically impossible.
After completion of the required clinical testing, an NDA is prepared and submitted to the FDA. FDA approval of the NDA is required before marketing of the product may begin in the United States. The NDA must include the results of all preclinical, clinical and other testing and a compilation of data relating to the product's pharmacology, chemistry, manufacture and controls. The cost of preparing and submitting an NDA is substantial. The submission of most NDAs is additionally subject to a substantial application user fee, and the manufacturer and/or sponsor under an approved NDA are also subject to annual product and establishment user fees. These fees are typically increased annually.
The FDA has 60 days from its receipt of an NDA to determine whether the application will be accepted for filing based on the agency's threshold determination that it is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review. The FDA has agreed to certain performance goals in the review of NDAs. Most such applications for standard review drug products are reviewed within 10 to 12 months; most applications for priority review drugs are reviewed in six to eight months. Priority review can be applied to drugs to treat serious conditions that the FDA determines offer significant improvement in safety or effectiveness. The review process for both standard and priority review may be extended by the FDA for three additional months to consider certain late-submitted information, or information intended to clarify information already provided in the submission.
16

The FDA may also refer applications for novel drug products, or drug products that present difficult questions of safety or efficacy, to an advisory committee—typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts—for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, but it generally follows such recommendations. Before approving an NDA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCPs. Additionally, the FDA will inspect the facility or the facilities at which the drug is manufactured. The FDA will not approve the product unless compliance with cGMPs and GCPs is satisfactory and the NDA contains data that provide substantial evidence that the drug is safe and effective in the indication studied.
After the FDA evaluates the NDA and the manufacturing facilities and clinical sites, it issues either an approval letter or a complete response letter. A complete response letter generally outlines the deficiencies in the submission and may require substantial additional testing, or information, in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. If, or when, those deficiencies have been addressed to the FDA's satisfaction in a resubmission of the NDA, the FDA will issue an approval letter. The FDA has committed to reviewing such resubmissions in two or six months depending on the type of information included.
An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications. As a condition of NDA approval, the FDA may require a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, to ensure that the benefits of the drug outweigh the potential risks. A REMS can include a medication guide, a communication plan for healthcare professionals and elements to assure safe use, such as special training and certification requirements for individuals who prescribe or dispense the drug, requirements that patients enroll in a registry and other measures that the FDA deems necessary to assure the safe use of the drug. The requirement for a REMS can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the drug. Moreover, product approval may require substantial post-approval testing and surveillance to monitor the drug's safety or efficacy. Once granted, product approvals may be withdrawn if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or problems are identified following initial marketing.
Changes to some of the conditions established in an approved application, including changes in indications, labeling, or manufacturing processes or facilities, require submission and FDA approval of a new NDA or NDA supplement before the change can be implemented. An NDA supplement for a new indication typically requires clinical data similar to that in the original application, and the FDA uses the same procedures and actions in reviewing NDA supplements as it does in reviewing NDAs. Such supplements are typically reviewed within 10 months of receipt.
Post-Approval Requirements 
Once an NDA is approved, a product is subject to post-approval requirements. For instance, the FDA closely regulates the post-approval marketing and promotion of drugs, including standards and regulations for direct-to-consumer advertising, off-label promotion, industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities and promotional activities involving the internet and social media. Drugs may be marketed only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved labeling. 
Adverse event reporting and submission of periodic reports is required following FDA approval of an NDA. The FDA also may require post-marketing testing, known as Phase 4 testing, REMS or surveillance to monitor the effects of an approved product, or restrictions on the distribution or use of the product. In addition, quality-control, drug manufacture, packaging and labeling procedures must continue to conform to cGMPs after approval. Drug manufacturers and certain of their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies. Registration with the FDA subjects entities to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA, during which the agency inspects manufacturing facilities to assess compliance with cGMPs. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the areas of production and quality-control to maintain compliance with cGMPs. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in, among other things:

• | restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls;


• | fines, warning letters or holds on post-approval clinical trials;


• | refusal of the FDA to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications, or suspension or revocation of product approvals;


• | product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; or


• | injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.

17

Foreign Regulation 
In order to market any product outside of the United States, we would need to comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements of other countries and jurisdictions regarding quality, safety and efficacy and governing, among other things, clinical trials, marketing authorization, commercial sales and distribution of our products. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we would need to obtain the necessary approvals by the comparable foreign regulatory authorities before we can commence clinical trials or marketing of the product in foreign countries and jurisdictions. Although many of the issues discussed above with respect to the United States apply similarly in the context of the European Union, the approval process varies between countries and jurisdictions and can involve additional product testing and additional administrative review periods. The time required to obtain approval in other countries and jurisdictions might differ from and be longer than that required to obtain FDA approval. Regulatory approval in one country or jurisdiction does not ensure regulatory approval in another, but a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one country or jurisdiction may negatively impact the regulatory process in others.
Other Healthcare Laws 
Although we currently do not have any products on the market, our current and future business operations may be subject to additional healthcare regulation and enforcement by the federal government and by authorities in the states and foreign jurisdictions in which we conduct our business. Such laws include, without limitation, state and federal anti-kickback, fraud and abuse, false claims, privacy and security, price reporting and physician sunshine laws. Some of our pre-commercial activities are subject to some of these laws.
The federal Anti-Kickback Statute makes it illegal for any person or entity, including a prescription drug manufacturer or a party acting on its behalf, to knowingly and willfully solicit, receive, offer, or pay any remuneration that is intended to induce the referral of business, including the purchase, order, lease of any good, facility, item or service for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program, such as Medicare or Medicaid. The term "remuneration" has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value. The Anti-Kickback Statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on one hand and prescribers, purchasers, formulary managers, and beneficiaries on the other. Although there are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting some common activities from prosecution, the exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly. Practices that involve remuneration that may be alleged to be intended to induce prescribing, purchases or recommendations may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exception or safe harbor. Failure to meet all of the requirements of a particular applicable statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor does not make the conduct per se illegal under the Anti-Kickback Statute. Instead, the legality of the arrangement will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis based on a cumulative review of all its facts and circumstances. Several courts have interpreted the statute's intent requirement to mean that if any one purpose of an arrangement involving remuneration is to induce referrals of federal healthcare covered business, the Anti-Kickback Statute has been violated. Violations of this law are punishable by up to five years in prison, and can also result in criminal fines, administrative civil money penalties and exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs.
Additionally, the intent standard under the Anti-Kickback Statute was amended by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, collectively the Affordable Care Act, to a stricter standard such that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. In addition, the Affordable Care Act codified case law that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal civil False Claims Act. 
The federal civil False Claims Act prohibits, among other things, any person or entity from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, for payment to, or approval by, federal programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, claims for items or services, including drugs, that are false or fraudulent or not provided as claimed. Persons and entities can be held liable under these laws if they are deemed to "cause" the submission of false or fraudulent claims by, for example, providing inaccurate billing or coding information to customers or promoting a product off-label. In addition, certain of our future activities relating to the reporting of wholesaler or estimated retail prices for our products, the reporting of prices used to calculate Medicaid rebate information and other information affecting federal, state and third-party reimbursement for our products, and the sale and marketing of our products, are subject to scrutiny under this law. Penalties for federal civil False Claims Act violations may include up to three times the actual damages sustained by the government, plus mandatory civil penalties of between $10,957 and $21,916 for each separate false claim, the potential for exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs, and, although the federal False Claims Act is a civil statute, False Claims Act violations may also implicate various federal criminal statutes.
18

The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, created new federal criminal statutes that prohibit among other actions, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors, knowingly and willfully embezzling or stealing from a healthcare benefit program, willfully obstructing a criminal investigation of a healthcare offense, and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. Like the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, the Affordable Care Act amended the intent standard for certain healthcare fraud statutes under HIPAA such that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation.
The civil monetary penalties statute imposes penalties against any person or entity that, among other things, is determined to have presented or caused to be presented a claim to a federal health program that the person knows or should know is for an item or service that was not provided as claimed or is false or fraudulent.
HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, and their implementing regulations, including the final omnibus rule published on January 25, 2013, mandates, among other things, the adoption of uniform standards for the electronic exchange of information in common healthcare transactions, as well as standards relating to the privacy and security of individually identifiable health information, which require the adoption of administrative, physical and technical safeguards to protect such information. Among other things, HITECH makes HIPAA's security standards directly applicable to business associates, defined as independent contractors or agents of covered entities that create, receive or obtain protected health information in connection with providing a service for or on behalf of a covered entity. At present, it is unclear if we would be considered a business associate subject to HIPAA based on our business activities and service offerings upon the commercialization of a product. HITECH also increased the civil and criminal penalties that may be imposed against covered entities and business associates, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorney's fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. In addition, certain state laws govern the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, some of which are more stringent than HIPAA and many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts. Failure to comply with these laws, where applicable, can result in the imposition of significant civil and/or criminal penalties.
The Affordable Care Act, through the enactment of the Physician Payments Sunshine Act, imposes, among other things, new annual reporting requirements for covered manufacturers for certain payments and other transfers of value provided to physicians and teaching hospitals, as well as certain ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. Failure to submit timely, accurately and completely the required information for all payments, transfers of value and ownership or investment interests may result in civil monetary penalties of up to an aggregate of $150,000 per year and up to an aggregate of $1 million per year for "knowing failures."
Many states have similar fraud and abuse statutes or regulations that may be broader in scope and may apply regardless of payor, in addition to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs. We may also be subject to state laws that require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government, and/or state laws that require drug manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures. Additionally, to the extent that any of our products are sold in a foreign country, we may be subject to similar foreign laws.
Because we intend to commercialize products that could be reimbursed under a federal healthcare program and other governmental healthcare programs, we will continue to develop a comprehensive compliance program that establishes internal controls to facilitate adherence to the rules and program requirements to which we will or may become subject. Although the development and implementation of compliance programs designed to establish internal control and facilitate compliance can mitigate the risk of violating these laws, and the subsequent investigation, prosecution, and penalties assessed for violations of these laws, the risks cannot be entirely eliminated.
If our operations are found to be in violation of any of such laws or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including, without limitation, administrative, civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, additional reporting requirements and oversight if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or similar agreement, the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs and individual imprisonment, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results.
19

Healthcare Reform 
In the United States and foreign jurisdictions, there have been a number of legislative and regulatory changes to the healthcare system that could affect our future results of operations. There have been and continue to be a number of initiatives at the United States federal and state levels that seek to reduce healthcare costs.
In particular, the Affordable Care Act has had, and is expected to continue to have, a significant impact on the healthcare industry. The Affordable Care Act was designed to expand coverage for the uninsured while at the same time containing overall healthcare costs. With regard to pharmaceutical products, among other things, the Affordable Care Act revises the definition of "average manufacturer price," or AMP, for calculating and reporting Medicaid drug rebates on outpatient prescription drug prices and imposes a significant annual fee on companies that manufacture or import certain branded prescription drug products. In January 2016, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services issued a final rule regarding the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, effective April 1, 2016, that, among other things, revises the manner in which the AMP is to be calculated by manufacturers participating in the program and implements certain amendments to the Medicaid rebate statute created under the Affordable Care Act. Substantial new provisions affecting compliance have also been enacted, which may require us to modify our business practices with healthcare providers and entities, and a significant number of provisions are not yet, or have only recently become, effective.
We cannot predict the full impact of the Affordable Care Act on pharmaceutical companies, as many of the reforms require the promulgation of detailed regulations implementing the statutory provisions, some of which has not yet fully occurred. Further, there have been judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the Affordable Care Act, and we expect there will be additional challenges and amendments to the Affordable Care Act in the future. In January 2017, President Trump signed an Executive Order directing federal agencies with authorities and responsibilities under the Affordable Care Act to waive, defer, grant exemptions from, or delay the implementation of any provision of the Affordable Care Act that would impose a fiscal or regulatory burden on states, individuals, healthcare providers, health insurers, or manufacturers of pharmaceuticals or medical devices. In May 2017, following the passage of the budget resolution for fiscal year 2017, the U.S. House of Representatives passed legislation known as the American Health Care Act, which, if enacted, would amend or repeal significant portions of the Affordable Care Act. The U.S. Senate could adopt the American Health Care Act as passed by the U.S. House of Representatives or other legislation to amend or replace elements of the Affordable Care Act. Thus, it is uncertain when or if the American Health Care Act will become law. In the coming years, additional legislative and regulatory changes could be made to governmental health programs that could significantly impact pharmaceutical companies and the success of our product candidates.
Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the Affordable Care Act was enacted. In August 2011, the President signed into law the Budget Control Act of 2011, which, among other things, created the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction to recommend to Congress proposals in spending reductions. The Joint Select Committee did not achieve a targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for the years 2013 through 2021, triggering the legislation's automatic reduction to several government programs. These included reductions to Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect on April 1, 2013 and, due to subsequent legislative amendments to the statute, will stay in effect through 2025 unless additional Congressional action is taken. Additionally, in January 2013, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 was signed into law, which, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several providers and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. Further, there have been several recent U.S. Congressional inquiries and proposed federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, reduce the out-of-pocket cost of prescription drugs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drugs.
Moreover, the Drug Supply Chain Security Act imposes new obligations on manufacturers of pharmaceutical products, among others, related to product tracking and tracing, which is being phased in over several years beginning in 2015. Among the requirements of this new legislation, manufacturers will be required to provide certain information regarding the drug product to individuals and entities to which product ownership is transferred, label drug product with a product identifier, and keep certain records regarding the drug product. The transfer of information to subsequent product owners by manufacturers will eventually be required to be done electronically. Manufacturers will also be required to verify that purchasers of the manufacturers' products are appropriately licensed. Further, under this new legislation, manufacturers will have drug product investigation, quarantine, disposition, and notification responsibilities related to counterfeit, diverted, stolen, and intentionally adulterated products, as well as products that are the subject of fraudulent transactions or which are otherwise unfit for distribution such that they would be reasonably likely to result in serious health consequences or death.

Coverage and Reimbursement 
Sales of our products, if and when approved, will depend, in part, on the extent to which the costs of our products will be covered by third-party payors, such as government healthcare programs, private health insurers and managed care organizations. Third-party payors generally decide which drugs they will cover and establish certain reimbursement levels for such drugs. In particular, in the U.S., private health insurers and other third-party payors often provide reimbursement for products and services based on the level at which the government (through the Medicare or Medicaid programs) provides reimbursement for such treatments. Patients who are prescribed treatments for their conditions and providers performing the prescribed services generally rely on third-party payors to reimburse all or part of the associated healthcare costs. Patients are unlikely to use our products unless coverage is provided and reimbursement is adequate to cover a significant portion of the cost of our products. Sales of our product candidates, and those of any future product candidate, will therefore depend substantially on the extent to which the costs of our product candidates, and those of any future product candidate, will be paid by third-party payors. Additionally, the market for our product candidates, and those of any future product candidate, will depend significantly on access to third-party payors' formularies without prior authorization, step therapy, or other limitations such as approved lists of treatments for which third-party payors provide coverage and reimbursement. Additionally, coverage and reimbursement for therapeutic products can differ significantly from payor to payor. One third-party payor's decision to cover a particular medical product or service does not ensure that other payors will also provide coverage for the medical product or service, or will provide coverage at an adequate reimbursement rate. As a result, the coverage determination process will require us to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of our products to each payor separately and will likely be a time-consuming process.
Third-party payors are developing increasingly sophisticated methods of controlling healthcare costs and challenging the prices charged for medical products and services. Additionally, the containment of healthcare costs (including drug prices) has become a priority of federal and state governments. The U.S. government, state legislatures and foreign governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution by generic products. Adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could limit our net revenue and results. If these third-party payors do not consider our products to be cost-effective compared to other therapies, they may not cover our products once approved as a benefit under their plans or, if they do, the level of reimbursement may not be sufficient to allow us to sell our products on a profitable basis. Decreases in third-party reimbursement for our products once approved or a decision by a third-party payor to not cover our products could reduce or eliminate utilization of our products and have an adverse effect on our sales, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, state and federal healthcare reform measures have been and will be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for healthcare products and services, which could result in reduced demand for our products once approved or additional pricing pressures.
