ITEM 1. BUSINESS.
OVERVIEW
 
We are a biopharmaceutical company principally engaged in the research, development, manufacturing and sales of human plasma-based biopharmaceutical products, or plasma products, in China. We are among the top three producers of plasma products in China in terms of 2016 sales, based on our industry knowledge. We operate our business through a majority owned subsidiary, Shandong Taibang, a company based in Tai’an, Shandong Province and a wholly owned subsidiary, Guizhou Taibang, a company based in Guiyang, Guizhou Province. We also hold a minority equity interest in Huitian, a plasma products company based in Xi’an, Shaanxi Province.
 
We have a strong product portfolio with over 20 different dosage forms of plasma products and other biopharmaceutical products across nine categories. All of our products are prescription medicines administered in the form of injections. Our principal products are human albumin and immunoglobulin for intravenous injection, or IVIG. Albumin has been used for almost 50 years to treat critically ill patients by assisting the maintenance of adequate blood volume and pressure. IVIG is used for certain disease prevention and treatment by enhancing specific immunity. These products use human plasma as their principal raw material. Sales of human albumin products represented approximately 39.2%, 37.6% and 39.3% of our total sales for 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Sales of IVIG products represented approximately 34.6%, 42.2% and 40.4% of our total sales for 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
 
Our sales model focuses on direct sales to hospitals and inoculation centers and is complemented by distributor sales. In 2016, we generated sales of $341.2 million, an increase of 15.1% from 2015, and recorded net income attributable to our company of $104.8 million, an increase of 17.8 % from 2015. In 2015, we generated sales of $296.5 million, an increase of 21.9% from 2014, and recorded net income attributable to our company of $89.0 million, an increase of 25.5% from 2014.
 
We operate and manage our business as one single segment. We do not account for the results of our operations on a geographic or other basis.

INDUSTRY
 
Overview
 
We operate in the plasma industry in China. We derive certain industry-related data from reports and written analysis prepared by The Marketing Research Bureau, Inc., or MRB, an independent research firm focused on blood and plasma industry data on a global level, including a China-specific report from January 2017.
 
China is the second largest plasma products market in the world, after the United States. According to MRB, China’s plasma products market (excluding recombinant products) grew from $0.80 billion in 2009 to $2.47 billion in 2015 in terms of sales revenue, representing a compound annual growth rate, or CAGR, of 20.7%. MRB expects that by 2018, China’s plasma-derived products market will reach over $3.3 billion, representing about a 35% increase from 2015, assuming domestic plasma supply continues to grow at least 8% annually. Based on our industry knowledge, human albumin products dominated China’s plasma products market with a market share of 64.7% in terms of sales revenue in 2016, and IVIG products accounted for 25.2% of the market. Other plasma products, including coagulation factors, accounted for the remaining 10.1% of the market in 2016.
 
Compared to more developed countries, China has a lower per capita usage level of plasma products, and China’s plasma products market is significantly different in terms of product composition and range. In more developed countries such as the United States, IVIG products account for a majority of plasma product sales. This difference reflects the maturity levels of the plasma industries in these countries. According to MRB, plasma fractionation came into existence in the 1940s in the United States, whereas in China, plasma processing appeared in the 1960s or 1970s. Until the early 1970s, the U.S. plasma products market was dominated by albumin products, as is the case in China’s market presently. The current low per capita consumption of IVIG products in China is primarily attributable to a lack of awareness of the benefits of IVIG therapy, especially in medical conditions such as primary immune deficiency or chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy, and lower per capita healthcare spending in China. China’s plasma products market is expected to be increasingly driven by IVIG products in the future as IVIG therapy becomes more widespread as a result of the combined efforts of physician education and product promotion, among other factors.
 
Based on our industry knowledge, China National Biotec Group, or CNBG, Hualan Biological Engineering Inc., or Hualan, and China Biologic, were the top three plasma product manufacturers in terms of sales revenue in 2016.
 
Overall Plasma Products Market Trends
 
Compared to more developed countries, China’s plasma products market has distinctive characteristics and trends, including the following:
 
High Entry Barriers. The PRC State Council has ceased issuing new plasma fractionation licenses since 2001, and there are approximately 30 licensed producers of plasma products in China, of which only approximately 28 are currently in operation. Nearly all of these producers make albumin and IVIG products, but only five of them, including China Biologic, make factor VIII products. Furthermore, foreign investment in domestic producers of plasma products is subject to stringent government approval process. As a result, existing China-based producers with large production capacities face limited competition and are well positioned to gain more market share during the industry consolidation phase.

Stringent regulation. China’s plasma products market is stringently regulated. Because of the public health crises of contaminated plasma products experienced by China over the past decade, China has implemented, and is expected to continue to maintain, stringent regulations for the plasma products industry in the foreseeable future. The opening of a new plasma collection station in China requires the approval by three levels of government authorities, namely the provincial, municipal and county level authorities, which is a time-consuming and difficult process. To be eligible to open a new collection station, a company must produce no fewer than six types of plasma products, which must include products in three mandatory categories, namely human albumin, immunoglobulin and coagulation factors. From 2010 to 2015, various local governments approved the opening of plasma collection stations by small companies that were not able to produce all the mandatory products. In response, in December 2016, the NHFPC and CFDA jointly released a new guideline on the regulation of plasma collection stations. The guideline aims to strengthen regulatory oversight for existing collection stations and approval requirements for new plasma collection stations, and to tighten safety control at the plasma collection stations to improve the quality of plasma collected. The guideline states that in considering the applications for the opening of new plasma collection stations, the relevant authorities should give priority to companies with strong research and development capabilities, high plasma utilization rate and good management practice. We believe this guideline will benefit large plasma products manufacturers like China Biologic by reducing the chance for smaller manufacturers to open new plasma collection stations.
 
Demand outstripping supply. Due to stringent regulations on the collection of raw plasma from human beings and a lack of plasma donation, China has experienced a shortage of plasma products since the 1980s. There are fewer than 220 plasma collection centers in China, compared to over 530 in the United States. The restriction on approving new collection centers in China, cultural barriers to plasma donation, concerns over plasma donation safety, and low quantity per donation and long intervals between donations contribute to the supply shortage. According to the National Health and Family Planning Committee (NHFPC), the demand for raw plasma materials in China is estimated to be over 10,000 tons per annum. Total plasma collected in 2015 was 5600 tonnes in China, in comparison with over 30,000 tonnes in the United States. As a result, the tendering prices for plasma products by various provincial and regional governments have been slightly increased or stabilized in contrast to price cuts for other drugs.
 
Ban on imports. As a measure to prevent a range of viral risks, China strictly prohibits the import of plasma products, except for human albumin and recombinant factor VIII products. In other market segments, such as IVIG, where import is prohibited, domestic producers are shielded from competition from their multinational peers, and the demand for such products in China has been supplied entirely by domestically-sourced plasma only.
 
Low consumption level and huge growth potential. While China’s plasma products market has experienced rapid growth in recent years, China’s per capita consumption of plasma products lags substantially behind more developed countries. The following chart sets forth the comparison of per capita consumptions of selected plasma products in China and the United States in 2015:

(2) | Based on 2015 per capita consumption (international units per capita) in the Unites States divided by 2015 per capita consumption in China.
----+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Based on our industry knowledge, as a result of the growing number of patients seeking treatment of plasma products, an increasing awareness of health benefits of plasma products and the rising affordability of plasma products since the commencement of China’s healthcare reform, China’s plasma products market is expected to continue to have substantial growth potential.
 
Improved fractionation technologies. In the early years of plasma fractionation in China, technologies used were not as sophisticated as those in the United States, resulting in relatively low yields and a product portfolio limited to only two or three products (albumin, IVIG and hyper-immune globulin products). Technologies used by and yields from leading domestic manufacturers are, however, on par with international standards, and these manufacturers are well positioned to manufacture safer products and have higher production efficiency compared with other domestic companies.
 
Increasing market concentration of top players. China’s current landscape of plasma products market is relatively fragmented. However, factors such as stringent regulations, tightened quality control and heavy capital expenditure requirements have contributed to increasing industry consolidation in recent years. For instance, the CFDA issued new GMP requirements to re-certify all the fractionation plants by the end of 2013, which has resulted in the shutdown of smaller fractionation plants that were unable to upgrade their production lines by the deadline. China’s plasma industry has also witnessed multiple merger and acquisition transactions in recent years. Market leaders with stable plasma supplies complemented by further collection expansion potentials, strong product portfolios and robust research and development capabilities are expected to be able to continue to solidify their positions and further gain development advantages.

Albumin Market Trends
 
According to MRB, human albumin products achieved sales revenue of $1.57 billion in 2015, accounting for 63.8% of China’s plasma products market (excluding recombinant factors) in 2015 and representing a CAGR of approximately 25.3% from 2009.
 
The robust demand for albumin products in China continues to grow as a result of the high incidence of hypo-albuminemia from liver cirrhosis, cancer and in cardiac surgeries. Unlike many other plasma products, albumin products may be imported from other countries due to the acute shortage of albumin products from domestic manufacturers, and as a result, many multinational plasma product manufacturers are expected to continue to divert a large portion of their albumin products to China’s market in the future so long as the price in China remains competitive. Based on our industry knowledge, imported albumin products accounted for approximately 56.2% of China’s albumin products market in 2016. CNBG, Hualan, and China Biologic were the three largest domestic albumin product manufacturers with a combined market share close to 19.9%, and China Biologic ranked the third with a market share of approximately 6.5%, in terms of sales revenue in 2016.
 
IVIG Market Trends
 
According to MRB, China’s IVIG products achieved sales revenue of $671.0 million in 2015, representing a CAGR of approximately 14.5% from 2009. Based on our industry knowledge, CNBG, Hualan, and China Biologic were the three largest domestic albumin product manufacturers with a combined market share close to 48.5%, and China Biologic ranked the third with a market share of approximately 14.7%, in terms of sales revenue in 2016.
 
In more developed countries, major applications of IVIG therapy are for chronic diseases such as primary immune deficiency and chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy, which require treatment for a number of years or even lifetime. In contrast, IVIG therapy is only used to treat acute diseases and infections in China. The substantial growth in China’s IVIG products market in recent years was mainly due to increasing awareness by doctors of the benefits of IVIG therapy. Compared with the markets in more developed countries, China’s IVIG products market is far from mature. In 2015, for instance, the per capita consumption of IVIG products in China was 15.0 grams per 1,000 inhabitants, as compared to over 200 grams per 1,000 inhabitants in the United States, according to MRB, and therefore there is tremendous growth potential as China’s IVIG per capita consumption draws closer to that of the United States. Developing this market requires significant efforts from IVIG manufacturers to educate physicians, the public and the health authorities on the benefits of IVIG therapy for a number of medical conditions. In countries with higher per capita consumption of IVIG products, the efficacy of IVIG therapy in a number of medical conditions has been promoted over the years by clinical trials, anecdotal reports, scientific articles, educational activities for physicians and medical students, medical conferences and seminars, and promotional campaigns such as advertisements in medical journals. The role of a specialized sales force was also instrumental in the rapid acceptance of IVIG therapy in North America and Europe. In addition, patient organizations, which are largely supported by IVIG manufacturers, have also become increasingly important in recent years, as they are able to draw physicians’ attention to antibody deficiency tests. All of these factors may be replicated in China as a result of IVIG manufacturers’ educational and promotional efforts as well as economic development and healthcare spending growth in China.
 
Factor VIII Market Trends
 
According to MRB, China’s market size for plasma-derived factor VIII was $36.2 million in terms of sales revenue in 2015, representing a CAGR of approximately 22.7% from 2009. Based on our industry knowledge, only five domestic plasma product manufacturers offered plasma-derived factor VIII in 2016. Hualan, Green Cross (China) Biological Products Co., Ltd., and China Biologic were the largest three domestic manufacturers of plasma-derived factor VIII with a combined market share close to 84.9%, and China Biologic ranked the third with a market share of approximately 21.8%, in terms of sales revenue in 2016.

There were over 15,000 registered hemophilia patients in China as of December 31, 2016, according to China Hemophilia Association, which underpins a significant market demand for factor VIII products. Due to an acute shortage of plasma-derived coagulation factor concentrates available in China as a result of limited coagulation factor manufacturers, recombinant factor VIII products have taken a growing role in hemophilia care in China. However, since recombinant products are approximately twice more expensive than plasma-derived factor VIII products and not covered by national health insurance for full reimbursement in China, they are used only in the absence of suitable plasma-derived products. As an increasing number of China-based manufacturers, including China Biologic, commercially launched factor VIII products, the supply is expected to increase and lead to overall market growth. It is unlikely, however, that plasma-derived factor VIII will be able to fully meet the market demand if hemophilia care continues to improve in China. China’s market for factor VIII products is expected to experience a continued shortage of plasma-derived factor VIII products in the foreseeable future.
 
BUSINESS
 
Our Competitive Strengths
 
We believe that the following competitive strengths enable us to compete effectively in and capitalize on the growth of the plasma products market:
 
Leading producer of plasma products in China with strong growth potential
 
We are one of the top three producers of plasma products in terms of 2016 sales revenue based on our industry knowledge. In the albumin segment, which accounts for a majority of the plasma products market in China, we are the third largest domestic producer with a market share of approximately 6.5% in terms of 2016 sales revenue, based on our industry knowledge. In the IVIG segment, which is the second largest segment of the plasma products market in China, we are also the third largest producer overall in China with a market share of approximately 14.7% in terms of 2016 sales revenue, based on our industry knowledge.
 
We have a strong product portfolio with over 20 different dosage forms of plasma products and other biopharmaceutical products across nine categories and a robust near-term product pipeline of seven products. We believe that we are one of the only four plasma products manufacturers in China with the product portfolio comprising at least eight categories of plasma products. Since different types of plasma products utilize different protein components of plasma, different types of plasma products can be produced from the same raw plasma supply with minimal incremental increase in raw material cost. Our broad product portfolio, supported by our strong research and development capabilities, therefore, provides us with the benefit of more comprehensive plasma utilization, which in turn contributes to higher profit margins.
 
We believe that product safety and supply stability are the most critical considerations for hospitals and inoculation centers in making purchase decisions on plasma products. We implement stringent quality control measures throughout our production process, and have not historically experienced failure to receive pre-sale approval or had a recall with respect to any of our plasma products. We currently have a manufacturing facility in Guizhou Province and expect to launch a new manufacturing facility in Shandong Province by the end of 2017 to replace our old facility in Shandong Province, which together will reach a production capacity of 1,600 tonnes. As a leading producer of plasma products, we have been able to maintain a steady plasma supply volume and sales volume over the years. Our safety record and the stability of our supply, we believe, have strengthened our business relationship with existing customers and enhanced our ability to acquire new customers.

China’s plasma products market is, and will continue to be, subject to stringent government regulation. In recent years, however, PRC regulators have also taken initiatives to increase plasma collection volume by approving more new plasma collection stations and expanding plasma collection coverage for existing plasma collection stations. We are well positioned to benefit from these favorable regulatory trends as we are able to meet the associated quality control and technology investment requirements.
 
Stable and growing supply of plasma with strategically located collection stations
 
Our ability to secure and expand our supply of plasma, a critical raw material for our operations, is one of our key strengths. Our plasma collection network consists of 14 captive plasma collection stations (including one branch collection facility). In addition, Huitian, a company in which we hold a minority equity interest, operates three plasma collection stations. In 2016, we were among the top five plasma collectors in China in terms of collection volume with approximately 12.4% of the total national supply, based on our industry knowledge.
 
We operate nine plasma collection stations (including one branch collection facility) in Shandong Province, two in Guangxi Province, two in Guizhou Province, and one in Hebei Province, covering 33 cities and counties with an aggregate population of approximately 42.6 million. Shandong Province has one of the largest population, and Guangxi Province and Guizhou Province are among the least economically developed regions in China — both favorable characteristics underpinning a strong and stable plasma supply. Hebei Province is an underdeveloped province for plasma collection that provides convenient and economic transportation to our manufacturing facilities in adjacent Shandong Province.
 
We continue to seek innovative ways to identify and attract potential plasma donors. We regularly organize a variety of community events to deliver our messages that focus on the life-saving and other social contribution aspects of plasma donation. We also regularly review our donor compensation to ensure that it remains competitive. In addition, we actively seek to expand the geographic coverage of our existing collection stations to gain access to additional donor populations. As a result of our collection efforts, our average plasma collection volume is greater than the national average by approximately 78.0% in 2016 based on our industry knowledge. Our total plasma collection volume increased by approximately 16.9% from 2015 to 2016.
 
In addition to increasing our collection volume at existing plasma collection stations, we also seek to build new plasma collection stations to expand our donor base. For example, in October 2014, we received regulatory approval to build two new plasma collection stations in Xinglong and Daming Counties, respectively, in Hebei Province. In June 2016, we received the operating permit for and commenced operations at our new plasma collection station in Xinglong County. The Daming station is still under construction as of the date of this report and is expected to open in 2017. In December 2016, we received the regulatory approvals to build a new plasma collection station in Ju County in Shandong Province and to build a branch collection facility in Feicheng County to operate under our Ningyang plasma collection station in Shandong Province.

Robust near-term product pipeline to capture full plasma value chain backed by strong research and development capabilities
 
We currently have six new products under development, with one of them in registration stage and expected to be commercially launched in the second half of 2017. We expect our expanding product portfolio to further increase our comprehensive plasma utilization, which will in turn lead to higher profit margins. With our current and pipeline products, we believe that by 2018, our product offerings will be able to capture substantially all of the value along the plasma products value chain.
 
Benefiting, in part, from our direct sales to hospitals and inoculation centers, our ability to bring new products to market reflects a research and development process that is demand-driven and highly responsive to physician feedback and the latest market trends in medicine. To complement our research and development efforts, we also work closely with a number of leading research institutes in China specializing in plasma products. As of December 31, 2016, we held 55 patents for plasma products.
 
Leading position in China’s fast-growing IVIG products market
 
We are the third largest producer of IVIG products in China in terms of 2016 sales revenue based on our industry knowledge. Our IVIG sales, accounting for approximately 34.6% of our total sales, increased to $117.9 million in 2016 from $98.4 million in 2014, representing a CAGR of 9.5% between 2014 and 2016. We attribute our rapid growth and leading position in the IVIG products market, in part, to our continued efforts to promote IVIG therapy to physicians in tier one cities.
 
Compared with markets in more developed countries, China’s IVIG products market is far from mature. In more developed countries, major applications of IVIG therapy are for chronic diseases, which require treatment for a number of years or even lifetime, while in China, IVIG therapy is only used to treat acute diseases and infections. Also, the per capita consumption of IVIG products in China is significantly lower than that in the more developed countries, and therefore there is significant growth potential as China’s IVIG consumption draws closer to that of the more developed countries as a result of growing awareness of IVIG therapy and favorable government reimbursement policies. For details of the IVIG products market comparison, see “Industry — IVIG Market Trends.” As a leading player in China’s IVIG products market, we are uniquely positioned to benefit from the anticipated increase in demand from the popularization of IVIG therapy.
 
Flexible and effective sales and distribution model aimed to maximize penetration
 
We have a flexible sales model that focuses on direct sales to hospitals and inoculation centers and is complemented by distributor sales. Under this sales model, our products reach 30 provinces, municipalities and autonomous regions in China.
 
In 2016, 55.3% of our product sales were generated from direct sales, and in 2016, our direct sales network covered approximately 605 hospitals and inoculation centers. Our sales and marketing team, consisting of 114 employees as of December 31, 2016, is responsible for the sales and marketing efforts to our end customers and provide product educational programs and other sales support directly to doctors and nurses. These efforts are designed to ensure effective and seamless communications with our end customers, particularly with respect to clinical education, which provides us with first-hand intelligence on the latest industry trends and market demands and enables us to provide better after-sale services and support. For example, our sales and marketing team actively promotes new IVIG indications that are widely accepted in more developed countries but less known among Chinese physicians.
 
Our direct sales network is complemented by sales through distributors, which accounted for 38.9% of our plasma sales in 2016. We select our distributors through a rigorous process, which focuses on market leadership in the covered region, the degree of control we have over to which hospitals our products are sold (i.e., larger and higher tiered hospitals are preferred), and the level of access we have to our customers (i.e., greater access enables us to better track the sales of our products).

We believe that our flexible sales model of focusing on direct sales is cost-effective and has helped us to achieve strong financial performance. Our selling expenses as a percentage of sales were 3.4%, 3.4% and 4.4% in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively; and our operating margin was 42.1%, 44.7% and 45.7% during these periods, respectively.
 
Experienced and committed management team
 
We have an experienced, dedicated and visionary management team with an in-depth understanding of the pharmaceutical industry in China. Our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Mr. David (Xiaoying) Gao, with more than 14 years of experience in the pharmaceutical industry, was instrumental in the development and implementation of our business strategy. Before joining our company, Mr. Gao was the chief executive officer of BMP Sunstone Corporation before that company was acquired by Sanofi. Our Chief Financial Officer, Ming Yang, has more than 19 years of financial management and accounting experience. Mr. Guangli Pang and Mr. Gang Yang, the general manager of Shandong Taibang and Guizhou Taibang, respectively, have more than 30 and 20 years of experience in the plasma products industry in China, respectively. Since our current senior management team was put in place in 2012, we have been committed to improving corporate governance and enhancing shareholder value. We believe our management team, with their extensive industry background and strong management talent, provides a strong foundation for the execution of our growth strategy and achievement of our goals.
 
Our Business Strategy
 
Our mission is to become a first-class biopharmaceutical enterprise in China. To achieve this objective, we have implemented a business strategy with the following key components:
 
Securing the supply of plasma
 
Due to the shortage of plasma, we plan to build new plasma collection stations in regions not covered by our existing collection network as well as to expand collection territories of existing plasma collection stations in order to secure our plasma supply. We currently have a total of 14 plasma collection stations (including one branch collection facility) in operation, of which nine are in Shandong Province, two in Guangxi Province, two in Guizhou Province and one in Hebei Province. In October 2014, we received the regulatory approval to build two new plasma collection stations in Xinglong and Daming Counties, respectively, in Hebei Province. In June 2016, we received the operating permit for and commenced operations at our new plasma collection station in Xinglong County. The Daming station is still under construction as of the date of this report and is expected to open in 2017. In December 2016, we received the regulatory approvals to build a new plasma collection station in Ju County in Shandong Province and to build a branch collection facility in Feicheng County to operate under our Ningyang plasma collection station in Shandong Province. Meanwhile, we are carrying out various promotional activities to stabilize and expand our donor base for our existing plasma collection stations. A majority of our plasma collection stations recorded increases in plasma collection volume in 2016 as compared to 2015.
 
Further strengthening of research and development capability
 
We believe that, unlike other more developed countries such as the United States, China’s plasma products are at an early stage of development. There are many other plasma products that are being used in the United States, which are not currently manufactured or used widely in China. We intend to strengthen our research and development capabilities through in-house development and partnership with leading international players to expand our product line to include plasma products that have higher margins and are technologically more advanced. We also intend to continue to improve the yield for our products. As a result of our research and development efforts, we currently have six products under development, with one of them in registration stage and expected to be commercially launched in the second half of 2017. For further details of our pipeline products, see “— Our Research and Development Efforts” below. We believe that our increased focus on research and development will give us a competitive advantage in China over our competitors.

Market development and network expansion
 
Leveraging on the high quality and steady supply of our products, we intend to expand our geographic coverage in China to include markets where we envision significant growth potential. In particular, we plan to further strengthen our direct sales by growing our sales and marketing team and expanding our coverage among hospitals and inoculation centers. We also plan to strengthen our relationships with major distributors in tier-one cities to deepen our penetration in those markets and to obtain higher market share.
 
Organic growth complemented by acquisition of competitors and/or other biologic-related companies
 
We have expanded organically by securing sufficient plasma supply and strengthening in-house development efforts. In addition to organic growth, acquisition is an important part of our expansion strategy. Although there are approximately 30 approved plasma-based biopharmaceutical manufacturers in the market, we believe that there are approximately 28 manufactures currently in operation in China, only about half of which are competitive. We estimate that the top five manufacturers in China accounted for more than 70.5% market share (excluding imports) in terms of sales revenue in 2016. Furthermore, we believe that the regulatory authorities are considering further industry reform and those smaller, less competitive manufacturers will face possible revocation of their manufacturing permits by the regulators due to the compliance cost, making them potential targets for acquisition. If we are presented with appropriate opportunities, we may acquire additional companies, products or technologies in the biologic-related sectors (e.g., medical, pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical) to complement our current business operations.
 
Our Products
 
Our principal products are our approved human albumin and IVIG products. Human albumin is principally used to treat critically ill patients by replacing lost fluid and maintaining adequate blood volume and pressure. IVIG products are primarily used to enhance specific immunity, a defense mechanism by which the human body generates certain immunoglobulin, or antibodies, against invasion by potentially dangerous substances. In a situation where the human body cannot effectively react to these foreign substances, injection of IVIG products can provide sufficient antibodies to neutralize such substances. We are currently approved to produce over 20 different dosage forms of plasma products, which are listed in the table below.

Approved Products(1)(2) | Treatment/Use 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Human albumin – 20%/10ml, 20%/25ml, 20%/50ml, 10%/100ml, 10%/20ml, 10%/50ml, 25%/50ml and 20%/50ml (10g, from factor IV) | Shock caused by blood loss trauma or burn; raised intracranial pressure caused by hydrocephalus or trauma; oedema or ascites caused by hepatocirrhosis and nephropathy; prevention and treatment of low-density-lipoproteinemia; and neonatal hyperbilirubinemia. 
Human immunoglobulin – 10%/3ml and 10%/1.5ml | Original immunoglobulin deficiency, such as X chain low immunoglobulin, familiar variable immune deficiency, immunoglobulin G secondary deficiency; secondary immunoglobulin deficiency, such as severe infection, newborn sepsis; and auto-immune deficiency diseases, such as original thrombocytopenia purpura or Kawasaki disease.
IVIG – 5%/25ml, 5%/50ml, 5%/100ml and 5%/200ml | Same as above. 
Human hepatitis B immunoglobulin – 100 IU, 200IU and 400IU | Prevention of measles and contagious hepatitis. When applied together with antibiotics, its curative effect on certain severe bacteria or virus infection may be improved. 
Human rabies immunoglobulin – 100IU, 200IU and 500IU | Mainly for passive immunity from bites or claws by rabies or other infected animals. All patients suspected of being exposed to rabies are treated with a combined dose of rabies vaccine and human rabies immunoglobulin. 
Human tetanus immunoglobulin – 250IU | Mainly used for the prevention and therapy of tetanus. Particularly applied to patients who have allergic reactions to tetanus antitoxin. (3) 
Placenta polypeptide – 4ml/vial | Treatment for cell immunity deficiency diseases, viral infection and leucopenia caused by various reasons, and assist in postoperative healing. 
Factor VIII – 200IU and 300IU | Treatment for coagulopathies such as hemophilia A and increased concentration of coagulation factor VIII. 
Human prothrombin complex concentrate (or PCC) – 300IU | Treatment for congenital and acquired clotting factor II, VII, IX, X deficiency, such as Hemophilia B, excessive anticoagulant, and vitamin K deficiency, etc. 


(1) | “%” represents the degree of dosage concentration for the product and each product has its own dosage requirement. For example, human albumin 20%/10ml means 2g of human albumin is contained in each 10ml packaging and human immunoglobulin 10%/3ml means 300mg of human immunoglobulin is contained in each 3ml packaging. Under PRC law, each variation in the packaging, dosage and concentration of medical products requires separate registration and approval by CFDA before it may be commercially available for sale. For example, among our human albumin products, only human albumin 20%/10ml, 20%/25ml, 20%/50ml, 10%/100ml, 10%/20ml, 10%/50ml, 25%/50ml and 20%/50ml (10g, from factor IV) products are currently approved and are commercially available.
----+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(2) | “IU” means International Units. IU is a unit used to measure the activity of many vitamins, hormones, enzymes, and drugs. An IU is the amount of a substance that has a certain biological effect. For each substance there is an international agreement on the biological effect that is expected for 1 IU. In the case of immunoglobulin, it means the number of effective units of antibodies in each package.
----+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(3) | Tetanus antitoxin is a cheaper injection treatment for tetanus. However, it is not widely used because most people are allergic to it.
----+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Our approved human albumin, immunoglobulin (including IVIG), factor VIII and PCC products all use human plasma as the primary raw material. All of our approved products are prescription medicines administered in the form of injections.
 
We have two product liability insurance policies covering Shandong Taibang’s and Guizhou Taibang’s products in the amount of RMB20 million (approximately $2.9 million) each. Since our establishment in 2002, we have been subject to four lawsuits filed by patients who were treated with our products and received blood and/or plasma transfusions. See “Risk Factors — Risks Relating to Our Business — Product liability claims or product recalls involving our products could have a material adverse effect on our business” for further details. We do not expect these four claims to have a material adverse effect on our company.

Raw Materials
 
Plasma from in-house collection
 
Plasma is the principal raw material for our biopharmaceutical products. We currently operate 12 plasma collection stations (including one branch collection facility) through Shandong Taibang and two plasma collection stations through Guizhou Taibang. We plan to build new plasma collection stations throughout China as well as to expand collection territories of existing plasma collection stations. In October 2014, we received the regulatory approval to build two new plasma collection stations in Xinglong and Daming Counties, respectively, in Hebei Province. In June 2016, we received the operating permit for and commenced operations at our new plasma collection station in Xinglong County. The new station in Daming County is under construction as of the date of this report and is expected to open in 2017. In December 2016, we received the regulatory approvals to build a new plasma collection station in Ju County in Shandong Province and to build a branch collection facility in Feicheng County to operate under our Ningyang plasma collection station in Shandong Province. We believe that our plasma collection stations give us a stable source of plasma supply and control over product quality. Also, we believe that we have enjoyed benefits of economies of scale, including sharing certain administration and management expenses across our several plasma collection stations. A majority of our plasma collection stations recorded increases in plasma collection volume in 2016 as compared to 2015.
 
Plasma sourced from Xinjiang Deyuan
 
We purchased approximately 143 tonnes of source plasma and plasma pastes from Xinjiang Deyuan Bioengineering Co., Ltd., or Xinjiang Deyuan, for a total consideration of approximately RMB139 million (approximately US$20.0 million) in 2015. The final products made from such raw materials were fully released into the market by the first half of 2016.
 
We entered into a cooperation agreement with Xinjiang Deyuan and its controlling shareholder in August 2015, pursuant to which Xinjiang Deyuan agreed to sell to us no less than 500 tonnes of source plasma in batches from August 2015 to August 2018. As required and approved by the local regulator, all plasma used for production must be able to be traced to plasma collection stations, and therefore, we monitor the quality of the plasma collection process at Xinjiang Deyuan. We purchased approximately 210.7 tonnes of source plasma from Xinjiang Deyuan in 2016, which was 17.8% more than the expected volume according to the agreement as of December 31, 2016. The final products made from this plasma began to be released to the market from the fourth quarter of 2016. Our transactions with Xinjiang Deyuan will provide us a significant volume of additional raw material over the contracted period and enable us to efficiently enhance our production capacity utilization and supply more plasma products to satisfy growing market demand.
 
Other raw materials and packaging materials
 
Other raw materials used in the production of our biopharmaceutical products include reagents and consumables such as filters and alcohol. The principal packaging materials we use include glass bottles for our injection products as well as external packaging and printed instructions for our biopharmaceutical products. We acquire our raw materials and packaging materials from our approved suppliers in China and overseas. We select our suppliers based on quality, consistency, price and delivery of the raw materials which they supply.
 
Our five largest suppliers for other raw materials and packaging materials in the aggregate accounted for approximately 42.5%, 36.2% and 30.2% of our total procurement for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. We have not experienced any shortage of supply or significant quality issue with respect to any raw materials and packaging materials.
 
Plasma Collection
 
Our plasma collection stations purchase, collect, examine and deepfreeze plasma on behalf of Shandong Taibang and Guizhou Taibang and are subject to provincial health bureau’s rules, regulations and specifications for quality, packaging and storage. Each station is only allowed to collect plasma from healthy donors within its respective districts and in accordance with a time table set by its respective parent company, Shandong Taibang or Guizhou Taibang. The plasma must be tested negative for HBsAb, HCV and HIV antibodies and the RPR test, contain ALT 25 units (ALT) and plasma protein 55g/l, and contain no virus pollution or visible erythrolysis, lipemia, macroscopic red blood cell or any other irregular finding. The plasma is packaged in 25 to 30 separate 600g bags in each box and then stored at a temperature of -20°C or lower within limited time after collection to ensure that it will congeal within six hours. Each bag is labeled with a computer-generated tracking code. Shandong Taibang and Guizhou Taibang are responsible for the overall technical and quality supervision of the plasma collection, packaging and storage at each plasma collection station.

Sales, Marketing and Distribution
 
Because all of our products are prescription drugs, we can only sell to hospitals and inoculation centers directly or through approved distributors. For 2016, 2015 and 2014, direct sales to hospitals and inoculation centers represented approximately 61.1%, 59.0% and 65.4%, respectively, of our total plasma products sales. Our five largest customers in the aggregate accounted for approximately 15.5%, 13.0% and 14.6% of our total sales for 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Our largest customer accounted for approximately 5.4%, 4.0% and 4.2% of our total sales for 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
 
We select our distributors through a rigorous process, which focuses on market leadership in the covered region, the degree of control we have over to which hospitals our products are sold (i.e. larger and higher tiered hospitals are preferred), and the level of access we have to our customers (i.e. greater access enables us to better track the sales of our products). As part of our effort to ensure the quality of our distributors, we also conduct due diligence to verify whether potential distributors have obtained necessary permits and licenses and facilities (such as cold storage) for the distribution of our biopharmaceutical products and assess their financial condition. Certain of our regional distributors are appointed on an exclusive basis within a specified geographic territory. Our supply contracts set out the quantity and price of products to be supplied by us. For distributors, our contracts also contain guidelines for the sale and distribution of our products, including restrictions on the geographical territory in which the products may be sold. We provide our distributors with training in relation to our products and on sales techniques. We generally require our distributors to pay in advance before we deliver products, with a few exceptions for a credit period of no longer than 60 days to major distributors in tier-one cities. For hospitals and clinics, we generally grant a credit period of no longer than 90 days, with exceptions to certain high credit-worthy customers of up to six months. For 2016, 2015 and 2014, we had not incurred any significant bad debts from our customers.
 
Our largest geographic market is Shandong Province, representing approximately 24.3%, 23.2% and 23.9% of our total sales for 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Jiangsu Province is our second largest geographic market, representing 10.0%, 10.0% and 9.3% of our total sales for 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. In addition to Shandong Province and Guizhou Province, we also have sales presence in 28 other provinces, municipalities and autonomous regions.
 
As of December 31, 2016, our marketing and after-sales services department consisted of 114 employees.
 
We believe that due to the nature of our products, our competitiveness centers on product safety, steady supply, brand recognition, timely availability and pricing. As all of our products are prescription medicines, we are not allowed to advertise our products in the mass media. For 2016, 2015 and 2014, total sales and marketing expenses amounted to approximately $11.7 million, $10.0 million and $10.7 million, respectively, representing approximately 3.4%, 3.4% and 4.4%, respectively, of our total sales.

Our Research and Development Efforts
 
Each of Shandong Taibang and Guizhou Taibang has its own research and development department. All of our research and development researchers hold degrees in medicine, pharmacy, biology, biochemistry or other relevant fields. Our research and development departments are responsible for the development and registration of our products. We also cooperate with a number of leading institutions in China specializing in plasma products to strengthen our research and development capacity.
 
We employ a market driven approach to initiate research and development projects, including both product and production technique development. We believe that the key to our industry’s developments is the safety of products and maximizing the yield per unit volume of plasma. Our research and development efforts are focused on the following areas:
 

· | broaden the breadth and depth of our portfolio of plasma products;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------


· | enhance the yield per unit volume of plasma through new fractionation techniques;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | maximize manufacturing efficiency and safety;
--+----------------------------------------------


· | promote product safety through implementation of new technologies; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------


· | refine production technology for existing products.
--+----------------------------------------------------



All the products we currently manufacture have been developed in-house. The following table outlines our research and development work in progress:
 

Products Currently in Development | Treatment/Use | Status of Product Development | Stage*
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+-------

For 2016, 2015 and 2014, total research and development expenses amounted to approximately $7.0 million, $6.0 million and $4.2 million, respectively, representing approximately 2.1%, 2.0% and 1.7%, respectively, of our total sales.
 
Competition
 
We face intense competition. There are both local and overseas pharmaceutical enterprises that engage in the manufacture and sale of potential substitutes or similar biopharmaceutical products as our products in China. These competitors may have more capital, better research and development resources, and stronger manufacturing and marketing capabilities than we do. In our industry, we compete based upon product quality, production cost, ability to produce a diverse range of products and logistical capabilities.
 
Our profitability may be adversely affected if competition intensifies, competitors reduce prices, regulators promulgate or strengthen regulations that have the effect of controlling the prices of our products, or competitors develop new products or product substitutes with comparable medicinal applications or therapeutic effects that are more effective or less costly than ours.
 
There are approximately 30 approved manufacturers of plasma products in China of which approximately 28 are currently in operation. Many of these manufacturers are essentially producing the same type of products that we produce, including human albumin and various types of immunoglobulin. We believe, however, that it is difficult for new manufacturers to enter into the industry due to current regulatory barrier. We believe that our major competitors in China include CNBG, Hualan, Shanghai RAAS Blood Products Co., Ltd., Sichuan Yuanda Shuyang Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., Shanxi Kangbao Biological Product Co., Ltd., and Jiangxi Boya Bio Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd.
 
In addition, we also face competition from imported products where allowed. China became a member of the World Trade Organization in December 2001 and as a result imported biopharmaceutical products enjoy lower tariffs. Since 2009, China has experienced a substantial increase in volume of imported human albumin. If the import of human albumin continues to increase, we may face more fierce competition in the domestic human albumin market.
 
Based on our industry knowledge, we are among the top three plasma products manufacturer in China in terms of 2016 sales revenue. To solidify our market position, we have expanded our product portfolio to include coagulation factor products, such as factor VIII and human prothrombin complex concentrate, or PCC. For factor VIII, we obtained the manufacturing approval certificate and the GMP certification for production facility from the CFDA in 2012. For PCC, we obtained the manufacturing approval certificate in July 2013 and the GMP certification for the production facility in March 2014.
 
We will continue to meet challenges and secure our market position by enhancing our existing products, introducing new products to meet customer demand, delivering quality products to our customers in a timely manner and maintaining our established industry reputation.
 
Our Intellectual Property
 
We held 59 issued patents and 10 pending patent applications in China for certain manufacturing processes and packing designs as of December 31, 2016. We also had eight registered trademarks in China as of December 31, 2016.
 
In addition, we had registered three domain names as of December 31, 2016, namely, www.chinabiologic.com, www.ctbb.com.cn and www.taibanggz.com.

Regulation
 
Set forth below is a summary of the major PRC regulations relating to our business.
 
Due to the nature of our products, we are supervised by various levels of the NHFPC and/or CFDA. Such supervision includes the safety standards regulating our raw material supplies (mainly plasma), our manufacturing process and our finished products.
 
We are also subject to other PRC regulations, including those relating to taxation, foreign currency exchange and dividend distributions.
 
Plasma collection
 
Plasma collection stations are commonly used to collect plasma in China and substantially all plasma donations for commercialized plasma products are made at plasma collection stations. Plasma donation means that donors give only plasma but not the other blood components such as platelets, red cells and infection-fighting white cells. In China, current regulations only allow an individual donor to donate plasma in 14-day intervals, with a maximum quantity of 580ml (or about 600 gram) per donation.
 
The following are the general regulatory requirements to establish a plasma collection station in China:
 

· | meet the overall plan in terms of the total number, distribution, and operational scale of plasma collection stations;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | have the required professional health care technicians to operate a station;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | have the facility and a hygienic environment to operate a station;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------


· | have an identification system to identify donors;
--+--------------------------------------------------


· | have the equipment to operate a station; and
--+---------------------------------------------


· | have the equipment and quality control technicians to ensure the quality of the plasma collected.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Plasma collection stations were historically owned and managed by the PRC health authorities. In March 2006, the NHFPC and other eight central governmental departments of the PRC State Council promulgated the Measures for the Reform of Blood Collection Stations whereby the ownership and management of the plasma collection stations are required to be transferred to plasma-based biopharmaceutical companies while the regulatory supervision and administrative control remain with the government. As a result, all plasma collection stations are now having direct supply relationship with their parent fractionation facilities.
 
Set out below are some of the safety features at China’s plasma collection stations:
 

· | Plasma collection stations can only source plasma from donors that are the local residents within the assigned districts approved by the provincial health authorities.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Plasma collection stations must perform a health check on the donor. Once the donor passes the health check, a “donor permit” is issued to the donor. The standards of the health check are established by the health authorities at the PRC State Council level.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


19
--


· | The designing and printing of the “donor permit” is administrated by the provincial health authorities, autonomous region or municipality government, as the case maybe. The “donor permit” cannot be altered, copied or assigned.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Before donors can donate plasma, the station must verify their identities and the validity of their “donor permits.” The donors must pass the verification procedures before they are given a health check and blood test. For those donors who have passed the verification, health check and blood test and whose plasma were donated according to prescribed procedures, the station will set up a record.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Collected plasma which passes quality testing cannot be used to produce plasma products until its donor donates again after a 90-day quarantine period and the subsequently donated plasma passes quality testing as well.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | All plasma collection stations are subject to the regulations on the prevention of communicable diseases. They must strictly adhere to the sanitary requirements and reporting procedures in the event of an epidemic situation.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



The operation of plasma collection stations is subject to stringent regulations by the PRC government. We estimate that there were approximately 209 plasma collection stations in operation in China as of December 31, 2016.
 
Importation of plasma products
 
According to current PRC regulations, except for human albumin and recombinant factor VIII products, all the plasma products are banned from importation into China.
 
Production of plasma products
 
The manufacture and sale of plasma products are subject to stringent regulations by the PRC government. Under PRC law, each variation in the packaging, dosage and concentration of medical products requires separate registration and approval by the CFDA before it may be commercially available for sale. For example, among our human albumin products, only human albumin 20%/10ml, 20%/25ml, 20%/50ml, 10%/100ml, 10%/20ml, 10%/50ml, 25%/50ml and 20%/50ml (10g, from factor IV) products have been approved and are commercially available. All references in this report to our manufacture and sale of human albumin relate to our approved human albumin products.
 
The table below illustrates the PRC approval process for the manufacture and sale of new medicines:
 

Stage | | Activities 
------+-----------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------
1 | Pre-clinical Research | The pre-clinical research stage mainly involves the following steps:
 | | · | initiate the research project, study the project feasibility and develop a plan for testing and producing the new medicine; 
 | | · | develop the scope and the techniques for testing the new medicine in the laboratory; 
 | | · | develop laboratory-scale manufacturing process for the new medicine; 
 | | · | develop the manufacturing process for the new medicine on an expanded basis in the workshop; and 
 | | · | develop the virus inactivation process/techniques, engage qualified institution to assess the virus inactivation process/techniques, and report the related documents to the related government authority for re-assessment.

2 | Clinical trial application | The clinical trial application stage mainly involves the following steps: 
--+----------------------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 | | · | submit required sample products and documents to The PFDA. The PFDA will perform an on-site examination on the documents and equipment, and then transfer all the required materials to the CFDA, who will further review the documents and test the sample products; 
 | | · | submit a draft clinical trial program to the CFDA for the application of the clinical trial; and 
 | | · | obtain approval of the clinical trial. 
3 | Clinical trials | Clinical trials range from Phase I to IV: 
 | | · | Phase I: preliminary trial of clinical pharmacology and human safety evaluation studies. The primary objective is to observe the pharmacokinetics and the tolerance level of the human body to the new medicine as a basis for ascertaining the appropriate delivery methods or dosage. 
 | | · | Phase II: preliminary exploration on the therapeutic efficacy. The purpose is to assess preliminarily the efficacy and safety of the new medicine on patients and to provide the basis for designing dosage tests in phase III. 
 | | · | Phase III: confirm the therapeutic efficacy. The objective is to further verify the efficacy and safety of the new medicine on patients, to evaluate the benefits and risks and finally to provide sufficient experimental evidence to support the registration application of the new medicine. 
 | | · | Phase VI: application research conducted after the launch of a new medicine. The objective is to observe the efficacy and adverse reaction of the new medicine under extensive use, to perform an evaluation of the benefits and risks of the application among ordinary or special group of patients, and to ascertain and optimize the appropriate dosage and formula for application.
4 | Registration | The registration stage mainly involves the following steps: 
 | | · | submit documents related to pre-clinical and clinical trials to the PFDA, which will perform on-site inspection on the clinical trials and then transfer the related documents to the CFDA for further review; 
 | | · | receive on-site inspection by the CFDA on three consecutive sample productions at the production facilities; 
 | | · | obtain the manufacturing approval certificate following the public notification period; and 
 | | · | obtain the GMP certificate following the public notification period. 
5 | Production and approval for sale | The production and approval for sale stage mainly involves the following steps:
 | | · | produce the approved products in qualified facilities with requisite GMP certificates; 
 | | · | submit documentation and samples of mass production products to the CFDA for inspection; and 
 | | · | obtain qualification certificate to mass production products for sale on a batch-by-batch basis. 

 
New GMP standard
 
All of our production facilities are required to obtain GMP certificates for their pharmaceutical production activities. In February 2011, the CFDA enacted the new GMP standard, which has significantly increased standards for quality control, documentation, and overall manufacturing processes of blood products, vaccines, injections and other sterile pharmaceutical products. The new GMP standard requires us to, among others, maintain and operate a comprehensive and effective product quality control system throughout the production process. In addition, it imposes higher standards for our production facilities. The new GMP standard became applicable to all of our production facilities at the end of 2013. Following the upgrades on our production facilities, we obtained the renewed GMP certificate for Shandong Taibang and Guizhou Taibang in June 2013 and March 2014, respectively. Huitian obtained the GMP certificate from the CFDA for its new plasma production facility in February 2016 and commenced commercial production thereafter.

Pricing
 
Prior to June 1, 2015, retail prices of certain pharmaceutical products were subject to various price-related regulations. According to the “Regulations on Controlling Blood Products” promulgated by the PRC State Council in 1996, regional offices of the Pricing Bureau and the NHFPC had the authority to regulate retail prices for controlled plasma products. Effective on June 1, 2015, the NDRC removed the retail price ceilings for all drug products (except for anesthetics and category I antipsychotics) in China. See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our Business— We do not have discretion to increase the prices of certain of our products, which are subject to the regional government tendering mechanism.”
 
After the pricing ceiling was removed, the pricing of pharmaceutical products are mainly subject to the provincial tendering mechanism. In 2016, 31 provinces/regions/municipalities in China initiated a new round of tenders with different tender rules, including the followings trends: 1) a combination of Essential Drug List (“EDL”) tenders and non-EDL tenders; 2) a dynamic pricing system across different provinces; 3) volume-based procurement; 4) different tender mechanisms based on product types; 5) various implementation timelines; 6) group purchase organization (“GPO”) in certain regions. For our plasma products, tetanus immunoglobulin, Factor VIII and PCC are included on the life-saving EDL in most Chinese provinces, for which drug procurement was prioritized and the hospitals are allowed to directly purchase drugs from manufacturers through an on-line procurement process. For products like albumin and IVIG, most provinces adopted regular tendering process that requires manufacturers to compete with other suppliers in both quality and price. To date, most provinces have not completed the tendering. We expect that most of the provinces, which accounted for the majority of our product sales, will finish their tenders in the first half of 2017. Even after the official tendering, there might be post-tender negotiations. Tenders across different provinces with on-line price disclosure will help narrow the differences in tenders among different provinces and make the practice more uniform across the country, which will increase the price pressure since provinces intend to benchmark to the lowest nationwide prices.
 
In addition, retail prices of pharmaceutical products fully or partially covered under the national insurance system are also affected by the reimbursement ceilings set out in the National Drug Reimbursement List, or the NDRL, which may be adjusted by the NDRC from time to time. The new edition of NDRL was launched on February 21, 2017. The hospitals as participants of the national insurance program are pressured not to sell the products to patients at prices substantially exceeding such reimbursement ceilings. This in turn puts pressure on the manufacturers’ pricing of the relevant products. Seven of our principal products (namely human albumin, IVIG, human rabies immunoglobulin, human tetanus immunoglobulin, factor VIII, PCC and human immunoglobulin) are included in the NDRL. Two other principal products (namely placenta polypeptide and human hepatitis B immunoglobulin), although not included in the NDRL, are also subject to tender and drug reimburse list in certain provinces.

Taxation
 
On March 16, 2007, the National People’s Congress of China passed the Enterprise Income Tax Law, or the EIT Law, and on November 28, 2007, the PRC State Council passed its implementation rules, which became effective on January 1, 2008. The EIT Law and its implementation rules impose a unified EIT of 25.0% on all domestic-invested enterprises and foreign investment enterprises, or FIEs, unless they qualify under certain limited exceptions.
 
In addition to the changes to the tax structure, under the EIT Law, an enterprise established outside of China with “de facto management bodies” within China is considered a resident enterprise and will normally be subject to an EIT of 25.0% on its global income. The implementation rules define the term “de facto management bodies” as “an establishment that exercises, in substance, overall management and control over, among others, the production, business, recruitment and accounting aspects of a Chinese enterprise.” If the PRC tax authorities subsequently determine that we should be classified as a resident enterprise, then our global income will be subject to PRC income tax of 25%. For detailed discussion of PRC tax issues related to resident enterprise status, see “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Doing Business in China—Under the Enterprise Income Tax Law, we may be classified as a “resident enterprise” of China. Such classification will likely result in unfavorable tax consequences to us and our non-PRC stockholders.”
 
The EIT Law confirmed that qualified high and new technology enterprises may enjoy a preferential income tax rate of 15%, instead of the uniform enterprise income tax rate of 25%. The PRC Ministry of Science and Technology, the PRC Ministry of Finance and the State Administration of Taxation, or SAT, jointly promulgated the Measures for Determination of High and New Technology Enterprise on August 14, 2008 to provide the detailed rules for the examination of qualifications and approval of certificates for high and new technology enterprises. Each high and new technology enterprise certificate is valid for three years. Shandong Taibang was recognized by Shandong provincial government as a high and new technology enterprise in 2008 and renewed the certificate in 2011, as a result of which Shandong Taibang was entitled to enjoy a preferential income tax rate of 15.0% until the end of 2013. In October 2014, Shandong Taibang renewed the high and new technology enterprise certificate, which entitled it to enjoy a preferential income tax rate of 15.0% for a period of three years from 2014 to 2016. Shandong Taibang will apply for a renewal for an additional three years from 2017 to 2019 upon the expiration of such certificate.
 
According to Notice on Issues Concerning Relevant Tax Policies in Deepening the Implementation of the Western Development Strategy jointly promulgated by the PRC Ministry of Finance, the PRC General Administration of Customs and SAT on July 27, 2011, enterprises located in the western region of China which have at least 70.0% of their income from the businesses falling within the Category of Encouraged Industries in western region of China may enjoy a preferential income tax of 15.0% within the period from January 1, 2011 to December 31, 2020. Guizhou Taibang, being a qualified enterprise located in the western region of China, enjoys a preferential income tax rate of 15.0% effective from January 1, 2011 to December 31, 2020.
 
Foreign currency exchange
 
The principal regulation governing foreign currency exchange in China is the Foreign Currency Administration Rules (1996), as amended (2008). Under these rules, RMB is freely convertible for current account items, such as trade and service-related foreign exchange transactions, but not for capital account items, such as direct investment, loan or investment in securities outside China unless the prior approval of, and/or registration with, the State Administration of Foreign Exchange, or SAFE, or its local counterparts (as the case may be) is obtained.

Pursuant to the Foreign Currency Administration Rules, FIEs in China may purchase foreign currency without the approval of SAFE for trade and service-related foreign exchange transactions by providing commercial documents evidencing these transactions. They may also retain foreign exchange (subject to a cap approved by SAFE) to satisfy foreign exchange liabilities or to pay dividends. In addition, if a foreign company acquires a company in China, the acquired company will also become an FIE. However, the relevant PRC government authorities may limit or eliminate the ability of FIEs to purchase and retain foreign currencies in the future. In addition, foreign exchange transactions for direct investment, loan and investment in securities outside China are still subject to limitations and require approvals from, and/or registration with, SAFE.
 
Dividend distributions
 
Under applicable PRC regulations, FIEs in China may pay dividends only out of their accumulated profits, if any, determined in accordance with PRC accounting standards and regulations. In addition, an FIE in China is required to set aside at least 10% of its after-tax profit based on PRC accounting standards each year to its general reserves until the accumulative amount of such reserves reach 50% of its registered capital. These reserves are not distributable as cash dividends. The board of directors of an FIE also has the discretion to allocate a portion of its after-tax profits to staff welfare and bonus funds, which may not be distributed to equity owners except in the event of liquidation.
 
In addition, under the EIT law, the Notice of the State Administration of Taxation on Negotiated Reduction of Dividends and Interest Rates, promulgated on January 29, 2008, the Arrangement between the PRC and the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region on the Avoidance of Double Taxation and Prevention of Fiscal Evasion, or the Double Taxation Treaty, which became effective on December 8, 2006, and the Notice of the State Administration of Taxation Regarding Interpretation and Recognition of Beneficial Owners under Tax Treaties, which became effective on October 27, 2009, dividends from our PRC subsidiary, Taibang Biotech (Shandong) Co., Ltd., paid to us through our Hong Kong subsidiary, Taibang Holdings, may be subject to a withholding tax at a rate of 10%, or at a rate of 5% if Taibang Holdings is considered a “beneficial owner” that is generally engaged in substantial business activities in Hong Kong and entitled to treaty benefits under the Double Taxation Treaty.
