Item 1.    Business
Protective Life Corporation (the "Company") is a holding company headquartered in Birmingham, Alabama, with subsidiaries that provide financial services primarily in the United States through the production, distribution, and administration of insurance and investment products. Founded in 1907, Protective Life Insurance Company ("PLICO") is the Company's largest operating subsidiary. Unless the context otherwise requires, the "Company," "we," "us," or "our" refers to the consolidated group of Protective Life Corporation and its subsidiaries.
On February 1, 2015, The Dai-ichi Life Insurance Company, Limited, a kabushiki kaisha organized under the laws of Japan (now known as Dai-ichi Life Holdings, Inc., "Dai-ichi Life"), acquired 100% of the Company's outstanding shares of common stock through the merger of DL Investment (Delaware), Inc., a Delaware corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of Dai-ichi Life, with and into the Company, with the Company continuing as the surviving entity (the "Merger"). As a result of the Merger, the Company is a direct, wholly owned subsidiary of Dai-ichi Life.
The Company operates several operating segments, each having a strategic focus. An operating segment is distinguished by products, channels of distribution, and/or other strategic distinctions. The Company's operating segments are Life Marketing, Acquisitions, Annuities, Stable Value Products, and Asset Protection. The Company has an additional segment referred to as Corporate and Other which consists of net investment income on assets supporting our equity capital, unallocated corporate overhead, and expenses not attributable to the segments above (including interest on certain corporate debt). This segment also includes earnings from several non-strategic or runoff lines of business, financing and investment related transactions, and the operations of several small subsidiaries. The Company periodically evaluates its operating segments and makes adjustments to our segment reporting as needed.
Additional information concerning the Company and its operating segments may be found in Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, and Note 22, Operating Segments to the consolidated financial statements included in this report.
In the following paragraphs, the Company reports sales and other statistical information. These statistics are used to measure the relative progress of its marketing and acquisition efforts, but may not have an immediate impact on reported segment or consolidated adjusted operating income. Sales data for traditional life insurance is based on annualized premiums, while universal life sales are based on annualized planned premiums, or "target" premiums if lesser, plus 6% of amounts received in excess of target premiums and 10% of single premiums. "Target" premiums for universal life are those premiums upon which full first year commissions are paid. Sales of annuities are measured based on the amount of purchase payments received less surrenders occurring within twelve months of the purchase payments. Stable value contract sales are measured at the time the purchase payments are received. Sales within the Asset Protection segment are based on the amount of single premiums and fees received.
These statistics are derived from various sales tracking and administrative systems and are not derived from the Company's financial reporting systems or financial statements. These statistics attempt to measure only some of the many factors that may affect future profitability, and therefore, are not intended to be predictive of future profitability.
Life Marketing
The Life Marketing segment markets fixed universal life ("UL"), indexed universal life ("IUL"), variable universal life ("VUL"), bank-owned life insurance ("BOLI"), and level premium term insurance ("traditional") products on a national basis, primarily through networks of independent insurance agents and brokers, broker-dealers, financial institutions, independent distribution organizations, and affinity groups.
The following table presents the Life Marketing segment's sales as defined above:

Acquisitions
The Acquisitions segment focuses on acquiring, converting, and servicing policies and contracts from other companies. The segment's primary focus is on life insurance policies and annuity products that were sold to individuals. The level of the segment's acquisition activity is predicated upon many factors, including available capital, operating capacity, potential return on capital, and market dynamics. The Company expects acquisition opportunities to continue to be available. However, the Company believes it may face increased competition and evolving capital requirements that may affect the environment and the form of future acquisitions.
Most acquisitions completed by the Acquisitions segment have not included the acquisition of an active sales force, thus policies acquired through the segment are typically blocks of business where no new policies are being marketed. Therefore, earnings and account values are expected to decline as the result of lapses, deaths, and other terminations of coverage, unless new acquisitions are made. The segment's revenues and earnings may fluctuate from year to year depending upon the level of acquisition activity. In transactions where some marketing activity was included, the Company may cease future marketing efforts, redirect those efforts to another segment of the Company, or elect to continue marketing new policies as a component of other segments.
The Company believes that its focused and disciplined approach to the acquisition process and its experience in the assimilation, conservation, and servicing of acquired policies provides a significant competitive advantage. On occasion, the Company's other operating segments have acquired companies and/or blocks of policies, such as the December 2016 acquisition of USWC Holding Company which is included in the Asset Protection segment. These acquisitions are not included in the Acquisitions segment. The results of these acquisitions are included in the respective segment's financial results.
On January 18, 2018, and for the limited purposes set forth therein, the Company entered into a Master Transaction Agreement (the "Master Transaction Agreement") with Liberty Mutual Insurance Company, Liberty Mutual Fire Insurance Company, for the limited purposes set forth therein, Liberty Mutual Group Inc. ("Liberty Mutual"), The Lincoln National Life Insurance Company ("Lincoln Life"), and for the limited purposes set forth therein, Lincoln National Corporation, pursuant to which Lincoln Life will acquire Liberty Mutual's Group Benefits Business and Individual Life and Annuity Business (the "Life Business") through the acquisition of all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of Liberty Life Assurance Company of Boston ("Liberty") (the "Transaction"). Pursuant to the Master Transaction Agreement, the Company, PLICO and Protective Life and Annuity Insurance Company ("PLAIC"), a wholly owned subsidiary of PLICO, agreed to enter into reinsurance agreements and related ancillary documents at the closing of the Transaction. On the terms and subject to the conditions of the reinsurance agreements, Liberty will cede to PLICO and PLAIC, effective as of the closing of the Transaction, substantially all of the insurance policies relating to the Life Business. The aggregate statutory reserves of Liberty to be ceded to PLICO and PLAIC as of the closing of the Transaction are expected to be approximately $13.0 billion. To support its obligations under the reinsurance agreements, PLICO and PLAIC will each establish a trust account for the benefit of Lincoln Life. Entry into the reinsurance agreements represents an estimated capital investment by PLICO of approximately $1.17 billion. The transaction is expected to be completed in the second quarter of 2018, pending regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions.
On January 15, 2016, PLICO completed a reinsurance transaction with Genworth Life and Annuity Insurance Company (“GLAIC”). Effective January 1, 2016, PLICO entered into a reinsurance agreement under the terms of which PLICO coinsures certain term life insurance business of GLAIC. This transaction allowed the Company to invest its capital and increase the scale of its Acquisitions segment. 
Annuities
The Annuities segment markets fixed and variable annuity ("VA") products. These products are primarily sold through broker-dealers, financial institutions, and independent agents and brokers.
The Company's variable annuities offer the policyholder the opportunity to invest in various investment accounts and offer optional features that guarantee the death and withdrawal benefits of the underlying annuity.
The Company's fixed annuities include indexed annuities, single premium deferred annuities, and single premium immediate annuities. The Company's fixed annuities also include modified guaranteed annuities which guarantee an interest rate for a fixed period. Contract values for these annuities are "market-value adjusted" upon surrender prior to maturity. In certain interest rate environments, these products afford the Company with a measure of protection from the effects of changes in interest rates.

The demand for annuity products is related to the general level of interest rates, performance of the equity markets, and perceived risk of insurance companies. The following table presents fixed annuity and VA sales:

Successor Company

2013 | 693 | | | 1,867 | | | 2,560

Stable Value Products
The Stable Value Products segment sells fixed and floating rate funding agreements directly to the trustees of municipal bond proceeds, money market funds, bank trust departments, and other institutional investors. The segment also issues funding agreements to the Federal Home Loan Bank ("FHLB") and markets guaranteed investment contracts ("GICs") to 401(k) and other qualified retirement savings plans. GICs are contracts which specify a return on funds for a specified period and often provide flexibility for withdrawals at book value in keeping with the benefits provided by the plan. The demand for GICs is related to the relative attractiveness of the "fixed rate" investment option in a 401(k) plan compared to the equity-based investment options which may be available to plan participants. The Company also has an unregistered funding agreement-backed notes program which provides for offers of notes to both domestic and international institutional investors.
The segment's products complement the Company's overall asset/liability management in that the terms may be tailored to the needs of PLICO as the seller of the contracts. The Company's emphasis is on a consistent and disciplined approach to product pricing and asset/liability management, careful underwriting of early withdrawal risks, and maintaining low distribution and administration costs. Most GICs and funding agreements the Company has written have maturities of one to twelve years.

Asset Protection
The Asset Protection segment markets extended service contracts, credit life and disability insurance, and other specialized ancillary products to protect consumers' investments in automobiles, recreational vehicles ("RV"), watercraft, and powersports. In addition, the segment markets a guaranteed asset protection ("GAP") product. GAP products are designed to cover the difference between the scheduled loan pay-off amount and an asset's actual cash value in the case of a total loss. Each type of specialized ancillary product protects against damage or other loss to a particular aspect of the underlying asset. The segment's products are primarily marketed through a national network of approximately 8,500 automobile, marine, and RV dealers. A network of direct employee sales representatives and general agents distribute these products to the dealer market.
The following table presents the insurance and related product sales measured by the amount of single premiums and fees received:

Successor Company 
For The Year Ended December 31, | Sales 
 | (Dollars In Millions)
2017 | $ | 584
2016 | 504 | 
For the period of February 1, 2015 to December 31, 2015 | 482 |

2013 | 470 | 

In 2017, all of the segment's sales were through the automobile, RV, marine, and powersports dealer distribution channel and approximately 78.6% of the segment's sales were extended service contracts. A portion of the sales and resulting premiums are reinsured with producer-affiliated reinsurers.
Corporate and Other
The Corporate and Other segment primarily consists of net investment income on assets supporting our equity capital, unallocated corporate overhead, and expenses not attributable to the segments above (including interest on corporate debt). This segment includes earnings from several non-strategic or runoff lines of business, financing and investment related transactions, and the operations of several small subsidiaries. The results of this segment may fluctuate from year to year.

Investments
As of December 31, 2017 (Successor Company), the Company's investment portfolio was approximately $54.6 billion. The types of assets in which the Company may invest are influenced by various state insurance laws which prescribe qualified investment assets. Within the parameters of these laws, the Company invests in assets giving consideration to such factors as liquidity and capital needs, investment quality, investment return, matching of assets and liabilities, and the overall composition of the investment portfolio by asset type and credit exposure. On February 1, 2015, immediately before the Merger, the fair value of the Company's investment portfolio was significantly above the carrying value primarily due to low market interest rates. As a result of purchase accounting applied as of February 1, 2015, the carrying value of the Company's investment portfolio was adjusted to fair value which resulted in a drop in the overall yield of the Company's investment portfolio for the successor period. For further information regarding the Company's investments, the maturity of and the concentration of risk among the Company's invested assets, derivative financial instruments, and liquidity, see Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, Note 5, Investment Operations, and Note 7, Derivative Financial Instruments to the consolidated financial statements included in this report, and Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.

Mortgage Loans
The Company invests a portion of its investment portfolio in commercial mortgage loans. As of December 31, 2017 (Successor Company), the Company's mortgage loan holdings were approximately $6.8 billion. The Company has specialized in making loans on credit-oriented commercial properties, credit-anchored strip shopping centers, senior living facilities, and apartments. The Company's underwriting procedures relative to its commercial loan portfolio are based, in the Company's view, on a conservative and disciplined approach. The Company concentrates on a small number of commercial real estate asset types associated with the necessities of life (retail, multi-family, senior living, professional office buildings, and warehouses). The Company believes these asset types tend to weather economic downturns better than other commercial asset classes in which it has chosen not to participate. The Company believes this disciplined approach has helped to maintain a relatively low delinquency and foreclosure rate throughout its history. The majority of the Company's mortgage loan portfolio was underwritten and funded by the Company. From time to time, the Company may acquire loans in conjunction with an acquisition.

Ratings
Various Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organizations ("rating organizations") review the financial performance and condition of insurers, including our insurance subsidiaries, and publish their financial strength ratings as indicators of an insurer's ability to meet policyholder and contract holder obligations. These ratings are important to maintaining public confidence in an insurer's products, its ability to market its products and its competitive position. The following table summarizes the current financial strength ratings of our significant member companies from the major independent rating organizations:

Ratings | A.M. Best | Fitch | Standard &Poor's | Moody's
Insurance company financial strength rating: | | | | 
Protective Life Insurance Company | A+ | A+ | AA- | A1 
West Coast Life Insurance Company | A+ | A+ | AA- | A1 
Protective Life and Annuity Insurance Company | A+ | A+ | AA- | — 
Protective Property & Casualty Insurance Company | A- | — | — | — 
MONY Life Insurance Company | A+ | A+ | A+ | A1 

The Company's ratings are subject to review and change by the rating organizations at any time and without notice. A downgrade or other negative action by a ratings organization with respect to the financial strength ratings of the Company's insurance subsidiaries could adversely affect sales, relationships with distributors, the level of policy surrenders and withdrawals, the Company's acquisitions strategy or competitive position in the marketplace, and the cost or availability of reinsurance. The rating agencies may take various actions, positive or negative, with respect to the financial strength ratings of the Company's insurance subsidiaries, including as a result of the Company's status as a subsidiary of Dai-ichi Life.
Rating organizations also publish credit ratings for the issuers of debt securities, including the Company. Credit ratings are indicators of a debt issuer's ability to meet the terms of debt obligations in a timely manner. These ratings are important in the debt issuer's overall ability to access credit markets and other types of liquidity. Ratings are not recommendations to buy the Company's securities or products. A downgrade or other negative action by a ratings organization with respect to our credit rating could limit the Company's access to capital markets, increase the cost of issuing debt, and a downgrade of sufficient magnitude, combined with other negative factors, could require the Company to post collateral. The rating organizations may take various actions, positive or negative, with respect to the Company's debt ratings, including as a result of the Company's status as a subsidiary of Dai-ichi Life.

Underwriting
The underwriting policies of the Company's insurance subsidiaries are established by management. With respect to individual insurance, the subsidiaries use information from the application, and in some cases, third party medical information providers, inspection reports, credit reports, attending physician statements and/or the results of a medical exam, to determine whether a policy should be issued as applied for, other than applied for, or rejected. Substandard risks may be referred to reinsurers for evaluation. The Company does utilize a "simplified issue" approach for certain policies which are primarily sold through the Asset Protection segment. In the case of "simplified issue" policies, coverage is rejected if the responses to certain health questions contained in the application, or the applicant's inability to make an unqualified health certification, indicate adverse health of the applicant. 
The Company's insurance subsidiaries generally require blood samples to be drawn with individual insurance applications above certain face amounts based on the applicant's age. Blood samples are tested for a wide range of chemical values and are screened for antibodies to certain viruses. Applications also contain questions permitted by law regarding certain viruses which must be answered by the proposed insureds. 
The Company utilizes an advanced underwriting system, TeleLife®, for certain product lines in life business. TeleLife® streamlines the application process through a telephonic interview of the applicant, schedules medical exams, accelerates the underwriting process and the ultimate issuance of a policy mostly through electronic means, and reduces the number of attending physician statements. The Company also introduced a streamlined underwriting approach that utilizes the TeleLife® process and noninvasive risk selection tools to approve some applications without requiring a paramedical exam or lab testing. 
The Company's maximum retention limit on directly issued business is $5,000,000 for any one life on certain of its traditional life and universal life products.
Reinsurance Ceded
The Company's insurance subsidiaries cede life insurance to other insurance companies. The ceding insurance company remains liable with respect to ceded insurance should any reinsurer fail to meet the obligations assumed by it. The Company has also reinsured guaranteed minimum death benefit ("GMDB") claims relative to certain of its VA contracts.
For approximately 10 years prior to mid-2005, the Company entered into reinsurance contracts in which the Company ceded approximately 90% of its newly written traditional life insurance business on a first dollar quota share basis under coinsurance contracts. In mid-2005, the Company substantially discontinued coinsuring its newly written traditional life insurance and moved to yearly renewable term ("YRT") reinsurance. The amount of insurance retained by the Company on any one life on traditional life insurance was $500,000 in years prior to mid-2005. In 2005, this retention amount was increased to $1,000,000 for certain policies, and during 2008, was increased to $2,000,000 for certain policies. During 2016, the retention amount was increased to $5,000,000.
For approximately 15 years prior to 2012, the Company reinsured 90% of the mortality risk on the majority of its newly written universal life insurance on a YRT basis. During 2012, the Company moved to reinsure only amounts in excess of its $2,000,000 retention, which was increased to $5,000,000 during 2016, for the majority of its newly written universal life and level premium term insurance.
10

Policy Liabilities and Accruals
The applicable insurance laws under which the Company's insurance subsidiaries operate require that each insurance company report policy liabilities to meet future obligations on the outstanding policies. These liabilities are calculated in accordance with applicable law. These liabilities along with additional premiums to be received and the compounded interest earned on those premiums are considered to be sufficient to meet the various policy and contract obligations as they mature. These laws specify that the liabilities shall not be less than liabilities calculated using certain named mortality tables and interest rates.
The policy liabilities and accruals carried in the Company's financial reports presented on the basis of generally accepted accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP") differ from those specified by the laws of the various states and carried in the insurance subsidiaries' statutory financial statements (presented on the basis of statutory accounting principles mandated by state insurance regulations). For policy liabilities for traditional life, immediate annuity, and health contracts, these differences arise from the use of mortality and morbidity tables and interest rate assumptions which are deemed to be more appropriate for financial reporting purposes than those required for statutory accounting purposes. The GAAP policy liabilities also include lapse assumptions in the calculation and use the net level premium method on all business which generally differs from policy liabilities calculated for statutory financial statements. Policy liabilities for universal life policies, deferred annuity contracts, GICs, and funding agreements are generally carried in the Company's financial reports at the account value of the policy or contract plus accrued interest. Additional liabilities are held as appropriate for excess benefits above the account value.
Federal Taxes
In general, existing law exempts policyholders from current taxation on the increase in value of their life insurance and annuity products during these products’ accumulation phase. This favorable tax treatment gives certain of the Company's products a competitive advantage over non-insurance products. If tax laws are revised such that there is an elimination or scale-back of this tax deferral, or competing non-insurance products are granted similar tax deferrals, then the relative attractiveness of the Company's products may be reduced or eliminated.
The Company is subject to corporate income, excise, franchise, and premium taxes. On December 22, 2017, the President of the United States signed into law the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Reform Act”). The legislation significantly changes U.S. tax law by, among other things, lowering the corporate income tax rate effective January 1, 2018. The legislation is expected to result in an overall benefit for investment-related adjustments decreasing the effective tax rate and taxable income. The Company also expects an increase in taxable income, but no effect on the effective tax rate, as the result of changes in legislation regarding the capitalization of deferred acquisition costs and policyholder benefit reserves. While overall the Tax Reform Act will cause the Company to report higher amounts of taxable income, the Company expects to pay less income tax in the future due to the lower tax rate.
In addition, life insurance products are often used to fund estate tax obligations. Future changes to estate tax laws may affect the demand for life insurance products.
The Company's insurance subsidiaries are taxed in a manner similar to other life insurance companies in the industry. Certain restrictions apply to the inclusion of recently-acquired life insurance companies into the Company's consolidated income tax return. Additionally, restrictions on the amount of life insurance income that can be offset by non-life-insurance losses may cause the Company's income tax expense to increase.
The Company's decreased reliance on reinsurance for newly written traditional life products results in a net reduction of current taxes, offset by an increase in deferred taxes. The Company allocates the benefits of reduced current taxes to the Life Marketing and Acquisition segments. The profitability and competitive position of certain products is dependent on the continuation of existing tax law and the Company's ability to generate future taxable income.
Competition
Life and health insurance is a mature and highly competitive industry. In recent years, the industry has experienced a decline in life insurance sales, though the aging population has increased the demand for retirement savings products. The Company encounters significant competition in all lines of business from other insurance companies, many of which have greater financial resources than the Company and which may have a greater market share, offer a broader range of products, services or features, assume a greater level of risk, have lower operating or financing costs, or have lower profitability expectations. The Company also faces competition from other providers of financial services. Competition could result in, among other things, lower sales or higher lapses of existing products.
The Company's ability to compete is dependent upon, among other things, its ability to attract and retain distributors to market its insurance and investment products, its ability to develop competitive and profitable products, its ability to maintain low unit costs, and its maintenance of adequate ratings from rating organizations.
As technology evolves, a comparison of a particular product of any company for a particular customer with competing products for that customer is more readily available, which could lead to increased competition as well as agent or customer behavior, including persistency, which differs from past behavior.

Risk Management
Risk management is a critical part of the Company's business, and the Company has adopted risk management processes in multiple aspects of its operations, including product development and management, business acquisitions, underwriting, investment management, asset-liability management, and technology. The Company's Enterprise Risk Management office, under the direction of the Chief Risk Officer, along with other departments, management groups and committees, have responsibilities for managing different risks throughout the Company. Risk management includes the assessment of risk, a decision process which includes determining which risks are acceptable and the monitoring and management of identified risks on an ongoing basis. The primary objectives of these risk management processes are to determine the acceptable level of variations the Company experiences from its expected results and to implement strategies designed to limit such variations to these levels.
Regulation
The Company is subject to government regulation in each of the states in which it conducts business. In many instances, the regulatory models emanate from the National Association of Insurance Commissioners ("NAIC"). Such regulation is vested in state agencies having broad administrative and in some instances discretionary power dealing with many aspects of the Company's business, which may include, among other things, premium and cost of insurance rates and increases thereto, interest crediting policy, underwriting practices, reserve requirements, marketing practices, advertising, privacy, cybersecurity, policy forms, reinsurance reserve requirements, insurer use of captive reinsurance companies, acquisitions, mergers, capital adequacy, claims practices and the remittance of unclaimed property. In addition, some state insurance departments may enact rules or regulations with extra-territorial application, effectively extending their jurisdiction to areas such as permitted insurance company investments that are normally the province of an insurance company's domiciliary state regulator.
The Company's insurance subsidiaries are required to file periodic reports with the regulatory agencies in each of the jurisdictions in which they do business, and their business and accounts are subject to examination by such agencies at any time. Under the rules of the NAIC, insurance companies are examined periodically (generally every three to five years) by one or more of the regulatory agencies on behalf of the states in which they do business. At any given time, a number of financial and/or market conduct examinations of the Company's subsidiaries may be ongoing. From time to time, regulators raise issues during examinations or audits for the Company's subsidiaries that could, if determined adversely, have a material adverse impact on the Company. To date, no such insurance department examinations have produced any significant adverse findings regarding any of the Company's insurance company subsidiaries.
Under the insurance guaranty fund laws in most states, insurance companies doing business therein can be assessed up to prescribed limits for policyholder losses incurred by insolvent companies. From time to time, companies may be asked to contribute amounts beyond prescribed limits. It is possible that the Company could be assessed with respect to product lines not offered by the Company. In addition, legislation may be introduced in various states with respect to guaranty fund assessment laws related to insurance products, including long-term care insurance and other specialty products, that increases the cost of future assessments or alters future premium tax offsets received in connection with guaranty fund assessments. The Company cannot predict the amount, nature or timing of any future assessments or legislation, any of which could have a material and adverse impact on the Company's financial condition or results of operations.
In addition, many states, including the states in which the Company's insurance subsidiaries are domiciled, have enacted legislation or adopted regulations regarding insurance holding company systems. These laws require registration of and periodic reporting by insurance companies domiciled within the jurisdiction which control or are controlled by other corporations or persons so as to constitute an insurance holding company system. These laws also affect the acquisition of control of insurance companies as well as transactions between insurance companies and companies controlling them. Most states, including Tennessee, where PLICO is domiciled, require administrative approval of the acquisition of control of an insurance company domiciled in the state or the acquisition of control of an insurance holding company whose insurance subsidiary is incorporated in the state. In Tennessee, the acquisition of 10% of the voting securities of an entity is deemed to be the acquisition of control for the purpose of the insurance holding company statute and requires not only the filing of detailed information concerning the acquiring parties and the plan of acquisition, but also administrative approval prior to the acquisition. Holding company legislation has been adopted in certain states where the Company's insurance subsidiaries are domiciled, which subjects the subsidiaries to increased reporting requirements. Holding company legislation has also been proposed in additional states, which, if adopted, will subject any domiciled subsidiaries to additional reporting and supervision requirements.
The states in which the Company's insurance subsidiaries are domiciled also impose certain restrictions on the subsidiaries' ability to pay dividends to the Company. These restrictions are based in part on the prior year's statutory income and surplus. In general, dividends up to specified levels are considered ordinary and may be paid without prior approval. Dividends in larger amounts are considered extraordinary and are subject to approval by the insurance commissioner of the state of domicile. The maximum amount that would qualify as ordinary dividends to the Company by its insurance subsidiaries in 2018 is approximately, in the aggregate, $853.2 million. No assurance can be given that more stringent restrictions will not be adopted from time to time by states in which the Company's insurance subsidiaries are domiciled; such restrictions could have the effect, under certain circumstances, of significantly reducing dividends or other amounts payable to the Company by such subsidiaries without prior approval by state regulatory authorities.
State insurance regulators and the NAIC regularly re-examine existing laws and regulations applicable to insurance companies and their products. Changes in these laws and regulations, or in interpretations thereof, are often made for the benefit of the consumer and may lead to additional expense for the insurer. Some NAIC pronouncements, particularly as they affect accounting issues, take effect automatically in various states without affirmative action by those states. The Uniform Laws Commission’s revisions to model regulations affecting unclaimed property have prompted states to re-examine and, in some cases, 
12

change their own unclaimed property laws. These laws have resulted in exams conducted by the NAIC and on a state-by-state basis and could result in findings that adversely affect the Company. Additionally, regulatory actions with prospective impact can potentially have a significant adverse impact on currently sold products.
At the federal level, the executive branch or federal agencies may issue orders or take other action with respect to financial services and life insurance matters, and bills are routinely introduced in both chambers of the United States Congress which could affect the Company's business. In the past, Congress has considered legislation that would impact insurance companies in numerous ways, such as providing for an optional federal charter or a federal presence for insurance, preempting state law in certain respects regarding the regulation of reinsurance, increasing federal oversight in areas such as consumer protection and solvency regulation, setting tax rates, and other matters. The Company cannot predict whether or in what form legislation will be enacted and, if so, the impact of such legislation on the Company.
The Company is also subject to various conditions and requirements of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 (the "Healthcare Act"). The Healthcare Act makes significant changes to the regulation of health insurance and may affect the Company in various ways. The Healthcare Act may affect small blocks of business the Company has offered or acquired over the years that are, or are deemed to constitute, health insurance. The Healthcare Act may also affect the benefit plans the Company sponsors for employees or retirees and their dependents, the Company's expense to provide such benefits, the tax liabilities of the Company in connection with the provision of such benefits, and the Company's ability to attract or retain employees. In addition, the Company may be subject to regulations, guidance or determinations emanating from the various regulatory authorities authorized under the Healthcare Act. The Healthcare Act, any amendments or modifications thereto, or any regulatory pronouncement made thereunder, could have a significant impact on the Company.
The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act ("the Dodd-Frank Act") made sweeping changes to the regulation of financial services entities, products and markets. The Dodd-Frank Act directed existing and newly-created government agencies and bodies to perform studies and promulgate a multitude of regulations implementing the law, a process that has substantially advanced but is not yet complete. Although the new presidential administration has indicated a desire to revise or reverse some of its provisions, the fate of these proposals is unclear, and we cannot predict with certainty how the Dodd-Frank Act will continue to affect the financial markets generally, or impact our business, ratings, results of operations, financial condition or liquidity. 
Among other things, the Dodd-Frank Act imposed a comprehensive new regulatory regime on the over-the-counter (“OTC”) derivatives marketplace and granted new joint regulatory authority to the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) and the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (“CFTC”) over OTC derivatives. In collaboration with U.S. federal banking regulators, the CFTC has adopted regulations which categorize the Company as a “financial end-user” which is thereby required to post and collect margin in a variety of derivatives transactions. Recommendations and reports from entities created under the Dodd-Frank Act, such as the Federal Insurance Office (“FIO”) and the Financial Stability Oversight Council (“FSOC”), could also affect the manner in which insurance and reinsurance are regulated in the U.S. and, thereby, the Company’s business. The Dodd-Frank Act also created the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ("CFPB"), an independent division of the Department of Treasury with jurisdiction over credit, savings, payment, and other consumer financial products and services, other than investment products already regulated by the SEC or the CFTC. Certain of the Company's subsidiaries sell products that may be regulated by the CFPB, and the Company is unable to predict at this time the ways in which the CFPB’s regulations might directly or indirectly affect the Company or its subsidiaries.
The Company is subject to regulations adopted by the United States Department of Labor that affect a variety of products and services provided to employee benefit plans and individual investors that are governed by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act ("ERISA"). The regulations significantly expand the definition of “investment advice” and increase the circumstances in which the Company and broker-dealers, insurance agencies and other financial institutions that sell the Company’s products could be deemed a “fiduciary” when providing investment advice with respect to ERISA plans or Individual Retirement Accounts (“IRAs”). The Department of Labor also issued amendments to long-standing exemptions from the provisions of ERISA and the Internal Revenue Code (the "Code") that prohibit fiduciaries from engaging in certain types of transactions (“Prohibited Transaction Exemptions”) and adopted new Prohibited Transaction Exemptions. These amended and new Prohibited Transaction Exemptions appear to increase significantly the conditions that must be satisfied by fiduciaries in order to receive traditional forms of commission, such as sales commissions, for sales of insurance products to ERISA plans, plan participants and IRAs. 
The Department of Labor has recently expanded the definition of "investment advice fiduciary" and made effective new and revised Prohibited Transaction Exemptions, with additional exemptions and conditions thereto delayed and under review. In addition, various other suitability and/or best interest requirements are being considered at the state and federal levels which, if made effective, may ultimately apply to the Company. The indefiniteness and continued delays associated with these various initiatives have created uncertainty among distributors of our products, and this uncertainty continues to have an impact upon sales. Our current distributors may continue to move forward with their plans to limit the number of products they offer, including the types of products offered by the Company. The Company may find it necessary to change sales representative and/or broker compensation, to limit the assistance or advice it can provide to owners of the Company’s annuities, to replace or engage additional distributors, or to otherwise change the manner in which it designs and supports sales of its annuities. In addition, the Company continues to incur expenses in connection with initial and ongoing compliance obligations with respect to such rules, and in the aggregate these expenses may be significant. 
Certain life insurance policies, contracts, and annuities offered by the Company are subject to regulation under the federal securities laws administered by the SEC. The federal securities laws contain regulatory restrictions and criminal, administrative, and private remedial provisions. From time to time, the SEC and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority ("FINRA") examine or investigate the activities of broker-dealers and investment advisers, including the Company's affiliated broker-dealers and 
13

investment advisers. These examinations or investigations often focus on the activities of the registered representatives and registered investment advisers doing business through such entities and the entities’ supervision of those persons.
The USA PATRIOT Act of 2001 includes anti-money laundering and financial transparency laws as well as various regulations applicable to broker-dealers and other financial services companies, including insurance companies. Financial institutions are required to collect information regarding the identity of their customers, watch for and report suspicious transactions, respond to requests for information by regulatory authorities and law enforcement agencies and share information with other financial institutions. As a result, the Company is required to maintain certain internal compliance practices, procedures, and controls.
Other types of regulation that could affect the Company and its subsidiaries include insurance company investment laws and regulations, state statutory accounting practices, tax laws, antitrust laws, minimum solvency requirements, enterprise risk requirements, state securities laws, federal privacy laws, cybersecurity regulation, technology and data regulations, insurable interest laws, federal anti-money laundering and anti-terrorism laws, employment and immigration laws and, because the Company owns and operates real property, state, federal, and local environmental laws. The Company may also be subject to regulations influenced by or related to international regulatory authorities or initiatives. The Company's sole stockholder, Dai-ichi Life, is subject to regulation by the Japanese Financial Services Authority ("JFSA"). Under applicable laws and regulations, Dai-ichi Life is required to provide notice to or obtain the consent of the JFSA prior to taking certain actions or engaging in certain transactions, either directly or indirectly through its subsidiaries, including the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries. Domestically, the NAIC may be influenced by the initiatives or regulatory structures or schemes of international regulatory bodies, and those initiatives or regulatory structures or schemes may not translate readily into the regulatory structures or schemes of the legal system (including the interpretation or application of standards by juries) under which U.S. insurers must operate. Changes in laws and regulations or in interpretations thereof, or to initiatives or regulatory structures or schemes of international regulatory bodies, which are applicable to the Company could have a significant adverse impact on the Company.
Additional issues related to regulation of the Company and its insurance subsidiaries are discussed in Item 1A, Risk Factors, and in Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, included herein.
