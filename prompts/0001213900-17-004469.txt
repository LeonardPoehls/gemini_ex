Item 1. Business.
General
 
Throughout this Form 10-K, the terms "we," "us," "our," and the "Company" refer to Lifestyle Medical Network Inc., a Nevada corporation, and, unless the context indicates otherwise, includes our subsidiaries.
 
The Company was incorporated in the State of Nevada on September 3, 2003, under the name Beverly Hills Film Studios, Inc. and changed its name to Emerging Media Holdings, Inc. on September 28, 2006. Initial operations involved the acquisition of two television stations and the operator of a television channel in Moldova. We disposed of our Moldova media subsidiaries in 2011, and on December 29, 2011, changed the focus of our business to healthcare management by the acquisition of rights to healthcare technologies and practices pursuant to a license agreement, the full assignment of which was completed February 2, 2012. Effective July 31, 2012, the name of our Company was changed to Lifestyle Medical Network Inc.  
 
The operations of the MED-CURE and Total Care clinics in Houston, Texas, were acquired in 2015 and 2016 by Dr. Ronald Moomaw, a former director of the Company and a licensed physician in the State of Texas. The Company, through its subsidiary Lifestyle Texas Medical Management, LLC, had provided scheduling, marketing and advertising, office space, equipment, supplies and other management services to these clinics and in return for a percentage of the gross revenues of each of the practice groups. The MED-CURE and Total Care clinics terminated operations in late 2016. In connection with the cessation of operations of these clinics, the Company has incurred a bad debt expense write-off of $1,131,873 as at December 31, 2016, representing the aggregate of our investments in these clinics and clinic debt to us as of that date.
 
As of the date of this report, we are focusing our efforts, through our consulting subsidiaries, Lifestyle Texas Medical Management LLC, Lifestyle Texas Management Services LLC and Lifestyle Florida Management Services, LLC, on providing administrative support and practice management services to healthcare providers. In May 2016, we commenced working with Global Physicians Healthcare, Inc. (“Global”), of which Christopher Smith, the Chief Executive Officer and a director of the Company, and Nathan Hawkins, a director of the Company, each have one-third equity interests. We entered into a support services agreement with Global in September 2016, under which Global has provided valuable assistance to us as a marketing and services consultant in marketing our services to healthcare providers and healthcare systems, andthe healthcare industry generally. The Company following initiation of its healthcare provider support services in 2016 is now expanding its internally generated marketing efforts for client healthcare providers.
 
Our services package is tailored to a practice group’s specific needs. Practices can select from menu of business solutions including billing, HR/PEO, accounting and consulting, computer technical support, compliance, and administrative functions including, but not limited to, equipment selection, budgeting, and staffing recruitment.
 
The Company has access to a nationwide network of ancillary providers of local and regional medical practice solutions. As a result, our client medical practices may benefit from cost savings, higher quality of patient care, and increased productivity efficiencies and revenue.
 
The Company is continuing to look for opportunities in the direct ownership of clinics where the operations of the clinic would be compatible with the applicable regulatory regime governing ownership of medical practices and where the clinic’s operations would complement our current practice management services operations.
 
Competition
 
The healthcare industry, including the services market for healthcare providers, is competitive. There is competition from the types of services we provide to medical and health clinics and medical practice groups in the market areas where we operate, as well as generally from medical practices and hospitals. Competitors may have existing relationships with the medical community which may be superior to ours.

Governmental Regulation
 
The healthcare industry is subject to numerous laws, regulations and rules including, among others, those related to government healthcare program participation requirements, various licensure and accreditation standards, reimbursement for patient services, health information privacy and security rules, and government healthcare program fraud and abuse provisions. Providers that are found to have violated any of these laws and regulations may be excluded from participating in government healthcare programs, subjected to significant fines or penalties and/or required to repay amounts received from the government for previously billed patient services.
 
Anti-Kickback Statutes
 
The United States Medicare/Medicaid Fraud and Abuse Anti-Kickback Statute (the “Anti-Kickback Statute”) prohibits “knowingly or willfully” paying money or providing remuneration of any sort in exchange for federally-funded referrals. While the Department of Health and Human Services has issued regulations containing “safe harbors” to the Anti-Kickback Statute, our operations and arrangements may not comply with all of the requirements. However, we believe that our operations are structured to substantially comply with applicable anti-kickback laws.
 
The State of Texas has its own version of the Anti-Kickback Statute, called the Texas Patient Solicitation Act (“TPSA”). Texas prohibits fee-splitting arrangements with physicians where professional fees of physicians are shared with non-physician persons or non-physician owned entities. Payment of remuneration for referrals and violations can result in state criminal and civil penalties. Because the TPSA is based on the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, the risks described above also arise under this state law except that the TPSA arguably is not limited to claims for treatment of federal program beneficiaries.
 
Prohibition Against Practice of Medicine
 
The establishment, marketing and operation of medical and health clinics are subject to laws prohibiting the practice of medicine by non-physicians and the rebate or division of fees between physicians and non-physicians. They also limit the manner in which patients may be solicited. We believe our providing management and professional medical consulting services to medical practices will not result in the Company being considered as engaged in the practice of medicine. There can be no assurance, however, that state authorities or courts will not determine in the future that we are engaged in the unauthorized practice of medicine. Such a determination could have a materially adverse effect upon the Company and would prohibit us from continuing our current advisory services to medical practices. Texas law generally does not permit business corporations to practice medicine, exercise control over the professional decisions of physicians who practice medicine or engage in various business practices, such as employing physicians.
Licensing and Certification 
 
Any healthcare practices or facilities that we advise must comply with various federal, state and local licensing and certification regulations and undergo periodic inspection by licensing agencies to certify compliance with such regulations. The initial and continued licensure of these facilities and certification to participate in government healthcare programs depends upon many factors including various state licensure regulations relating to quality of care, environment of care, equipment, services, staff training, personnel and the existence of adequate policies, procedures and controls.
Audits 
 
Government healthcare program participating healthcare facilities are subject to federal and state audits to validate the accuracy of claims submitted to the government healthcare programs. If these audits identify overpayments, facilities that we advise as a consultant could be required to make substantial repayments, subject to various administrative appeal rights.

Federal False Claims Act and Other Fraud and Abuse Provisions 
 
The Social Security Act also imposes criminal and civil penalties for submitting false claims to the government healthcare programs. Violations of the federal False Claims Act are punishable by fines of up to three times the actual damages sustained by the government, plus mandatory civil penalties. Whistleblower provisions allow private individuals to bring actions on behalf of the government by alleging that the defendant has defrauded the federal government. Further, a number of states have adopted their own false claims provisions as well as their own whistleblower provisions whereby a private party may file a civil lawsuit on behalf of the state. Further, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (“HIPAA”) broadened the scope of the fraud and abuse laws by adding several criminal provisions for healthcare fraud offenses that apply to all health benefit programs, whether or not payments under such programs are paid pursuant to federal programs. HIPAA also introduced enforcement mechanisms to prevent fraud and abuse under Medicare. There are civil penalties for prohibited conduct, including, but not limited to, billing for medically unnecessary products or services.
HIPAA Administrative Simplification and Privacy and Security Requirements 
 
The administrative simplification provisions of HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, require the use of uniform electronic data transmission standards for healthcare claims and payment transactions submitted or received electronically. These provisions are intended to encourage electronic commerce in the healthcare industry. HIPAA also established federal rules protecting the privacy and security of individually identifiable patient health information. The privacy and security regulations control the use and disclosure of patient health information and the rights of patients to understand and control how such patient health information is used and disclosed. Violations of HIPAA can result in both criminal and civil fines and penalties. The HIPAA security regulations require healthcare providers to implement administrative, physical and technical safeguards to protect the confidentiality, integrity and availability of patient health information.
Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act 
 
On March 23, 2010, President Obama signed into law the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (the “ACA”). The Healthcare and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (the “Reconciliation Act”), which contains a number of amendments to the PPACA, was signed into law on March 30, 2010. Two primary goals of the ACA, combined with the Reconciliation Act (collectively referred to as the “Health Reform Legislation”), are to provide for increased access to coverage for healthcare and to reduce healthcare-related expenses.
 
The Health Reform Legislation expands coverage of uninsured individuals and provides for significant reductions in the growth of Medicare program payments, material decreases in Medicare and Medicaid disproportionate share hospital payments, and the establishment of programs where reimbursement is tied in part to patient outcomes. Based on Congressional Budget Office estimates, the Health Reform Legislation, as enacted, is expected to expand health insurance coverage to approximately 32 to 34 million additional individuals through a combination of public program expansion and private sector health insurance reforms.
 
The ACA, or its possible successor, is currently the subject of legislative activity in the U.S. Congress, and it is unclear whether the existing legislation will remain in place, be modified, or replaced by new legislation.
