BUSINESS
Overview
We are a provider of postsecondary education services through our regionally accredited academic institutions, Ashford University® and University of the RockiesSM. We believe our institutions, which deliver programs primarily online, embody the contemporary college experience. Our institutions had a total of 40,730 students enrolled as of December 31, 2017.
Our institutions are committed to providing a high-quality educational experience to their students. Our institutions' online delivery models, weekly start dates, commitment to affordability and transferability of credits make their programs highly attractive and accessible. Our institutions' online platform has been designed to deliver a quality educational experience while offering the flexibility and convenience that many students require, particularly working adults. Our institutions have a comprehensive curriculum development process and employ qualified faculty members with significant academic and practitioner credentials. Our institutions conduct ongoing faculty and student assessment processes and provide a broad array of student services. We are also focused on providing innovative technologies to enhance the student experience and support faculty and student engagement.
Ashford University
In March 2005, we acquired Ashford University, whose mission is to provide high-quality, accessible, affordable, and innovative educational programs that meet the diverse needs of individuals pursuing advancement in their lives, professions, and communities. We believe Ashford University is helping to define the modern college experience by providing the flexibility and effectiveness of online learning. The institution offers associate's, bachelor's and master's degree programs online. Ashford University is comprised of four colleges: the Forbes School of Business and Technology™, the College of Education, the College of Health, Human Services and Science and the College of Liberal Arts.
Ashford University is accredited by WASC Senior College and University Commission (“WSCUC”). For additional information regarding accreditation, see “Regulation — Accreditation” below. Ashford University maintains a website at www.ashford.edu, the contents of which are not incorporated by reference into, or in any way a part of, this report.
University of the Rockies
In September 2007, we acquired University of the Rockies, whose mission is to provide high-quality, accessible learning opportunities globally for diverse groups of individuals seeking preparation for life goals, professional practice, service and distinguished leadership. University of the Rockies is a graduate institution that offers master's and doctoral degree programs in the social and behavioral sciences. Classes at University of the Rockies are presented in a progressive online format. The majority of students at University of the Rockies attend via the institution's accessible online platform, which is also available through our mobile applications.
University of the Rockies is accredited by the Higher Learning Commission (“HLC”). For additional information regarding accreditation, see “Regulation — Accreditation” below. University of the Rockies maintains a website at www.rockies.edu, the contents of which are not incorporated by reference into, or in any way a part of, this report.

* Includes students who are taking one or more courses at our institutions, but have not declared that they are pursuing a specific degree.
We define period-end enrollment as the number of active students on the last day of the financial reporting period. A student is considered active if the student has attended a class within the prior 15 days or is on an institutionally-approved break not to exceed 45 days, unless the student has graduated or provided notice of withdrawal, or for new students who have completed their third week of attendance, and posted attendance in the fourth week.
As of December 31, 2017, approximately 70% of our institutions' online students were female, 56% identified themselves as minorities and the average age of online students was 35. Our institutions have online students throughout the United States and students in 23 different countries.
Graduation
As of December 31, 2017, more than 112,000 students have graduated from our combined institutions. The total number of credits required to obtain a degree for online programs varies based on the type of degree: an associate's degree requires a minimum of 64 credits; a bachelor's degree requires a minimum of 120 credits; a master's degree typically requires a minimum of 30 credits; and a doctoral degree at University of the Rockies requires a minimum of 62 credits.
Many students have previously completed some postsecondary education and have credits they would like to transfer to a new degree program. We believe students should receive credit for their prior work and our institutions work closely with their accrediting agencies to obtain the right to accept transfer credits.
Tuition and Fees
Our institutions generally structure the tuition and fees for programs to be below Title IV loan limits and average grant awards, affording students who do not otherwise have the financial means to pursue an education the opportunity to gain access to our institutions' programs. We recognize that private loans are increasingly difficult to obtain, which can prevent academically qualified students from pursuing an education at institutions with higher tuition and fees. We believe that helping to remove the financial burden of obtaining incremental private loans while pursuing a postsecondary education not only permits more students to access our institutions' programs, but also enables students to focus more on their coursework and program completion while in school.
The price of our institutions' courses varies based upon the number of credits per course (with most courses representing three credits), the degree level of the program and the discipline. Ashford University implemented a tuition increase of approximately 5%, for courses beginning on or after February 6, 2018. This increase does not impact military students receiving governmental benefits and students under the Full Tuition Grant program. There were no such tuition increases for students at University of the Rockies. Refer to the respective academic catalog of each institution for the relative price per credit for undergraduate and graduate courses.
Revenue realized from tuition is reduced by the amount of scholarships awarded to students. For the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, we recorded $100.3 million, $96.4 million, and $102.2 million, respectively, for institutional scholarships awarded to students at our institutions.

Student Financing
Students finance their education at our institutions through a combination of the financing options described below.
Title IV programs
If a student attends any institution certified as Title IV eligible by the U.S. Department of Education (the “Department”) and meets applicable student eligibility standards, that student may receive grants, loans, or both grants and loans to help fund their education under programs authorized by Title IV of the Higher Education Act (“Title IV”). An institution participating in federal student financial aid programs authorized by Title IV (“Title IV programs”) must ensure that all program funds are accounted for and disbursed properly. To continue receiving program funds, students must demonstrate satisfactory academic progress toward the completion of their program of study.
During the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017, Ashford University derived 80.8%, and University of the Rockies derived 86.1% of their respective cash revenues from Title IV program funds.
Federal Direct Loans
The William D. Ford Federal Direct Loan Program (the “Direct Loan Program”) consists of two types of loans: Stafford loans, which are either subsidized or unsubsidized, and PLUS loans, which are made available to graduate and professional students, as well as parents of dependent undergraduate students. For a Direct Subsidized Loan, the federal government pays the interest on the loan while the student is in school and during grace periods and any approved periods of deferment, until the student's obligation to repay the loan begins. Direct Unsubsidized Loans are not based on financial need and are available to students who do not qualify for a Direct Subsidized Loan, or in some cases, in addition to a Direct Subsidized Loan. Loan funds are paid to our institutions, which in turn credit the student's account for tuition and fees and disburse any requested amounts in excess of tuition and fees to the student.
Under the Bipartisan Student Loan Certainty Act of 2013, interest rates will be established each year for Direct Subsidized Loans, Direct Unsubsidized Loans, and PLUS loans for which the first disbursement is on or after July 1 of that year through the following June 30. The interest rate, once established, will be fixed and apply for the life of the loan. With respect to loans for which the first disbursement was on or after July 1, 2017 but before July 1, 2018, the interest rates are (i) 4.45% for Direct Subsidized Loans and Direct Unsubsidized Loans for undergraduate students, (ii) 6.0% for Direct Unsubsidized Loans for graduate/professional students and (iii) 7.0% for PLUS loans.
Federal Pell Grant Program
Under the Federal Pell Grant Program, the Department makes grants to undergraduate students who demonstrate financial need. Under the August 2008 reauthorization of the Higher Education Act, students were able to receive Pell Grant funds for attendance on a year-round basis, and could potentially receive more in a given year than the traditionally defined maximum annual amount. However, the U.S. Department of Defense and Full-Year Continuing Appropriations Act of 2011 permanently repealed the Pell Grant provision that provided an otherwise eligible student with more than one Pell Grant in an award year, effective with the 2011-2012 award year. Beginning with the 2012-2013 award year, a student's eligibility to receive a Pell Grant was reduced from 18 semesters (or its equivalent) to 12 semesters (or its equivalent). The funding for Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education appropriations is part of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2014, which was signed into law by President Obama in January 2014 and is subject to change annually. The maximum funding amount for Pell Grant award year 2017-2018 increased to $5,920.
Non-Title IV funding sources
Other funding sources consist primarily of payments made in cash by individuals, private loans from third parties, reimbursement from corporate affiliates and government tuition assistance programs for military personnel, including veterans. During the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017, Ashford University derived 19.2%, and University of the Rockies derived 13.9% of their respective cash revenues from these other funding sources.
Financial aid processing
Our institutions have dedicated staff that provide call center and transactional processing services for the online financial aid student populations at our institutions, including services related to disbursement eligibility review and Title IV fund returns. We believe our centralized process helps improve student financing outcomes and enhances efforts to comply with Title IV rules and regulations.

Curricula and Scheduling
Our institutions are committed to providing their students with a rigorous and rewarding academic experience that gives them the knowledge and experience necessary to be contributors, educators and leaders in their chosen professions. Our institutions seek to maintain a high level of quality in curriculum, faculty and student support services, all of which contribute to the overall student experience. Our curricula are reviewed periodically to ensure that content is refined and updated as necessary. Our institutions provide extensive student support services, including academic, administrative and technology support, to help maximize the success of their students. Additionally, our institutions monitor the success of their educational delivery processes through periodic faculty and student assessments. Our institutions believe their commitment to quality is evident in the satisfaction and demonstrated proficiency of their students, which is measured at the completion of every course.
As of December 31, 2017, our institutions offered approximately 1,200 courses and approximately 80 degree programs. The degree programs are offered through Ashford University's four various colleges, the Forbes School of Business and Technology, the College of Education, the College of Health, Human Services and Science and the College of Liberal Arts, as well as through University of the Rockies.
Our institutions' online courses are offered with weekly start dates throughout the year, except for two weeks total in late December and early January. Courses typically run five to six weeks and all courses are offered in an asynchronous format so students can complete their coursework as their schedule permits. Online students typically enroll in one course at a time. This focused approach to learning allows the student to engage fully in each course. Doctoral students of University of the Rockies are required to participate in periodic seminars located in Denver, Colorado and compose and defend a dissertation on an approved topic.
Program Development
Our institutions design their academic offerings to meet the needs of a broad cross-section of prospective students. In addition to adding programs in high-demand disciplines, our institutions enhance their programs through the addition of specializations. Specialization areas are comprised of a select number of courses within an existing program that supplement that program's required courses. Specializations are used to create an offering that is tailored to the specific objectives of a student population and, therefore, is more attractive to potential students interested in a particular program. We believe the addition of specializations represents a cost-effective way to both expand our market and further enhance the differentiation of our institutions' programs in that market. Our institutions are expanding their portfolio of master's and doctoral degree programs, consistent with our commitment to a quality academic offering, and to pursue increased graduate student enrollments because we believe graduate students represent an attractive segment of the market.
Our institutions seek to offer programs in disciplines in which we believe there is strong demand for education and significant opportunity for employment. Our institutions' current program portfolio includes offerings at the associate's, bachelor's, master's and doctoral levels in the disciplines of business, education, psychology, social sciences and health sciences. Our institutions follow a defined process for identifying new degree program opportunities that incorporates student, faculty and market feedback, as well as macro trends in the relevant disciplines, in order to evaluate the expected level of demand for a new program prior to developing the content and marketing it to potential students.
Potential new programs and specializations are determined based on proposals submitted by faculty and staff and an assessment of overall market demand. Our institutions' faculty and academic leadership work in collaboration with our marketing team to research and select new programs that are expected to have strong demand and that can be developed at a reasonable cost. Programs are reviewed by the respective institution and must also receive approval through the normal governance process at the relevant institution. Once a program is selected for development, one or more subject matter experts are assigned to work with curriculum development staff to define measurable program-level student learning objectives. Each course in a program is designed to include learning activities that address the program objectives, foster student engagement and assess learning outcomes. All courses undergo extensive internal and external third-party quality assurance reviews before they are offered to students, and the new program is reviewed for approval through the appropriate governance processes. Following approval, an online program is conformed to the standards of our online learning management system and our marketing department creates a marketing plan for the program. In most cases, the time frame to identify, develop and internally approve a new program is approximately six months, not including the external regulatory approvals required before a program can be offered to students.
Comprehensive Assessment
Each of our institutions have developed and implemented a comprehensive assessment plan focused on student learning and effective instruction. The plans stipulate assessment of learning outcomes at the course, program and institutional levels. Learning outcomes are unique to each institution and demonstrate the skills that graduates should be able to demonstrate upon 
8

completion of their respective programs. With the assistance of our dedicated assessment team, our institutions' faculty routinely evaluate and revise courses and learning resources based upon outcomes and institutional research data. Using direct and indirect measurements, student performance is assessed on an ongoing basis to help ensure student success.
We utilize Waypoint Outcomes, our proprietary assessment platform, which is an innovative, web-based assessment system of interactive rubrics, to gather data from specific learning activities. Data results from Waypoint Outcomes are shared with the student and are also accessible by the faculty and program administrators.
In addition to course and program assessments, faculty instructional performance is continuously assessed by institutional deans and instructional specialists and through the results of student surveys at the completion of each course. The results of all of our assessment practices are reviewed by an assessment team, including faculty, and based on their conclusions, recommendations may be made to add to or modify our institutions' programs.
Branding and Marketing
We have invested significant resources in developing processes and implementing technologies that allow us to effectively identify, recruit and retain qualified students. We develop and participate in various marketing activities to generate leads for prospective students and to build the Bridgepoint Education, Ashford University and University of the Rockies brands.
For our institutions' online student population, we align ourselves with working adults, many of whom have already completed some postsecondary courses and are seeking an accessible, affordable education from a quality institution. The admissions policies that require a minimum age for online students at Ashford University are focused on attracting students with a greater commitment to completing their degrees.
Our institutions' branding campaigns utilize digital channels to communicate their message, and leads are generated from online sources. We also purchase keywords from search providers to generate online leads directly, rather than acquiring them solely through aggregators. Additionally, we have a team internally who focuses on generating online leads through search engine optimization techniques.
Recruiting and Admissions
Our institutions employ teams who facilitate all aspects of enrollment and integration of a prospective student into a program of study. These teams consist of enrollment service advisors, financial services advisors and academic advisors. This structure promotes internal accountability among employees involved in identifying, recruiting, enrolling and retaining new students.
Prospective student leads are managed through a customer relations management (“CRM”) system, which directs a lead for a prospective student to a recruiting team and assigns an enrollment service advisor within that team to serve as the primary liaison for that prospective student. Once contact with a prospective student is established, the enrollment service advisor, along with the academic and financial services advisors, begins an assessment process to determine if our institutions' program offerings match the student's needs and objectives. Additionally, enrollment service advisors communicate other criteria, including expected duration and cost of the program, to the prospective student.
The enrollment service advisors go through a comprehensive training program that addresses our institutions' academic offerings, financial aid options and the regulatory environment in which we operate, including the restrictions imposed by regulations on the admissions process. We place significant emphasis on regulatory requirements and demand an environment of strict compliance.
Our institutions have a presence in both military and corporate channels. Our military education outreach teams work with representatives of military education services offices, as well as with the military students we serve to demonstrate the quality, impact and value that our institutions' programs can provide to individuals in the organizations. We believe our institutions' educational offerings are attractive to potential students in the military. Military students may frequently change locations or seek to complete a program intermittently over the course of several years. In the corporate channel, we have the Education Partnerships program. These corporate partnership programs provide companies with the opportunity to allow their employees to pursue and complete a college degree without incurring any student debt. We believe employers value our institutions' affordability, which allows employer tuition reimbursements to be used more efficiently.
The admissions process is designed to offer access to prospective students who seek the benefits of a postsecondary education. Ashford University undergraduate students may qualify in various ways, including by having a high school diploma or a General Educational Development equivalent. Graduate level students at Ashford University and University of the Rockies 
9

are required to have an undergraduate degree from an accredited college and may be required to have a minimum grade point average or meet other criteria to qualify for admission to certain programs.
Retention
Once a student enrolls in an online program, the institution provides consistent, ongoing support to assist the student in acclimating to the online environment and to address challenges that arise in order to increase the likelihood that the student will persist through graduation.
Providing a superior learning experience to every student is a key component in retaining students at our institutions. We believe that our team-based approach to recruitment and the robust student services we provide enhance retention because of each student's interaction with his or her team and the accountability inherent in the team structure. We also incorporate a systematic approach to contacting students at key milestones during their experience at our institutions, providing encouragement and highlighting their progress. There are frequent personal interactions between academic advisors and students, which we view as a key component to our retention strategy. Ashford University has a retention committee that monitors performance metrics and other key data to analyze student retention rates, as well as the causes of and potential risks for student drops. In addition, our dispute resolution department serves as a neutral third party for students to raise any concerns or complaints. Such concerns and complaints are then elevated to the appropriate department.
Ashford University has various programs focused on academic quality and student success that we believe help students succeed in their courses, help retain higher quality students and ultimately increase student retention. Ashford University has a free two-week orientation course that is mandatory for all incoming students who have not earned any previous college credits. The orientation is designed to provide students with a complete overview of the online classroom experience, prepare them for success in their courses and help them self-evaluate their readiness to succeed in an online college setting. The experience provides a realistic, up-front overview of expectations so that students are aware of what is expected of them as they prepare for their studies. Students also gain an understanding of how to access and navigate within the online classroom so they can feel confident when they move to their first course in their respective programs. For students taking the orientation course, successful completion of the orientation is required before they can begin their first class.
Ashford University also offers the “Ashford Promise,” which allows a student to experience the first three weeks of his or her first class before incurring any financial obligation. After the first three weeks, students who do not demonstrate satisfactory academic progress, or those who simply opt out, will not be admitted as students. These individuals will not be responsible for any tuition or fees, and therefore will not incur any debt. We believe the Ashford Promise initiative helps increase student retention while reducing the financial risk to the student.
Technology
We have created a scalable technology system that we believe is secure, reliable and redundant, and permits our institutions' courses and support services to be offered online.
Online course delivery and management
During 2017, we transitioned learning management systems away from Pearson eCollege, and now currently use the Canvas learning management system provided by Instructure, Inc. (“Instructure”), a third-party software and services provider. Canvas is a software-as-a-service (“SaaS”) platform that enables us to develop and deliver the latest in engaging online learning experiences. As a native cloud platform, Canvas software and data are hosted by Amazon Web Services, providing for a fast, secure and readily scalable experience for our institutions’ students and faculty. Additionally, students and faculty will have greater flexibility to learn and teach from anywhere, anytime and on any iOS or Android device.
Internal administration
Ashford University utilizes a CRM application from Campus Management Corp. for lead management, workflow, analytics, reporting and a complete view of our students. This tool enables Ashford University to view the entire student history from the lead to graduation, individually or in cohorts, and to respond appropriately. University of the Rockies utilizes an internally developed proprietary CRM system for lead management, document management, workflow, analytics and reporting. Both institutions utilize online application portals to accept, integrate and process student applications.
Both institutions utilize CampusVue, a student information system provided by Campus Management Corp., to manage student data (including grades, attendance, status and financial aid) and to generate periodic management reports. This system interfaces with our online learning management system.

Innovation and new technologies
Central to our ideal of enabling learning anytime, anywhere, is the commitment to providing learning platforms and resources that make accessible learning a reality. These innovations include Constellation, our proprietary learning platform, Waypoint Outcomes, our proprietary assessment software, and our mobile application technology.
Constellation
Constellation is an innovative suite of interactive educational materials that increases the educational quality for online students at Ashford University and University of the Rockies. Constellation is our proprietary learning platform that takes the best features of traditional textbooks and combines them with the best features of the Internet to create a premium student experience. We developed Constellation as an alternative to third-party textbooks with digital course materials. Constellation gives students access to their digital course materials across platforms without sacrificing time-tested studying tools like highlighting and note taking. Constellation includes customized content geared to our institutions' courses and students, combined with a robust set of features that make course materials engaging and accessible to students of various learning styles and abilities. Constellation is cloud-based and is compatible across operating systems, browsers and mobile technologies, including web-enabled smartphones and tablet devices. We have developed Constellation-enabled courses primarily in core classes to attempt to reach as many students as possible. We plan to expand the features of Constellation in future releases.
The Constellation team includes editors with extensive experience at leading textbook publishing firms. Highly qualified subject matter experts are recruited to author content that addresses course and institutional outcomes. Constellation digital texts are organized around our institutions' accelerated courses.
Waypoint Outcomes
Waypoint Outcomes provides learning and assessment software to our institutions. The software combines classic rubric grading scales with easy, efficient technology to help educators teach writing, critical thinking and cognitive skills. Its sophisticated grading palette frees teachers to focus on meaningful, personalized feedback for students by automating repetitive tasks.
Mobile application technology
Each of our institutions offers mobile applications compatible with most web-enabled smartphones and tablet devices in order to increase the accessibility of the student learning experience. The applications enable students to use their mobile device to contact support staff, complete discussion posts and review important information regarding their academic status. We have received positive feedback from students indicating that these mobile applications further their learning experience, and we have incorporated feedback received into the periodic updates to these mobile applications.
Employees
As of December 31, 2017, our institutions had approximately 200 full-time faculty roles, including programs chairs, as well as approximately 3,200 active adjunct faculty. Adjunct faculty members are part-time employees engaged on a course-by-course basis and are compensated based upon a fixed amount per course, which varies among faculty members based on each individual's experience and background. In addition to teaching assignments, adjunct faculty members may also be asked to serve on student committees, such as comprehensive examination and dissertation committees, or assist with course development.
As of December 31, 2017, the Company and institutions also employed approximately 2,200 combined non-faculty staff in the areas of university services, academic advising and academic support, enrollment services, university administration, financial aid, information technology, human resources, corporate accounting, finance and other administrative functions. None of our employees is a party to any collective bargaining or similar agreement with us.
Competition
The postsecondary education market is highly fragmented and competitive, with no private or public institution representing a significant market share. Our institutions compete primarily with public and private degree-granting regionally accredited colleges and universities. Many colleges and universities enroll working adults, in addition to traditional 18 to 24 year-old students. Many of those colleges and universities offer a variety of distance education and online initiatives.
We believe that competitive factors in the postsecondary education market include the reputation of the college or university among students and employers, the number of qualified and experienced faculty, the program costs, the relevant and accredited program offerings, the regulatory approvals, the convenient, flexible and dependable access to programs and classes, 
11

the relative marketing and selling effectiveness, the time necessary to earn a degree and the level of student support services. We expect to encounter increased competition as a result of new entrants to the online education market, including traditional colleges and universities that had not previously offered online education programs.
Intellectual Property
We rely on a combination of copyrights, trademarks, service marks, patents, trade secrets, domain names and agreements with employees and third parties to protect our intellectual property rights. We have trademark and service mark registrations and pending applications for additional registrations in the United States and select foreign jurisdictions. We also own the domain name rights for our institutions, as well as other words and phrases important to our business. In addition, we have applied for domestic and international patents for certain technology developed by us. We also have registered copyrights for exemplary business course materials. In many instances, our institutions' course content is produced by faculty and other content experts under work-for-hire agreements pursuant to which we own the course content in return for a fixed development fee. In certain limited cases, course content is licensed from third parties on a royalty fee basis.
Environmental Matters
We believe our facilities are in material compliance with federal, state and local laws and regulations that have been enacted or adopted regulating the discharge of materials into the environment, or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment. Compliance with these laws and regulations has not had, and is not expected to have, a material effect on our capital expenditures, results of operations or competitive position.
Financial Information about Segments and Geographic Areas
We operate our business in one reportable segment and we have no foreign operations or assets located outside of the United States. For information about our revenues from external customers, measures of profits and losses, and total assets, see our annual consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report.

REGULATION
Ashford University and University of the Rockies are accredited institutions of higher education that are subject to extensive regulation by a variety of agencies. These agencies include WSCUC, the agency that accredits Ashford University, and HLC, the agency that accredits University of the Rockies. Accrediting agencies provide an independent assessment of educational quality. Our institutions are also subject to regulation by educational licensing authorities in states where our institutions are physically located or conduct certain operations. We are also subject to regulation by the Department due to our participation in Title IV programs. To participate in Title IV programs, a school must maintain authorization by the state education agency or agencies where it is physically located, be accredited by an accrediting agency recognized by the Department and be certified by the Department as an eligible institution. Institutions that participate in Title IV programs are subject to an extensive set of laws and regulations. The laws, regulations and standards of WSCUC, HLC, the Department and state agencies affect the vast majority of our institutions' operations.
Accreditation
Prior to being institutionally accredited by WSCUC in July 2013, Ashford University had been accredited by HLC since 1950. University of the Rockies has been institutionally accredited since 2003 by HLC. WSCUC and HLC are two of seven regional accrediting agencies that accredit colleges and universities in the United States. Most traditional, public and private non-profit, degree-granting colleges and universities are accredited by one of these seven agencies.
Accreditation by WSCUC and HLC is recognized by the Department and by prospective students as a reliable indicator of educational quality. Accreditation is a private, non-governmental process for evaluating the quality of an educational institution and its programs and an institution's effectiveness in carrying out its mission in areas including integrity, student performance, curriculum, educational effectiveness, faculty, physical resources, administrative capability and resources, financial stability and governance. To be recognized by the Department, an accrediting agency, among other things, must adopt specific standards to be maintained by educational institutions, conduct peer-review evaluations of institutions' compliance with those standards, monitor compliance through periodic institutional reporting and the periodic renewal process and publicly designate those institutions that meet the agency's criteria. An accredited institution is subject to periodic review by its accrediting agency to determine whether it continues to meet the performance, integrity, quality and other standards required for accreditation. An institution that is determined not to meet the standards of accreditation may have its accreditation revoked or not renewed.
Accreditation is important to our institutions as it establishes comprehensive criteria designed to promote educational quality and effectiveness. Accreditation also represents a public acknowledgment by a recognized independent agency of the quality and effectiveness of our institutions and their programs. It also facilitates the transferability of educational credits when students transfer to or apply for graduate school at other regionally accredited colleges and universities. The Department relies on accreditation as an indicator of educational quality and effectiveness in determining an institution's eligibility to participate in Title IV programs, as do certain corporate and government sponsors in connection with tuition reimbursement and other student aid programs.
We believe that regional accreditation is viewed favorably by certain students when choosing a school, by other schools when evaluating transfer and graduate school applications, and by certain employers when evaluating the credentials of candidates for employment.
Evaluations and renewals of accreditation
In 2003, University of the Rockies was granted its initial accreditation from HLC for a period of five years. Its accreditation was then renewed by HLC in 2008 for a period of seven years. In September and October of 2014, HLC conducted a previously scheduled comprehensive evaluation visit at University of the Rockies in order for the university to seek reaffirmation of its accreditation by HLC. In February 2015, University of the Rockies received continuation of its accreditation by HLC for a period of ten years, with the next Reaffirmation of Accreditation in 2024-25.
In July 2013, WSCUC granted Initial Accreditation to Ashford University for five years, until July 15, 2018. As part of a continuing monitoring process, Ashford hosted a visiting team from WSCUC in a special visit in April 2015. In July 2015, Ashford received an Action Letter from WSCUC outlining the findings arising out of its team's special visit. The Action Letter stated that the WSCUC visiting team found substantial evidence that Ashford continues to make sustained progress in all six areas recommended by WSCUC in 2013. As part of its institutional review process, WSCUC will conduct a comprehensive review of Ashford, scheduled to commence with an off-site review in spring 2018, followed by an on-site review in fall 2018.

Licensure by California BPPE
To be eligible to participate in Title IV programs, an institution must be legally authorized to offer its educational programs by the states in which it is physically located. Ashford University was approved by the BPPE to operate in California until July 15, 2018. As a result, the university is subject to laws and regulations applicable to private, postsecondary educational institutions located in California, including reporting requirements related to graduation, employment and licensing data, certain changes of ownership and control, faculty and programs, and student refund policies. Ashford also remains subject to other state and federal student employment data reporting and disclosure requirements.
Negotiated Rulemaking and Other Executive Action
On December 16, 2016, the Department released final regulations to clarify state authorization requirements for postsecondary institutions offering distance education that participate in federal student loan programs, as required by the Higher Education Act. Among other things, the final regulations (i) require institutions offering distance education to be authorized by each state in which they enroll students, if such authorization is required by the state, (ii) require institutions to document the state process for resolving student complaints regarding distance education programs, (iii) require public and individualized disclosures to enrolled and prospective students in distance education programs, including disclosures regarding adverse actions taken against the institution, the institution’s refund policies and whether each of the institution’s programs meet applicable state licensure or certification requirements, and (iv) require institutions to explain to students the consequences of moving to a state where the school is not authorized, which could include loss of eligibility for federal student aid. The final regulations recognize authorization through participation in a state authorization reciprocity agreement, as long as the agreement does not prevent a state from enforcing its own consumer laws. The final regulations are scheduled to take effect on July 1, 2018.
Authorization by Congress of Title IV Programs
Congress must periodically reauthorize the Higher Education Act and annually determine the funding level for each Title IV program through the budget and appropriations process. In 2008, the Higher Education Act was reauthorized through September 2014 and on December 13, 2017, the House of Representatives’ Committee on Education and the Workforce passed H.R. 4508, the Promoting Real Opportunity, Success, and Prosperity through Education Reform Act (“PROSPER Act”). No date has been set for consideration by the full House on the legislation, nor has a companion Higher Education Act reauthorization bill been introduced in the U.S. Senate. The Higher Education Act's programs will continue year-to-year without explicit reauthorization as long as Congress appropriates funds for the programs. Congress may propose and pass revisions to the Higher Education Act between reauthorizations by using other legislative vehicles such as budget bills and appropriations bills, which could impact funding for student financial aid programs.
Department Regulation of Title IV Programs
To be eligible to participate in Title IV programs, an institution must comply with the Higher Education Act and the regulations thereunder that are administered by the Department. Among other things, the law and regulations require that an institution (i) be licensed or authorized to offer its educational programs by the states in which it is physically located, (ii) maintain institutional accreditation by an accrediting agency recognized for such purposes by the Department and (iii) be certified to participate in Title IV programs by the Department. Our institutions' participation in Title IV programs subjects them to extensive oversight and review pursuant to regulations promulgated by the Department. Those regulations are subject to revision and amendment from time to time by the Department. The Department's interpretation of its regulations likewise is subject to change. As a result, it is difficult to predict how Title IV program requirements will be applied in all circumstances.
An institution must periodically seek recertification from the Department to continue to participate in Title IV programs and may, in certain circumstances, be subject to review by the Department prior to seeking recertification. The University of the Rockies is certified until March 21, 2019 and is required to submit its reapplication for continued certification by December 31, 2018. On October 20, 2017, Ashford University received an updated Program Participation Agreement from the Department. Based on the updated Program Participation Agreement, Ashford University is provisionally certified to participate in Federal Student Financial Aid Programs until December 31, 2018. Ashford University was previously eligible to participate on a month-to-month basis while its reapplication for certification was pending with the Department. As a result of the updated Program Participation Agreement, Ashford University’s previously pending educational programs have been approved and Ashford University is required to submit its reapplication for continued certification by September 30, 2018. During the time when an institution is provisionally certified, it may be subject to adverse action with fewer due process rights than those afforded to other institutions, and it must apply for and receive approval from the Department for any substantial change including but not limited to the establishment of an additional location, an increase in the level of academic offerings, or the addition of certain programs.

The 90/10 rule
Under the Higher Education Act, a proprietary institution loses eligibility to participate in Title IV programs if the institution derives more than 90% of its revenues from Title IV program funds for two consecutive fiscal years, as calculated in accordance with Department regulations. This rule is commonly referred to as the “90/10 rule.” Any institution that violates the 90/10 rule for two consecutive fiscal years becomes ineligible to participate in Title IV programs for at least two fiscal years. In addition, an institution whose rate exceeds 90% for any single fiscal year is placed on provisional certification and may be subject to other enforcement measures. In September 2016, the Department issued new audit standards, for financial statement audits of proprietary institutions for fiscal years ending June 30, 2017 or later, which include a requirement that institutions must determine Title IV and non-Title IV revenue on a student by student basis. On the basis of this calculation, during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017, Ashford University derived 80.8%, and University of the Rockies derived 86.1%, of their respective cash revenues from Title IV program funds. As previously reported, for fiscal years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, Ashford University derived 81.2% and 80.9%, respectively, and University of the Rockies derived 86.5% and 86.6%, respectively, of their respective cash revenues from Title IV program funds.
Revenue derived from government tuition assistance for military personnel, including veterans, is not considered federal student aid for purposes of calculations under the 90/10 rule, and accordingly helps our institutions satisfy the 90/10 rule. As of December 31, 2017, approximately 25.8% of our institutions' students were affiliated with the military, some of whom are eligible to receive government tuition assistance that may be used to pursue postsecondary degrees. For the year ended December 31, 2017, this represented approximately 15% of revenues as calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”).
Cohort default rate
For each federal fiscal year, the Department calculates a rate of student defaults over a three-year measuring period for each educational institution, which is known as a “cohort default rate.” An institution may lose eligibility to participate in the Direct Loan Program and the Federal Pell Grant Program if, for each of the three most recent federal fiscal years, 30% or more of its students who became subject to a repayment obligation in that federal fiscal year defaulted on such obligation by the end of the following federal fiscal year.
The most recent official three-year cohort default rates for Ashford University for the 2014, 2013 and 2012 federal fiscal years were 14.9%, 14.5% and 15.3%, respectively. The most recent official three-year cohort default rates for University of the Rockies for the 2014, 2013 and 2012 federal fiscal years were 5.5%, 3.8% and 4.3%, respectively.
Financial responsibility
The Higher Education Act and Department regulations establish standards of financial responsibility that an institution must satisfy in order to participate in Title IV programs. The Department evaluates compliance with these standards annually upon receipt of an institution's annual audited financial statements and also when an institution applies to the Department to reestablish its eligibility to participate in Title IV programs following a change in ownership. One financial responsibility standard is based on the institution's composite score, which is derived from a formula established by the Department. The composite score is a number between negative 1.0 and positive 3.0. It must be at least 1.5 for the institution to be deemed financially responsible without the need for further Department financial oversight. In addition to having an acceptable composite score, an institution must, among other things, meet all of its financial obligations (including required refunds to students and any Title IV liabilities and debts), be current in its debt payments and not receive an adverse, qualified or disclaimed opinion by its accountants in its audited financial statements.
For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016, the consolidated composite score calculated was 2.0, satisfying the composite score requirement of the Department's financial responsibility test. For the year ended December 31, 2017, we expect the consolidated composite score to be 2.5. However, the consolidated calculation is subject to determination by the Department once it receives and reviews our audited financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2017. Additionally, for the year ended December 31, 2017, the composite score at each of our institutions is higher than the consolidated score.
Substantial misrepresentation
The Higher Education Act prohibits an institution participating in Title IV programs from engaging in substantial misrepresentation regarding the nature of its educational programs, its financial charges or the employability of its graduates. Under the Department's rules, a “misrepresentation” is any false, erroneous or misleading statement an institution, one of its representatives or any ineligible institution, organization or person with whom the institution has an agreement to provide educational programs or marketing, advertising, recruiting or admissions services makes directly or indirectly to a student, prospective student or any member of the public, or to an accrediting agency, a state agency or the Department. The 
15

Department's rules define a “substantial misrepresentation” as any misrepresentation on which the person to whom it was made could reasonably be expected to rely, or has reasonably relied, to that person's detriment. For-profit educational institutions are also subject to the general deceptive practices jurisdiction of the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (“CFPB”).
On December 10, 2015, Ashford University received a request for information from the Multi-Regional and Foreign School Participation Division of the Department’s Office of Federal Student Aid (“FSA”) for (i) advertising and marketing materials provided to prospective students regarding the transferability of certain credit, (ii) documents produced in response to the CFPB's August 10, 2015 Civil Investigative Demand related to the CFPB's investigation to determine whether for-profit postsecondary education companies or other unnamed persons have engaged in or are engaging in unlawful acts or practices related to the advertising, marketing or origination of private student loans, (iii) certain documents produced in response to subpoenas and interrogatories issued by the Attorney General of the State of California and (iv) records created between 2009 and 2012 related to the disbursement of certain Title IV funds. The FSA is reviewing representations made by Ashford University to potential and enrolled students, and has asked us and Ashford to assist in its assessment of Ashford's compliance with the prohibition on substantial misrepresentations. We, together with Ashford, intend to provide the FSA with our full cooperation with a view toward demonstrating the compliant nature of our practices.
The Department is currently conducting a program review to assess Ashford University's administration of the Title IV programs in which it participates. For additional information regarding the program review, see “— Compliance reviews, audits and reports — Department of Education Open Program Review of Ashford University” below.
Return of Title IV funds for students who withdraw
If a student who has received Title IV funds withdraws, the institution must determine the amount of Title IV program funds the student has earned pursuant to applicable regulations. If the student withdraws during the first 60% of any payment period (which, for our undergraduate online students, is typically a 20-week term consisting of four five-week courses), the amount of Title IV funds that the student has earned is equal to a pro rata portion of the funds the student received or for which the student would otherwise be eligible for the payment period. If the student withdraws after the 60% threshold, then the student is deemed to have earned 100% of the Title IV funds received. If the student has not earned all of the Title IV funds disbursed, the institution must return the unearned funds to the appropriate lender or the Department in a timely manner, which is generally no later than 45 days after the date the institution determined that the student withdrew. If an institution's annual financial aid compliance audit in either of its two most recently completed fiscal years determines that 5% or more of such returns were not timely made, the institution may be required to submit a letter of credit in favor of the Department equal to 25% of the amount of unearned Title IV funds the institution was required to return for its most recently completed fiscal year. For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017, our institutions did not exceed the 5% threshold for late refunds sampled.
Gainful employment
In October 2014, the Department published gainful employment regulations impacting programs required to prepare graduates for gainful employment in a recognized occupation. Almost all academic programs offered by Title IV-participating private sector institutions of higher education must prepare students for gainful employment in a recognized occupation. The gainful employment regulations became effective July 1, 2015, with certain institutional disclosure requirements which became effective early 2017. The gainful employment regulations have a framework with three components:

• | Certification: Institutions must certify that each of their gainful employment programs meet state and federal licensure, certification and accreditation requirements.


• | Accountability Measures: To maintain Title IV eligibility, gainful employment programs will be required to meet minimum standards for the debt burden versus the earnings of their graduates.


◦ | Pass: Programs whose graduates have annual loan payments less than 8% of total earnings or less than 20% of discretionary earnings.


◦ | Zone: Programs whose graduates have annual loan payments between 8% and 12% of total earnings or between 20% and 30% of discretionary earnings.


◦ | Fail: Programs whose graduates have annual loan payments greater than 12% of total earnings and greater than 30% of discretionary earnings.

Programs that fail in two out of any three consecutive years or are in the Zone for four consecutive years will be disqualified from participation in the Title IV programs.
16


• | Transparency: Institutions will be required to make public disclosures regarding the performance and outcomes of their gainful employment programs. The disclosures will include information such as costs, earnings, debt and completion rates.

The accountability measures will typically weigh a calculated debt burden from graduates who completed their studies three and four years prior to the measuring academic year and earnings from the most recent calendar year prior to the conclusion of the measuring academic year. Thus for the 2014-2015 academic year, the two-year cohort will include graduates from the 2010-2011 and 2011-2012 academic years and earnings for those graduates from calendar year 2014.
On October 20, 2016, we received draft debt-to-earnings rates and certain underlying data from the Department for the first gainful employment measurement year. On January 8, 2017, we received our institutions’ final debt-to-earnings rates for the first gainful employment measurement year. Based on the final rates, none of our programs were determined to fail. Two of our current programs, including the Associate of Arts in Early Childhood Education and the Bachelor of Arts in Early Childhood Education/Administration, were determined to be in the zone. At December 31, 2017, approximately 3% of our institutions' students were enrolled in the Associate of Arts in Early Childhood Education and approximately 8% of our institutions' students were enrolled in the Bachelor of Arts in Early Childhood Education/Administration. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we derived revenue of approximately $15.3 million from the Associate of Arts in Early Childhood Education and approximately $44.2 million from the Bachelor of Arts in Early Childhood Education/Administration.
The fact that none of our programs were determined to fail and only two of our current programs were determined to be in the zone is significant given the framework discussed above, as a program would be disqualified from participation in Title IV programs only if it were to fail for two out of three consecutive years, or either fail or be in the zone for three out of four consecutive years. The gainful employment regulations contemplate a transition period in the first several years to afford institutions the opportunity to make changes to their programs and retain Title IV eligibility.
On June 15, 2017, the Department announced its intention to conduct additional negotiated rulemaking on certain issues related to gainful employment. On June 30, 2017, the Department also granted institutions until July 1, 2018 to comply with disclosure provisions related to promotional materials and prospective students, and extended the deadline for all programs to file alternate earnings appeals to a soon to be announced date. The Department did not change a July 1, 2017 deadline requiring institutions to provide a completed disclosure template, or a link thereto, on gainful employment program web pages and our schools have complied with this requirement.
We continue to review the information provided by the Department to understand the potential impact of the gainful employment regulations on our programs. We will also continue to evaluate options related to new programs or adjustments to current programs that could help mitigate the potential adverse consequences of the regulations. We will also continue to monitor changes to the existing regulations that may arise as a result of negotiated rulemaking.
Defense to repayment
On June 18, 2015, the Department announced processes that will be established to assist students who may have been the victims of fraud in gaining relief under the “defense to repayment” provisions of the Direct Loan Program regulations. The defense to repayment provisions currently in effect allow a student to assert as a defense against repayment of federal direct loans any commission of fraud or other violation of applicable state law by the school related to such loans or the educational services for which the loans were provided.
On June 14, 2017, the Department announced a postponement of the defense to repayment regulations and its intention to resubmit the regulations through the negotiated rulemaking process. The Department announced an additional postponement on October 24, 2017. On February 14, 2018, the Department announced they are postponing the effective date of this rule until July 1, 2019 so they can complete the negotiated rulemaking process and develop the new regulations. While rulemaking occurs, the Department will continue to process claims under the current borrower defense rules. We will continue to monitor changes to the existing regulations that may arise as a result of negotiated rulemaking.
Potential sanctions for noncompliance with Title IV regulations
The Department can impose sanctions for violating the statutory and regulatory requirements of Title IV programs, including:

• | transferring an institution from the advance method or the heightened cash monitoring level one method of Title IV payment, each of which permit the institution to receive Title IV funds before or concurrently with disbursing them to students, to the heightened cash monitoring level two method of payment or to the reimbursement method of

17

payment, each of which delay an institution's receipt of Title IV funds until student eligibility has been verified by the Department;

• | imposing a monetary liability against an institution in an amount equal to any funds determined to have been improperly disbursed or not to have been properly returned upon student withdrawal;


• | requiring an institution to post a letter of credit in favor of the Department as a condition for continued Title IV eligibility;


• | initiating proceedings to impose a fine or to limit, suspend or terminate an institution's participation in Title IV programs;


• | referring a matter for possible civil or criminal investigation;


• | failing to grant an institution's application for renewal of its certification, or revocation of an institution's provisional certification, to participate in Title IV programs, or imposing conditions on its participation in Title IV programs; or


• | taking emergency action to suspend an institution's participation in Title IV programs without prior notice or a prior opportunity for a hearing.

Compliance reviews, audits and reports
Our institutions are subject to reviews in connection with periodic renewals of certification to participate in Title IV programs, as well as announced and unannounced compliance reviews and audits by various external agencies, including the Department and the Office of Inspector General (“OIG”). The Department periodically reviews institutions participating in Title IV programs for compliance with applicable laws and regulations. The OIG is responsible for promoting the efficiency, effectiveness and integrity of the Department's programs and operations, including through the performance of general audits of institutions' administration of federal funds and investigations of fraud, abuse or other wrongdoing by institutions.
State licensing agencies, the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs and accrediting bodies may also conduct audits and reviews of a similar fashion. In addition, as part of the Department's ongoing monitoring of institutions' administration of Title IV programs, the Higher Education Act requires institutions to submit to the Department an annual Title IV compliance audit conducted by an independent certified public accounting firm. Each institution must also annually submit audited financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP and Department regulations to enable the Department to make a determination of an institution's financial responsibility.
Department of Education Open Program Review of Ashford University
On July 7, 2016, Ashford University was notified by the Department that an off-site program review had been scheduled to assess Ashford’s administration of the Title IV programs in which it participates. The program review commenced on July 25, 2016 and covered students identified in the 2009-2012 calendar year data previously provided by Ashford University to the Department in response to a request for information received from the Multi-Regional and Foreign School Participation Division of the Department’s Office of Federal Student Aid (the “FSA”) on December 10, 2015, but may be expanded if appropriate.
On December 9, 2016, the Department informed Ashford that it intended to continue the program review on-site at Ashford. The on-site program review commenced on January 23, 2017 and initially covers the 2015-2016 and 2016-2017 award years, but may be expanded if appropriate. To date, we have not received a draft report or any notice of deficiencies from the Department.
GI Bill Benefits
On May 20, 2016, the Company received a letter from the Iowa Department of Education (the “Iowa DOE”) indicating that, as a result of the planned closure of Ashford University’s residential campus in Clinton, Iowa, the Iowa State Approving Agency (the “ISAA”) would no longer continue to approve Ashford’s programs for GI Bill benefits after June 30, 2016, and recommending Ashford seek approval through the State Approving Agency of jurisdiction for any location that meets the definition of a “main campus” or “branch campus.” Ashford University began the process of applying for approval through the State Approving Agency in California (“CSAAVE”), and the Company subsequently disclosed that on June 20, 2016 it received a second letter from the Iowa DOE indicating that the Iowa DOE had issued a stay of the ISAA’s withdrawal of approval of Ashford’s programs for GI Bill benefits effective immediately until the earlier of (i) 90 days from June 20, 2016 or (ii) the date on which CSAAVE completed its review and issued a decision regarding the approval of Ashford in California. Ashford received communication from CSAAVE indicating that additional information and documentation would be required before Ashford’s application could be considered for CSAAVE approval. Ashford subsequently withdrew the CSAAVE application and continued working with the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (“VA”), the Iowa DOE and the ISAA to obtain continued 
18

approval of Ashford’s programs for GI Bill benefits and to prevent any disruption of educational benefits to Ashford’s veteran students.
On September 15, 2016, in response to a Petition for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief (the “Petition”) filed by Ashford University, the Iowa District Court for Polk County entered a written order (the “Order”) staying the Iowa DOE’s announced intention to withdraw the approval of Ashford as a GI Bill eligible institution until the entry of a final and appealable order and judgment in the action. On June 23, 2017, the Iowa District Court held a hearing on Ashford’s Petition and on July 17, 2017, the Court ruled in favor of the Iowa DOE and denied the petition. Ashford filed a motion for reconsideration of this ruling, which was denied on August 17, 2017. On August 23, 2017, Ashford filed a Petition to Vacate or Modify the Iowa District Court’s July 17, 2017 ruling, based on material evidence, newly discovered, which could not with reasonable diligence have been previously discovered by Ashford (the “Petition to Vacate”). The Petition to Vacate is pending. On September 18, 2017, Ashford posted an appeal bond, which stays this matter pending resolution of Ashford’s appeal, and as a result, Ashford’s approval was not withdrawn, and Ashford’s programs remain approved for GI Bill purposes. The Assistant Attorney General handling this matter on behalf of the Iowa DOE also advised Ashford that the Iowa DOE would take no action pending the post-ruling motions and appeal. On October 12, 2017, the Iowa District Court judge that issued the July 17, 2017 ruling filed a Disclosure Statement revealing family ties to the Iowa Attorney General’s Office, and following a motion by Ashford for recusal, the judge recused herself from further proceedings concerning the Petition to Vacate on October 20, 2017. On October 24, 2017, Ashford moved to vacate the July 17, 2017 ruling and all other material orders entered by the judge, or in the alternative, for a limited remand of this matter. This motion was granted, in part, and the case was remanded back to the District Court for further consideration.
On July 6, 2017, Ashford University received approval from the Arizona State Approving Agency to provide GI Bill benefits to its students. On September 13, 2017, the VA accepted the Arizona State Approving Agency’s approval, subject to Ashford's continued compliance with the approval requirements, and the University subsequently received a facility code from the VA. However, on November 9, 2017, the VA informed Ashford University that the Arizona State Approving Agency had not provided sufficient evidence to establish that it has jurisdictional authority over Ashford’s online programs. As a result, the VA stated that it would suspend payment of educational assistance and approval of new enrollments and reenrollments for Ashford University’s online programs in 60 days unless corrective action was taken.
On November 17, 2017, Ashford filed a petition in Federal Court challenging the VA’s rejection of the Arizona State Approving Agency’s approval of Ashford. In response to that petition, the VA agreed to stay the actions with respect to suspension and reenrollment it had announced on November 9, 2017 through the entry of judgment in the Federal Circuit case, on the condition that Ashford request and submit an application for approval to CSAAVE on or before January 8, 2018. Ashford University submitted an application to CSAAVE for approval on January 5, 2018. The VA has made assurances to Ashford’s veteran students that as long as Ashford pursues this application in good faith, it will continue to pay benefits, even as Ashford and the VA remain in discussions over Ashford’s current approval in Arizona. For additional information, see “Part II, Item 9B - Other information.” 
Adding teaching locations and implementing new educational programs
The requirements and standards of accrediting agencies, state education agencies and the Department limit our institutions' ability in certain instances to establish additional teaching locations or implement new educational programs. WSCUC, HLC and state education agencies that may authorize or accredit our institutions or their programs generally require institutions to notify them in advance of adding certain new locations or implementing certain new programs, and may undertake a review of the quality of the facility or the program and the financial, academic and other qualifications of the institution. In addition, if an institution participating in Title IV programs plans to add a new location or educational program, the institution must apply under certain circumstances to the Department to have the new location or educational program designated as within the scope of the institution's Title IV eligibility.
On October 20, 2017, Ashford University received an updated Program Participation Agreement from the Department. Based on the updated Program Participation Agreement, Ashford University is provisionally certified to participate in Federal Student Financial Aid Programs until December 31, 2018. Ashford University was previously eligible to participate on a month-to-month basis while its reapplication for certification was pending with the Department. As a result of the updated Program Participation Agreement, Ashford University’s previously pending educational programs have been approved and Ashford University is required to submit its reapplication for continued certification by September 30, 2018. During the time when an institution is provisionally certified, it must apply for and receive approval from the Department for any substantial change, including but not limited to the establishment of an additional location, an increase in the level of academic offerings or the addition of certain programs.
19

Change in ownership resulting in a change of control
The Department and most state and accrediting agencies require institutions of higher education to report or obtain approval of certain changes of control and changes in other aspects of institutional organization or operations. Transactions or events that constitute a change of control may include significant acquisitions or dispositions of an institution's common stock and significant changes in the composition of an institution's governing board. The types of thresholds for such reporting and approval vary among the states and among accrediting agencies. The Department regulations provide that a change of control occurs for a publicly traded corporation if either (i) a person acquires such ownership and control of the corporation so that the corporation is required to file a Current Report on Form 8-K with the SEC disclosing a change of control or (ii) the corporation's largest stockholder who owns at least 25% of the total outstanding voting stock of the corporation, ceases to own at least 25% of such stock or ceases to be the largest stockholder owning at least 25% of the total stock. A significant purchase or disposition of our voting stock, could be determined by the Department to be a change of control under this standard. In such event, the regulatory procedures applicable to a change in ownership and control would have to be followed in connection with the transaction. Similarly, if such a disposition were deemed a change of control by the applicable accreditor or state educational licensing agency, any required regulatory notifications and approvals would have to be made or obtained.
On January 22, 2018, HLC notified the University of the Rockies that the sale by Warburg Pincus of all of its remaining shares in the Company constituted a change of control under HLC policy.  As a result, the University of the Rockies must undergo a change of control review, which involves the submission of an application, a subsequent fact finding visit, and review by a peer review team and HLC staff.  The University of the Rockies application is currently due on or before March 2, 2018.
Privacy of student records
The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 (“FERPA”) and the Department's FERPA regulations require educational institutions to, among other things, protect the privacy of students' educational records by limiting an institution's disclosure of a student's personally identifiable information without the student's prior written consent. If an institution fails to comply with FERPA, the Department may require the institution to take corrective action or may terminate the institution's receipt of federal funds. Educational institutions are also obligated to safeguard student information pursuant to the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (“GLBA”), which requires an institution to, among other things, develop and maintain a comprehensive written information security program designed to protect against the unauthorized disclosure of personally identifiable financial information of students, parents or other individuals with whom such institution has a customer relationship. If an institution fails to comply with the applicable GLBA requirements, it may be required to take corrective action, be subject to monitoring and oversight by the FTC, and be subject to fines or penalties imposed by the FTC.
State authorization
To be eligible to participate in Title IV programs, an institution must be legally authorized to offer its educational programs by the states in which it is physically located. An institution is considered to be legally authorized by a state if, among other things, it meets one of the following sets of requirements:

• | the state establishes the institution by name as an educational institution through a charter, statute, constitutional provision or other action issued by an appropriate state agency or state entity and is authorized to operate educational programs beyond secondary education, including programs leading to a degree or certificate; the institution complies with any applicable state approval or licensure requirements, except that the state may exempt the institution from any state approval or licensure requirement based on the institution's accreditation by one or more accrediting agencies recognized by the Department or based upon the institution being in operation for at least 20 years; and the state has a process to review and appropriately act on complaints concerning the institution including the enforcement of state laws;


• | the institution is established by the state on the basis of an authorization to conduct business in the state or to operate as a nonprofit charitable organization; the institution, by name, is approved or licensed by the state to offer programs beyond secondary education, including programs leading to a degree or certificate; and the institution is not exempt from the state's approval or licensure requirements based on accreditation, years in operation, or other comparable exemption; and the state has a process to review and appropriately act on complaints concerning the institution including the enforcement of state laws; or


• | the institution is exempt from state authorization as a religious institution under the state constitution or by state law, and the state has a process to review and appropriately act on complaints concerning the institution and to enforce applicable state laws.

20

The Department has stated that it will not publish a list of states that meet, or fail to meet, the above requirements, and it is unclear how the Department will interpret these requirements in each state.
The regulations also provide that if an institution is offering postsecondary education through distance or correspondence education to students in a state in which it is not physically located or in which it is otherwise subject to state jurisdiction as determined by the state, the institution must meet any state requirements in order to legally offer postsecondary distance or correspondence education to students in that state. Additionally, upon request by the Department, an institution must be able to document that it has the applicable state approval.

California, Arizona, Iowa and Colorado
The Higher Education Act requires Ashford University and University of the Rockies to be legally authorized in the states in which they are physically located in order to participate in Title IV programs, and Department regulations impose Title IV program requirements for an institution to be considered legally authorized by a state.
Ashford University has designated its San Diego, California facilities as its main campus for Title IV purposes and has been approved by the BPPE to operate in California until July 15, 2018. For additional information, see “Regulation — Licensure by California BPPE” above. Ashford University also has physical locations in Arizona and Iowa. Ashford is registered as a postsecondary school in the State of Iowa by the Iowa College Student Aid Commission (“ICSAC”). Ashford University timely submitted to ICSAC an application to renew registration on November 15, 2017. Ashford University remains authorized in the state of Iowa by ICSAC while the renewal application is pending review and approval. To maintain its Iowa registration, Ashford must comply with applicable requirements under Iowa statutes and rules. Ashford University submitted an Original Application for a Regular Degree-Granting License to the Arizona State Board for Private Postsecondary Education (“State Board”) on June 9, 2017. On June 22, 2017, the Arizona State Board issued Ashford a license to operate an Online Administrative and Student Services Center, valid until June 30, 2018.
University of the Rockies is located in the State of Colorado and is authorized to operate by the Colorado Commission on Higher Education. To maintain its Colorado authorization, the university must comply with applicable requirements under Colorado statutes and rules.
Additional state regulation
Most state education agencies impose regulatory requirements on educational institutions operating within their boundaries. Several states have sought to assert jurisdiction over out-of-state educational institutions offering online programs that have no physical location or other presence in the state but have some activity in the state, such as enrolling or offering educational services to students who reside in the state, employing faculty who reside in the state or advertising to or recruiting prospective students in the state. In addition to California, Arizona, Iowa and Colorado, we have determined that our activities in certain states constitute a presence requiring licensure or authorization under the requirements of the applicable state education agency, and we have obtained state education agency approvals in certain states as determined necessary in connection with our marketing and recruiting activities. We review state licensure requirements on a regular basis to determine whether our activities in those states constitute a presence or otherwise require licensure or authorization. Because we enroll students throughout the United States, we may have to seek licensure or authorization in additional states in the future.
