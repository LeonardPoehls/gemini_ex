Item 1. Business.
Organization
We are a New York City focused REIT that primarily owns income-producing commercial real estate. We were incorporated on October 6, 2009 as a Maryland corporation that qualified as a REIT beginning with our taxable year ended December 31, 2010. On April 15, 2014, we listed our common stock on the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE") under the symbol "NYRT."
We purchased our first property and commenced active operations in June 2010. As of December 31, 2016, we owned 19 properties, which aggregated 3.3 million rentable square feet, had an occupancy of 93.4% and a weighted-average remaining lease term of 8.9 years. Our portfolio primarily consists of office and retail properties, representing 83% and 9%, respectively, of rentable square feet as of December 31, 2016. We have acquired hotel and other types of real properties to add diversity to our portfolio. Properties other than office and retail spaces represented 8% of rentable square feet.
Substantially all of our business is conducted through New York Recovery Operating Partnership, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership (the "OP"). Our only significant asset is the general partnership interests we own in the OP and assets held by us for the use and benefit of the OP. 
On August 22, 2016, our board of directors approved the Liquidation Plan, subject to stockholder approval. On January 3, 2017, we held a special meeting of stockholders, at which our stockholders approved the Liquidation Plan. Pursuant to the Liquidation Plan, we expect to sell or transfer all of our assets, pay or provide for our liabilities and expenses, distribute the remaining proceeds of the liquidation of our assets to our stockholders, wind up our operations and dissolve. The actual amounts and times of liquidating distributions to our stockholders pursuant to the Liquidation Plan will be determined by our board of directors at its discretion.
We have no employees. We have retained the Advisor to manage our affairs on a day-to-day basis through the Transition Date (as defined below) pursuant to an advisory agreement with the Advisor (as amended to date, the “Advisory Agreement”). Until the Transition Date, New York Recovery Properties, LLC (the "Property Manager") serves as our property manager, unless services are performed by a third party for specific properties. The Advisor and Property Manager are under common control with AR Global Investments, LLC (the successor business to AR Capital, LLC).
In September 2016, our board of directors issued a request for proposals for all interested, qualified parties to serve as our external advisor after December 26, 2016, which was then the expiration date of the Advisory Agreement. On December 19, 2016, we entered into an agreement (the “Services Agreement”) with the Service Provider, and a series of other agreements with the Advisor and the Property Manager pursuant to which we: (i) amended the Advisory Agreement to provide that the Advisor will not be responsible for implementing the Liquidation Plan and to extend the term to March 31, 2017, subject to five one-month extension options that may be exercised by our independent directors, provided that, following the later of February 28, 2017 and the filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the Advisory Agreement may be terminated upon three business days’ written notice from our independent directors, (ii) amended our agreement with the Property Manager (as so amended, the "Property Management Agreement") so that it will terminate on the expiration or termination of the Advisory Agreement, and (iii) entered into the Services Agreement pursuant to which the Service Provider will serve as (x) our exclusive advisor with respect to all matters primarily related to the Liquidation Plan (and as a consultant to us on other matters) during the period from January 3, 2017 through the Transition Date, and (y) as our advisor from and after the Transition Date. The "Transition Date" will occur upon the earlier of (i) three business days after written notice from our independent directors to the Advisor, following the filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”), but not earlier than March 3, 2017, and (ii) April 1, 2017.
Prior to the Transition Date, the Advisor will continue to provide all services related to the management of our day-to-day operations that are not related to the Liquidation Plan. Following the Transition Date, the Service Provider will be responsible for providing these services in addition to the services it has been providing since January 3, 2017 with respect to the Liquidation Plan. All services provided pursuant to the Advisory Agreement and the Services Agreement are subject to the supervision of our board of directors.

Liquidation Plan
On January 3, 2017, our stockholders approved the Liquidation Plan, and we became fully authorized to commence implementing the Liquidation Plan. The actual amounts and times of the liquidating distributions we make to our stockholders pursuant to the Liquidation Plan will be determined by our board of directors or, if a liquidating trust is formed, by the trustees of the liquidating trust, in their discretion. The Liquidation Plan provides, in pertinent part, that, among other things:

• | We are authorized to sell all of our assets, liquidate and dissolve the Company and its subsidiaries, and distribute the net proceeds of such liquidation in accordance with the provisions of our charter, our bylaws and the laws of the State of Maryland.


• | We will not engage in any business activities, except (i) to exercise the WWP Option, or (ii) to the extent otherwise necessary to preserve the value of our assets, wind up our business, pay or establish a reserve fund for our debts and distribute our assets to our stockholders, all in accordance with our charter and our bylaws, and the Liquidation Plan.


• | We are authorized to satisfy any existing contractual obligations (including any capital call requirements), pay for required tenant improvements and capital expenditures at our real estate properties (including real estate properties owned by joint ventures in which the Company owns an interest) if our board of directors so chooses and make protective acquisitions or advances with respect to our existing assets.


• | We are authorized to provide for the payment of any and all claims and obligations of ours, including all contingent, conditional or contractual claims known to us. We may do so through the creation of a reserve fund or in other ways.


• | All of our shares of common stock will be canceled and we will cease to exist upon the earlier of a final cash liquidating distribution or an in kind distribution of beneficial interests in a liquidating trust.


• | If we cannot sell our assets and pay our debts by January 3, 2019, which is 24 months from the date our stockholders approved the Liquidation Plan, we intend, for tax purposes, to transfer and assign our remaining assets and liabilities to a liquidating trust. This would be necessary in order for us, assuming we remain qualified as a REIT, to be eligible to deduct amounts distributed pursuant to the Liquidation Plan as dividends paid and thereby meet our annual distribution requirement and not be subject to U.S. federal income tax on such amounts. Upon transfer and assignment, our stockholders will receive beneficial interests in the liquidating trust equivalent to our stockholders’ ownership interests in the Company as represented by the shares of our common stock held by our stockholders prior to the transfer and assignment. The liquidating trust will pay or provide for all of our liabilities and distribute any remaining net proceeds from the sale of its assets to the holders of beneficial interests in the liquidating trust. The transfer of our assets to a liquidating trust is a taxable event to our stockholders notwithstanding that our stockholders may not currently receive a distribution of cash or any other assets with which to satisfy the resulting tax liability. Our stockholders’ interests in a liquidating trust will be generally non-transferable except by will, intestate succession or operation of law.


• | Until we are dissolved, our board of directors may terminate the Liquidation Plan without stockholder approval only (i) if our board of directors approves the Company entering into an agreement involving the sale or other disposition of all or substantially all of our assets or common stock by merger, consolidation, share exchange, business combination, sale or other transaction involving the Company or (ii) if our board of directors determines, in exercise of its duties under Maryland law, after consultation with its advisor and its financial advisor (if applicable) or other third party experts familiar with the market for Manhattan office properties, that there is an adverse change in the market for Manhattan office properties that reasonably would be expected to adversely affect proceeding with the Liquidation Plan. Notwithstanding approval of the Liquidation Plan by our stockholders, our board of directors may amend the Liquidation Plan without further action by our stockholders to the extent permitted under then current law.

The following table lists the tenants whose annualized cash rent represented greater than 10% of our total annualized cash rent for all portfolio properties as of December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively:

 | | December 31,
Property Portfolio | Tenant | 2016 | 2015 | 2014
Worldwide Plaza(1) | Cravath, Swaine & Moore, LLP | 16% | 16% | 16% 
Worldwide Plaza(1) | Nomura Holdings America, Inc. | 11% | 11% | 11% 

________________________

(1) | Annualized cash rent reflects our 48.9% pro rata share of rent generated by Worldwide Plaza.

The termination, delinquency or non-renewal of any of the above tenants would have a material adverse effect on our revenues. No other tenant represents more than 10% of our annualized cash rent for the periods presented.
Indebtedness
As of December 31, 2016, we had combined debt of $1.6 billion, including the POL Loans described below and $427.9 million of unconsolidated mortgage debt reflecting our pro rata share of Worldwide Plaza's total mortgage debt of $875.0 million, with a weighted average interest rate equal to 4.3% per annum and a weighted average term to maturity of 2.8 years. Approximately $810.2 million of this debt matures prior to January 3, 2019, the 24-month anniversary of stockholder approval of the Liquidation Plan. As of December 31, 2016, our combined debt to enterprise value was 48% based on the closing price of our common stock of $10.12 per share and fully diluted shares of common stock outstanding of 168.7 million.

On December 20, 2016, we entered into a mortgage loan (the "Mortgage Loan") in the aggregate amount of $500.0 million and a mezzanine loan (the “Mezzanine Loan” and, together with the Mortgage Loan, the “POL Loans”) in the aggregate amount of $260.0 million. Borrowings under the Mortgage Loan are secured by a mortgage on real properties (or ground lease or master lease) located in New York, New York at 245-249 West 17th Street, 333 West 34th Street, 216-218 West 18th Street, 50 Varick Street, 229 West 36th Street, 122 Greenwich Street, 350 West 42nd Street, 382-384 Bleecker Street, 350 Bleecker Street, 416-425 Washington Street, 33 West 56th Street and 120 West 57th Street (the "POL Loan Properties").
A portion of the net proceeds of the POL Loans after closing costs was used: (i) to repay the $485.0 million principal amount then outstanding under our revolving credit and term loan facility with Capital One, National Association (the “Credit Facility”); and (ii) to deposit $260.0 million in an operating account that may be used by the Company to purchase the additional equity interests in Worldwide Plaza upon exercise of the WWP Option. Prior to the repayment in full of the Credit Facility, all of the POL Loan Properties were included as part of the borrowing base under the Credit Facility.
We will be unable to pay liquidating distributions until we repay the release amounts required to be paid upon sales of POL Loan Properties under the POL Loans, which may delay the timing of liquidating distributions. 
WWP Option
We are generally not permitted to engage in any business activities while implementing the Liquidation Plan, except to exercise the WWP Option to purchase additional equity interests in Worldwide Plaza, pursuant to the terms of the joint venture agreement. The purchase price required to exercise the WWP Option equals the product of the percentage interest being acquired and the agreed-upon property value of approximately $1.4 billion (subject to certain adjustments, including adjustments for any of our preferred return in arrears) minus the principal balance of the outstanding mortgage and mezzanine debt encumbering the Worldwide Plaza property, which was $875.0 million as of December 31, 2016. 
We have the right to exercise the WWP Option by giving notice to our joint venture partner and making a $30.0 million deposit at any time during the period commencing January 1, 2017 through June 30, 2017, and we intend to exercise the WWP Option during this period with respect to all the equity interests in Worldwide Plaza, subject to our joint venture partner’s right to retain up to 1.2% of our joint venture partner’s membership interest. In accordance with the terms of the WWP Option, the closing of any purchase of additional equity interests in Worldwide Plaza would occur between 30 and 90 days after we give notice of our exercise of the WWP Option, subject to extension for up to 60 days if necessary to satisfy the loan assumption conditions described below. The Worldwide Plaza property would remain subject to the mortgage and mezzanine debt encumbering the Worldwide Plaza property in connection with any purchase of additional equity interests in Worldwide Plaza pursuant to our exercise of the WWP Option. In order to keep the mortgage and mezzanine debt encumbering the Worldwide Plaza property in place, we must satisfy certain loan assumption conditions, including meeting a minimum net worth requirement of $750.0 million and a minimum value of real estate assets controlled (through ownership or management) requirement of $2.0 billion (exclusive of our interest in the Worldwide Plaza property and cash). While we believe we currently meet such tests, there can be no assurance that we will meet them at the time that we desire to exercise the WWP Option. If we do not exercise the WWP Option, we will be subject to a fee in the amount of $25.0 million. 
We expect to fund the estimated $270.0 million in cash required at the closing of our purchase of additional equity interests in Worldwide Plaza primarily with proceeds from the POL Loans and cash on hand.
Tax Status
We elected and qualified to be taxed as a REIT under Sections 856 through 860 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), effective for our taxable year ended December 31, 2010. We believe that, commencing with such taxable year, we have been organized and operated in a manner so that we qualify for taxation as a REIT under the Code. We intend to continue to operate in such a manner during our liquidation process, but no assurance can be given that we will operate in a manner so as to remain qualified for taxation as a REIT. Despite having adopted the Liquidation Plan, in order to continue to qualify for taxation as a REIT we must, among other things, continue to distribute annually at least 90% of our REIT taxable income (which does not equal net income as calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP")) determined without regard for the deduction for dividends paid and excluding net capital gains, and must comply with a number of other organizational and operational requirements until we have completely liquidated. If we continue to qualify for taxation as a REIT, we generally will not be subject to federal corporate income tax on that portion of our REIT taxable income that we distribute to our stockholders. Even if we qualify for taxation as a REIT, we may be subject to certain state and local taxes on our income and properties as well as federal income and excise taxes on our undistributed income.

Competition
The New York City real estate market is highly competitive and there are many competing properties in the New York MSA. With respect to the assets that we own, we compete for tenants based on a number of factors that include location, rental rates, security, suitability of the property's design to prospective tenants' needs and the manner in which the property is operated and marketed. Many competitors have substantially greater marketing budgets and financial resources than we do which could limit our success when we compete with them directly. Competition could have a material effect on our occupancy levels, rental rates and on property operating expenses. We also may compete with other entities advised or sponsored by affiliates of the Service Provider for tenants.
Subsequent to the adoption of the Liquidation Plan we have competition from other properties located in the New York City real estate market both from an operations perspective and with respect to the disposition of our assets. We cannot assure you that the competitive pressures we face will not have a material adverse effect on our business and our net assets in liquidation.
Regulations
Our investments are subject to various federal, state and local laws, ordinances and regulations, including, among other things, zoning regulations, land use controls, environmental controls relating to air and water quality, noise pollution and indirect environmental impacts such as increased motor vehicle activity. We believe that we have all permits and approvals necessary under current law to operate our investments.
Environmental
As an owner of real estate, we are subject to various environmental laws of federal, state and local governments. Compliance with existing laws has not had a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations, and management does not believe it will have such an impact in the future. However, we cannot predict the impact of unforeseen environmental contingencies or new or changed laws or regulations on properties in which we hold an interest.
Employees
We have no employees. The employees of the Advisor, the Service Provider and their affiliates perform a full range of real estate services for us, including property management, accounting, legal, asset management and investor relations services.
We are dependent on these affiliates for services that are essential to us, including asset dispositions, asset and property management and other general administrative responsibilities. 
Financial Information About Industry Segments
All of our consolidated revenues are from our consolidated real estate properties. We internally evaluate operating performance on an individual property level and view all of our real estate assets as one industry segment; accordingly, all of our properties are aggregated into one reportable segment. See our consolidated financial statements beginning on page F-1 for our revenues from tenants, net income or loss, total assets and other financial information.
