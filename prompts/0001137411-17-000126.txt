Our Company's heritage is rooted in the Collins Radio Company, established in 1933. Rockwell Collins, Inc., the parent company, is incorporated in Delaware. As used herein, the terms "we", "us", "our", "Rockwell Collins" or the "Company" include subsidiaries and predecessors unless the context indicates otherwise.
Whenever reference is made in any Item of this Annual Report on Form 10-K to information in our Proxy Statement for the Annual Meeting of Shareowners to be held on February 1, 2018 (2018 Proxy Statement), such information shall be deemed to be incorporated herein by such reference.
All date references contained herein relate to our fiscal year ending on the Friday closest to September 30 unless otherwise stated. For ease of presentation, September 30 is utilized consistently throughout this report to represent the fiscal year end date. Fiscal years 2017, 2016 and 2015 were 52-week fiscal years.
Proposed Acquisition by United Technologies Corporation
On September 4, 2017, the Company entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”) with United Technologies Corporation, a Delaware corporation (“UTC”), and Riveter Merger Sub Corp., a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of UTC (“Merger Sub”). Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, at the closing, Merger Sub will merge with and into Rockwell Collins, with Rockwell Collins surviving as a wholly owned subsidiary of UTC (the “UTC Merger”).
Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, at the effective time of the UTC Merger (the “Effective Time”), each share of Rockwell Collins common stock, par value $0.01 per share, issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than (1) shares held by Rockwell Collins as treasury stock, UTC, or any subsidiaries of Rockwell Collins or UTC and (2) shares held by a holder who has properly exercised and perfected (and not effectively withdrawn or lost) such holder’s demand for appraisal rights under Section 262 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, which in each case will be treated as described in the Merger Agreement) will be converted into the right to receive (1) $93.33 in cash, without interest, plus (2) a fraction of a share of UTC common stock having a value equal to the quotient obtained by dividing $46.67 by the average of the volume-weighted average prices per share of UTC common stock on the New York Stock Exchange for each of the 20 consecutive trading days ending with the trading day immediately prior to the closing date (the “UTC stock price”), subject to a two-way collar mechanism described below (together, the “Merger Consideration”), less any applicable withholding taxes. 
The fraction of a share of UTC common stock into which each such share of Rockwell Collins common stock will be converted is referred to as the exchange ratio. The exchange ratio will depend upon the UTC stock price. If the UTC stock price is greater than $107.01 but less than $124.37, the exchange ratio will be equal to the quotient of (i) $46.67 divided by (ii) the UTC stock price, which, in each case, will result in the stock consideration having a value equal to $46.67. If the UTC stock price is less than or equal to $107.01 or greater than or equal to $124.37, a two-way collar mechanism will apply, pursuant to which (i) if the UTC stock price is greater than or equal to $124.37, the exchange ratio will be fixed at 0.37525 and the value of the stock consideration will be more than $46.67, and (ii) if the UTC stock price is less than or equal to $107.01, the exchange ratio will be fixed at 0.43613 and the value of the stock consideration will be less than $46.67.
The completion of the UTC Merger is subject to customary conditions, including, without limitation, (1) the approval of the UTC Merger by Rockwell Collins shareowners, (2) the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting period under the 
 1

Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, (3) the receipt of other required regulatory approvals, (4) the absence of any order or law that has the effect of enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the completion of the UTC Merger or resulting in the occurrence of certain conditions specified in the Merger Agreement, (5) the absence of a material adverse effect on Rockwell Collins and UTC and (6) the approval for listing of the shares of common stock of UTC forming part of the Merger Consideration on the New York Stock Exchange and the effectiveness of a registration statement on Form S-4 with respect to such common stock. The completion of the UTC Merger is not subject to the approval of UTC’s shareowners or the receipt of financing by UTC.
The Company and UTC have made customary representations and warranties in the Merger Agreement. The Merger Agreement also contains customary covenants and agreements, including covenants and agreements relating to (a) the conduct of each of the Company’s and UTC’s respective businesses between the date of the signing of the Merger Agreement and the consummation of the UTC Merger, and (b) the efforts of the parties to cause the UTC Merger to be completed.
The Merger Agreement includes termination provisions for both Rockwell Collins and UTC. The Merger Agreement provides that the Company may be required to pay UTC a termination fee equal to $695 million if the Merger Agreement is terminated by the Company under certain circumstances described in the Merger Agreement.

Our largest customers have substantial bargaining power with respect to price and other commercial terms. Although we believe that we generally enjoy good relations with our customers, the loss of all or a substantial portion of our sales to any of our large volume customers for any reason, including the loss of contracts, bankruptcy, reduced or delayed customer requirements, strikes or other work stoppages affecting production by these customers, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
 5

Competition
We operate in a highly competitive environment. Principal competitive factors include total cost of ownership, product and system performance, network coverage, quality, service, warranty and indemnification terms, technology, design engineering capabilities, new product innovation and timely delivery. We compete worldwide with a number of U.S. and non-U.S. companies in each of our businesses. Many of these competitors are also our suppliers or customers. Principal competitors include BAE Systems Aerospace, Inc.; CAE Inc.; Diehl Aerosystems Holding GmBH; Elbit Systems Ltd.; Esterline Technologies Corp.; FlightSafety International; Garmin International Inc.; General Dynamics Corporation; General Electric Co.; Groupe Zodiac Aerospace S.A.; Harris Corp.; Honeywell International, Inc.; Jamco America, Inc.; L3 Communications, Inc.; Northrop Grumman Corp.; Raytheon Co.; Recaro Aircraft Seating GmbH & Co. KG; Satcom Direct, Inc.; SITA; Thales S.A.; The Boeing Company; and Thompson Aero Seating Ltd. Several of our competitors are significantly larger than we are in terms of resources and market share and can offer a broader range of products. We believe that our systems, products and services are well positioned to compete in our served markets.
Industry consolidation has from time to time had a major impact on the competitive environment in which we operate. Our competitors periodically undertake mergers, alliances and realignments that contribute to a dynamic competitive landscape. We have contributed to this changing landscape in the past three years by completing a significant acquisition (B/E Aerospace, Inc.), four smaller acquisitions and several strategic alliances to improve our competitive position and expand our market reach. 
Raw Materials, Supplies and Working Capital
We believe we have adequate sources for the supply of raw materials and components for our manufacturing and service needs with suppliers located around the world. Electronic components and other raw materials used in the manufacturing of our products are generally available from several suppliers. We continue to work with our supply base for raw materials and components to ensure an adequate source of supply, utilizing strategic alliances, dual sourcing, identification of substitute or alternate parts that meet performance requirements and life-time buys. These life-time buys involve purchases of multiple years of supply in order to meet production and service requirements over the life span of a product. Although historically we have not experienced any significant difficulties in obtaining an adequate supply of raw materials and components necessary for our manufacturing operations or service needs, the loss of a significant supplier or the inability of a supplier to meet performance and quality specifications or delivery schedules could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
Our investment in inventory is a significant part of our working capital, and historically we have maintained sufficient inventory to meet our customers' requirements on a timely basis. This investment includes production stock, work-in-process, pre-production engineering costs, finished goods, spare parts and goods on consignment. Our accounts receivable also constitute a significant part of our working capital. Accounts receivable includes unbilled receivables which are primarily related to sales recorded under the percentage-of-completion method of accounting in accordance with applicable contract terms that have not been billed to customers. The critical accounting policies involving pre-production engineering costs and long-term contracts are discussed under the caption Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Item 7 below. Additional information relating to accounts receivable and inventory is contained in Notes 2, 5 and 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 below.
Backlog

(1) Customer-funded R&D includes activities relating to the development of new products and the improvement of existing products for which we are reimbursed by our customers. Customer-funded R&D also includes amortization of pre-production engineering costs as disclosed in Note 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 below. 
(2) Total R&D investment consists of company- and customer-funded R&D expenditures as well as the net increase in pre-production engineering costs capitalized within inventory. As disclosed in Note 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 below, pre-production engineering costs capitalized within inventory were $1.175 billion and $1.140 billion at September 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively. A description of the critical accounting policies involving pre-production engineering is included under the caption Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Item 7 below. 
Intellectual Property
Our intellectual property rights include valuable patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets, inventions and other proprietary rights. We own numerous U.S. and foreign patents and have numerous pending patent applications, including patents and patent applications purchased in our acquisitions. We also license certain patents relating to our manufacturing and other activities. While in the aggregate we consider our patents and licenses important to the operation of our business, we do not consider any individual patent or license to be of such importance that the loss or termination of any one patent or license would materially affect us.
Rockwell Automation, Inc. (Rockwell) owns the "Rockwell" name. In connection with our spin-off from Rockwell in 2001, we were granted the exclusive right to continue to use the Rockwell Collins name for use in our business other than in connection with the Rockwell Automation business or industrial automation products. This exclusive right would terminate following certain change of control events, including the completion of the UTC Merger, as described in our distribution agreement with Rockwell.
Employees
As of September 30, 2017, we had approximately 29,000 employees and approximately 69 percent of them were located in the U.S. Approximately 11 percent of our employees located within the U.S. and 8 percent of our employees located outside of the U.S. are covered by collective bargaining agreements. Many of our employees located outside of the U.S. who are not covered by a collective bargaining agreement are represented by workers' councils or statutory labor unions. The collective bargaining agreements for most of our employees covered by collective bargaining agreements are set to expire in 2018.
 8

Cyclicality and Seasonality
The markets in which we sell our products are, to varying degrees, cyclical and have experienced periodic upswings and downturns. For example, markets for our commercial aerospace products have experienced downturns during periods of slowdowns in the commercial airline industry and during periods of weak conditions in the economy in general, as demand for new aircraft generally declines during these periods. We believe that we are currently benefiting from robust backlogs in commercial air transportation and increasing content as next generation aircraft enter into service. While we believe our Government Systems business is well positioned, it is also subject to some cyclicality, primarily as a result of U.S. Government defense budget cycles. Additional information related to the defense budget environment can be found under the caption Risk Factors in Item 1A below.
Our business tends to be seasonal with our fourth quarter usually producing relatively higher sales and cash flow and our first quarter usually producing relatively lower sales and cash flow. A large part of this seasonality variance is attributable to our Government Systems business and relates to the U.S. Government procurement cycle.
Regulatory Matters
As a defense contractor, our contract costs are audited and reviewed on a continual basis by the Defense Contract Management Agency and the Defense Contract Audit Agency. Audits and investigations are conducted from time to time to determine if our performance and administration of our U.S. Government contracts are compliant with applicable contractual requirements and procurement regulations and other applicable federal statutes and regulations. Under present U.S. Government procurement regulations, if indicted or adjudged in violation of procurement or other federal civil laws, a contractor, such as us, could be subject to fines, penalties, repayments or other damages. U.S. Government regulations also provide that certain findings against a contractor may lead to suspension or debarment from eligibility for awards of new U.S. Government contracts for up to three years. In addition, we are subject to various non-U.S. governmental contracting requirements.
The sale, installation and operation of our products in commercial aviation applications is subject to continued compliance with applicable regulatory requirements and future changes to those requirements. In the U.S., our commercial aviation products are required to comply with FAA regulations governing production and quality systems, airworthiness and installation approvals, repair procedures and continuing operational safety. Some of our products, such as radio frequency transmitters and receivers, must also comply with Federal Communications Commission (FCC) regulations governing authorization and operational approval of telecommunications equipment. Our communication services offered in the Information Management Services business are also subject to certain FCC regulations.
Internationally, similar requirements exist for communication services, airworthiness, installation and operational approvals. These requirements are administered by the national aviation authorities of each country and, in the case of Europe, coordinated by the European Joint Aviation Authorities. Many countries also impose specific telecommunications equipment requirements, administered through their national aviation authorities or telecommunications authorities. In Europe, approval to import products also requires compliance with European Commission directives, such as those associated with electrical safety, electro-magnetic compatibility, use of metric units of measurement and restrictions on the use of lead.
Products already in service may also become subject to mandatory changes for continued regulatory compliance as a result of any identified safety issue, which can arise from an aircraft accident, incident or service difficulty report.
Our products and technical data are controlled for export and import under various regulatory agencies. Audits and investigations by these agencies are a regular occurrence to ensure compliance with applicable federal statutes and regulations. Violations, including as a successor to an acquired business, can result in fines and penalties assessed against the Company as well as individuals, and the most egregious acts may result in a complete loss of export privileges.
Various anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws, as well as data privacy laws, are applicable to our business operations throughout the world. 
Although we do not have any significant regulatory action pending against us, any such action could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
 9

Environmental Matters
Federal, state and local requirements relating to the discharge of substances into the environment, the disposal of hazardous waste and other activities affecting the environment have had and will continue to have an impact on our manufacturing operations. To date, compliance with environmental requirements and resolution of environmental claims have been accomplished without material effect on our liquidity and capital resources, competitive position or financial condition. We believe that our expenditures for environmental capital investment and remediation necessary to comply with present regulations governing environmental protection and other expenditures for the resolution of environmental claims will not have a material adverse effect on our business or financial condition. Additional information on environmental matters is contained in Note 18 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 below.
Geographic Information
Our principal markets outside the U.S. are in France, Canada, China, the United Kingdom, the United Arab Emirates, Germany, Japan, Qatar, Brazil, South Korea, Taiwan, Russia, Singapore, Italy, Australia and Hong Kong. In addition to normal business risks, operations outside the U.S. are subject to other risks, including political, economic and social environments, governmental laws and regulations and currency revaluations and fluctuations.
Selected financial information by major geographic area for each of the three years in the period ended September 30, 2017, 2016 and 2015 is contained in Note 21 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 below.
