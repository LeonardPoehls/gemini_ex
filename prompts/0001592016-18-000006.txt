ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
AgroFresh Solutions, Inc. (the “Company”, “AgroFresh”, “we”, “us” or “our) is a global leader in delivering innovative food preservation and waste reduction solutions for fresh produce. The Company is empowering the food industry with Smarter FreshnessTM, a range of integrated solutions designed to help growers, packers and retailers improve produce freshness and quality while reducing waste. AgroFresh’s solutions range from pre-harvest with HarvistaTM and LandSpringTM to its marquee SmartFreshTM Quality System, which includes SmartFreshTM, AdvanStoreTM and ActiMistTM, working together to maintain the quality of stored produce. AgroFresh has a controlling interest in Tecnidex Fruit Protection, S.A.U. (“Tecnidex”), a leading provider of post-harvest fungicides, waxes and biocides for the citrus market. Additionally, the company’s initial retail solution, RipeLockTM, optimizes banana ripening for the benefit of retailers and consumers. AgroFresh has key products registered in over 45 countries, supports approximately 3,700 direct customers and services over 25,000 storage rooms globally.
AgroFresh uses proprietary technology to regulate the ripening effects of ethylene, the naturally occurring plant hormone that triggers ripening in certain fruits and vegetables. Our portfolio of products, that span the supply chain of fresh produce, from orchard to retail shelves, differentiates us compared to other companies that have more narrow product offerings. The active ingredient of several of our products, 1-Methylcyclopropene ("1-MCP"), blocks the effects of ethylene. All of AgroFresh’s 1-MCP products are naturally biodegradable and leaves no detectable residue, which has significant consumer appeal. 
We believe that SmartFresh our current principal product preserves the texture, firmness, taste, and appearance of produce during storage, transportation, and retail display. SmartFresh allows growers and packers to deliver “just harvested” freshness on a year-round basis, and enables retailers to increase customer satisfaction with fresh, high quality produce. An integral part of the SmartFresh sales process is a direct service model providing customers with on-site applications of SmartFresh at their storage facilities together with value-added advisory services.
AgroFresh has two solutions for the pre-harvest market. Our Harvista™ technology is used in pre-harvest management of pome fruit, such as apples and pears. Just as we believe SmartFresh revolutionized post-harvest apple storage, we believe Harvista can have a similar impact in the orchard. Harvista slows ripening (starch conversion), reduces fruit drop, and holds fruit on the tree longer to promote better color and fruit size, thereby bringing new benefits to the grower and the retailer. It also extends the harvest window to allow growers maximum flexibility in harvest timing while providing peace of mind. LandSpring is a plant-growth regulator ("PGR") for pre-transplant use on seedlings to help them withstand transplanting and other stresses encountered in the field. 2017 was the first year of sales for LandSpring and it received positive reaction from key launch customers.
Our range of solutions for packers and distributors includes innovative storage monitoring systems, StorEdge and AdvanStore, as well as a new delivery system for fungicides, ActiMist. StorEdge and AdvanStore provide customers insights into their storage rooms to help them better manage their storage inventory. Through its novel thermofogging application, ActiMist introduces a better and more efficient way to apply fungicides to stored apples that saves customers money and reduces the complexity of their fungicide protocols. Tecnidex broadens our portfolio of products to post-harvest fungicides, waxes, and biocides, primarily for the citrus market.
RipeLock, a solution designed to improve the quality and consumer appeal of bananas, combines proprietary modified atmosphere packaging and 1-MCP. RipeLock is sold to retailers and enables them to offer consumers bananas that are in better condition and hold the consumer-preferred color longer, reducing shrink and increasing sales. AgroFresh also has a commercial agreement with Food Freshness Technology Holdings Limited ("FFT") that permits us to offer retailers their It’s Fresh!TM ethylene absorbing filters, another novel technology to preserve the freshness of produce at retail.
History
We are a former blank check company that completed our initial public offering on February 19, 2014. On July 31, 2015 (the “Closing Date”), we consummated a business combination (the “Business Combination”) pursuant to a Stock Purchase Agreement, dated April 30, 2015 (the “Purchase Agreement”), with The Dow Chemical Company (“Dow”), providing for the acquisition by us of the AgroFresh business from Dow, resulting in AgroFresh Inc. becoming our wholly-owned, indirect subsidiary. On the Closing Date, we changed our name from Boulevard Acquisition Corp. to AgroFresh Solutions, Inc. Prior to 
4

the closing of the Business Combination, the business that now comprises our business was operated through a combination of wholly-owned subsidiaries and operations of Dow, including through AgroFresh Inc. in the United States.
In December 2017, AgroFresh acquired a controlling interest in Tecnidex, a leading provider of post-harvest fungicides, waxes, and biocides for the citrus market. With this acquisition, AgroFresh expanded its industry-leading post-harvest presence into additional crops, and increased its penetration of the produce market in southern Europe, Latin America and Africa. 
For over 35 years, Tecnidex has been helping fruit and vegetable producers offer clean, safe and high-quality products to customers in 18 countries. Through its portfolio of post-harvest products, technology, consulting, and after-sale services, Tecnidex improves the quality and value of its clients’ fruit and vegetables while respecting the environment. Tecnidex is based in Valencia, Spain.
In December of 2017, AgroFresh invested approximately $10 million for an approximate 15% ownership stake in and entered into a commercial agreement with FFT, provider of the award-winning It’s Fresh! ethylene removal filters in North America, Europe, the Middle East and Africa (“EMEA”) and Latin America. The proprietary active ingredient of It’s Fresh! has been found to be 100 times more powerful than any other ethylene-absorbing substances, providing a powerful tool to preserve food freshness. We expect It’s Fresh! to complement the RipeLockTM Quality System, our retail solution for extending the freshness of bananas. Through our commercial agreement with FFT, AgroFresh will market It’s Fresh! for high value crops such as berries, stone fruit, avocadoes, tomatoes and cherries, and open up new opportunities to address food waste in retail. FFT’s filters create a protective "Freshasphere"TM around fruit and vegetables to significantly improve their quality, reduce waste and increase sales. Although both companies will continue to operate independently, a key goal of the mutual collaboration is to increase penetration of each company’s respective technology at leading retailers. Where FFT has developed strong retailer relationships, it will serve as a sales agent for AgroFresh’s RipeLock program and AgroFresh will perform the same role for FFT’s It’s Fresh!TM filters with AgroFresh’s retail partners.
We are subject to extensive national, state and local government regulations. We have completed more than 400 comprehensive international health and environmental tests that have shown the AgroFresh family of products, including SmartFresh and Harvista to be safe for consumers, workers, and the environment. 1-MCP, the active ingredient in the AgroFresh products is metabolized by the natural processes in fruits and leaves no residue. The AgroFresh products have been approved by over 50 authorities including the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the European Commission.
Competitive Strengths

We believe that the following strengths differentiate us from our competitors and serve as the foundation for our continued growth:

Global Agricultural Innovator with Proprietary Technical Know-How and Solutions. We are an agricultural innovator with operations in over 45 countries. Our scientists and research staff are leaders in the field of post-harvest physiology. Since the launch of SmartFresh in 2002, we have developed an extensive and exclusive database on produce physiology and preferences of our approximately 3,700 customers. Using this extensive proprietary technical expertise, AgroFresh provides a range of integrated solutions. SmartFresh delivers a step-change in storage solutions for apples and pears, allowing for significantly less waste and greater productivity, as well as a constant supply of high quality fruit throughout the year. We believe Harvista has the potential to significantly impact the pre-harvest stage, allowing apple and pear growers to better manage their harvest, reduce waste and improve fruit quality. With StorEdge and AdvanStore, we expect to be able to provide packers unparalleled information about the condition of their fruit while in cold storage using novel monitoring technologies. The introduction of ActiMist, a fungicide platform delivered via thermofogging offers a more efficient and quicker application of fungicides in storage rooms, simplifying operations and reducing complexity. The combination of Harvista, SmartFresh, ActiMist, StorEdge and AdvanStore offers apple and pear growers a unique solution to improve the results they are able to deliver to their customers. LandSpring is an additional pre-harvest technology that benefits seedling growers by making the seedlings less sensitive to stresses such as heat, cold and flooding. RipeLock is an innovative fruit quality management system for bananas, offering flexibility and consistency to growers, ripeners and retailers to deliver bananas at a ripeness preferred by consumers. We believe that our storage solutions and portfolio of pre- and post-harvest services are well positioned to help address customer needs. The acquisition of a controlling interest in Tecnidex and the investment in FFT reflect our ability to expand beyond 1-MCP solutions and develop additional sources of revenue through a variety of crops.
Compelling Benefits for Value Chain. Consumer surveys have found that freshness is the most important driver of satisfaction with produce purchased at retail. The ability to store produce longer while preserving just-harvested quality allows growers and packers to extend their marketing window and capitalize on seasonal pricing trends. We believe that SmartFresh revolutionized the apple industry by allowing growers and packers to meet year-round consumer demand for just-harvested quality. This 
5

extension of post-harvest life substantially increases the value of produce that is harvested on a seasonal basis but is sold to consumers throughout the year, particularly during the summer months when apple prices have historically peaked. The cost of SmartFresh translates into less than one cent per pound of apples, and can provide up to a 20-fold increase in value to the grower or packer over the cost of the service. Due to its high effectiveness and low cost relative to the value of the crop treated, we believe that SmartFresh provides compelling benefits across the value chain, from grower to retailer.

Unique Business Model with Sustainable Competitive Strengths. AgroFresh’s direct service model comprises not only product applications but also “mission critical” advisory services. We have established a global footprint with operations in over 45 countries, allowing us to make over 38,000 monitored applications of SmartFresh in 2017. We currently have approximately 40 employees in research and development working in seven AgroFresh locations around the world and at numerous research institutes and customer sites. This infrastructure investment has allowed us, over the past decade, to amass a proprietary database of technical data regarding the effective use of SmartFresh with a wide range of apple varieties in variable conditions. Our advisory services utilize this information to assist customers in maximizing the profitability of their operations. We believe that our direct service model, extensive technical know-how, and brand loyalty will continue to sustain our competitive strengths. The credibility and trust this business model has created positions AgroFresh well to provide existing and new customers with other solutions such as storage monitoring and fungicides.

Multiple Drivers of Future Growth. The market penetration of apples treated with SmartFresh outside the U.S. has been growing but has not yet reached the levels achieved in the U.S. We are increasing our sales and marketing efforts in non-U.S. regions to seek to capture these penetration opportunities and are working to increase the use of SmartFresh on other crops, including pears, kiwifruit, plums, and bananas. Harvista extends our proprietary technology into pre-harvest management of apples and pears. Harvista is undergoing an expanded commercial launch in the U.S. We also currently sell Harvista in Turkey, Argentina and Israel, and plan further launches in South Africa and Chile soon. In addition, we are investing in and launching new solutions that we anticipate will drive continued business growth. LandSpring is another pre-harvest application approved for use on tomato and pepper seedlings and 14 other crops. It is applied to seedlings prior to transplant from the plant house to the field because transplanting is a stress event that causes the plant to produce ethylene. LandSpring blocks the negative effects of ethylene and allows for increased plant vigor including better root establishment, development of greater leaf surface, and less susceptibility to disease which all can lead to better yields. StorEdge and AdvanStore offer atmospheric monitoring that storage operators are not capable of achieving with existing controlled atmosphere (“CA”) technology. This advanced monitoring system is being developed with our extensive understanding of fruit physiology, fruit respiration, current CA technology, and new proprietary diagnostic tools for measuring fruit volatiles and is designed to provide solutions to customers to help them protect the value of their crops. ActiMist is a platform for delivering fungicides in the storage rooms via thermofogging which enable packhouses to get their storage rooms to desired conditions faster and with less complexity. RipeLock combines 1-MCP with modified atmosphere packaging designed specifically for preserving the quality of bananas during transportation and extending their yellow shelf life for retailers and consumers.

High Customer Touch and Retention. Our personnel interact with our customers face to face throughout the year to address all aspects of post-harvest operations and a variety of customer specific issues to improve the economics of growers and packers. We believe that this, in turn, has produced a high level of customer retention and trust in our products and services.

Proven Management Team. Our management team has extensive agricultural and related industry experience, long-standing customer relationships, and a long track record of success in bringing valuable services and solutions to market. Commercial and technical experts are located in key geographies worldwide to provide on-site advisory services, which help customers optimize crop potential. We encourage an independent and entrepreneurial spirit among our management team and employees.

Industry Overview

Food Preservation and Freshness

According to the FAO, over 1.3 billion tons of food, or approximately one third of the total food produced worldwide, is lost to spoilage or waste each year, including food valued at an estimated $48.3 billion in the U.S. alone. An October 2013 TESCO Consumer Study found that nearly 45% of all fresh fruits and vegetables, including 40% of apples and 20% of bananas, are lost to spoilage. Loss or waste along the food supply chain has a variety of causes, including degradation of fresh produce during storage and transportation.
Food waste is a major economic cost for retailers. A large percentage of food waste at the retail level is based on qualitative factors related to consumer perception of freshness. A consumer survey conducted by Oliver Wyman and Ipsos Interactive in 
6

the U.S. in 2007 indicated that freshness is the most important driver of customer satisfaction with a store’s produce department.

Pre-Harvest Treatments

Pre-harvest treatments commonly used to increase the value of crops and reduce pre-harvest losses include the use of
“plant growth regulators” (“PGRs”). PGRs influence the rate of growth or development of crops or affect their reaction to stress events such as harsh weather. PGRs interact with the biochemical make-up of the plant and work by mimicking or blocking the production of naturally occurring plant hormones, like ethylene. Blocking the production of ethylene allows a grower to slow down the maturation of fruit to achieve better control over the timing of harvest. PGRs have a range of effectiveness depending on factors such as environmental conditions and the timing of application

Post-Harvest Treatments

Post-harvest treatments to maximize quality and reduce loss include treatments to manage the effects of ethylene and to prevent microbial contamination. Naturally occurring ethylene triggers the acceleration of ripening in certain crops which results in a reduction of post-harvest life.
One class of post-harvest treatments enhances quality and reduces losses by controlling the environment in which produce is stored. CA and Dynamic Controlled Atmosphere (“DCA”) systems are used to keep stored crops within their optimal ranges of temperature and levels of oxygen and carbon dioxide. Specific oxygen and carbon dioxide levels can lower respiration in fresh produce and delay ripening. CA systems have been used for many decades with fruits and vegetables to preserve freshness. DCA, a more recent innovation, seeks to adjust levels of oxygen and carbon dioxide dynamically as the produce in storage breathes and matures. CA and DCA are only effective at preserving freshness while the fruit is kept in cold storage. However, 1-MCP treatments have been found to be complementary to these technologies by helping to better maintain the quality of apples during cold storage and maintaining freshness for up to 90 days after the apples are removed from cold storage.

Our Business

We are an agricultural innovator in proprietary advanced technologies that enhance the freshness, quality, and value of fresh produce. We currently offer SmartFresh applications at customer sites predominately through a direct service model utilizing third-party contractors. We also provide advisory services based on our extensive knowledge on the use of 1-MCP collected through thousands of monitored applications done as a part of the service model. We operate in over 45 countries and derive the majority of our revenue working with customers to protect the value of apples, pears and other produce during storage. We also offer Harvista pre-harvest technology in the U.S, Argentina, Turkey, Israel, Chile and South Africa. LandSpring, an additional pre-harvest technology for seedlings, is being marketed primarily in the U.S. RipeLock, an innovative quality management system is being marketed in the U.S., Europe and Australia. ActiMist, a platform of foggable fungicides was launched in the U.S. and is being expanded into other countries subject to regulatory approval. Line extensions and new services are planned for introduction to seek to strengthen our global position in post-harvest storage and to capitalize on adjacent growth opportunities in pre-harvest markets.
Tecnidex’s business, focused on citrus, is mainly concentrated in southern Europe and North Africa and expands our product offering into other types of fungicides, as well as waxes and coatings.
1-MCP, the active ingredient in SmartFresh, LandSpring, Harvista and RipeLock, is an ethylene action inhibitor with a proven ability to maintain freshness and extend the shelf life of certain fresh produce. The 1-MCP molecule is structurally similar to ethylene, a naturally occurring plant hormone that occurs in certain fruits and vegetables. Ethylene helps produce grow and ripen, but eventually causes over-ripening and spoilage. 1-MCP works by blocking the ethylene receptors in plant cells, which temporarily delays the ripening process, enabling the produce to better maintain the qualities associated with freshness.
Today, two types of SmartFresh formulations are used to deliver 1-MCP into store rooms, powder and tablets. In a typical SmartFresh powder application, an AgroFresh service provider mixes a pouch of water-soluble powder with water in a SmartFresh generator and activates the generator to release the gaseous form of 1-MCP in the sealed storeroom. When using tablets, a service provider adds the tablets into a prepackaged formulated solution, the tablets dissolve in the solution and the gaseous form of 1-MCP is released in the storeroom. The gas released by either process interacts with the stored fruit, and firmly binds to the fruit’s ethylene receptor sites.
7

Fruits and vegetables are classified as climacteric or non-climacteric, a term referring to the process of fruit maturation. The climacteric event is a stage of fruit ripening associated with higher ethylene production and changes in the fruit including pigment changes and sugar release. The climacteric event marks the peak of edible ripeness, with fruits having the best taste and texture for consumption. The role of SmartFresh is to delay the onset of the climacteric stage until the product is ready for consumption. Apples, pears, kiwifruit, plums, persimmon, bananas, melons, peaches, and tomatoes are examples of climacteric fruit. Our management continues to evaluate the commercial value of 1-MCP with a range of other climacteric fruit.

SmartFresh Value Proposition

The value of SmartFresh with any crop is determined by both the biological efficacy with that crop and the utility value the application delivers to the customer. The biological efficacy with apples is high; apples are sensitive to ethylene and SmartFresh is effective at delaying ripening. In addition, SmartFresh brings high utility value by helping to keep apples fresh year-round despite their limited harvest window. This has resulted in the widespread adoption of SmartFresh by apple growers and packers throughout the world. The cost of SmartFresh translates into less than one cent per pound of apples, which is small relative to both the value of the crop and the importance of maintaining the quality of that crop during storage. The use of SmartFresh gives growers and packers the ability to store apples from one season to the next without losing their just picked quality characteristics.
Beneficial effects of SmartFresh have been proven across numerous apple varieties throughout the world. SmartFresh is also effective with other crops, including pears, kiwifruit, plums, persimmons, avocados, and flowers, the latter marketed under the EthylBloc brand name and various private label brands.
SmartFresh Service Model

We believe that we have developed deep, trusted relationships with our customers by combining our effective SmartFresh product with application expertise and trusted advisory services. Over the past decade we have amassed a valuable proprietary database of technical information on the best practices for the effective use of SmartFresh on a wide range of apple and pear varieties. The advisory services component utilizes this information to help maximize the profitability of our customers’ operations.
Seasonality

Our business is highly seasonal, driven by the timing of harvests in the northern and southern hemispheres. The first half of the year is when the southern hemisphere harvest occurs and the second half of the year is when the northern hemisphere harvest occurs. Since the northern hemisphere harvest is typically larger, a significant portion of our sales are historically generated in the second half of the year. In addition to this seasonality, factors such as weather patterns may impact the timing of the harvest within the two halves of the year.
Our Other Products

Harvista

Harvista is a pre-harvest management product that brings ethylene management into orchards and fields. Our Harvista product line includes several proprietary 1-MCP formulations that are specifically designed to keep fruit on the tree longer, which allows more color and size development and reduces fruit stress.
Harvista provides flexibility for fruit harvesters when it is needed the most - within a few days before harvest or when bad weather strikes. Additionally, application prior to, or following, a stress event such as bad weather helps to reduce the incidence of fruit drop or other adverse reactions triggered by these events, which can lower crop yields and cause significant economic loss. We believe the flexibility to apply treatment close to harvest provides growers using Harvista with valuable harvest management benefits compared to competing solutions using older technology that require applications well in advance of harvest.
Harvista extends the “ideal harvest window,” the period during which fruit quality is at its peak, by keeping the fruit on the tree longer. For pome fruits, Harvista can extend the length of the harvest window for up to an additional 14 days. This added flexibility creates significant benefits both in terms of harvest logistics and crop profitability. Widening the harvest window allows for better scheduling and the optimization of limited resources, such as harvest crews and equipment. The extended harvest window can result in increased average size and weight of fruit. Overall, the value of the crop is enhanced by bigger average sizes, better color, and fewer defects.

We offer Harvista for apples and pears through a pre-scheduled application service including aerial and/or ground applications. Typically, our technical staff designs the protocol in consultation with the customer, and third-party service providers make the applications. We have also implemented a program to allow customers to make their own applications through AgroFresh-owned sprayers or using kits to modify the customers' own sprayers. This gives orchard operators flexibility to manage the application timing to meet orchard conditions.
Harvista is currently available in the U.S., Turkey, Argentina, Israel, Chile, and South Africa, and the Company is currently compiling data for registrations in ten more countries, which are expected to be granted on a country by country basis over the next five years. In 2017, we received regulatory approval to apply Harvista to cherries. Additional registrations and label expansions are expected to be pursued as new formulations and/or crop concepts are validated.
StorEdge & AdvanStore
Our StorEdge and AdvanStore platforms are useful in monitoring the condition of produce during storage. StorEdge provides confirmation, within days that a SmartFresh application was completed successfully and provides additional data about storage room conditions the customers can use to identify issues. The AdvanStore offering includes on-going monitoring, analytics and feedback to enable the customer to more optimally manage the condition of the stored commodity and receive early notice of conditions present in the room that may be detrimental to the quality of the produce. Through internal innovation, use of sophisticated analysis and external alliances, the AdvanStore platform reflects our strategy to provide proprietary complete storage solutions to customers by leveraging our extensive knowledge of fruit physiology. 
RipeLock

RipeLock is an innovative fruit quality management system specifically designed for the banana industry. The patented RipeLock system combines a specially-engineered, micro-perforated form of Modified Atmosphere Packaging (“MAP”) and our proprietary 1-MCP formulation. The combination of MAP with 1-MCP provides greater control over the ripening progression of bananas during shipping, distribution, and display. We believe that bananas handled with RipeLock technology retain their bright-yellow color, firm texture, fresh taste, and appealing look for significantly longer than untreated bananas. As a result, RipeLock maximizes the marketable “yellow life” of the fruit, providing economic benefits to brand owners and retailers. Commercial launch of RipeLock began in 2015, and it is now generating revenue among ripeners, food service companies and retailers in the U.S., Europe and Central/Latin America.
LandSpring
LandSpring technology is a PGR for use on seedlings to help them withstand transplanting and other stresses encountered in the field. LandSpring’s active ingredient, 1-MCP, prevents the ethylene signals that would prompt a stress event in the seedling and reduce growth. Among the number of protective benefits, this technology makes seedlings less sensitive to stresses such as heat, cold, UV radiation, drought, flooding and salinity that often occur after planting. When applied before transplanting, LandSpring results in greater plant vigor and a healthier crop that is better able to withstand adverse environmental conditions and give growers the opportunity to increase yield.

Growth Strategy

Our mission is to provide technology, service and support targeted at preserving the quality, freshness and value of produce, through the value chain, worldwide. We have a high touch, asset light, technology driven solutions philosophy. We intend to pursue profitable growth by building on our current capabilities and competencies, expanding into adjacent markets and pursuing related, accretive acquisitions.
Our focus is to:

• | Strengthen our brand awareness and loyalty through customer relationship programs, intellectual property protection and year-round customer engagement. AgroFresh believes this focus, building on its philosophy of customer intimacy and its sustainable competitive advantages, will allow it to secure and grow its current business.


• | Further penetrate short term cold storage opportunities in all regions. AgroFresh currently provides its offering to over 80% of U.S. apples stored beyond 30 days. This percentage is much lower in Latin America, Asia Pacific and Europe.

9

Penetration is typically driven by the pace of registrations, which were earliest in the U.S., and AgroFresh sees these other geographies presenting further opportunities for growth moving forward, as well as shorter term apple storage opportunities in all regions with existing customers.

• | Extend to other produce, including bananas, pears, and other crops that have the ethylene physiology which responds positively to 1-MCP. One example is RipeLock for bananas. AgroFresh believes it will be able to provide a measurable extension of “yellow life” as well as prevent disorders like split-peel, both of which are highly desired value drivers throughout the supply chain, especially at retail and consumer levels where consistent quality is expected to increase sales.


• | Expand into other segments such as pre-harvest fruit quality management, fungal and microbial control solutions, diagnostics and storage management solutions. Solutions developed in-house include Harvista, LandSpring, ActiMist and AdvanStore.


• | Diversify and grow via alliances and accretive acquisitions, building on our numerous core competencies. AgroFresh anticipates proactively pursuing these opportunities. Our acquisition of a controlling interest in Tecnidex is one such example facilitating our expansion into fungicides, biocides, waxes and coatings. In addition, we expect our agreement with FFT to complement RipeLock by bringing a new type of freshness solution to the same retailers we are engaging.

Operations

We operate in more than 45 countries around the world. Currently, we use a single third-party manufacturer (and have a second supplier qualified), under a long-term contract that includes strong confidentiality obligations, to manufacture our key active ingredient, 1-MCP, and several other third parties, primarily to manufacture formulated products and provide product packaging services. We have no owned manufacturing facilities or manufacturing personnel.
We use a high-touch service model for our commercially available products including SmartFresh and Harvista. Sales and sales support personnel maintain direct relationships with customers year-round, which our technical sales and support personnel work directly with customers to provide value-added advisory services regarding the application of SmartFresh and Harvista. The actual application of SmartFresh and Harvista is performed by service providers that are typically third-party contractors. In addition to providing Harvista full service at customer orchards in 2017, we provide retrofit kits to customers to allow them to use their own sprayers to make applications themselves.
We have a dedicated customer service organization responsible for fulfilling customer-related requirements as well as coordinating all services being delivered by our service providers. During the harvest season, temporary third-party resources are added to the customer service organization to support the high volume of transactions and activities.
Marketing and Sales
Our success depends on our ability to attract and develop the talent to effectively implement our strategy. AgroFresh changed its organizational structure and leadership team to support its strategic growth and diversification objectives. The goal of the organizational change is to consolidate the Company’s core business units under a global general manager while adding leadership and focus to accelerate new business development activities. Over the past year, we have been strengthening and deepening our management organization. We have hired a vice president and global general manager to lead our post-harvest offerings and a director of global retail solutions to lead the RipeLock commercial opportunities.

The Company’s core post-harvest business includes SmartFresh, ActiMist, StorEdge and AdvanStore, all designed to strengthen the company’s leadership in the post-harvest space. There is one global general manager with separate regional leads for North America, EMEA, Latin America and APAC.
The 2017 acquisition of Tecnidex was managed as a separate business unit and integration is well under way in 2018.
The technical sales support group housed within the Research and Development organization, supports the sales team. Technical sales support runs customer-specific trials for local crop varieties or specialized storage and distribution conditions and conducts follow-up with customers. These individuals work closely with customers to provide advice on appropriate protocols for SmartFresh and Harvista applications depending on crop, variety, region, and climatic conditions. The technical sales support group draws on our extensive knowledge base of 1-MCP applications across all regions and conditions.
Marketing and communications functions are organized on a global and regional basis. The regional teams manage the core post-harvest business's marketing needs, while the Global marketing department is responsible for corporate brand stewardship 
10

and communications, as well as serving as a center of excellence to support all product launches, advertising and trade shows. The teams reach out to customers to keep them up to date on the latest research and news about AgroFresh products. Market research, including product penetration, collecting competitive intelligence and tracking other relevant market and industry information, is managed globally in conjunction with the regional teams.

No single customer accounted for more than 10% of net sales in 2017, 2016, or 2015.

Competition

The market for post-harvest solutions is fragmented with various regional suppliers or products. The market for the use of 1-MCP is evolving and we expect to continue to face growing competition as our key patent expires. We compete with other pre- and post-harvest crop preservation providers that have similar product claims and offer potential functional substitutes for our products. Current competitors include: dynamic controlled atmosphere storage companies, including Harvest Watch; Janssen Pharmaceutical and Pace International; and 1-MCP generic sellers such as AgroBest, Fitomag and several Chinese companies. ReTainTM is used pre-harvest for extending the harvest season across all regions with the exception of the European Union. We believe that the principal factors of competition in our industry include reputation, product quality, customer service and intimacy, product innovation, technical service and value creation. We believe that we compete favorably with competitors on the basis of these and other factors. See the subsection titled “Competitive Strengths” above.
Research and Development

Research and development plays an important role at AgroFresh in supporting customers as well as developing line extensions and new products. Approximately half of our research and development resources are located in facilities in North America, with the remainder across the other regions. Approximately 30% of our research and development resources are third-party contractors. During fruit harvest times (August to November in the Northern Hemisphere and late January to early May in the Southern Hemisphere), we hire additional third-party contract scientists to assist AgroFresh in the execution of experiments involving Harvista, SmartFresh, and AdvanStore technologies. Most of the regional research and development facilities focus on business aligned research and development initiatives to develop line extensions and create new products. Research and development makes use of core competencies in a number of technical areas including post-harvest physiology, analytical chemistry, regulatory sciences, regulatory affairs, formulation science, formulation process development, organic chemistry, and delivery systems. Initiatives focused on next generation solutions utilize expertise in molecular biology, postharvest pathology, diagnostics and sensor technology.
Intellectual Property

We are a technology-based solutions provider and, as such, rely on a combination of important intellectual property strengths, including licenses, patents, trademarks, copyrights and trade secret protection laws to protect our proprietary technology and our intellectual property. We seek to control access to and distribution of our proprietary information. We enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, customers, service providers and vendors that generally provide that any confidential or proprietary information developed by us or on our behalf be kept confidential including, but not limited to, information related to our proprietary manufacturing process and SmartFresh service model. In the normal course of business, we provide our intellectual property and/or our products protected by our intellectual property to third parties through licensing or restricted use agreements.
We obtained an exclusive license from North Carolina State University under the Sisler patent (U.S. 5,518,988) for the use of 1-MCP to delay ripening of fruit and flowers. This patent has expired in the United States and Europe and continues only in Japan until May of 2020. We also acquired the Daly patent (U.S. 6,017,849) for the encapsulation complex of 1-MCP and alpha-cyclodextrin, used as the foundational component in SmartFresh and Harvista. Depending on the country, SmartFresh is currently protected by a patent for the encapsulation complex through 2018 or 2019. We have also generated an impressive portfolio of intellectual property with over 30 patents granted in at least one country (pending in other countries) covering 1-MCP and next generation technologies, most of which do not expire until 2025 or beyond. RipeLock and Harvista formulations are patent protected through at least 2027.
Regulation and Compliance

We are subject to extensive national, state and local government regulation, and we have an internal regulatory team that leverages a global network of highly-experienced regulatory consultants. Through this network, we have successfully obtained registrations for SmartFresh, Harvista, RipeLock, and LandSpring in every country where the review process has been completed, and the registration process for Harvista continues in many additional countries. We have completed more than 400

comprehensive international health and environmental tests that have shown the AgroFresh family of products, including SmartFresh and Harvista are safe for consumers, workers, and the environment. 1-MCP, the active ingredient in the AgroFresh products, is metabolized by the natural processes in apples and other fruits and leaves no residue. The products have been approved by over 50 authorities including the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the European Commission. We do not anticipate any significant problems in obtaining future required licenses, permits or approvals that are necessary to expand our business.
