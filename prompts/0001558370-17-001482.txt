 ITEM 1.  BUSINESS
 Overview
 Planet Payment, Inc. together with its wholly-owned subsidiaries (“Planet,” “the Company,” “us” or “we”) is a provider of international payment and transaction processing and multi‑currency processing services. We provide our services to approximately 189,000 active merchant locations in 22 countries and territories across the Asia Pacific region, the Americas, the Middle East, Africa and Europe, primarily through our acquiring bank and processor customers, as well as through our own direct sales force. We provide banks and their merchants with innovative services to accept, process and reconcile electronic payments. Our point‑of‑sale multi‑currency payment processing services are designed for merchants in the retail, restaurant, and hospitality environments. We also provide payment services for e‑commerce and mail and telephone order merchants. Our point‑of‑sale and e‑commerce services help merchants sell more goods and services to consumers, and are integrated within the international payment card transaction process enabling our acquiring customers to process and reconcile payment transactions in multiple currencies, geographies and channels. Our ATM services provide our domestic and international acquirers with additional processing capabilities to help them increase revenue and improve customer satisfaction. We also offer transaction processing services that allow merchants to offer a range of commercial services including pre‑paid mobile phone top‑up and bill payments using the same point‑of‑sale devices deployed to accept payment cards. We are a registered third party processor with the major card associations and operate in accordance with industry standards, including the Payment Card Industry, or PCI, Security Council’s Data Security Standards.
 Our services help acquiring banks, processors and merchants enhance revenue, broaden their product set and open new sales channels. Our payment processing services enable the authorization and settlement of payment transactions by providing the connections between the merchant, its bank and the card association. In addition, we provide online access to advanced reconciliation and reporting services and localized language support to our customers. Our flagship offerings are our multi‑currency processing services, which include Pay in Your Currency®, our point-of-sale Dynamic Currency Conversion (DCC) service, Multi-Currency Pricing primarily for card-not-present merchants, and DCC at ATMs. These services enable merchants to offer customized pricing in multiple currencies. Additionally, acquiring banks, processors and merchants all benefit from the ease of settlement and reporting in their local currency.
 Our proprietary, currency‑neutral payment processing technology platform enables us to develop and deliver a broad range of international payment services, quickly enter new markets and provide a range of differentiated solutions and analytical tools that are integrated within our customers’ existing business processes. We provide our customers with worldwide connectivity to our payments infrastructure that is secure, compliant and regularly maintained and updated. Our secure platform is scalable to facilitate growth and meet the needs of new customers, and flexible to provide a broad range of capabilities, including the unique regional requirements of the various markets in which we operate.
 We distribute and cross-sell our services across a variety of points‑of‑sale, e‑commerce and ATM payment channels with customized solutions in specific verticals, such as hospitality, restaurants and retail. We believe our business model creates powerful network effects which help drive growth and operating leverage in our business while our customer contracts, which generally have an initial term of three to five years, provide a stable customer base. In 2016, we generated 60% of our revenue internationally and 40% in the United States, through a revenue model that generates fees every time a purchase is made across our network. We manage our business through two operating segments: multi‑currency processing services and payment processing services. For the year ended December 31, 2016, our multi‑currency processing services represented 63% of our revenue and our payment processing services represented 37% of our revenue.  For a breakdown of revenue by operating segment, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Results of Operations.”
 We were incorporated in Delaware in October 1999 and our common stock is traded on The NASDAQ Stock Market, or NASDAQ (trading symbol: "PLPM"). Our corporate headquarters are located at 670 Long Beach Blvd., Long Beach, New York 11561, and our main telephone number is (516) 670‑3200. We maintain a website at www.planetpayment.com. The contents of our website are not incorporated into, or otherwise to be regarded as part of, this Annual Report on Form 10‑K.

The global payments industry
 We operate in the global payments industry, with a specific focus on international payment processing. We believe there are three primary trends that drive growth in our industry:

· | continued global shift toward electronic payment transactions;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------


· | increased international travel and commerce; and
--+-------------------------------------------------


· | increased e‑commerce on a global scale.
--+----------------------------------------

  As a result of the trends that are driving growth and change in our industry, we believe acquiring banks, processors and merchants are facing new challenges and competitive pressures and are demanding secure, reliable and differentiated solutions to more efficiently and effectively process payments. In addition, we believe consumers are increasingly seeking a more transparent and convenient way to pay.
 Our solutions to industry challenges
 Our solutions are designed to enable acquiring banks, processors and merchants to respond to the challenges facing the global payments industry by expanding the market reach and merchant portfolio of our acquiring bank customers, providing an attractive new revenue stream for our acquiring bank customers and merchants, and improving the buying experience for consumers.
 Acquiring banks, processors and card associations
 Through our platform, acquiring banks, processors and card associations are able to offer differentiated services to merchant customers that enhance merchant loyalty, attract new merchants, and open new sales channels. In addition, by securing a share of the foreign exchange rate margin, customers using our multi‑currency processing services gain access to a new, high‑margin revenue stream. By partnering with us, our customers get access to our next‑generation technology and are able to cost‑effectively enhance the processing services they offer to merchants and the ATM services they offer to cardholders. Our acquiring bank and processor customers also gain a competitive advantage by being able to more easily expand their merchant and ATM portfolios and open new sales channels without incurring significant up‑front costs.
 Merchants
 Merchants can use our services to attract more international customers, and make the buying experience more convenient and transparent, as well as share in a financial incentive. Merchants that use our services are also able to leverage customized solutions that are adapted for their specific business. Because of the flexibility and scalability of our platform, merchants can enjoy a single processing solution that is integrated and consistent across multiple locations. Our solutions also provide merchants with the ability to offer commercial services, including prepaid mobile phone top‑up and bill payments, using the same point‑of‑sale devices deployed to accept payment cards. Consumers
 Consumers benefit from the advanced multi‑currency services we provide to our customers, enjoying greater clarity as to the final cost of the transaction in their native currency for point‑of‑sale purchases, online transactions or cash withdrawals.

 Our competitive strengths
 Domain knowledge of international payments
 Since our founding in 1999, we have established deep domain knowledge of international payments and multi‑currency payment processing based on our multi‑currency capabilities, patented technology, proprietary transaction‑level reconciliation, global reporting and data analytics services, and support for local language and market requirements. Given the breadth of our offerings, the global scope of our services, our brand recognition in the industry and the proprietary nature of our technology, we believe we are one of the leading providers of international payment processing services in the world.
 Broad international footprint and distribution
 We provide our services to more than 70 acquiring banks, processors and card associations who offer our payment and multi‑currency services to their own network of merchants. We utilize our direct merchant-sales force and have leveraged the geographic footprints and distribution capabilities of our acquiring customers to build a diversified base of approximately 189,000 active merchant locations in 22 countries and territories across the Asia-Pacific region, the Americas, the Middle East, Africa, and Europe. In the United States and Canada, we offer our payment processing services directly to merchants in certain channels.
 Versatile and scalable proprietary technology platform
 We have developed and operate a single, currency‑neutral payment processing platform that enables us to quickly enter new markets and respond to new opportunities. Our proprietary platform is scalable to meet the needs of large volume customers, flexible to provide a broad range of capabilities, and meets the regional requirements of the various markets in which we operate. Given the unified architecture of our single platform, once new enhancements and solutions have been implemented, they are available to all of our customers around the world. Planet Switch is our front‑end system, which communicates with the merchant’s system and provides transaction authorization, switching and security services. Merchant Accounting System, or MAS, is our back‑end system, which makes a financial record of transactions among a merchant, acquirer and a card association; and calculates, effects settlement and prepares statements of payments, costs, losses and adjustments with respect to transactions in all supported currencies. MAS also comprises our reconciliation and reporting system, which also provides certain fraud and risk management tools, as well as web‑based reporting and email alerts with local language support. Our platform has dedicated endpoints which allow us to connect directly to Visa, MasterCard, American Express, JCB and UnionPay, and provide an end‑to‑end service for our customers without the need for third‑party processors. We also provide a proprietary Internet payment gateway service, the Planet Payment Gateway, which is fully integrated into our platform, to provide a range of online payment processing and multi‑currency services to e‑commerce customers. Our Commercial Services Platform, or CSP, enables us to provide processing services for other transaction types, including pre‑paid mobile phone top‑up and bill payments which allow merchants to use the same point‑of‑sale device deployed to accept payment cards.
 Differentiated and innovative suite of payment and transaction services
 Our proprietary platform offers a broad range of domestic and international point‑of‑sale and e‑commerce processing services. Our suite of services is comprised of our:

· | Pay In Your Currency service that enables international consumers to complete purchases at retailers, restaurants, hotels and e-commerce merchants in their own currency for greater transparency using our patented rate mark‑up technology, while merchants enjoy the ease of settlement and reporting in their local currency.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Payment Processing service that provides end‑to‑end processing of both domestic and multi‑currency transactions, including authorization, capture, clearing and settlement services. For local language and market requirements, local card types such as UnionPay (Asia‑Pacific), Interac (Canada) and Maestro and regional interchange regimes. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
 
  6

 


· | Multi-Currency Pricing service that enables e-commerce, point‑of‑sale, and mail order and telephone order, or MOTO, merchants to target international consumers by allowing them to view pricing and make purchases in their home currencies.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | DCC at ATMs service that enables international consumers to complete ATM withdrawals in their own currency for greater transparency, while banks enjoy the ease of settlement and reporting in their settlement currency.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | The Planet Payment Gateway that provides fully‑integrated domestic and multi‑currency processing services with connectivity to a range of processors that enables acceptance of all major payment types and numerous alternative payment methods.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Commercial Transaction service that allows merchants to offer a range of commercial services including pre‑paid mobile phone top‑up and bill payments using the same point‑of‑sale device deployed to accept payment cards.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Global Consolidated Reporting that provides merchants with valuable insights into their operations and customer spending habits and country of origin, also enables merchants to create personalized marketing programs to attract international consumers.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Customized vertical specific solutions
 We leverage our platform and services to create a suite of customized solutions for specific verticals and channels, such as hospitality and retail, which we believe provide a differentiated value proposition for our customers. We have also created solutions for specific point‑of‑sale systems, such as support for certain integrated systems for the hospitality solution integrated systems, which enable merchants to utilize our Pay in Your Currency services easily without any further integration. For the e‑commerce vertical, our Planet Payment Gateway provides customers with fully-integrated domestic and Multi‑Currency Pricing services.
 Business model with network effects
 We believe there are significant and powerful network effects in our business model which help drive growth and operating leverage in our business. As we continue to add new acquiring bank and processing customers, we gain the benefits of their sales force and distribution capabilities as well as their network of merchants. As we gain additional market penetration, other businesses in our customers’ markets have recognized the value we provide their competitors and have sought to partner with us to provide our services. As we onboard new merchants, we gain additional market penetration and we are able to demonstrate the benefits of our services to other merchants who may also choose to implement our services.
 Our strategy
 We seek to extend our position and enhance the network effects in our business model by continuing to penetrate our existing markets and expand into new geographies and market segments. Our goal is to continue to deliver innovative payment services to our customers that help merchants sell more goods and services and improve their business efficiencies. The key components of our strategy are discussed below.
 Continued focus on existing customer base
 We intend to continue collaborating with our existing acquiring bank customers, processor customers and card associations in order to increase participation by merchants in the various services that we offer together. We believe that with our existing acquiring bank and processor customers and card associations, we have a large addressable market, which consists of such entities’ existing pools of merchants, as well as additional merchants that they may acquire in the future.

 Cross‑sell to existing customers
 We intend to continue to cross-sell our innovative services to our acquiring banks, processors, merchants and card associations. We believe our range of services and solutions enable cross‑selling opportunities that are intended to increase revenue from our existing customers by helping them broaden their product set with additional value‑add services. For example, certain of our acquirer bank customers that have successfully deployed our Pay in Your Currency service have added our DCC at ATM solution to their ATM networks.  
 Add new customers
 Our sales and business development group will continue to target new acquiring banks, processors, merchants and card associations in existing regions. We believe acquiring banks, processors and card associations are seeking differentiated solutions, such as ours, to provide them with international payment processing services as well as multi‑currency processing capabilities to meet the demands of their international customers, which they can offer to merchants. We believe merchants are increasingly seeking global payment and e-commerce processing services, such as ours, that are integrated into their existing business processes, enabling them to consolidate reporting and data from different international business units, regardless of geographic location or acquirer.
 Enter new markets
 We are leveraging our platform to enter new geographies and business sectors. We are working to implement our services in new countries to expand our footprint and support the growth of our customers with a focus on geographies. We are also expanding into additional business areas where we can offer our differentiated technology and services. We believe the expansion of our services will increase our market opportunity.
 Enhance our technology platform capabilities
 We will continue to use our technology resources to develop advanced platform capabilities in order to enhance our market position and enable our customers to retain and attract new business. For example, by adding support for the Europay, Mastercard and Visa, or EMV,  international payment card standard, also known as “chip and PIN,” as required in certain regions, we significantly opened the market opportunity for our multi‑currency processing services around the world. We were therefore well positioned to support the advent of EMV cards in the United States, which began in 2016.
 Develop and expand new services and solutions
 As the payment industry continues to evolve, we aim to be at the forefront by developing new services and solutions that leverage our platform and core competencies and thereby enable us to enter new markets and industry verticals, attract new customers and retain existing ones. We believe the development of new services and solutions will enable us to continue to differentiate our platform and capabilities, and accelerate the network effects of our business model. 
 We are expanding acceptance of international cards across new regions and enabling multi-currency functionality across other international card associations.  We have, for instance, delivered support of UnionPay at the point-of-sale for banks in Myanmar, and a multi-currency enabled UnionPay solution for U.S. e-commerce merchants, allowing our merchant customer to sell more effectively to Chinese cardholders.  We are also adding dynamic currency conversion for JCB for certain acquirer customers in Asia.  We also developed support for the processing of “quasi cash” transactions which allowed us to offer Pay in Your Currency on cash advances completed at casinos.  
 We continue to expand the delivery of DCC ATM support around the world including the United States, Mexico, Malaysia and the United Arab Emirates.  This requires integration with an expanding list of ATM manufacturers and ATM host systems.

 Enhanced focus on data and transaction security 
 There has been a recent increased focus on security issues in the payment industry. To address these issues, we delivered new security enhancements in 2016, including implementation of a point-to-point encryption solution in India and derived unique key per transaction, or DUKPT, encryption key management in Malaysia.
 Pursue selective acquisitions
 We intend to selectively pursue acquisitions that will help us achieve our strategic goals, enhance our technology and capabilities, and accelerate growth. We believe pursuing these types of acquisitions will increase our ability to work with existing customers, add new customers, enter new markets, develop new services and enhance our processing platform capabilities. We have no commitments with respect to any such acquisitions at this time.
 Our services
 We provide a range of international payment processing and multi‑currency processing services that are integrated within the payment card transaction flow. Our services enable our customers to process and reconcile payment transactions in multiple currencies, geographies and channels at the point‑of‑sale, ATMs and through e‑commerce, as more fully discussed below.  Our services include payment processing, multi-currency processing, gateway, data analytics, and commercial transaction services.
 Payment processing
 Our authorization and capture processing services are integrated into the transaction flow of acquiring banks, processors, and card associations to provide seamless support to merchants. Our processing services support authorization of various regional card and debit payments, including: Visa, MasterCard, Discover, American Express, UnionPay, Diners Club International, Interac, JCB and Maestro. We provide these services for both EMV and magnetic stripe transactions.
 Our platform accepts transactions from a broad range of point‑of‑sale devices, mobile devices and payment gateways for e‑commerce and telephone / mail order merchants. We offer a fully‑managed payment solution hosted by us and integrated into our processing platform that enables integrated payment processing for hospitality solution point‑of‑sale and property management systems. The Planet Payment Gateway online payment solution is designed to help e‑commerce and mail and telephone order merchants accept online payments securely, quickly and in any currency.
 At the end of each day, regardless of the source of the transactions, we capture all of the transactions processed during the day for each merchant and submit them to the card associations as part of the clearing and settlement process. Thereafter, we reconcile and provide reporting to our customers on the transactions that have been processed.
 On the back-end of the process, we deploy MAS comprising a single, flexible and scalable platform that supports acquiring banks, processors and card associations across multiple geographies and payment systems. The key functions of MAS include clearing to the major card associations; intra‑country, intra‑regional and international interchange support; flexible merchant pricing structures; online exception and chargeback management tools; and multiple language support for acquirers and merchants, including the ability to support double‑byte character sets, such as for Mandarin and Cantonese.
 As part of our processing services, we also offer our acquiring bank and processor customers advanced transaction reconciliation and reporting services, including the capability for segregated reporting by region, market and currency, available via our secure web portal.
 Merchants using CSP can accept payment transactions and provide commercial services such as mobile phone top up and bill payments, all processed from a single point‑of‑sale device. The CSP connects to our transaction front- and back-end for processing of the financial transactions and to the third-party content provider for the commercial services.

 Multi‑currency processing
 Our flagship offering is multi‑currency processing, which empowers acquiring banks, processors and merchants to provide (1) Pay in Your Currency, our point-of-sale DCC service, (2) Multi-Currency Pricing primarily for card-not-present merchants and (3) DCC at ATMs, in each case through our single, currency‑neutral proprietary payment processing technology platform.
 Our multi‑currency processing services are designed for a variety of payment environments, from customer‑facing terminals to fully integrated front‑desk systems and ATMs as well as through our online e‑commerce gateway or a third‑party e‑commerce gateway.
 Pay In Your Currency
 Pay In Your Currency is a customer service feature in which a payment card purchase initially priced in the merchant’s local currency is converted, after the card is presented by a consumer, in real time at the point‑of‑sale into the consumer’s native currency while the merchant continues to receive settlement in its local currency. We believe this creates a personalized shopping experience and allows international consumers to enjoy the clarity and convenience of paying for their purchase in their native currency.
 To further illustrate the advantages of Pay In Your Currency, the chart below sets forth a representative transaction flow for processing: (1) a traditional card‑based payment by a U.S. consumer to a Hong Kong merchant; and (2) a card‑based payment by a U.S. consumer to a Hong Kong merchant using Pay In Your Currency:
 
  10

 

 | Traditional cross‑border transaction(U.S. Dollars and Hong Kong Dollars) | Planet Payment Pay In Your Currency transaction(U.S. Dollars and Hong Kong Dollars) 
Consumer | The U.S. consumer presents the Hong Kong merchant with a payment card. The consumer will not know the final cost of the transaction in U.S. Dollars (the sum of fees, foreign exchange rate and cost of the purchased item) until receipt of his or her card statement. | The U.S. consumer presents the Hong Kong merchant with a payment card and the merchant offers the consumer a choice of paying in U.S. Dollars or Hong Kong Dollars. The consumer knows the final transaction amount in U.S. Dollars before the sale is completed. 
Merchant | The merchant terminal transmits the card information and transaction amount (in Hong Kong Dollars) to the acquiring bank or its third‑party processor. | If U.S. Dollars are selected, the merchant (1) uses our technology to show the consumer the price in U.S. Dollars and the exchange rate with a margin agreed to by Planet and the acquiring bank and (2) transmits the card information and transaction amount (in U.S. Dollars) to Planet (on behalf of the acquiring bank). 
AcquiringBank/Processor | The acquiring bank or its third‑party processor submits the authorization request (in Hong Kong Dollars) to the card association. Upon eventual settlement of the transaction by the card association, the card association pays the acquiring bank the amount of the charge in Hong Kong Dollars, so that the acquiring bank can pay the merchant what it expects to be paid in the merchant’s local currency. | We (on behalf of the acquiring bank) submit the authorization request (in U.S. Dollars) to the card association. Upon eventual settlement of the transaction by the card association, the card association converts the amount back to Hong Kong Dollars and pays the acquiring bank, so that the acquiring bank can pay the merchant what it expects to be paid in its local currency. The margin that was included in the exchange rate is shared by the acquiring bank, the merchant and Planet. 
Card Association(Visa or MasterCard) | The card association typically (1) converts the amount from Hong Kong Dollars into U.S. Dollars using its internal treasury rates and (2) routes the authorization request in U.S. Dollars to the card issuing bank for response. | The card association routes the authorization request in U.S. Dollars to the card issuing bank for response. 
Card Issuing Bank | The card issuing bank approves or declines the transaction and that response is transmitted back through the chain to the merchant. Upon eventual settlement of the transaction, (1) the card association charges the card issuing bank and the acquiring bank certain fees for the international transaction and (2) the card issuing bank reflects the final cost of the transaction (the sum of fees, foreign exchange rate and cost of the purchased item) on the consumer’s card statement in U.S. Dollars. | The card issuing bank approves or declines the transaction and that response is transmitted back through the chain to the merchant. Upon eventual settlement of the transaction, (1) the card association charges the card issuing bank and the acquiring bank certain fees for the international transaction and (2) the card issuing bank reflects the final cost of the transaction on the consumer’s card statement in the consumer’s native currency, U.S. Dollars, as agreed to by the consumer at the point‑of‑sale.

 Multi-Currency Pricing
 Merchants use Multi-Currency Pricing, primarily in e‑commerce, to target and reach international markets more effectively by offering their customers the ability to view pricing in multiple currencies and pay in the currency of their choice. With Multi-Currency Pricing, the merchant continues to receive settlement in its preferred currency, thereby enabling each party to the sale to transact business in the currency of their choice.
 With Multi-Currency Pricing, the merchant prices its goods and services in various currencies and the customer makes the decision to purchase the goods and services in the currency of their choice. The consumer then presents his or her card at the point‑of‑sale and completes the transaction in the chosen currency as displayed by the merchant, and as far as the consumer is concerned, no conversion takes place. The transaction is submitted to the card association in the chosen transaction currency. Upon settlement by the card association to the acquiring bank, the transaction is converted back into the merchant’s settlement currency so that the acquiring bank can pay the merchant what it expected to be paid for the transaction in the merchant’s local currency.
 DCC at ATMs
 Banks and ATM operators using our DCC at ATMs service offer improved customer service for international travelers using their ATM’s for their cash needs abroad. With this service, international travelers can withdraw local currency from participating ATMs, using their foreign MasterCard card. These travelers enjoy the convenience of knowing, at the time of withdrawal, the exact amount debited from their bank account, in their home currency. The service operates in a similar way to the Pay in Your Currency service, in that the cardholder is offered the choice whether to be billed in local currency or the currency of the card at the time of making a cash withdrawal. The settlement with the bank or ATM operator continues to be made in the local currency, just as it would be for any other cash transaction.
 Direct Acquiring Business
 In to our traditional business model we partner with acquiring banks, pursuant to which we process the transactions and the acquiring bank, typically a member of Visa or MasterCard, contracts directly with individual merchants. We also maintain another distinct business line, known as ‘direct acquiring.’  In our direct acquiring business, we enter into agreements directly with merchants and act as both the processor and the ‘acquirer’ in the transaction.  Our largest partner in the direct acquiring business is UnionPay International, through which we process e-commerce transactions via UnionPay cards.  We are a principal member of UnionPay, which permits us to directly process transactions and settle the funds with the individual merchants.  We also acquire for Visa and MasterCard through partnerships with sponsor banks.
 In 2016, we entered into a partnership with UATP, a payment network privately owned by certain airlines, to provide airlines access to a wider portfolio of alternative forms of payment.  UATP has over 260 airline merchant customers around the world.  Our agreement with UATP is intended to expand acceptance of alternative forms payment with UATP’s airline partners. With an initial emphasis on UnionPay acceptance online, our solution will allow airline merchants to gain greater access to the Chinese market. 
 We also signed a direct acquiring agreement with United Airlines for the acceptance of UnionPay. The solution will allow United Airlines to accept the UnionPay card on its eCommerce sites, call centers and kiosks, thereby facilitating payments from mainland China and other regions where the UnionPay card is issued.
 We expect the rise of the Chinese middle class and burgeoning Chinese e-commerce market to drive demand for our UnionPay solutions.  We believe these market trends will accelerate in the future.   Further, as outbound travel in China continues to increase, with travel expenditures expected to reach $255 billion by 2025 according to Visa’s Mapping the Future of Global Travel and Tourism (Visa 2014), we believe the airline industry is a solid fit for our UnionPay solution.
 With our principal membership in UnionPay, we believe we are one of a few domestic providers that can provide U.S. and Canadian-based merchants with complete turnkey processing solutions with all of the components necessary to accept UnionPay credit, debit and bank transfers.  Our UnionPay solutions also feature support of our multi-currency 

 
  12

 
pricing service, allowing Chinese consumers to shop and pay in Chinese renminbi.  This price localization feature is an essential tool that allows U.S. and Canadian merchants to more effectively reach the Chinese consumer.
 Planet Payment Gateway
 The Planet Payment Gateway service provides PCI compliant payment gateway services for e-commerce, m-commerce, call center, mail order and telephone order merchants. The Gateway provides our customers domestic and multi-currency processing services, local and alternative payments, robust integration tools and connections to multiple fraud solutions that help merchants manage their business more effectively. 
 The Gateway enables acceptance of all major payment types and a number of alternative payment methods preferred by consumers in markets outside of the United States and offers merchants flexibility in configuring the Gateway to meet their business and processing needs.  A merchant can service its United States customers by accepting Visa and MasterCard and offer its international customers with a range of local and alternative payments worldwide through a single gateway integration.  
 We are currently providing the Planet Payment Gateway to customers in the United States and Canada and intend to make it available to our customers in all other regions where we operate.  The Planet Payment Gateway also supports UnionPay Online Payment, or UPOP, service and provides merchants in the United States and Canada with the additional facility to authenticate and process UnionPay credit and debit cards and bank transfer online, thereby providing merchants with better access to the Chinese e-commerce market. Our secure tokenization and sophisticated fraud and chargeback management tools are designed to help merchants manage the risks of conducting business in a card not present environment.
 Global consolidated reporting
 Our global consolidated reporting offers merchants valuable insights into their operations. Our centralized reporting platform can provide transactional data in a uniform, consolidated on‑line format across a merchant’s international operations with the ability to focus upon selected data according to a merchant’s particular requirements.
 Commercial transaction services
 Our CSP technology enables us to offer commercial transaction processing services, in addition to the processing of financial transactions using payment cards. This allows merchants to offer a range of commercial services including pre‑paid mobile phone top‑up and bill payments using the same point‑of‑sale device deployed to accept payment cards. The CSP connects to the relevant processor, whether our own payments platform or a third-party platform for the commercial services, in order to deliver the relevant transactions where they need to be processed. The technology also enables us to manage the point‑of‑sale device applications remotely, which can simplify the process of updating the software and adding new applications that can operate on the same devices.
 Customer service
 We offer a full service customer support center based in our Delaware and Hong Kong facilities. Calls are answered and responded to 24 hours a day, seven days a week. The call center is divided into consumer, merchant and corporate services teams to help streamline the process. These teams are trained to deal with Level I type issues, which involve support for our direct merchant portfolio in North America, where we are the first point of contact. Level II type issues, where we are supporting our acquiring bank and processor customers on their technical issues (and in response to more difficult Level I type issues our customers receive from their merchants) are escalated to the appropriate support team (in the United States or Hong Kong) for resolution via a problem ticket management system. All calls are entered as cases into a customer relationship management system to ensure integrity and continuity of service.

 Our acquiring banks, processors and card associations
 We provide our services to more than 70 acquiring banks, processors and card associations in 22 countries and territories across the Asia-Pacific region, the Americas, the Middle East, Africa and Europe. Our relationship with acquiring banks, processors and card associations provides us with broad market coverage by leveraging their distribution networks and global portfolios of merchants.
 We typically enter into three- to five- year contracts with our acquiring banks, processors and card associations which contain “evergreen” renewal clauses, so that they automatically renew for a further period, unless one party affirmatively terminates the contract. Our acquiring banks, processors and card associations often either renew or extend their contracts at the expiration of the term.  Other terms typically include representations and warranties concerning compliance with PCI data standards, applicable laws in the relevant designated territory and rules and regulations of the card associations.  We typically agree to indemnify in the event that our program infringes on third party intellectual property; our liability is generally capped at amounts which vary by contract and nature of claim.  The standard agreement also permits limited audit rights with respect to our records.
 Our sponsor banks
 In order to offer merchant acquiring services for Visa and MasterCard transactions as we do in the United States and Canada, we must be sponsored by a financial institution that is a principal member of the Visa and MasterCard networks. The sponsor bank must register us with Visa as an independent sales organization and with MasterCard as a member service provider. We have therefore entered into sponsorship agreements with member banks of the Visa and MasterCard networks, which we refer to as our sponsor banks that allow us to offer card acquiring services directly to merchants.
 The sponsorship agreements with our sponsor banks require, among other things, that we abide by the laws and regulations of the Visa and MasterCard networks. Pursuant to the sponsorship agreements, we are required to pay bank sponsorship fees. These fees are included in our consolidated statements of operations as “payment processing service fees.” If we breach a sponsorship agreement, our sponsor bank may terminate the agreement and, under the terms of the agreement, we are entitled to a reasonable transitional period to make arrangements with an alternative sponsor bank.
 Our merchants
 We provide our services to approximately 189,000 active merchant locations around the world. We serve these merchant locations, either indirectly through our acquiring banks, processors and card associations or directly through our sales force, and deliver innovative payment services that help merchants sell more goods and services. As of December 31, 2016, our active merchant locations grew 60% compared to December 31, 2015. For the year ended December 31, 2016, multi‑currency services processing transaction volume from retail, lodging, restaurant and e‑commerce comprised 50%, 30%, 8% and 6%, respectively, of the total multi‑currency processing transaction volume we processed during that period.
 Sales and marketing
 Our sales force is comprised of business development, key account relationship management and direct sales professionals responsible for developing and maintaining our relationships with our customers. Our sales force is focused on supporting our current customers, as well as nurturing relationships with prospective customers in key international markets. Our relationship managers support the development of sales presentation materials and training of our customers’ sales personnel to assist them in marketing our services, either directly or indirectly, to merchants. We also directly train and support selected key merchants’ employees and technology providers in order to grow active merchant locations, increase utilization of our services and solidify relationships. In addition, we employ a direct sales force which targets merchants in North America for our payment processing services.
 Our marketing staff is focused on marketing our company, our services and our acquiring bank and processor customers’ services. Managing our corporate website presence is a key responsibility for the marketing team, with a focus on acquiring bank and processor acquisition and description of our services to merchants. Since we allow our acquiring

bank and processor customers to market our services under their own brands, our marketing team also assists our customers with the development of marketing materials to encourage adoption of our multi‑currency processing services.
 Seasonality
 Our business and operations are seasonal in nature.  Historically, our second and third fiscal quarters generate less revenue than our first and fourth fiscal quarters.  We generally expect that this trend will continue for the foreseeable future, however, this may be offset by the timing of new rollouts in the respective quarters. Technology
 We believe that our wholly-owned, currency‑neutral processing platform is a major reason why leading international banks, processors and card associations use our services. The platform enables us to operate as an international independent third‑party processor with direct connectivity to card associations around the world. Since our platform is maintained internally, we are able to efficiently respond to customer needs and market opportunities. Our platform consists of several synchronized processing centers linked by a global telecommunications network. Our primary data centers are located in secure facilities in Elmsford, New York, and New Castle, Delaware. We also host facilities in Bermuda, Shanghai and Macau as well as two facilities in Hong Kong, through co‑location arrangements. The following is a summary of key attributes of our processing platform:
· | Singular platform. We operate a single platform that supports all the currencies, languages and regional card products that we offer our customers. Our platform is built on a unified architecture with a centralized database as opposed to the processing platforms of some of our primary competitors that use a regionalized architecture and regionalized database, with differing levels of functionality and a variety of interface technologies. Our singular platform provides consistency in our services, rapid response to emerging technologies and changing industry standards, and allows us to efficiently offer our services across geographies. Merchants operating across multiple territories can conveniently access a consolidated view of their transaction activity and use their preferred point‑of‑sale technology. As a result, our merchants can deliver a consistent customer experience in any region, which reduces implementation costs and customer training for both sales and operations.

· | Individualized exchange rates. Our acquiring banks and merchants can use our patented technology to offer individualized exchange rates for each transaction based on a number of different factors, including merchant location, the customer’s native currency and any special offers. The platform can also accept multiple exchange rate sources and provide rate guarantees for a specific time period; for example, for e‑commerce merchants where delivery of the product may take place several days after the payment transaction. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Scalability. Our platform can expand to add new banks and merchants, increase transaction volumes and enter new markets. Our unified global platform utilizes a distributed architecture, which improves flexibility and scalability. The number of payment card transactions that we can process is limited by the number of transactions per second that can be processed by our authorization system and the storage limits of our MAS. We have developed sophisticated exception management processes and procedures that are critical to maintaining our ability to scale effectively by allowing us to monitor and fine‑tune our processes as transaction volumes increase. We have been able to increase the capacity of both our authorization system and MAS by installing additional hardware on a managed, modular basis on a single platform without significant increases in capital expenditures. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | High level of security. Given the sensitive nature of the consumer data that we process and the strict security requirements of our acquiring bank customers and card associations, we built our platform with a strong focus on system security. We utilize next generation security safeguards using third-party hardware and software encryption, as well as our proprietary tokenization services. Our platform is compliant with the PCI Security Council’s Data Security Standards and is annually audited and certified by an independent security assessor. We proactively monitor our systems and network for any security threat and regularly maintain and seek to improve the security features of our platform to help our customers minimize risk. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Reliability. Our global telecommunications network and processing centers are designed for redundancy and fail‑over. During the two years ended December 31, 2016, our two core processing platform components, MAS and Planet Switch, each had average system uptime availability of at least 99.9%. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     Processing platform components
 Our processing platform was designed with a modular architecture to enhance scalability and easily offer additional components. The primary components of our processing platform include (1) MAS, (2) Planet Switch, (3) the Planet Payment Gateway, (4) our card association endpoints, and (5) the CSP.
 Merchant Accounting System. MAS creates end‑of‑day clearing files to the card associations, reports on merchant and acquiring bank transaction activity, creates and transmits payment instructions for our acquiring banks, and serves as the system of record for all transactions cleared through our platform. MAS tracks foreign exchange fluctuations on a daily basis to facilitate comprehensive reconciliation of each aspect of the credit card authorization and settlement processes.  MAS also provides portfolio and risk management features that allow clients to evaluate and take action on individual transactions and their merchant portfolio.
 MAS is a unified transaction processing system, for all regions, currencies and languages that we support, with a web‑based management and reporting interface for use by our back‑office staff, acquiring bank back‑office staff, and merchants. The customer facing web‑application and reporting infrastructure currently supports English, French, Canadian French, Cantonese, Mandarin, Portuguese and Spanish. MAS also provides acquiring banks, processors and merchants with comprehensive reporting of the status of their transactions and funding cycles as well as other pertinent credit card operational needs, including image processing, chargebacks, retrievals and representments.
 Planet Switch. Planet Switch is an authorization host for both domestic and foreign credit and debit card transactions communicating directly with Visa, MasterCard, American Express, JCB, UnionPay, and Diners Club International. Planet Switch also functions as a point‑of‑sale terminal and integrated system driver for credit card transactions. Planet Switch was designed for multi‑currency payment processing and supports our real‑time foreign exchange logic at the point‑of‑sale. Planet Switch receives the inbound authorization request, converts the sale amount into the consumer’s home billing currency, and forwards the request to the card association endpoints for completion. Planet Switch supports debit interfaces including Maestro, Interac (Canada) and UnionPay as well as the UnionPay online (e‑commerce) service—UPOP (UnionPay Online Payments).
 Planet Switch drives ‘smart’ ATMs as well as supporting host-to-host connectivity to major brands of ATM hosting software (e.g. ACI). Planet Switch connects to Visa Plus and the MasterCard Debit Switch (MDS) for ATM transactions.
 The Planet Payment Gateway. We offer a fully integrated e‑commerce gateway differentiated by its multi‑currency capabilities that processes all major card brands, numerous alternative payment products and ACH transactions. Given the increased risk of fraud associated with a card‑not‑present environment, we offer our own and third-party advanced fraud monitoring, tokenization and other security tools to protect acquiring banks, merchants and consumers.
 Card association endpoints. We have the capability to submit transaction data directly to Visa, MasterCard, American Express, JCB and UnionPay in the regions in which we do business, through leased hardware provided by Visa or MasterCard and certified interfaces to American Express, JCB and UnionPay. This capability enables us to control the transaction flow and eliminates the need to use third‑party processors. In order to utilize these endpoints, we have built support for interchange qualification in the United States, Canada, the Asia-Pacific region, the European Union, the Middle East and Africa and have the ability to quickly and effectively develop support for additional local card brands and regional interchange regimes.

 Commercial Services Platform.  The CSP comprises a platform which enables merchants to provide commercial services and process non‑financial transactions such as mobile phone top up and bill payments. In addition, CSP can centrally manage the merchant’s point‑of‑sale device without the need to individually update each device. The CSP has been integrated into our platform in order to enable enhanced functionality to be quickly deployed to merchants’ POS devices that are connected to our platform.
 Platform innovation and enhancements
 We will continue to use our technology resources to develop advanced platform capabilities in order to enhance our market position and enable our customers to retain and attract new business. Given the unified architecture of our single platform, once new enhancements and solutions have been implemented, they become available to all of our customers around the world. During 2016, we continued to enhance our proprietary systems in order to offer acquiring banks, processors and merchants increased opportunities to capture additional revenue with new services. For example, in 2016 we:

· | Enhanced our Platform to allow merchants in Mexico to accept payment cards issued by various Food Voucher Program Administrators.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Developed new API interface to facilitate and simply connectivity between point-of-sale technology providers and our Commercial Services Platform.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Launched enhanced version of UnionPay’s e-commerce payment solution which improves and streamlines the cardholder’s shopping experience.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Certified new point-of-sale terminals in support of new customer Pay in Your Currency® implementations in Mexico and Canada.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Added twenty-four new currencies to our Pay in Your Currency® and Multi-Currency Pricing product offerings. With these new additions, our customers can now offer Pay in Your Currency and Multi-Currency Pricing on a total of 142 currencies. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Technology partners
 In order to facilitate the provision of our services, technology and service providers to the electronic payments industry, including point‑of‑sale system providers, such as e‑commerce gateways, terminal manufacturers and other processors, have certified their solutions to our platform. Our technology partners, once integrated to our platform, have the ability to support merchants in any location, without having to replicate development efforts to connect to different regional platforms. Further, we have comprehensive implementation documents to guide our technology partners through development and a team of implementation and certification specialists to assist in the process.
 Competition
 Competition in our market is intense and involves rapidly changing technologies, evolving industry standards, frequent new product and service introductions, and changes in customer requirements. To maintain and improve our competitive position, we must keep pace with the evolving needs of our customers and continue to develop and introduce new features, services and solutions in a timely and efficient manner. Our primary competitors are international payment processors, multi-currency payment service providers and global e-commerce payment service providers. 
 Currently, there is a high level of concentration in the international payment processing industry, with a few large processors providing payment card processing services to acquiring banks on a multi-national and multi-regional basis. International processors with whom we compete include: 

· | First Data Corporation, with its OmniPay Limited subsidiary operating a multi-currency platform;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Elavon, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of U.S. Bancorp, that operates in the Americas and Europe;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
 
  17

 


· | WorldPay (UK) Limited, that also primarily services the Americas and Europe and Latin America.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

      We may also compete against prospective acquiring bank customers and regional processors that may prefer to develop and offer their own payment processing solution. 
 The multi-currency payment service industry is largely segmented among large, international processors, which provide multi-currency processing services as part of their broader international payment processing service, including those referenced above, and smaller companies who work on a regional or local basis to provide DCC or multi-currency processing services on behalf of acquiring banks or merchants. Specialized DCC providers include:

·
-


· | FEXCO Holdings
--+---------------


· | Fintrax Group
--+--------------


· | Currency Select, a Global Blue Company
--+---------------------------------------


· | Global Blue
--+------------


· | Monex Financial Services Limited
--+---------------------------------


· | Euronet Worldwide
--+------------------


· | Continuum Commerce Ltd.
--+------------------------

  In the global e-commerce payment space, our Multi-Currency Pricing service and Planet Payment Gateway, compete with several international online payment service providers, including:
    
· | CyberSource Corporation, a subsidiary of Visa
--+----------------------------------------------


· | MasterCard Internet Gateway Services, or MiGS
--+----------------------------------------------


· | PayPal, Inc.
--+-------------


· | Borderfree, Inc.
--+-----------------


· | Ingenico ePayments
--+-------------------


· | WorldPay (UK) Limited
--+----------------------


· | Payvision
--+----------

  In the United States, we compete against acquiring banks offering multi-currency processing solutions to online merchants, including Chase Paymentech and Bank of America. In the Asia-Pacific region, we compete against regional providers, including AsiaPay Limited, or JETCO, and eNETS Pte Ltd., but also support MiGS and AsiaPay Limited. Our Planet Payment Gateway service competes with them based on the specialized multi-currency solutions we offer. We also work cooperatively with several payment gateway providers to offer Multi-Currency Pricing services online, including PayOn, RocketGate, USAePAY and Plug’n Pay, but also support our services through certain competitors including CyberSource, MiGS and PayPal. 
     Several of our competitors enjoy substantial competitive advantages such as:
    
·
-


· | greater name and brand recognition and longer operating histories;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------


· | larger sales and marketing budgets and resources;
--+--------------------------------------------------


· | greater resources to make acquisitions of other competitors or products, services and technologies that strengthen their service and solution offerings and increase their presence in the market;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | lower labor and development costs;
--+-----------------------------------

 
 
  18

 


· | larger intellectual property portfolios related to electronic payment methods and systems; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | substantially greater financial, technical, customer support and other resources.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Conditions in our market could change rapidly and significantly as a result of technological advancements or market consolidation. For example, one of our smaller payment processing competitors may be acquired by a larger company with significant resources, and could leverage those resources to become a more significant competitive presence in our market. The development and market acceptance of alternative technologies could decrease the demand for our services and solutions or render them obsolete. 
     Many of our competitors also have substantially greater financial, technological and marketing resources than we have. In addition, our competitors that are financial institutions or are affiliated with financial institutions, may not incur the sponsorship costs we incur for registration with the payment networks. Accordingly, these competitors may be able to offer more attractive fees to our current and prospective clients or other services that we do not provide. Competition could result in a loss of existing clients, and greater difficulty attracting new clients. Furthermore, if competition causes us to reduce the fees we charge in order to attract or retain clients, there is no assurance we can successfully control our costs in order to maintain our profit margins. One or more of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
     Furthermore, we are facing new competitive pressure from non-traditional payments processors and other parties entering the payments industry, such as PayPal, Google, Apple, Alibaba and Amazon, who may compete in one or more of the functions performed in processing merchant transactions. These companies have significant financial resources and robust networks and are highly regarded by consumers. If these companies gain a greater share of total electronic payments transactions or if we are unable to successfully react to changes in the industry spurred by the entry of these new market participants, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
     Regulatory and legal environment
 Our customers are subject to numerous laws and regulations applicable to banks and other financial institutions in the United States and elsewhere and, as a consequence, our business is affected by such laws and regulations. Our contracts with acquiring banks, processor, and card association customers require us to comply with applicable laws and regulations in the United States and in the various jurisdictions in which we and our customers operate, including:

· | banking regulations, and monetary and other governmental authority requirements relating to the processing of payment card transactions;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | anti‑money laundering and anti-terrorist laws, regulations and related requirements, such as the USA PATRIOT Act in the United States;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | privacy and data security regulations, including rules regarding safeguarding personal information, such as rules implementing the privacy provisions of the Gramm‑Leach‑Bliley Act, or GLBA, in the United States and privacy and data protection laws in applicable jurisdictions outside of the United States;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | U.S. Internal Revenue Service, or IRS, and other taxing authority reporting requirements;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | VISA, MasterCard and other card association and payment network organization rules; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | other laws and regulations.
--+----------------------------

  Banking regulations
 The financial services industry is subject to significant legislative and regulatory scrutiny. Interchange fees, which are typically paid by the acquiring bank to the card issuing bank in connection with transactions, are reviewed by regulatory authorities and central banks in a number of jurisdictions in which we operate and are subject to increasingly intense legal, regulatory, and legislative scrutiny worldwide. 

 
  19

 

 For instance, in the United States, the Dodd‑Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, or Dodd‑Frank Act, requires the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System to regulate the fees charged or received by issuers for processing point‑of‑sale debit card transactions, as well as other restrictions on routing debit card transactions and network exclusivity. The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System has implemented this requirement by issuing a rule that limits interchange fees charged by issuers with $10 billion or more of assets to an amount not more than $0.21 per transaction plus an ad valorem amount of five basis points of the transaction’s value (0.05%) and that requires all debit cards be interoperable with at least two unaffiliated payment networks. Regulatory activity, even if not directed at us, may have a significant and negative impact on our customers in the United States and elsewhere because such regulatory activity may require significant efforts to change our systems and services and may require changes to how we price our services and solutions to our current and potential customers. We cannot predict the effect of these and any prospective regulatory changes on our customers, our operations and financial condition.
 The Canadian Department of Finance issued a voluntary Code of Conduct for payment card industry participants in Canada. Visa and MasterCard adopted the Code of Conduct in the form proposed by the Canadian government and, consequently, committed to include the Code of Conduct in its entirety in the network contracts, governing rules and regulations. The purpose of the Code of Conduct is to demonstrate the industry’s commitment to:

· | ensuring that merchants are fully aware of the costs associated with accepting credit and debit card payments, thereby allowing merchants to reasonably forecast their monthly costs related to accepting such payments;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | providing merchants with increased pricing flexibility to encourage consumers to choose the lowest‑cost payment option; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | allowing merchants to freely choose which payment options they will accept.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------

  The requirements for increased transparency and disclosure to merchants led us to change the formats of our merchant statement and certain other documentation in order to enable our customers in Canada to comply with the Code of Conduct. At this time, it is not possible to predict what effect the other provisions of the Code of Conduct will have on our customers, operations and financial condition.
 The banking and/or monetary authorities of some jurisdictions, such as the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, require acquiring banks to obtain their permission before outsourcing processing services to us. Similarly, in the United States, the federal bank regulatory agencies have issued guidance governing relationships between financial institutions, such as those with whom we do business, and third party vendors and service providers.  This regulatory guidance generally requires financial institutions to conduct initial and ongoing due diligence on all critical third party service providers and to conduct business with such third parties pursuant to contracts that meet certain requirements, including a requirement that the financial institution and its regulators have access to the third party service provider’s books, records, personnel and facilities to verify compliance with applicable law and contractual requirements. In accordance with our agreements with our customers, we are subject to compliance audits by our customers and by their regulators, as well as by the card associations. Although most of our customers conduct annual or other periodic reviews of various aspects of our services, we have not been subject to any audit or inspection by any government regulator to date. MasterCard has conducted periodic reviews of our operations under its Fraud Management Program and found that we are a risk aware service provider with the tools and knowledge required to assist member banks in the mitigation of fraud losses. Government regulators and regulatory bodies, such as the card associations, could change or impose additional requirements on us and our customers with respect to outsourcing, or the introduction of new services could require additional authorization from such regulators.
 In 2011, the China Bank Regulatory Commission, or CBRC, issued the Measures for the Supervision and Administration of Credit Card Business of Commercial Banks, or the Measures. The Measures impose a number of requirements on commercial banks involving credit card businesses, particularly in relation to information security and the ability to ensure the integrity and security of customer information and operational data. These requirements are applicable to acquiring banks and not their service providers, such as us. However, we cannot rule out the possibility that CBRC and other relevant authorities may decide to issue new laws or regulations or otherwise extend the reach of the Measures or other existing regulations in a manner that will impact the operations of third‑party data processors, such as us.

 Anti‑money laundering and anti-terrorism laws
 Most jurisdictions in which we and our customers operate have implemented, amended or have pending anti‑money laundering and anti‑terrorism regulation that is largely based on the standards developed by the Financial Action Task Force, an international inter-governmental body. The financial institutions, including operators of credit card networks and issuing banks, with whom we conduct business are subject to the provisions of the Bank Secrecy Act, as amended by the USA PATRIOT Act, and these financial institutions require us to maintain comprehensive anti‑money laundering and anti-terrorism financing programs. We are also subject to laws that prohibit knowingly engaging in financial transactions involving the proceeds of specified criminal activity. In general, these requirements mean that we must undertake certain efforts to prevent the use of our payment processing system to facilitate money laundering and the financing of terrorist activities, including, for example, the designation of a compliance officer, training of employees, adoption of internal policies and procedures to mitigate money laundering risks, and periodic audits. As are all U.S. citizens and U.S. entities, we are subject to regulations imposed by the U.S. Department of the Treasury Office of Foreign Assets Control, or OFAC, which prohibit or restrict financial and other transactions with specified countries, and designated individuals and entities, such as terrorists and narcotics traffickers.
 Some jurisdictions in which we and our customers operate have also adopted criminal law provisions that make it an offense to knowingly provide a financial service to a listed person or terrorist group, or to deal with or facilitate a dealing with property of a listed person or terrorist group, Names of persons and entities identified by the Security Council of the United Nations, generally, are included on this list. Antiterrorism resolutions of the United Nations are implemented by the governments of many jurisdictions in which we operate. Similarly, economic sanctions have been implemented by many of the jurisdictions in which we operate, and restrict dealing with, and providing financial services to, designated persons and entities and, in some cases, nationals of a sanctioned jurisdiction. Often, such international sanctions are similar in many respects to OFAC regulations and sanctions implemented by the United States government, although the foreign sanctions do sometimes differ.
 As a payments processor that does not handle customer funds, our primary responsibilities in this area relate to the underwriting and monitoring of merchants in our direct merchant portfolio. Our acquiring bank customers have the responsibility for underwriting merchants in their own portfolios, for which we are just acting as the processor, and the primary responsibility for monitoring unusual transactions. We have procedures and controls in place that are designed to protect against having direct business dealings with countries, individuals or entities that are subject to OFAC‑administered sanctions.
 Anti-money laundering and anti-terrorism regulations and economic sanctions laws are constantly evolving and we cannot predict how future regulations or changes thereto might affect us. Therefore, we monitor our compliance with anti‑money laundering regulations to ensure that we comply with the most current legal requirements. Complying with future regulation could be expensive or require us to change the way we operate our business.
 Privacy and data security regulation
 We collect and store consumers’ personally identifiable information on behalf of our customers, including names, card account numbers and expiration dates, and maintain a database of consumer data relating to specific transactions, including card numbers, in order to process transactions and assist our customers with retrieval requests, chargebacks and refunds. We also collect and store personally identifiable information about merchants and individual principals of these merchants, in connection with the underwriting of merchants in our direct merchant business, including names, addresses, social security numbers and employer identification numbers. As a service provider to financial institutions in the United States, we comply with the privacy provisions of GLBA and its implementing regulations and, as applicable with various other federal, state and foreign privacy statutes and regulations, and the PCI Security Standards Council’s Data Security Standards, each of which is subject to change at any time. We may only use and disclose the personal information we receive on behalf of our customers for the purposes for which it was provided to us and consistent with each acquiring bank and processor’s own data privacy and security obligations.

 
  21

 

 In order to comply with our obligations under GLBA, applicable state and foreign laws and our contractual agreements with our acquiring banks and processors, we are required to safeguard and protect the privacy of personally identifiable information we receive. As part of their compliance with the requirements, each of our U.S. customers is expected to have a program in place for responding to unauthorized access to, or use of, consumer information that could result in substantial harm or inconvenience to consumers. Almost all U.S. states have enacted security breach legislation, requiring varying levels of consumer notification in the event of a security breach, which could result in significant costs to us and significant damage to our reputation.
 Outside of the United States, most of the foreign jurisdictions in which we or our customers operate have laws regulating the protection of personal data. We may be subject to these laws as a result of our contractual arrangement with our customers or as a result of our collection of personal data from individuals residing in these foreign jurisdictions.
 The interpretation of pending and existing laws and regulations is evolving and, therefore, these laws and regulations may be applied inconsistently. In addition, new privacy and data security requirements continue to be introduced. It is possible that our current data protection policies and practices may be deemed inconsistent with new legal requirements or interpretations thereof, and breaches in the security of our payment processing platform and technology could result in a violation of these laws and regulations.
 Internal Revenue Service regulations
 The IRS adopted Section 1.6050W‑1 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 requiring acquiring banks, processors, and card associations to file Form 1099‑K reports regarding sales volumes processed on behalf of merchants using payment cards, commencing January 2012. This regulation imposes obligations on us to collect and report on information regarding the sales activities of merchants in the United States for which we process transactions. This regulation required us to modify our systems and processes and resulted in additional costs and imposed additional requirements on the way we provide our services to our customers.  This regulation may be subject to change or may be supplemented by additional regulations and it is not possible to predict the impact of such new regulations on our business and operations.
 Card association and payment network organization rules
 The acquiring banks that are our customers or that sponsor the bank identification numbers for Visa transactions and interbank card association numbers for MasterCard transactions that our customers use, whether or not such acquiring banks are our customers, must register Planet with Visa and MasterCard as a third-party processor. Visa and MasterCard set the standards with which we and the acquiring banks must comply. As a result of being registered as a third‑party processor, we are subject to card association rules and standards, and if we fail to comply with those rules and standards, the card association or network organization may subject our acquiring banks to a variety of fines or other penalties for which we could be responsible, including the termination of our ability to process transactions routed through these entities. Each card association and network organization has the power to audit us, as well as our merchant and acquiring bank customers from time to time, to ensure compliance with their rules and standards. We continue to work with our acquiring banks, processors and card associations to implement and maintain appropriate policies and programs, as well as adapt our business practices in order to comply with all applicable rules and standards.
 The card association rules and standards have included and may in the future include rules impacting DCC and multi‑currency pricing services such as ours. For example, in regions outside of Europe, Visa maintains a prohibition on performing DCC services on cash withdrawal transactions performed at ATMs with Visa cards and card associations other than Visa and MasterCard, such as UnionPay and American Express, only permit Multi-Currency Pricing services on transactions undertaken with their cards in certain circumstances. Additionally, JCB launched a pilot of DCC in certain Asia-Pacific markets.  We currently have a limited agreement with JCB that enables us to offer our Multi-Currency Pricing service only in North America for Japanese Yen and U.S. Dollars; we also have an agreement with American Express to offer our Multi-Currency Pricing service for e‑commerce transactions in many markets around the world. Planet also has an agreement with UnionPay to offer Multi-Currency Pricing for e-commerce transactions in the United States, Canada and the Cayman Islands for U.S. Dollars, Chinese Yuan, Hong Kong Dollars, Singapore Dollars and other relevant APAC currencies. 

 
  22

 

 Currently, rules issued by both Visa and MasterCard require DCC service providers to make certain disclosures regarding the currency conversion information and to offer consumers a choice as to whether to accept the currency conversion. The specific disclosure requirements and procedures vary for each card type and may also differ according to the merchant’s industry vertical. 
 In addition, Visa has established a certification regime that requires all new DCC services, and all changes to certified DCC solutions, to undergo a certification process and be approved by Visa. Visa also charges acquiring banks an annual fee of $45,000 for each country and territory in which they offer a DCC service. Additionally, both Visa and MasterCard charge additional cross‑border fees for transactions involving DCC. Visa’s compliance regime for DCC includes unannounced “mystery shopping” audits of our customer’s merchants, to assess how merchants are complying with the regulations applicable to DCC. Repeated failure by an acquiring bank or merchant to comply with regulations can result in substantial fines and ultimately a prohibition upon their offering DCC. Remediation of negative audit findings can be costly and time consuming for our customers.
 Visa, MasterCard and other network operating rules are subject to change at any time and in particular include twice yearly “compliance updates” each April and October. Such changes or updates often require us to modify our systems and processes and may result in additional costs, require substantial internal development work and change, or impose additional requirements on, the way we provide our services.
 Currently, the standard settlement period mandated by the NACHA rules for ACH transactions is the next business day after processing. NACHA has begun to implement new capabilities and rules permitting same-day ACH payments. The NACHA same-day ACH rule enables the option for same-day ACH payments through additional ACH functionality, without affecting previously available ACH schedules and capabilities. The changes have become effective in phases to allow financial institutions and businesses to acclimate to a faster processing environment. Beginning September 15, 2017, same-day ACH processing will be available for debit entries, enabling the same-day processing of most ACH payments, with exceptions for international transactions and high-value transactions above $25,000.
 Other laws and regulations
 As we develop new services and solutions, we may become subject to additional laws or regulations. These additional laws or regulations could substantially restrict the nature of the business in which we may engage. In addition, changes in current or future laws or regulations may restrict our ability to operate our business and may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
 In addition, changes to laws and regulations, or the interpretation or enforcement thereof, could have a negative financial effect on our business. Even an inadvertent failure to comply with laws and regulations could damage our business or our reputation. We cannot predict the substance or impact of pending or future legislation or regulation, or the application thereof, although enactment of such legislation or rules would affect how we and our customers operate and could significantly increase costs, impede the efficiency of internal business processes and limit our ability to pursue business opportunities in an efficient manner.
 Intellectual property
 Our intellectual property rights are a key component of our business success. We rely on a combination of patent, trademark, copyright, unfair competition and trade secret laws, as well as confidentiality procedures and contractual restrictions, to establish, maintain and protect our proprietary rights. These laws, procedures and restrictions provide only limited protection and any of our intellectual property rights may be challenged, invalidated, circumvented, infringed or misappropriated. Further, the laws of certain countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States and, therefore, in certain jurisdictions, we may be unable to protect our proprietary technology. We generally require employees, consultants, customers, suppliers and partners to execute confidentiality agreements with us that restrict the disclosure of our intellectual property and other confidential information. We also generally require our employees and consultants to execute invention assignment agreements with us that protect our intellectual property rights. Despite these precautions, third parties may obtain and use without our consent intellectual property that we own

or license. Any unauthorized use of our intellectual property by third parties, and the expenses incurred in protecting our intellectual property rights, may adversely affect our business.
 As of December 31, 2016, we had a total of twenty-two (22) issued patents in the United States, Australia, India, Indonesia, Japan, Korea, Malaysia, New Zealand, the Philippines, Singapore, South Africa, Sri Lanka and Taiwan, and an allowed application in Canada. We also have patent applications pending in the United States and several other jurisdictions, all of which are counterparts of our United States patents and patent applications. Our patents generally have a duration of 20 years from the respective priority date of each patent. We cannot ensure that any of our pending patent applications will be granted or that any of our issued patents will adequately protect our intellectual property. Any patents that have been, or may be issued to us may be contested, circumvented, found unenforceable or invalidated and we may not be able to prevent third parties from infringing them. 
 The patent laws of the United States and foreign countries in which we have issued patents and/or pending applications may change, making it more difficult or impossible to obtain or enforce patent rights related to our business. In addition, third parties could claim invalidity, co‑inventorship or assert other claims with respect to any of our currently issued patents or any patents that may be issued to us in the future. Any such claims, whether or not successful, could be extremely costly to defend, divert management’s time, attention and resources, damage our reputation and brand, and substantially harm our business. Therefore, the precise effect of having a patent cannot be predicted with certainty.
 We own and use distinctive trademarks on or in connection with our products and services, including both unregistered common law marks and trademarks registered in the United States, Canada, Hong Kong, Mexico and the European Union. We have also registered numerous Internet domain names.
 While we actively take steps to protect our proprietary rights, such steps may not be sufficient to prevent third parties from infringing or misappropriating our intellectual property. Trade secrets are difficult to protect.
 From time to time, we may become involved in disputes over rights and obligations concerning intellectual property. Although we believe that our product offerings do not infringe the intellectual property rights of any third party, we have not performed any significant freedom‑to‑operate analyses with respect to U.S. or foreign patent rights, and we cannot be certain that we will prevail in any intellectual property dispute. If we do not prevail in these disputes, we may lose some or all of our intellectual property protection, be enjoined from further sales of our products that are determined to infringe the rights of others, and/or be forced to pay substantial license fees or royalties to a third party, any of which would adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
