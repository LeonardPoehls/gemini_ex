ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
We transform security through visibility. We have pioneered an agentless approach to network security to protect organizations against the emerging threats that exploit the billions of Internet of Things, or IoT, devices connected to organizations’ networks. Over 28 billion devices will be connected to the internet by the year 2020, according to ABI Research, and a growing percentage of them will be used for business purposes through Bring Your Own Device, or BYOD, and Enterprise IoT initiatives. According to the 2017 Strategic Roadmap for IoT Network Technology by Gartner, Inc., or Gartner, (January 2017), 63 million IoT devices will be attempting to connect to the enterprise network each second by 2020. While IoT brings tremendous value to an organization, the traditional approach of relying on a corporate-installed software agent to secure a device has significant limitations in today’s world. Organizations cannot effectively deploy agents on non-corporate-issued devices and many Enterprise IoT devices are developed using a wide variety of platforms and operating systems that cannot support agents. As the volume and variety of devices increases, organizations’ abilities to manage devices decreases, creating a major gap in visibility. 
The threat landscape is rapidly evolving, and attackers are now leveraging the gap in device visibility to gain access to organizations. New attacks are stealthy, targeted, and pervasive and can target known and unknown software vulnerabilities that can persist undetected inside a network for months. As organizations invest billions of dollars to protect their traditional devices—personal computers, servers, and mobile systems—attackers are shifting their focus to the less secure BYOD and IoT devices, which have exponentially increased the attack surface within organizations. Attackers use these unsecured devices and a lack of IT control to enter a network and traverse through systems, gathering information before executing an attack. The response to such attacks is often both uncoordinated and manual because existing security systems operate in silos and security teams often lack the ability to share information and coordinate an attack response.
Organizations need a new approach to security that gives them the ability to see and control the devices connected to their networks. Over the past ten years, ForeScout has developed proprietary agentless technology that discovers and classifies IP-based devices in real time as they connect to the network and continuously monitors and assesses their security posture. Our solution supports heterogeneous wired and wireless networks, as well as both virtual and cloud infrastructures, while scaling to meet the needs of globally distributed organizations. We have built an extensive repository of policies that control how devices are expected to behave on the network. When a device deviates from a policy, we can immediately take action. Additionally, we offer more than 70 bi-directional workflow integrations with third-party systems that allow us to share contextual data on devices, enforce access policies, and automate security responses. 
Our solution is sold as either a physical or virtual appliance through a perpetual software license, with each appliance designed to manage a certain number of connected devices within an organization. As the number of devices in the organization increases, customers purchase additional appliances. We recently started offering, in limited quantities to a small number of large enterprises, CounterACT and Enterprise Manager together as a software-only license, or Enterprise License Software. Our Enterprise License Software is either sold with separate hardware or without hardware, depending on the end-customer’s selection. End-customers typically initially deploy our solution across a region or across their wired or wireless network, then expand their usage to cover additional regions and networks. After customers achieve enhanced visibility and control of their devices, they can deploy new use cases that leverage third-party integrations licensed as add-on modules. Increasingly, we are seeing larger initial roll outs as customers recognize their significant visibility gaps and our ease of deployment. We had 48 annual end-customer deals over $1.0 million in fiscal 2017 as compared to 26 and 28 annual end-customer deals over $1.0 million in fiscal 2015 and 2016, respectively. 
We sell into all industries and into organizations of all sizes, with a focus on those that are highly regulated or with a large footprint of transient devices. Our largest industries include financial services, healthcare, government agencies, high tech, and manufacturing. We target the largest accounts in each industry first to establish reference accounts for that sector. As of December 31, 2017, we have sold to over 2,700 end-customers in over 80 countries, including 18% of the Global 2000, since our inception, with more than 52 million devices under management. We utilize a high-touch direct sales force with deep security expertise and strong industry relationships. We are one of the only security providers in our market that is not part of a larger networking organization. This allows our sales representatives to solely focus on selling the value proposition of visibility and control. We sell our products predominantly through a network of value added resellers and systems integrators that provide a broad reach into various segments of the market across geographies.

We have experienced rapid growth in recent periods. For the years ended December 31, 2015, 2016, and 2017, our revenue was $126.0 million, $166.8 million, and $220.9 million, respectively, representing year-over-year growth of 32% and 32%, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2015, 2016, and 2017, our net loss was $27.3 million, $74.8 million, and $91.2 million respectively. 
Industry Background
Enterprises lack full visibility into devices connected to their networks
Increase in the number and diversity of devices
An increasing number and variety of devices are entering and connecting to enterprise networks every day that are not manageable by IT departments. These devices include employee BYOD, such as smartphones, laptops, and tablets that are not owned by organizations, non-employee BYOD, such as devices owned by third-party contractors and others doing business within enterprises, and an increasing number of IoT devices used for corporate purposes, including point-of-sale machines, heating and air conditioning systems, printers, security cameras, and medical devices. While once a small percentage of the IT landscape, we believe that as of December 31, 2017, these types of devices can account for up to 75% of devices connected to an organization’s network. Historically, enterprises have been able to install an agent, or small piece of software, onto a corporate-managed device to secure and manage the device, and to gather characteristics about the device when it connects to a network. By integrating with an agent, organizations have been able to make a determination as to whether or not to allow a device onto a network. However, as corporate-managed devices become a smaller percentage of the total population and as BYOD and IoT become a larger percentage of the total population, this agent-based approach no longer works. IT departments cannot force users to install agents on BYOD devices and many IoT devices do not have the ability to install agents.
Increase in operating system diversity and standards
The increase in volume and diversity of connected devices has coincided with the rapid growth of new operating systems running on these devices. Traditional corporate devices typically run on open standard operating systems such as Windows, Linux, iOS, and Android. For decades, agent-based systems have worked with standard operating systems because there were few options available and it was possible to create different versions of software for each operating system. However, new device types are increasingly developed with specialized operating systems specific to each device and closed to integrations, which can lead to a vast number of operating systems in the market. This trend has made it technically unfeasible and impractical to build different versions of agent-based software for each new operating system in the market. The diversity of operating systems further complicates the management of new devices by IT departments.
Pace of new technology adoption 
The fast pace of new technology adoption further complicates the visibility and manageability problem. Technology is refreshed continuously and employees expect to use new technology and have real-time access to systems, regardless of the device they are using. IT departments cannot test new technologies fast enough to keep up with the pace of change, and the default action is often to allow devices onto the network, without a consistent security policy. As more unsecured devices are allowed onto the network, the surface area of attack grows.
Adoption of cloud technologies has resulted in more complex IT environments further reducing visibility
Enterprise networks are undergoing significant change, contributing to the lack of visibility and control over IT assets. The disappearing enterprise perimeter, increase in virtualization technology and movement of workloads to the public cloud have resulted in decentralized management of IT assets as more people have direct access to virtual and cloud-based resources. The rapid adoption of cloud service providers, such as Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud, and Microsoft Azure, for applications and computing has changed the data center from a fairly static and controlled environment to a more dynamic and de-centralized environment. With increasing frequency, organizations are accessing devices in the cloud, including physical and virtual servers, and users are connecting to cloud-based environments from disparate locations. Unlike on-premise data centers which can favor infrastructure from a single vendor, cloud environments are heterogeneous, integrating a wide variety of system types and vendors. Device visibility and control needs to apply to all devices, no matter where they are located, and be able to integrate into a heterogeneous network and computing environment.

Convergence of IT and OT expands the attack surface
Companies run their physical operations in their operational networks. Devices on those networks include SCADA devices and industrial control systems that you typically find in dams, bridges, oil and gas pipelines, manufacturing assembly lines and much of U.S. critical infrastructure. Given the criticality of these devices, they seldom can be taken offline for maintenance or patching, and agents are often impossible to install. This leaves them vulnerable to cyberattacks.
To protect themselves, companies have ‘air-gapped’ these networks by isolating them from external systems. However, as the Industrial IoT revolution is taking place, organizations have a need to connect these devices to the rest of their IT network and the cloud in order to monitor and improve business performance. As they connect these networks to the outside world, organizations are realizing they do not understand what they have connected, undermining the security of these networks and greatly increasing the risks they face.
Existing security solutions operate in silos 
The average enterprise uses 75 distinct security products, according to public statements by a representative of Symantec Corporation. These solutions can be effective at determining what is good and bad based on their own intelligence and preventing an attack if it falls within the scope of their specific capability. However, point solutions generally have limited ability to leverage information generated by other solutions in order to gain a better understanding of a potential threat or coordinate a multi-system response to a threat.
Many security solutions generate alerts when they sense an attack, triggering human involvement by security teams to review alert data and determine the best course of action based on judgment. These security solutions often generate false positives and a high volume of alerts, which can result in no response, or a manual and slow response, as IT teams must gather data from multiple systems to piece together a storyline and make a determination about how to respond. In many cases, gaps in the manual review process can result in alerts not being properly investigated and followed through to completion. Human-based processes face significant challenges scaling to meet the demands of an increasingly complex and dynamic security environment.
More cyberattacks are entering organizations by leveraging gaps in network visibility and vendor silos 
The significant increase in undetected and unmanaged devices on a network has increased the surface area of attack for enterprises as cybercriminals target less secure devices with the same access levels as corporate-managed devices (i.e., desktops and corporate laptops). Today, organizations face adversaries that are more sophisticated and keenly aware of safeguards designed to defend networks from malicious threats. These adversaries seek to exploit areas of vulnerability where threats can enter undetected and remain within a network for an extended period of time before executing an attack. Once in, hackers can move laterally, communicating across a distributed network and infiltrating a wide range of devices with malicious malware. Examples of recent cyberattacks illustrating these trends include:

• | NotPetya (IT ransomware disrupts OT systems)—June 2017: The ransomware was designed to exploit a vulnerability in MS Windows. While an earlier variant called WannaCry primarily impacted IT systems throughout the world, the NotPetya attack infiltrated OT networks, crippling supply chains in manufacturing, transportation, utilities and other industries. 


• | FedEx delivery in Europe interrupted


• | Maersk lost $300 million because they couldn’t remove cargo from their ships


• | Reckitt Benckiser, a British consumer company, suffered production disruptions with an estimated $135 million in lost revenue


• | Mondelez, a multinational confectionery, food and beverage company, (Cadbury, Nabisco) incurred a loss of three percentage points from its second-quarter sales growth


• | Renault and Nissan had to shut down auto manufacturing plants

• | The Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant had to disconnect Microsoft Windows systems and manually conducted radiation monitoring


• | Ukraine’s national bank, state power company and largest airport all saw their networks crash. “The official site of the airport and the scoreboard with the schedule of flights aren't working!” Boryspil International Airport Acting Director Pavel Ryabikin wrote on Facebook. ATMs and supermarket tills were also left inoperable, flashing a message left by the hackers


• | Merck experienced $300 million in lost revenues and had to adjust financial guidance to the SEC


• | Equifax, Inc. (unauthorized entry)—March-July 2017: Hackers gained access to the data of credit reporting agency Equifax because an individual in Equifax’s technology department had failed to heed security warnings and did not ensure the implementation of software fixes that could have prevented the breach. By taking advantage of the security lapse, hackers compromised the personal data of over 143 million people.


• | Dyn, Inc. (DDoS attack using IoT)—October 2016: Hackers executed a massive Distributed Denial of Service, or DDoS, attack on Dyn, a company used to provide core internet services to a number of web-based businesses including Amazon, Twitter, Netflix, Spotify, Airbnb, and the New York Times, among many others. Using approximately 100,000 IoT devices such as security cameras, printers, cell phones, and DVRs, hackers were able to direct an overwhelming amount of traffic at Dyn servers, overloading the servers and taking down the services reliant upon Dyn. Critical business applications were unavailable for hours, affecting thousands of businesses. Since then, the same Mirai Botnet used in the Dyn attack has been used to perpetuate several other IoT-led DDoS attacks.

Addressing the device visibility problem is one of the next major enterprise priorities in the evolution of the security industry
Over time, the evolution of new threat vectors has resulted in the introduction of new markets in security and caused a major change in cybersecurity spend.

• | In the 1990s, the transition from mainframe to client-server architecture, in conjunction with the introduction of the Windows OS, led to the proliferation of new viruses that would infiltrate computer systems and spread throughout a network. The anti-virus market developed in response to these threats, protecting predominantly Windows PCs with signature-based defense. According to IDC, this market grew to $4.2 billion in 2015.


• | In the mid-2000s, more prevalent instances of data exfiltration from organizations by company insiders and Nation States led to significant new spend on data loss prevention and encryption software to prevent data breaches.


• | In the 2010s, the onset of more sophisticated and zero-day attacks directed at specific companies led to a shift in security spend. The attack on Sony Pictures Entertainment, believed to be by North Korea to prevent the release of the film “The Interview,” is an example of such an advanced threat. New industry-wide spending related to advanced and persistent threats and endpoint detection and response emerged to combat these new and more damaging threats.

Today, the lack of visibility caused by the proliferation of new devices and operating systems has created the need for a new control point in security. The number of IP-based devices is rising at the same time manageability of those devices is declining. The gap demonstrates increasing vulnerability and a widening surface area of attack. We believe solving the visibility problem will become the first and most important line of defense in preventing previously undetected attacks.
Traditional NAC technology has significant limitations
The Network Access Control, or NAC, market began in 2003 as a means to drive the sales of network infrastructure products. The core technology and functionality of traditional NAC technology still exists today, but has seen limited innovation by large networking vendors since its inception and has significant limitations in today’s world.
Reliant on agents to detect devices
NAC technology relies on an 802.1x supplicant, or agent, installed on a device to allow companies to authenticate corporate-managed devices as they attempt to connect to the network. These solutions cannot detect certain devices, including BYOD and 
9

IoT devices, which do not have a corporate-installed agent, or run operating systems that cannot integrate with agents. To address this problem with traditional NAC technologies, enterprises have to whitelist all of the devices that cannot accept an agent, which is administratively impractical.
Limited functionality
The core functionality of a NAC solution is control, or the ability to allow or deny access to a network based on the authentication of the device at a single point in time. This “on or off” determination often does not provide organizations the flexibility to move a device to a more secure network, limit the device access to the network, or alert third-party security systems or IT administrators to a problem. Further, these systems do not continuously assess the security posture of the device after a connection is made. Because the core functionality is control, NAC does not coordinate with other third-party systems to automate a response to a threat.
Dependent on vendor-specific systems
Because the NAC market was established to drive sales of network infrastructure products, traditional NAC solutions are often dependent on vendor-specific switches and routers and are designed to only work with these systems. Organizations are then limited in their ability to adopt new technologies, or run in heterogeneous environments, such as the public cloud. Traditional vendors often bundle NAC products into a broad network solution, so they lack the ability or motivation to enable these products to work across heterogeneous environments.
Enterprises need a solution that addresses today’s network complexities and dynamic threat environment
Enterprises must address the device visibility problem and close the gap between device proliferation and device manageability. We believe that effective solutions to solve this problem require the following characteristics:

• | Agentless. Ability to detect a broad range of devices connecting to a network by integrating directly with network infrastructure, without relying on a corporate-installed agent.


• | Continuous. Ability to provide continuous visibility into connected devices after initial authentication.


• | Automated. Ability to immediately and automatically determine what to do with a device based on policy and behaviors.


• | Integrated. Ability to share and enrich data among systems to better understand the context of an environment and of device posture to automate a response.


• | Heterogeneous. Ability to work across multi-vendor platforms and provide the same level of visibility and control to devices on-premise, in the cloud, or in hybrid environments.


• | Scalable. Ability to scale within an enterprise, providing the same level of service across an environment as the number of devices grows.

Our Solution
We provide visibility and control solutions to a broad range of organizations. We have spent over a decade developing proprietary technology that allows us to discover IP-based devices as they connect to a network, classify them based on characteristics, assess their security posture based on policy and behaviors, and take action on those devices, all without the use of an agent. 
10

Key benefits of our solution include the following:

• | Greater visibility into devices connected to the network. Because our solution discovers the increasing proportion of IP-based devices that do not have agents, our end-customers have reported seeing up to 60% more devices on their network than previously known. We provide increased visibility into devices regardless of their physical location— on-premise, in the public cloud and in corporate data centers as well as branch offices and operational technology environments.


• | Continuous visibility. Our solution sees devices when they connect to the network and at all times while connected. We have the ability to detect a change in device posture, such as outdated or broken agents, as well as determine when a device is not acting the way we believe it should be based on our extensive repository of expected behaviors developed over the past 15 years.


• | Automated control based on policy. Once our solution discovers and classifies devices, it provides organizations a choice of what to do with these devices based on granular compliance and security policies. Organizations can set their own specific security policies upon connection. Examples of how we enforce an organization’s security policies could include the following:


– | Ensure latest anti-virus software is installed;


– | Limit third-party contractors to a section of the network that only provides access to required resources;


– | Update encryption software before connecting;


– | Block a device from the network if it fails to meet policy, such as a non-sanctioned device;


– | Apply device specific policy to categories of devices, such as printers; and


– | Immediately remove from a network if behaviors change from policy.

Once the security posture of a device is determined, we provide many options beyond allow or deny for network access, including segmenting to a more secure VLAN, alerting IT teams or third-party systems of potential threats, or quarantining devices from the network. Our solution enforces these policies automatically, without the need for human involvement.

• | Orchestration of actions between systems. Our solution enables third-party systems to share data to gain better context of device posture and orchestrate an automated response. We have built integrations with leading providers in the firewall, security information and event management, advanced threat detection, vulnerability assessment, endpoint protection, endpoint detection, and response markets, among others. Our technology extends the value of an organization’s existing security investments by interconnecting fragmented security tools. Examples of actions we can affect through our orchestration capabilities include:


– | Provide up-to-date device properties, classification, configuration and network context to ServiceNow to gain a current view of networked assets, track their movement, and remediate or retire these assets as required;


– | Trigger Rapid7 or Qualys to run a real-time vulnerability assessment at time of connection;

11


– | Receive an indicator of compromise from FireEye or Palo Alto Networks and remove impacted devices from the network;


– | Provide Palo Alto Networks next-generation firewall, or NGFW, with device context (type, function, posture, user) to enable dynamic network segmentation; and


– | Share with Splunk real-time device information for accelerated incident identification and automated response.


• | Integrated across a heterogeneous environment. We are one of the only independent companies in our market that is not owned by a large networking company. We integrate with a diverse group of switches, routers and servers and are not constrained by a single vendor dependency. Our ability to integrate with all major network infrastructures is particularly important as workloads move to the cloud and organizations utilize heterogeneous environments serviced by many vendors. This independence allows us to be more adaptive as technologies evolve and provides end-customers with ease of implementation, freedom from vendor lock-in, and resilience to upgrade and refresh cycles.


• | Scalable to cover the increasing number of devices on a network. We grow as more devices come online in the enterprise. As of December 31, 2017, we had sold products with licenses covering over 52 million devices. Our high-end appliances can each manage up to 10,000 devices and we can deploy multiple appliances within a single environment. We support organizations of all sizes and scale, with our largest end-customers using us to manage over one million devices on the network. While many of our end-customers expand their initial deployment by department or use case, increasingly our end-customers are deploying initial multi-million dollar enterprise-wide deployments based on the value our appliances provide during a proof of concept.

Our Market Opportunity
According to Gartner, a total of approximately $96 billion is expected to be spent on enterprise security software and equipment in 2018; however, today’s threat landscape is evolving faster than the security market and new technologies are constantly emerging to target the new and more sophisticated and dynamic threat vectors initiated from hackers and Nation States. Organizations are adopting more technology from emerging vendors that have innovative solutions to address new forms of threats. The massive increase in BYOD and IoT devices presents a major security gap in organizations and increases their surface area of attack. Organizations have a strategic imperative to gain visibility over devices connected to their network in order to stop the proliferation of malware. We believe visibility and control solutions represent the next major control point in security, and as such, will garner a greater share of overall security spend over time as traditional defenses become less relevant in today’s dynamic threat environment.
We internally estimate that the total addressable market, or TAM, for our solution is approximately $10.8 billion for 2018. We expect our TAM to increase as the number of addressable devices is projected to nearly double over the next four years. To calculate our TAM, we first derived the total number of addressable devices within organizations worldwide based on independent third-party data, which includes global corporate-managed devices, BYOD devices, and IoT devices that would be found in an enterprise IT environment. We then excluded addressable devices that we believe are attributable to organizations that are currently outside of our core target market. For the purposes of this calculation, we define our core target market as enterprises with annual revenue greater than $500 million and government agencies. Using third-party data, we estimated the ratio of employees in organizations within our core target market to total employees in organizations worldwide. Next, we multiplied this ratio by the total number of addressable devices in organizations worldwide to estimate the total number of addressable devices in our core target market.  Finally, we multiplied the total number of addressable devices in our core target market by a conservative assumed average sales price per device. 
Our Competitive Strengths
We believe we have several competitive advantages that will enable us to maintain and extend our market position as the pioneer of visibility and control solutions. Our key competitive strengths include:

• | Ongoing product innovation. In 2006, we made the strategic decision to develop an agentless architecture. Our core technology differentiates us in the market and positions us to capitalize on the proliferation of new device types entering the enterprise that cannot be supported by agent-based technologies. We constantly innovate on our products and have made improvements in areas such as device classification, network system integration, scalability of ForeScout

12

Enterprise Manager, user interface, and high availability. In 2012, we introduced our first Extended Module, enhancing our solution by adding third-party integrations and orchestration capabilities. Our large-scale competitors still rely on agent-based solutions and lack the motivation to re-architect their solutions.

• | Rapid time to value. Organizations often begin realizing the benefit of our solution almost immediately after implementation as they see substantially more devices on their network than previously known. We have customers that have deployed our solution across hundreds of thousands of devices in less than 90 days. Increasingly, customers are deploying our solution more broadly after an initial proof of concept to cover wired networks (on-premise), wireless networks (remote and visitor devices), data centers, and branch offices. We can support a gradual implementation or large initial enterprise-wide deployment depending on our customer’s needs.


• | Broad appeal of our product across diverse customer base. We serve customers of all sizes across diverse industries and have seen particularly strong demand from customers in highly regulated industries, such as financial services, healthcare and government agencies, where the impact of an attack can be particularly severe. We also see high demand from industries with a large volume of transient devices, such as education and retail. Our customers include some of the largest enterprises in the world. As of December 31, 2017, we had sold to 18% of the Global 2000, since our inception, with more than 52 million devices under management. We are deeply integrated into our customers’ security infrastructure and have a long-term, loyal base of customers with many relationships spanning over 10 years. 


• | Recognized market leadership. We have received multiple innovation awards from industry analysts and publications, including Frost & Sullivan, SC Magazine, Network Computing, Forbes, and CRN. In 2016, we received the JPMorgan Chase Hall of Innovation Award for Transformative Security Technology. We believe our market reputation makes us one of the most prominent vendors in an increasingly important segment in security.


• | Global market reach driven by direct and indirect sales strategy. We have recruited top sales talent from leading security organizations and retain the highest quality sales representatives with demonstrated success. We are one of the only vendors in our market solely focused on visibility and control and as such, our sales representatives are solely focused on selling the standalone value of our products. To many of our competitors, our category represents a relatively small portion of their overall revenue. We are also investing in our channel partners to expand our reach across organizations and geographies.


• | Strong leadership team of security experts. Our management team has extensive security domain expertise with a proven track record of scaling and running profitable businesses. Our Chief Executive Officer, Michael DeCesare, has over 25 years of technology industry experience, including as President of Intel Security and Executive Vice President of Worldwide Sales at McAfee. We have a deep bench of talent at the executive level, with years of industry experience at McAfee, Symantec, Tanium, and HP Enterprise Company. Our board of directors includes current and former leaders of leading public security companies including Symantec, FireEye, and McAfee.

Our Growth Strategy
We intend to execute on the following growth strategies:

• | Expand within our existing end-customers as more devices enter the enterprise. We expect to grow within our end-customer base as more devices come online within the enterprise. Our product revenue is directly tied to the number of licensed devices managed by our solution, therefore we sell more product as more devices come online. As of December 31, 2017, we had sold products with licenses covering over 52 million devices.


• | Expand within our existing end-customers as we expand to new parts of their network. End-customers often expand usage of our products as they realize the value and applicability to other areas within an organization. We expect to grow as our end-customers broaden their use of our solution across wired networks (on-premise), wireless networks (remote and visitor devices), data centers, branch offices and various geographies as well as public cloud and operational technology environments.


• | Grow global end-customer base. We have invested significantly, and plan to continue to invest, in our sales organization to drive new end-customer growth. Between December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2017, we have grown the number of quota-bearing sales representatives by 156% with the majority focused on the Global 2000 and government agencies.

13

As of December 31, 2017, our current base of end-customers includes 18% of the Global 2000, representing a significant opportunity to expand our market reach. In the future, we also plan to increase sales to mid-size enterprises.

• | Increase sales of our Extended Modules. We are seeing strong demand for our Extended Modules as end-customers increasingly require coordinated information sharing and policy-based security enforcement across their networks. Our Extended Modules had an attach rate of approximately 38% for the year ended December 31, 2017, which represents the annual value of Extended Modules as a percentage of CounterACT sales on orders where both products are sold together or subsequent stand-alone Extended Module sales. As of December 31, 2017, we had a portfolio of over 20 Extended Modules. We have also established an Alliance Partner program that allows us to productize these integrations and leverage joint go-to-market efforts. Today, we have an Alliance Partnerships with CrowdStrike, CyberArk, FireEye, Fortinet, Juniper Networks, Palo Alto Networks, ServiceNow and Splunk.


• | Expand our presence in the market by leveraging our ecosystem of channel partners. We will continue to broaden and invest in our channel partner relationships to increase distribution of our products. We are focused on educating existing partners and investing in sales enablement to expand our market reach through our channel partner network, particularly into mid-market enterprises.

Our Products
We offer our solution across three products: (i) ForeScout CounterACT, (ii) ForeScout CounterACT Enterprise Manager, and (iii) ForeScout Extended Modules.
ForeScout CounterACT®
CounterACT agentless technology discovers, classifies, and assesses IP-based devices. CounterACT interrogates the network infrastructure to discover devices immediately as they attempt to connect to the network. Since it does not rely on agents, our end-customers have reported seeing up to 60% more devices on their networks than previously known. 
After discovering a device, CounterACT uses a combination of passive and active methods to classify the device based on its type and ownership—e.g., corporate-managed Windows, un-managed iPhone, digital security camera, or MRI device. Based on its classification, CounterACT then assesses the device security posture and allows organizations to set policies that establish the specific behavior the device is allowed to have while connected to a network.
14

CounterACT collects a rich set of data for each of the devices it sees. A sample of the types of data CounterACT collects include:
Once CounterACT discovers a security problem on a device, its sophisticated policy manager can automatically execute a range of responses depending on the severity of the problem. Minor violations might result in a warning message sent to the end user. Employees and contractors who bring their own devices can be redirected to an automated onboarding portal. Serious violations could result in actions such as blocking or quarantining the device, reinstallation of a security agent, re-starting of an agent (such as third-party antivirus software) or process, triggering the device to retrieve an operating system patch, segmenting to a more secure VLAN, or performing other remediation actions.
The following are examples of various control actions we can take:
15

ForeScout Extended Modules
Extended Modules expand the see and control capabilities of ForeScout CounterACT. As a result, organizations can share contextual device data with third-party systems, automate policy enforcement across disparate solutions, bridge previously siloed IT processes, accelerate system-wide responses, and rapidly mitigate risks.
Our Extended Modules represent integrations across vulnerability assessment (VA), advanced threat detection (ATD), security incidence and event management (SIEM), enterprise mobility management (EMM), endpoint protection (EPP) and endpoint detection and response (EDR), next generation firewall (NGFW), Privileged Access Management (PAM), and IT Systems Management (ITSM) vendors as well as compliance. Additionally, customers can create their own integration using our Open Integration Module (OIM).

Our foundational technologies are: (i) agentless data collection, (ii) an adaptive abstraction layer, (iii) a real time and continuous policy engine, and (iv) distributed and scalable architecture. We have invested over ten years of research and development into our technology and believe it represents a significant competitive advantage for us.

Agentless data collection. Our appliances use a combination of both active and passive methods to discover, classify and assess devices in an organization’s network. Utilizing active discovery methods, we can poll switches, VPN concentrators, and wireless controllers for a list of connected devices. Using NBT scans and NMAP, or via WMI for deeper inspection of corporate-managed devices, we can inspect workstations running Windows, Mac or Linux, without the use of agents. We also deploy passive inspection methods which allows our appliances to receive SNMP traps from switches and wireless controllers, monitor a network SPAN port to see network traffic, and leverage information such as TCP window sizes, session information, HTTP traffic, and DHCP information banners as well as NetFlow traffic data. If 802.1x is implemented, our technology can authenticate 802.1x requests to a built-in or external RADIUS server, and authorize network access. In addition, our technology can import external MAC classification data or request LDAP data. We continue to expand the methods we make available, such as the recently added Power over Ethernet (PoE). 
Adaptive abstraction layer. Our abstraction layer is able to ingest billions of packets of raw data across a wide array of heterogeneous network systems. We then consolidate this data into a single pane of glass showing our end-customers a real-time depiction of the devices on their networks by type. Our solution does not require vendor-specific network equipment, upgrades of existing infrastructure, or reconfiguration of each switch and switch port to support 802.1x. As organizations adopt virtual and cloud environments, our technology has the flexibility to integrate with hypervisor technologies and cloud platforms. 
The abstraction layer adapts to the IT enterprise environment and continuously enriches its information as organizations make more data available. As an example, organizations can choose to consume only NetFlow data, which is only the metadata of the actual network traffic. With this information, we can expedite detection of new devices, collect device properties such as IP address and session protocols, and understand which devices are talking to each other. If organizations choose to give our technology full access to their network traffic through a SPAN port, we can build on this and provide very granular information such as MAC address, HTTP user agent, device type, applications in use, and the ability to identify malicious traffic.
Real-time and continuous policy engine. CounterACT’s policy engine continuously checks devices against a set of policies that control how devices are expected to behave on the network. While other vendor technologies rely on periodic checks, or queries from an operator, our policy engine can do this continuously and in real-time for over one million devices. Our policies are triggered in real-time based on events occurring on a specific device. These can be network admission events, such as plugging into a switch port or change of IP address, authentication events like those received by RADIUS servers or detected by network traffic, changes in device attributes like user, opening/closing of ports, and specific traffic behavior such as how the device is communicating and what protocol it is using. 
The policy engine leverages both infrastructure and host-based controls. At the network switch, our technology can change a Virtual Local Area Network, or VLAN, add an Access Control List, or ACL, or disable a switch port. At a wireless controller, we can blacklist a MAC address or change the role of a user. In addition, our technology can restrict remote VPN users. At the host, our technology can start and stop applications, update anti-virus security agents, disable peripheral devices, and request end-user acknowledgment. The policy engine applies these policies automatically regardless of a device’s location. As the device moves, the policy engine can follow it within the corporate network, cloud, or data center. We determine the type of infrastructure and, based on policy, apply the appropriate control actions.
Distributed, scalable architecture. Enterprise Manager uses distributed computing algorithms so each appliance can independently manage devices within its control. This enables organizations to expand their deployment by simply adding more appliances. Enterprise Manager virtually consolidates the device information from all appliances into a single pane of a glass view for the administrator. The algorithms allow the administrator to search for security related information such as users, processes, services across the entire deployment in real time and retrieve it in seconds.

For the year ended December 31, 2016, three distributors represented 24%, 14%, and 13% of our total revenue, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2017, three distributors represented 30%, 21%, and 17% of our total revenue.
Customer Case Studies
The following are examples of how certain of our representative end-customers have selected, deployed, and benefited from the use of our solution. 
E*Trade
Problem: E*Trade’s primary challenges revolved around visibility, specifically for a real-time asset inventory to identify devices accessing its network, while routing out rogue devices with malicious intent.
Solution and Benefits: After an evaluation period and proof of concept with three vendors, ForeScout was chosen for its ease of use and vendor agnostic design in 2014, which is ideal for E*Trade’s complex, heterogeneous network environment. Additionally, with many managed and unmanaged devices, various networking equipment, and IoT devices including printers, security cameras, badge scanners, and more, ForeScout’s agentless approach could provide E*Trade with all the visibility and control it needed to discover and classify devices across its diverse infrastructure. E*Trade initially rolled out CounterACT to deliver visibility into the devices accessing its network. In the second phase to eradicate the threat of rogue devices attempting to infiltrate the network for confidential data, E*Trade moved into asset control. Deploying ForeScout has helped E*Trade eliminate the threat of rogue devices, by identifying and then blocking their access to the network, alleviating a big gap in its security spectrum. Additionally, ForeScout has helped E*Trade realize even greater value from its existing investments with Rapid7, Inc., HP Enterprise Company’s ArcSight, and VMware, Inc.’s Airwatch by sharing information for better visibility and control using ForeScout as the real-time enforcement point.
RWJBarnabas Health
Problem: RWJBarnabas Health (RWJBarnabas) is New Jersey's largest integrated healthcare delivery system comprised of hospitals, clinics, and ambulatory centers throughout the state. RWJBarnabas needed real-time visibility to identify, classify, and control the devices that access its network. In addition, RWJBarnabas had compliance requirements, like HIPAA and HITECH, and needed to maintain a strong security posture without impeding medical care, automate endpoint policy compliance and remediation, and accommodate vendor-owned-and-managed systems. Furthermore, as RWJBarnabas continues to grow through acquisitions, it needed a way to identify, classify, and control devices so as to quickly and securely integrate acquired networks into RWJBarnabas.
Solution and Benefits: In 2015, RWJBarnabas first selected and deployed CounterACT. Leveraging CounterACT, RWJBarnabas has gained visibility and control across a diverse set of devices accessing its network, including laptops, mobile devices, medical devices, virtual machines, and more. CounterACT helps to ensure these devices meet endpoint compliance through automated remediation. And with its mergers and acquisitions activity, CounterACT provides an efficient and secure way for RWJBarnabas to classify, grant, limit, or block network access to the devices on the new entity's network while at the same time providing a comprehensive inventory of acquired IP-based device assets. Lastly, RWJBarnabas has gained additional value from its existing security tools by deploying Extended Modules to share information with its security information and event management and mobile service management solutions as well as other network monitoring tools across both wired and wireless networks.

United States Army Medical Command
Problem: The United States Army Medical Command (MEDCOM) provides a variety of medical, training, and research services to military beneficiaries worldwide through 39 medical facilities and over 20 research labs and administrative agencies. This includes more than 70,000 personnel and 300,000 network connected devices within MEDCOM facilities, organizations and field operating agencies that require access to the MEDCOM network for the delivery of healthcare services. MEDCOM’s challenge revolved around endpoint security and the need to identify and authenticate devices as they connect, in real-time, to the network while quarantining non-compliant devices.
Solution and Benefits: In 2012, MEDCOM first selected and deployed CounterACT. In its initial deployment phase, CounterACT was used to provide visibility into devices accessing MEDCOM’s network. Following its success with device visibility, MEDCOM then moved forward with real-time, on-demand application and software inventorying to identify applications on each device and ensure they met defined criteria. This included leveraging CounterACT to enforce policy driven access control, enabling MEDCOM to grant, limit, or block access for wired, WiFi, mobile, and IoT devices accessing the network. In its latest phase, MEDCOM rolled out two of the ForeScout Extended Modules, McAfee’s ePolicy Orchestrator and Microsoft’s Systems Center Configuration Manager.
United States Marine Corps
Problem: The U.S. Marine Corps (USMC) faced the challenge of getting comprehensive visibility over the millions of devices connected to its network across hundreds of locations across the globe. The USMC also viewed their existing security solutions as lacking the ability to provide real-time network device visibility, critical to eliminating potential network and device vulnerabilities and acting as a fundamental means of protecting both non-classified and classified enclaves across the organization. 
Solution and Benefits: U.S. Marine Corps Installations East (MCIEAST) under the direction and authority of HQMC C4 began a project in 2011, known as Comply to Connect. This project determined that ForeScout CounterACT was the foundation product of choice for discovery and classification. The USMC realized rapid benefits of ForeScout’s agentless solution and was able to identify a range of devices connected to its network that were previously hidden from the USMC’s IT department and then continuously profile the devices in order to gain greater insights into the devices connected onto its networks. Comply to Connect, or C2C, was incorporated into the 2017 National Defense Authorization Act, or NDAA, and was signed into law in February 2017. After recognizing the benefits of the ForeScout solution, the USMC expanded ForeScout’s deployment across the organization in a phased approach, with over 180,000 devices accessing the USMC networks under ForeScout management.
Sales and Marketing
Sales
We deploy a direct-touch channel-fulfilled strategy. Our sales cycle is typically six to 12 months, depending on the industry and size and scope of deployment. We have a direct field sales team and a dedicated team focused on managing relationships with our channel partners and working with our channel partners to support our end-customers. We expect to continue to grow our sales headcount in areas of highest demand for our solution. Generally, our sales representatives have become more productive the longer they are with us, with limited productivity in their first few quarters as they learn to sell our products and participate in field training. We focus our sales management efforts on helping our sales representatives increase productivity as they become more seasoned. As of December 31, 2017, 65% of our sales representatives have been with us for less than two years. 
Our sales team is supported by sales engineers with deep technical expertise who are responsible for pre-sales technical support, solutions engineering for our end-customers, proof of concept work and technical training for our channel partners.

Today we have an Alliance Partnerships with CrowdStrike, CyberArk, FireEye, Fortinet, Juniper Networks, Palo Alto Networks, ServiceNow and Splunk.
Research and Development
We invest substantial resources in research and development to consistently enhance features and capabilities of our solution. Our research and development team is located in Tel Aviv, Israel, San Jose, California, and Dallas, Texas. Research and development expense totaled approximately $17.8 million, $31.5 million, and $47.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2016, and 2017, respectively. We plan to continue to significantly invest in resources to conduct our research and development effort.
Competition
We operate in the intensely competitive network security market that is characterized by constant change and innovation. The threat landscape is growing faster than the security market, drawing new providers and new functionality from existing providers to address dynamic threat vectors. We compete with security providers in the following categories: 

• | the large networking vendors, Cisco and HP Enterprise Company; and


• | independent security vendors that offer products that perform some of the functions of our solution.

The principal competitive factors in our market include:

• | effectiveness;


• | features and functionality;


• | global support capabilities;


• | scalability and overall performance;


• | time to value;


• | integration capabilities with heterogeneous network infrastructure and security tools;


• | brand awareness and reputation;


• | strength of sales and marketing efforts;

20


• | size and scale of organization;


• | price and total cost of ownership; and


• | customer return on investment.

We believe we compete favorably with our competitors on the basis of these factors as a result of the features and performance of our solution, the ease of integration of our products with network infrastructure, and the breadth of our capabilities. However, many of our competitors have substantially greater financial, technical and other resources, greater name recognition, larger sales and marketing budgets, deeper customer relationships, broader distribution, and larger and more mature intellectual property portfolios.
Manufacturing
The manufacturing of our products is outsourced to a single third-party contract manufacturer, Arrow Electronics, Inc., or Arrow. This approach allows us to reduce our costs by decreasing our manufacturing overhead and inventory and also allows us to adjust more quickly to changing end-customer demand. Arrow assembles our product using design specifications, quality assurance programs and standards that we establish, and it procures components and assembles our products based on our demand forecasts. These forecasts represent our estimates of future demand for our products based on historical trends and analysis from our sales and product management functions as adjusted for overall market conditions.
We have entered into a written agreement with Arrow pursuant to which Arrow manufactures our product. This agreement continues in effect until either party terminates, with or without cause, by giving 90 days prior written notice. 
Information about Segment and Geographic Revenue
Information about segment and geographic revenue is set forth in Note 14 in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Seasonality and Backlog 
We experience seasonality in our business, with sales generally stronger in our third and fourth fiscal quarters. For this reason, we do not believe that our product backlog at any particular time is meaningful because it is not necessarily indicative of future revenue in any given period as such orders may be rescheduled by our partners without penalty or delayed due to inventory constraints.
Intellectual Property
Our success depends in part upon our ability to protect our core technology and intellectual property. We rely on, among other things, patents, trademarks, copyrights, and trade secret laws, confidentiality safeguards and procedures, and employee non-disclosure and invention assignment agreements to protect our intellectual property rights. We have five U.S-issued patents, which expire between November 24, 2019 and November 13, 2033, eleven patent applications pending in the United States, and six pending foreign counterpart patent applications in a non-U.S. jurisdiction. We also have two issued foreign counterparts of one of these patents. We also license software from third parties for integration into our products, including open source software and other software available on commercially reasonable terms.
We control access to and use of our proprietary software, technology and other proprietary information through the use of internal and external controls, including contractual protections with employees, contractors, end-customers, and partners, and our software is protected by U.S. and international copyright, patent, and trade secret laws. In addition, we intend to expand our international operations and effective patent, copyright, trademark, and trade secret protection may not be available or may be limited in foreign countries.
See the section titled “Risk Factors—Failure to protect our proprietary technology and intellectual property rights could substantially harm our business and results of operations” for additional information.
