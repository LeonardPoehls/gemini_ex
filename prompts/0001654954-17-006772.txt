 ITEM 1. BUSINESS
  
  Business Overview
  
 Petro River Oil Corp. (the “Company”) is an independent energy company focused on the exploration and development of conventional oil and gas assets with low discovery and development costs. The Company is currently focused on moving forward with drilling wells on several of its properties owned directly and indirectly through its interest in Horizon Energy Partners, LLC (“Horizon Energy”), as well as taking advantage of the relative depressed market in oil prices to enter highly prospective plays with Horizon Energy and other industry-leading partners. Diversification over a number of projects, each with low initial capital expenditures and strong risk reward characteristics, reduces risk and provides cross-functional exposure to a number of attractive risk adjusted opportunities.
  
 The Company’s core holdings are in the Mid-Continent Region in Oklahoma and in Kern County, California. Following the acquisition of Horizon I Investments, LLC (“Horizon Investments”), the Company now has exposure to a portfolio of several domestic and international oil and gas assets consisting of highly prospective conventional plays diversified across project type, geographic location and risk profile, as well as access to a broad network of industry leaders from Horizon Investment’s 20% interest in Horizon Energy.  Horizon Energy is an oil and gas exploration and development company owned and managed by former senior oil and gas executives.  It has a portfolio of domestic and international assets, including two assets located in the United Kingdom, adjacent to the giant Wytch Farm oil field, the largest onshore oil field in Western Europe.  Other projects include the proposed redevelopment of a large oil field in Kern County, California and the development of an additional recent discovery in Kern County.  Each of the assets in the Horizon Energy portfolio is characterized by low initial capital expenditure requirements and strong risk reward characteristics.
  
 The execution of our business plan is dependent on obtaining necessary working capital.  While no assurances can be given, in the event management is able to obtain additional working capital, we plan to acquire high-quality oil and gas properties, primarily proved producing and proved undeveloped reserves. We also intend to explore low-risk development drilling and work-over opportunities.  Management is also exploring farm in and joint venture opportunities for our oil and gas assets.
  
  Our Objective
  
 Our primary objective is to enhance shareholder value by increasing our net asset value, net reserves and cash flow through development, exploitation, exploration, and acquisition of oil and gas properties.
 Our Strategy
  
 We intend to follow a balanced risk strategy by allocating capital expenditures to a combination of lower risk development and high potential exploration prospects. Key elements of our business strategy include the following:
  
  Develop and exploit our existing oil and natural gas properties. Our principal growth strategy has been to explore, develop and exploit our acquired and leased properties to add proven reserves.
  
  Pursue selective acquisitions. The Company has acquired leasehold positions that it believes contain substantial resource potential and meet its targeted returns on invested capital. Management intends to continue to pursue strategic acquisitions that meet the Company’s operational and financial targets. We seek to acquire developed and undeveloped oil and gas properties that will provide us with additional development and exploratory prospect opportunities. We may also acquire a working interest in one or more prospects from others and participate with the other working interest owners in drilling and, if warranted, completing oil or gas wells on a prospect. We may purchase producing oil or gas properties.

  Use the latest 3-D seismic technology to maximize returns. Technical advances in imaging and modeling can lower risk and enhance productivity. The Company intends to utilize 3-D seismic and other technological advancements that benefit its exploratory and developmental drilling program.
  
  Limit our current exploration and acquisition activities to conventional oil plays with a projected breakeven price of $30 per barrel or less.  We intend to focus our resources on more easily recoverable conventional reserves.
  
  During the current downturn, obtain price concessions from third party vendors, specifically those involved in our drilling and completion activities and day-to-day well maintenance.
  
  Plan of Operation
  
 The Company is currently engaged in oil and natural gas acquisition, exploration, development and production, with activities in Oklahoma and California in the United States, and Northern Ireland, Denmark and the U.K in Western Europe. We focus on developing our existing properties, while continuing to pursue acquisitions of oil and gas properties with upside potential.
  
 The Company intends to grow its resources and production through exploration activities and development of identified potential drilling locations, and through acquisitions that meet the Company’s strategic and financial objectives. Our plan includes:
  
  Leveraging our management experience. The Company’s executive team, along with Horizon Energy, the Company’s operating partner, has extensive and proven experience in the oil and gas industry. We believe that the experience of our executive team will help reduce the time and cost associated with drilling and completing exploration and development of our conventional assets and potentially increasing recovery. Collectively, our management team and engineering professionals identify and evaluate acquisition opportunities, negotiate and close purchases and manage acquired properties.
  
  Leveraging our established business relationships. Our executive team, along with Horizon Energy, has many relationships with operators and service providers in our core asset regions. We believe that leveraging our relationships will be a competitive advantage in developing our acreage and identifying acquisition targets.
  
  De-risking our acreage position and build a vertical drilling program. The Company has identified a multi-year inventory of potential drilling locations that will drive reserves and production growth and provide attractive return opportunities. The Company views its Osage, Kern County and Grapevine projects as de-risked because of the significant production history in the area and well-established industry activity surrounding the acreage.
  
  Partnership with Horizon Energy. Following the acquisition of Horizon Investments, the Company has an indirect interest, through Horizon Investment’s 20% ownership in Horizon Energy, in a portfolio of several domestic and international oil and gas assets consisting of highly prospective conventional plays diversified across project type, geographic location and risk profile, as well as access to a broad network of industry leaders.
  
 Horizon Energy is an oil and gas exploration and development company owned and managed by former senior oil and gas executives.  It has a portfolio of domestic and international assets, including two assets located in the United Kingdom, adjacent to the giant Wytch Farm oil field, the largest onshore oil field in Western Europe.  Other projects include the proposed redevelopment of a large oil field in Kern County, California and the development of an additional recent discovery in Kern County.  Each of the assets in the Horizon Energy portfolio is characterized by low initial capital expenditure requirements and strong risk reward characteristics.
  
  Competitive Strengths
  
  Financial flexibility. Our capital structure and high degree of operational control continues to provide us with significant financial flexibility. We have no corporate debt in our capital structure, enabling us to make capital decisions with no restrictions imposed by debt covenants, lender oversight and/or mandatory repayment schedules. Additionally, in concert with our partner, Horizon Energy, we control the majority of our anticipated future net drilling locations, including the timing and selection of drilling locations as well as completion schedules. This allows us to modify our capital spending program depending on financial resources, leasehold requirements and market conditions.

  Management experience. Our key management team possesses an average of over thirty years of experience in oil and gas exploration and production in multiple resource plays, including exploration and production in the Company’s core regions of Osage, Oklahoma, Kern County, California, and the North Sea.
  
  Cost-efficient operators. In the past, our management team has shown an ability to drill wells in a cost-efficient way and to successfully integrate acquired assets without incurring significant increases in overhead.
  
  History
  
 The Company was originally incorporated under the Company Act (British Columbia) on February 8, 2000 under the name Brockton Capital Corp. We then changed our name to MegaWest Energy Corp. effective February 27, 2010, before changing it to Gravis Oil Corp. on June 20, 2011. On September 11, 2012, we re-organized under the laws of the State of Delaware as a corporation organized under the Delaware General Corporation Law. Prior to September 11, 2012, and at April 30, 2012, we were organized under the laws of Alberta, Canada.
  
 Petro River Oil LLC (“Petro”), an indirect subsidiary of the Company and wholly owned subsidiary of MegaWest Energy Kansas Corp., was incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware on March 3, 2011 (“MegaWest”). Through proceeds received from the issuance of various promissory notes, on February 1, 2012, Petro purchased various interests in oil and gas leases, wells, records, data and related personal property located along the play in the state of Kansas (“Mississippi Assets”).  Effective December 23, 2015, Petro divested the Mississippi Assets. In connection with the divestiture, the assignee and purchaser of the Mississippi Assets agreed to pay outstanding liabilities, including unpaid taxes, and assume certain responsibilities to plug any abandoned wells. No cash consideration was paid for the interests.
  
  Share Exchange. On April 23, 2013, the Company executed and consummated a securities purchase agreement by and among the Company, Petro, and certain investors in Petro (the “Investors”), namely, the holders of outstanding secured promissory notes of Petro (the “Notes”), and those holding membership interests in Petro (the “Membership Interests”, and, together with the Notes, the “Acquired Securities”) sold by Petro (the “Share Exchange”). In the Share Exchange, the Investors exchanged their Acquired Securities for 591,021,011 newly issued shares of the Company's common stock (2,955,105 shares of common stock based on the December 2015 reverse stock split – see “Reverse Stock Split” below). Upon completion of the Share Exchange, Petro became a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company.
  
 As a result of the Share Exchange, the Company acquired 100% of the membership units of Petro and consequently, control of Petro’s business and operations. Under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“U.S. GAAP”), because Petro’s former members and note holders held 80% of the issued and outstanding shares of the Company as a result of the Share Exchange, Petro was deemed the accounting acquirer while the Company remains the legal acquirer. Petro adopted the fiscal year of the Company. Prior to the Share Exchange, all historical financial statements presented are those of Petro. The equity of the Company is the historical equity of Petro, restated to reflect the number of shares issued by the Company in the transaction.
  
  Acquisition of Interest in Bandolier Energy LLC.   On May 30, 2014, the Company entered into a Subscription Agreement pursuant to which the Company was issued a 50% interest in Bandolier Energy, LLC (“Bandolier”) in exchange for a capital contribution of $5.0 million (the “Bandolier Acquisition”). In connection with the Bandolier Acquisition, the Company had the right to appoint a majority of the board of managers of Bandolier. The Company’s Executive Chairman was a manager of, and owned a 20% membership interest in, Pearsonia West Investment Group, LLC (“Pearsonia West”), a special purpose vehicle formed for the purpose of investing in Bandolier with the Company and Ranger Station, LLC (“Ranger Station”). Concurrent with the Bandolier Acquisition, Pearsonia West was issued a 44% interest in Bandolier for cash consideration of $4.4 million, and Ranger Station was issued a 6% interest in Bandolier for cash consideration of $600,000. In connection with Pearsonia West’s investment in Bandolier, the Company and Pearsonia West entered into an agreement, dated May 30, 2014, granting the members of Pearsonia West an option, exercisable at any time prior to May 30, 2017, to exchange their pro rata share of the Bandolier membership interests for shares of the Company’s common stock, at a price of $0.08 per share, subject to adjustment (the “Option”). The Option, if fully exercised, would result in the Company issuing 55,000,000 shares of its common stock (275,000 shares of common stock at a price of $16 per share based on the December 2015 reverse stock split – see “Reverse Stock Split” below), or 6% to the members of Pearsonia West.

 Until the execution of the Contribution Agreement, described below, the Company had operational control along with a 50% ownership interest in Bandolier. As a result, the Company consolidated Bandolier. The remaining 50% non–controlling interest represented the equity investment from Pearsonia West and Ranger Station. The Company allocated the proportionate share of the net operating income/loss to both the Company and the non-controlling interest.
  
 Subsequent to the initial capitalization of Bandolier, Bandolier acquired, for $8,712,893 less a $407,161 claw back, all of the issued and outstanding equity of Spyglass Energy Group, LLC (“Spyglass”), the owner of oil and gas leases, leaseholds, lands, and options and concessions thereto located in Osage County, Oklahoma. Spyglass controlled a significant contiguous oil and gas acreage position in Northeastern Oklahoma, consisting of approximately 106,000 acres, with substantial original oil in place, stacked reservoirs, as well as exploratory and development opportunities that could be accessed through both horizontal and vertical drilling. Significant infrastructure was already in place including 32 square miles of 3-D seismic, 3 phase power, a dedicated sub-station as well as multiple oil producing horizontal wells.
  
 The Company recorded the purchase of Spyglass by Bandolier using the acquisition method of accounting as specified in ASC 805 “Business Combinations.” This method of accounting requires the acquirer to (i) record purchase consideration issued to sellers in a business combination at fair value on the date control is obtained, (ii) determine the fair value of any non-controlling interest, and (iii) allocate the purchase consideration to alltangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their acquisition date fair values. Further, the Company commenced reporting the results of Spyglass on a consolidated basis with those of the Company effective upon the date of the acquisition.
  
  MegaWest Transaction.  On October 15, 2015, the Company entered into a contribution agreement (the “Contribution Agreement”) with MegaWest and Fortis Property Group, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (“Fortis”), pursuant to which the Company and Fortis each agreed to contribute certain assets to MegaWest in exchange for shares of MegaWest common stock (“MegaWest Shares”) (the “MegaWest Transaction”).
  
 Upon execution of the Contribution Agreement, (i) the Company transferred its 50% membership interest in Bandolier (the “Bandolier Interest”), and cancelled all of its ownership interest in the then issued and outstanding MegaWest Shares, which prior to the MegaWest Transaction represented 100% ownership of MegaWest; and (ii) Fortis transferred certain indirect interests held in 30 condominium units and the rights to any profits and proceeds therefrom.  Immediately thereafter, MegaWest issued to the Company 58,510 MegaWest Shares, representing a 58.51% equity interest in MegaWest, as consideration for the assignment of the Bandolier Interest, and issued to Fortis 41,490 MegaWest Shares, representing a 41.49% equity interest in MegaWest, as consideration for the assets assigned to MegaWest by Fortis.  The account receivable and the Company’s interest in real estate reflected on the Company’s balance sheet are assets held by MegaWest, and are controlled by MegaWest’s board of directors, consisting of two members appointed by Fortis, and one by the Company. The relative composition of the board of directors of MegaWest shall continue as long as Fortis has an equity interest in MegaWest.
  
  Proceeds from the amounts receivable from Fortis will not be available until such time as the Company has completed its evaluation of the Bandolier prospects, at which time the Redetermination will be performed. Subject to the terms and conditions of the Contribution Agreement, the Contribution Agreement provided for a redetermination of the fair market value of the Bandolier Interest at any time following the six month anniversary after the execution thereof (the “Redetermination”),  Upon a Redetermination, which has not occurred as of July 28, 2017, but is anticipated prior to December 31, 2017, in the event there is a shortfall from the valuation ascribed to the Bandolier Interest at the time of the Redetermination, as compared to the value ascribed to the Bandolier Interest in the Contribution Agreement, the Company will be required to provide Fortis with a cash payment in an amount equal to the shortfall.  If the Company is unable to deliver to Fortis the cash payment required after the Redetermination, if any, the board of directors of MegaWest shall have the right to exercise certain remedies against the Company, including a right to foreclose on the Company’s entire equity in MegaWest, which equity interest has been pledged to Fortis under the terms of the Contribution Agreement.  In the event of foreclosure, the Bandolier Interest would revert back to the Company, and the Company would record a loss for the amount of the notes receivable, interest in real estate rights, accounts receivable – related party, and any accrued interest.
  
  Acquisition of Horizon Investments. On December 1, 2015, the Company entered into a conditional purchase agreement with Horizon Investments (as amended, the "Purchase Agreement"), pursuant to which the Company acquired, on May 3, 2016, (i) a 20% membership interest in Horizon Energy; (ii) certain promissory notes issued by Horizon Investments to the Company in the aggregate principal amount of $1.6 million (the "Horizon Notes"); (iii) approximately $690,000 held in escrow pending closing under the Purchase Agreement (the "Closing Proceeds"); and (iv) certain bank, investment and other accounts maintained by Horizon Investments, in an amount which, together with the principal amount of the Horizon Note and the Closing Proceeds, totaled not less than $5.0 million (collectively, the "Purchased Assets"). The consideration for the Purchased Assets was 11,564,249 shares of the Company's common stock, $0.00001 par value (“Common Stock”), which shares were issued to Horizon Investments at closing.

  Recent Developments
  
  $2.0 Million Secured Note Financing. On June 13, 2017, the Company entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement (“Purchase Agreement”) with Petro Exploration Funding, LLC (“Funding Corp.”), pursuant to which the Company issued to Funding Corp. a senior secured promissory note to finance the Company’s working capital requirements (the “Note Financing”), in the principal amount of $2.0 million (“Secured Note”). As additional consideration for the Note Financing, the Company issued to Funding Corp. (i) a warrant to purchase 840,336 shares of the Company’s Common Stock (“Warrant”), and (ii) an overriding royalty interest equal to 2% in all production from the Company’s interest in the Company’s concessions located in Osage County, Oklahoma, currently held by Spyglass, pursuant to an Assignment of Overriding Royalty Interests (the “Assignment”).
  
  The Secured Note accrues interest at a rate of 10% per annum, and matures on June 30, 2020. To secure the repayment of all amounts due under the terms of the Secured Note, the Company entered into a Security Agreement, pursuant to which the Company granted to Funding Corp. a security interest in all assets of the Company. The first interest payment will be due on June 1, 2018 and each six-month anniversary thereafter until the outstanding principal balance of the Secured Note is paid in full.
  
 The Warrant is exercisable immediately upon issuance, for an exercise price per share equal to $2.38 per share, and shall terminate, if not previously exercised, five years from the date of issuance.
  
 Scot Cohen, a member of the Company’s Board of Directors and a substantial stockholder of the Company, owns or controls 31.25% of Funding Corp.
  
  Kern County Drilling Program Results. On July 18, 2017, the Company announced a new oil field discovery in its Sunset Boulevard prospect in Kern County, California upon successfully drilling the Cattani-Rennie 47X-15 exploration well (“CR 47X”). The CR 47X was drilled to a depth of approximately 8,500 feet and confirmed at least two commercially successful pay zones.  The discovery is currently being evaluated but initial results indicate significant reserve potential.  Following completion and production tests, the Company will announce development plans.  Several additional prospect wells are now being planned to be drilled in Kern County.
  
 The Company owns a 19.25% interest in the Kern County field based on a 13.75% direct working interest and 5.5% indirect working interest through its 20% equity investment in Horizon Energy. Historically, since its 1933 discovery, this field has produced over 100 million barrels of oil and equivalents from six distinct reservoirs. The Company’s 3-D survey constitutes the first modern seismic data (including both 2-D and 3-D) acquired over this geologically complex field.
  
  Osage County Drilling Program Results. On May 8, 2017, the Company announced a new oil field discovery in it’s 106,500-acre concession in Osage County, Oklahoma upon successfully drilling the Chat 2-11 exploration well. The Chat 2-11 was drilled to a depth of 2,800 feet into the Mississippian Chat. Initial results indicated up to 20 feet of oil productive formation. Following flow and fracking tests, the Company plans to confirm IP rates.
  
 On May 30, 2017, the Company announced a second new oil field discovery in its’ 106,500-acre concession in Osage County, Oklahoma upon successfully drilling the Red Fork 1-3 exploration well. The Red Fork 1-3 was drilled to a depth of 2,800 feet into the Mississippian Chat. Initial results indicated up to 30 feet of oil productive formation. Following flow and fracking tests, the Company plans to confirm IP rates. These structures were identified utilizing 3D seismic technology, indicating a potential of up to 2.5 million barrels of oil.
  
 The Company’s Osage County drilling program is the result of a Joint Exploration and Development Agreement (the “Exploration Agreement”), dated August 19, 2016, between Spyglass, a wholly owned subsidiary of Bandolier, Phoenix 2016, LLC (“Phoenix”) and Mackey Consulting & Leasing, LLC (“Mackey”). Pursuant to the Exploration Agreement, Phoenix and Mackey operates and provides certain services, including obtaining permits and providing technical services, at cost, in connection with a Phase I Development Program as agreed to by the parties (the “Phase I Program”).  Phoenix and Mackey shall earn a 25% working interest on all wells drilled in the Phase I Program.  Following success and completion of the Phase I Program, Phoenix and Mackey shall earn a 25% working interest in the Osage County, Oklahoma Concession held by Spyglass. Under the Exploration Agreement, Bandolier has agreed commit up to $2.1 million towards costs of the Phase I Program, at its sole discretion.

  Reverse Stock Split. At its Annual Meeting held on September 20, 2016, the Company’s shareholders approved a resolution to authorize the Company’s Board of Directors, in its sole and absolute discretion, to amend the Company’s Certificate of Incorporation to implement a reverse stock split of our Common Stock, at a ratio of not less than 1-for-2, and not greater than 1-for-10 (“Reverse Split”), within one year from the date of the Annual Meeting, with the exact ratio to be determined by the Board of Directors. The Board of Directors has not determined the ratio, and does not currently intend to execute the Reverse Split until such time as the Company lists its shares of Common Stock on the NASDAQ Stock Market.
  
  Competition
  
  We operate in a highly competitive environment. We compete with major and independent oil and natural gas companies, many of whom have financial and other resources substantially in excess of those available to us. These competitors may be better positioned to take advantage of industry opportunities and to withstand changes affecting the industry, such as fluctuations in oil and natural gas prices and production, the availability of alternative energy sources and the application of government regulation.
 Compliance with Government Regulation
  
 The availability of a ready market for future oil and gas production from possible U.S. assets depends upon numerous factors beyond our control. These factors may include, amongst others, regulation of oil and natural gas production, regulations governing environmental quality and pollution control, and the effects of regulation on the amount of oil and natural gas available for sale, the availability of adequate pipeline and other transportation and processing facilities and the marketing of competitive fuels. These regulations generally are intended to prevent waste of oil and natural gas and control contamination of the environment.
  
 We expect that our sales of crude oil and other hydrocarbon liquids from our future U.S.-based production will not be regulated and will be made at market prices. However, the price we would receive from the sale of these products may be affected by the cost of transporting the products to market via pipeline.
  
  Environmental Regulations
  
  Our U.S. assets are subject to numerous laws and regulations governing the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to environmental protection. These laws and regulations may require the acquisition of a permit before drilling commences, restrict the types, quantities and concentration of various substances that can be released into the environment in connection with drilling and production activities, limit or prohibit drilling activities on certain lands within wilderness, wetlands and other protected areas, require remedial measures to mitigate pollution from former operations, such as pit closure and plugging abandoned wells, and impose substantial liabilities for pollution resulting from production and drilling operations. Public interest in the protection of the environment has increased dramatically in recent years. The worldwide trend of more expansive and stricter environmental legislation and regulations applied to the oil and natural gas industry could continue, resulting in increased costs of doing business and consequently affecting profitability. To the extent laws are enacted or other governmental action is taken that restricts drilling or imposes more stringent and costly waste handling, disposal and cleanup requirements, our business and prospects could be adversely affected.
 Operating Hazards and Insurance
  
 The oil and natural gas business involves a variety of operating hazards and risks such as well blowouts, craterings, pipe failures, casing collapse, explosions, uncontrollable flows of oil, natural gas or well fluids, fires, formations with abnormal pressures, pipeline ruptures or spills, pollution, releases of toxic gas and other environmental hazards and risks. These hazards and risks could result in substantial losses to us from, among other things, injury or loss of life, severe damage to or destruction of property, natural resources and equipment, pollution or other environmental damage, clean-up responsibilities, regulatory investigation and penalties and suspension of operations. 
  
 In accordance with customary industry practices, we expect to maintain insurance against some, but not all, of such risks and losses. There can be no assurance that any insurance we obtain would be adequate to cover any losses or liabilities. We cannot predict the continued availability of insurance or the availability of insurance at premium levels that justify its purchase. The occurrence of a significant event not fully insured or indemnified against could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and operations. 
  
 
   
-7-


 
 
 
 Pollution and environmental risks generally are not fully insurable. The occurrence of an event not fully covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our future financial condition. If we were unable to obtain adequate insurance, we could be forced to participate in all of our activities on a non-operated basis, which would limit our ability to control the risks associated with oil and natural gas operations.
  
  Research and Development
  
  Previously, we did not have any research and development policies in place. We formed Petro Spring, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary, on December 12, 2013, to begin to focus on technology solutions related to the oil and gas industry.  During the year ended April 30, 2015, we purchased the Havelide and Coalthane Assets.  We are currently trying to determine a monetization strategy for these assets.
 Employees
  
 At April 30, 2017, we employed four full-time employees and no part-time employees. We also retained several consultants to provide both operational, investor relations and marketing support.
  
  Geographical Area of the Company’s Business
  
 The principal market that we compete in is the North American and Western Europe. The Company is currently contemplating expansion into additional international energy markets.
