 ITEM 1.  BUSINESS
 Overview 
 We are a global commercial-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of therapies for rare diseases with significant unmet needs. 
 Our first commercial product is Keveyis (dichlorphenamide), the first and only treatment approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”) for hyperkalemic, hypokalemic, and related variants of primary periodic paralysis (“PPP”), a group of rare hereditary disorders that cause episodes of muscle weakness or paralysis. 
 Our second commercial product, Macrilen (macimorelin) is an oral growth hormone secretagogue receptor agonist, and is the first and only oral drug approved by the FDA for the diagnosis of patients with adult growth hormone deficiency (“AGHD”). We expect to launch Macrilen in the United States in mid-2018.
 In addition to our two commercial products, we have two clinical-stage product candidates for rare endocrine diseases, Recorlev and veldoreotide. Recorlev (levoketoconazole) is a cortisol synthesis inhibitor currently being studied for the treatment of endogenous Cushing's syndrome. Veldoreotide is a next-generation somatostatin analog being investigated for the treatment of acromegaly and potential additional applications in other conditions amenable to somatostatin receptor activation. Both Recorlev and veldoreotide have received orphan designation from the FDA and the European Medicines Agency (“EMA”).
 Given the well-identified and concentrated prescriber base addressing our target markets, we intend to continue to use a small, focused sales force to market Keveyis, Macrilen and any future products, in the United States, the European Union and other key global markets. We believe that our ability to execute on our strategy is enhanced by the significant commercial and clinical development experience of key members of our management team.  
 Since the introduction of our new management team in August 2014, we have been building a rare disease, franchise-based business model focused on expansion through a disciplined in-licensing and acquisition strategy. In pursuit of our growth strategy, we have raised over $275 million in equity and debt financings since December 2014. We will continue to identify and evaluate the acquisition of products and product candidates for licensing or acquisition that would be complementary to our existing rare neuromuscular and endocrine franchises or that would form the basis for new rare disease franchises. We believe this approach will enable us to maximize our commercial potential by further leveraging our existing resources and expertise.
 Our Products and Product Candidates
    
· | Keveyis (dichlorphenamide), an oral carbonic anhydrase inhibitor and the only therapy approved in the United States to treat hyperkalemic, hypokalemic and related variants of PPP. PPP is a rare genetic, neuromuscular disorder that can cause extreme muscle weakness and/or paralysis; some forms are also commonly associated with myotonia or muscle stiffness. It often interferes with daily activities and, as patients get older, it can lead to permanent muscle weakness. The two most common forms of this disorder are “hyperkalemic” and “hypokalemic” periodic paralysis. Keveyis was approved by the FDA in August 2015, and has orphan drug exclusivity status in the United States through August 7, 2022. From May 2016 to December 2016, Taro Pharmaceuticals Industries Ltd. and its affiliates (“Taro”), supplied Keveyis on a non-commercial basis to patients through a single specialty pharmacy in the United States. We acquired the U.S. marketing rights to Keveyis in December 2016 and we launched Keveyis in the United States in April 2017.

Macrilen, an oral growth hormone secretagogue (GHS) receptor agonist, to be used in the diagnosis of patients with AGHD, which affects approximately 60,000 adults in the United States and Canada. We acquired the U.S. and Canadian marketing rights to Macrilen from Aeterna Zentaris GmbH in January 2018 and we intend to launch Macrilen in the United States in mid-2018.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Recorlev (levoketoconazole), a cortisol synthesis inhibitor, is in Phase 3 clinical development for the treatment of endogenous Cushing’s syndrome. Endogenous Cushing’s syndrome is a rare endocrine disorder characterized by sustained elevated cortisol levels that most commonly result from a benign tumor of the pituitary gland. We believe that Recorlev, which is the isolated, “left-handed” mirror image, or enantiomer, of ketoconazole, has the potential to become the new standard of care for the drug therapy of endogenous Cushing’s syndrome. In July 2017, we completed enrollment of 94 patients in SONICS, a pivotal, multinational Phase 3 clinical trial for Recorlev. We anticipate that top-line data for the primary efficacy analysis will be available in mid-2018. In addition, we have initiated LOGICS, a second pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial of Recorlev for the treatment of endogenous Cushing's syndrome. The LOGICS study will supplement the long-term efficacy and safety data from the ongoing SONICS trial via a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled design that will randomize approximately 35 patients, of which up to approximately one-half will have completed the SONICS study. Enrollment in the LOGICS study is anticipated to begin in the first quarter of 2018, and top-line data are expected in the first quarter of 2019.

  Upon completion of the clinical development program, we intend to file for marketing authorizations in the United States and elsewhere.  Following consultations with the FDA, we have determined that the 505(b)(2) approval pathway, which permits a New Drug Application (“NDA”) applicant to rely on data from studies that were not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference, is the appropriate pathway for a Recorlev NDA.  Because NDA approval can rely in part on data already accepted by the FDA or otherwise publicly available, an abbreviated and reduced development program may be possible. We intend to rely on published literature and the FDA’s prior findings concerning the safety and/or effectiveness of ketoconazole in our NDA for Recorlev.  A similar marketing authorization pathway is available in most of the rest of the world, and we anticipate that the studies supporting U.S. approval will likewise support approvals to market Recorlev elsewhere, including in the European Union.      
· | Veldoreotide modified-release, a novel multi-receptor targeted somatostatin analog (SSA) that was previously in Phase 2 development as an immediate release formulation. Based on the differentiated activation pattern of somatostatin receptor subtypes (“SSTRs”) and the preclinical and clinical profile of immediate-release veldoreotide, we believe that modified-release veldoreotide may offer an improved efficacy and safety profile relative to existing drug therapies for acromegaly and other conditions that are modifiable through activation of somatostatin receptors, such as Cushing’s disease and neuroendocrine tumors. Veldoreotide has been granted orphan drug designation by the FDA and the EMA for treatment of acromegaly. The lead formulation for veldoreotide modified-release is based upon PLGA microspheres. PLGA is a well-known polymer, which has been widely applied in modified-release formulations due to its biocompatibility, biodegradability, and favorable release kinetics. We expect to initiate a series of pre-clinical studies that seek to determine additional differentiating features of veldoreotide in both endocrine and non-endocrine conditions.

  Product Sales 
 Product sales for Keveyis in 2017 accounted for 100% of our total revenues as it was our only commercial product sold in 2017. We operate in one operating reporting segment. We sell Keveyis to one specialty pharmacy provider, who is the exclusive distributor of Keveyis in the United States. The specialty pharmacy subsequently resells Keveyis to patients, which are covered by payors that may provide for government-mandated or privately negotiated rebates with respect to the purchase of Keveyis (see Note 3 of our consolidated financial statements).

 Our Strategy
 Our goal is to transform the lives of patients by building a leading franchise‑based, commercially oriented biopharmaceutical company addressing rare diseases with significant unmet medical needs. We are focused on developing, in‑licensing, acquiring and eventually commercializing products and product candidates that target rare diseases across therapeutic areas.
 To achieve our goal, we are pursuing the following strategies:

· | Focus on rare diseases. We are selling or developing treatments for rare diseases, initially PPP, AGHD and endogenous Cushing’s syndrome. Rare diseases typically have a high unmet need for innovative treatment options. Drug development for the treatment of rare diseases often requires smaller clinical trials than for common diseases. Product candidates focused on rare diseases also often qualify for orphan drug designation, which in the United States provides for seven years of market exclusivity and in the European Union provides for 10 years of market exclusivity after regulatory approval to market has been granted. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Independently commercialize Keveyis, Macrilen and other products in the United States and the European Union. We have commercialized Keveyis in the United States and intend to market Macrilen in the United States and Canada. Our other rare disease product candidates, if approved, may be marketed in the United States, the European Union, and, selectively, in other key global markets. Given the relatively small prescriber bases for Keveyis, Macrilen and our two product candidates, we believe we can use a relatively small, focused sales force to effectively promote our products. We have established sales, marketing, market access and patient service capabilities in the United States to market Keveyis. We believe that some of the activities involved in our commercialization of Keveyis and Macrilen will provide synergies to our commercialization of Recorlev if successful. We believe that our ability to execute on this strategy is enhanced by the significant prior commercial experience of key members of our management team. Prior to joining our company, members of our management team were involved in the launch or commercialization of over 20 pharmaceutical products.

· | Expand our portfolio through a disciplined in‑licensing and acquisition strategy. We plan to source new product candidates by in‑licensing or acquiring them. Our management team seeks to mitigate the potential risks of this strategy by adhering to our disciplined criteria of focusing on in‑licensing or acquisition of products that are already commercially available or that have human clinical data that we believe suggest a relatively high probability of success for development and an attractive potential return on investment. As a result of our management team’s experience in sourcing, selecting, in‑licensing and acquiring products and product candidates, we were successful in acquiring the U.S. rights to Keveyis and the U.S. and Canadian rights to Macrilen, as well as augmenting our rare endocrine franchise by adding veldoreotide to our product pipeline.

· | Utilize a franchise model built on rare disease therapeutic areas. We intend to build our company by in‑licensing and acquiring products and product candidates that target rare diseases in therapeutically aligned franchises with significant commercial opportunity. We believe that complementary products and product candidates will allow us to significantly leverage our expertise as well as our development and commercial infrastructure. For example, Keveyis serves as the basis of our rare neuromuscular franchise, and Macrilen and Recorlev, if approved, will serve as the basis for our rare endocrine franchise. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Expand indications of products and product candidates within our franchises. In addition to identifying products and product candidates that can form the basis of new rare disease franchises, we also intend to leverage opportunities to develop potential products and product candidates for additional indications within their respective therapeutic franchises. We believe that this approach will enable us to maximize our commercial potential by further leveraging our existing resources and expertise.

 Our Product Candidate Pipeline
 The following table illustrates our product candidates by stage: 

 Our Rare Neuromuscular Franchise
 In December 2016, we initiated our rare neuromuscular franchise by acquiring the U.S. marketing rights to Keveyis (dichlorphenamide) from Taro Pharmaceuticals North America, Inc., a subsidiary of Taro Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. Keveyis is the first and only therapy approved in the United States to treat hyperkalemic, hypokalemic and related variants of PPP, a group of rare hereditary disorders that cause episodes of muscle weakness or paralysis
 Overview of PPP and Keveyis
     PPP is a rare, genetic, neuromuscular disorder related to a defect in muscle ion channels with multiple variants and subtypes. The disease is characterized by episodes of muscle weakness and paralysis. It often interferes with daily activities and, as patients get older, it can lead to permanent muscle weakness. PPP may be localized (“focal”) or more widespread (“generalized”), and it often goes underdiagnosed and/or undertreated.  Types of periodic paralysis are differentiated by criteria including underlying genetic mutations and changes in blood potassium during an episode. The two most common forms of PPP are hypokalemic, when episodes can be induced by low blood levels of potassium, and hyperkalemic, when episodes are associated with elevated levels of blood potassium.  We believe, based on our market research, that there are approximately 4,000 to 5,000 patients in the United States diagnosed with PPP.
 Keveyis is an oral carbonic anhydrase inhibitor that was approved by the FDA in the United States in August 2015 to treat hyperkalemic, hypokalemic and related variants of PPP.  The exact mechanism(s) through which oral carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, and Keveyis in particular, decrease the frequency and severity of periodic paralysis attacks is unknown.  However, it is believed that their effects are mediated both locally (i.e. in muscle) and systemically.  It is not known whether their effects are disease-modifying. Keveyis has received orphan drug exclusivity status in the United States through August 7, 2022.  
 Following FDA approval in August 2015, Keveyis was marketed by Taro.  In May 2016, Taro announced the cessation of their commercial sales and related promotional activities for Keveyis.  Taro supplied Keveyis to patients on a non-commercial basis through a single specialty pharmacy in the United States from May 2016 until our acquisition of the U.S. marketing rights to Keveyis in December 2016. We continued to supply Keveyis to patients on a non-commercial basis until launching Keveyis in April 2017. After acquiring the U.S. marketing rights for Keveyis, we established sales, marketing, market access and patient service capabilities.
 We launched Keveyis using 12 experienced sales representatives, and in the fourth quarter of 2017 expanded 

 
  7

 
our sales force to 24 individuals consisting of three regional business directors and 21 sales representatives. Because a large percentage of the people who suffer from PPP remain undiagnosed or inadequately treated, we developed programs to educate the medical community and patients about this illness. In addition, we established a field-based force of medical science liaisons.  We use a single, specialty pharmacy to provide reimbursement, clinical and distribution support for Keveyis and to develop cost-sharing and patient assistance programs to support qualified, commercially insured patients, federal- and state-insured patients, and uninsured or under-insured patients. We also donate money to independent charitable foundations dedicated to this cause. Our ultimate goal is to ensure that no PPP patient is denied access to Keveyis for financial reasons. 
 Clinical Development of Keveyis
     The efficacy of KEVEYIS was evaluated in two clinical studies, Study 1 and Study 2. 
 Study 1 
 Study 1 was a 9-week, double blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, multi-center study. Study 1 consisted of two substudies: a substudy in patients with hypokalemic periodic paralysis (n=44), and a substudy in patients with hyperkalemic periodic paralysis (n=21). The primary efficacy endpoint in both substudies was the average number of self-reported attacks of muscle weakness per week over the final 8 weeks of the trial. Withdrawal from the study for acute severe worsening was also assessed as an endpoint. 
 In Study 1, the tested dose of Keveyis was 50 mg b.i.d. for treatment-naïve patients. Patients already receiving dichlorphenamide prior to the study continued on the same dose if randomized to Keveyis during the study. In patients taking acetazolamide prior to the study, the daily dose of Keveyis was set at 20% of the daily acetazolamide dose. Dose reduction for tolerability was permitted. 
 In the hypokalemic periodic paralysis substudy, median age of patients was 45 years and 73% of patients were male. Patients treated with Keveyis (n=24) had 2.2 fewer attacks per week than patients (n=20) treated with placebo (p=0.02). None of the patients randomized to Keveyis reached the endpoint of acute worsening, vs. five patients randomized to placebo. The mean dose of Keveyis at Week 9 was 94 mg/day. 
 In the hyperkalemic periodic paralysis substudy, median age of patients was 43 years and 43% of patients were male. During the double-blind treatment period, patients treated with Keveyis (n=12) had 3.9 fewer attacks per week than patients treated with placebo (n=9) (p=0.08). None of the patients randomized to Keveyis reached the endpoint of acute worsening, vs. two patients randomized to placebo. The mean dose of Keveyis at Week 9 was 82 mg/day. 
 Study 2
 Study 2 was a 35-week, double blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, multi-center, two-period crossover study. Study 2 also consisted of two substudies: a substudy in patients with hypokalemic periodic paralysis (n=42), and a substudy in patients with hyperkalemic periodic paralysis (n=31), including patients with Paramyotonia Congenita (together termed potassium-sensitive periodic paralysis or PSPP). The primary endpoint in the hypokalemic periodic paralysis substudy was the incidence of acute intolerable worsening (based on attack frequency or severity) necessitating withdrawal. The primary endpoint in the hyperkalemic periodic paralysis substudy was the average number of self-reported attacks of muscle weakness per week. Dosing was determined similarly to Study 1. 
 In the hypokalemic periodic paralysis substudy, mean age of patients was 38 years and 79% of patients were male. Acute intolerable worsening was observed in 2 patients on Keveyis vs. 11 patients on placebo (p=0.02). The mean dose of Keveyis at the end of the study was 96 mg/day. 
 In the hyperkalemic periodic paralysis substudy, mean age of patients was 37 years and 58% of patients were male. Patients treated had 2.3 fewer attacks per week on Keveyis than on placebo (p=0.006). The mean dose of Keveyis at the end of the study was 73 mg/day.

 Our Rare Endocrine Franchise 
 Our rare endocrine franchise consists of Macrilen, Recorlev and veldoreotide. Macrilen is the first and only oral drug approved by the FDA for the diagnosis of patients with AGHD. Recorlev is being developed for the treatment of endogenous Cushing’s syndrome, and veldoreotide is being developed for the treatment of acromegaly and potential additional applications in other conditions amenable to somatostatin receptor activation.  Overview of Adult Growth Hormone Deficiency (AGHD) and Macrilen
 AGHD is a condition that is associated with premature mortality, as well as cardiovascular, neuromuscular, metabolic, nervous system, and skeletal abnormalities. The clinical features are nonspecific; growth hormone stimulation testing is required to diagnose AGHD. Growth hormone is produced by the pituitary gland and secreted in pulses, so random measurements of growth hormone levels in the blood are not useful for establishing a diagnosis of AGHD. Growth hormone stimulation testing provokes the pituitary gland to release levels of growth hormone above resting levels to determine the growth hormone release potential in a patient suspected of having AGHD.
 On December 20, 2017, the FDA granted marketing approval for Macrilen, an orally available, peptidomimetic growth hormone secretagogue receptor agonist (or ghrelin receptor, GHSR-1a, agonist), to be used in the diagnosis of patients with AGHD, which affects approximately 60,000 adults in the U.S. and Canada. We acquired the U.S. and Canadian marketing rights to Macrilen from Aeterna Zentaris GmbH in January 2018 and we intend to launch Macrilen in mid-2018. Macrilen is the first and only oral drug approved by the FDA for the diagnosis of patients with AGHD.
 Clinical Development of Macrilen
     The diagnostic efficacy of the Macrilen test was established in a randomized, open-label, single-dose, cross-over study.  The objective of the study was to compare the level of agreement between Macrilen test results and insulin tolerance test (“ITT”) results in adult patients with different pre-test probabilities of AGHD, including with healthy control subjects.  The four groups of individuals evaluated were: 
· | Group A: Adults with a high likelihood of growth hormone deficiency (GHD) 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | Structural hypothalamic or pituitary lesions and low insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), and/or
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | Three or more pituitary hormone deficiencies and low IGF-1, or
--+---------------------------------------------------------------


o | Childhood onset GHD with structural lesions and low IGF-1.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------


· | Group B: Adults with an intermediate likelihood of GHD 
--+--------------------------------------------------------


o | Eligible subjects not qualifying for either high or low likelihood.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Group C: Adults with a low likelihood of GHD 
--+----------------------------------------------


o | One risk factor for GHD only, such as history of distant traumatic brain injury or one pituitary hormone deficiency only with otherwise normal pituitary function, or
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | Isolated idiopathic childhood onset GHD without additional pituitary deficits.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Group D: Healthy adult controls 
--+---------------------------------


o | Healthy subjects matching Group A subjects by sex, age ± 5 years, body mass index (BMI ± 2 kg/m2), and estrogen status (females only).
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  For both the ITT and the Macrilen test, serum concentrations of growth hormone were measured at 30, 45, 60, and 90 minutes after drug administration.  The test was considered positive (i.e., AGHD diagnosed) if the maximum serum growth hormone level observed anytime after stimulation was less than the pre-specified cut point value of 2.8 ng/mL for the Macrilen test or 5.1 ng/mL for the ITT.
 The level of negative and positive agreement between the results of the ITT and the Macrilen test was used to evaluate the performance of the Macrilen test.  In the study, the ITT test results were used as the benchmark (i.e., a negative ITT indicated absence of the disease and a positive ITT indicated presence of the disease).  Negative agreement was the proportion of subjects with a negative ITT (i.e., those who did not have GHD per the ITT) who also had a negative Macrilen

test.  The results showed a high level of negative agreement, demonstrating that the Macrilen test will not wrongly diagnose an individual without GHD (per the ITT) as having GHD.  Positive agreement was the proportion of subjects with a positive ITT (i.e., those who had GHD per the ITT) who also had a positive Macrilen test.  The results showed a high level of positive agreement, demonstrating that the Macrilen test will not wrongly diagnose an individual with GHD (per the ITT) as not having GHD.  The agreement measures between the two tests are defined mathematically below (see Table 2).  
 Table 2: Definition of Agreement between ITT and Macrilen

Total | a+c | b+d | a+b+c+d | | Overall Agreement (%)=100% x (a+d)/(a+b+c+d)

      One hundred and fifty-seven subjects underwent at least one of the two tests in this study, 59% were male, 41% female, and 86% of white origin.  The median age was 41 years (range: 18 – 66 years) and body mass index 27.5 kg/m2 (range: 16 – 40 kg/m2).  The study relied on a cross-over design and each participant was to undergo the two diagnostic tests and serve as his or her own control.  Data on both tests were available for 140 subjects; 38 (27%) in Group A, 37 (26%) in Group B, 40 (29%) in Group C, and 25 (18%) in Group D.  One out of 154 Macrilen tests (0.6%) performed failed due to a technical error and 27 out of 157 ITTs (17.2%) performed failed because induction of severe hypoglycemia (i.e., the stimulus) could not be achieved. 
 Two-by-two tables presenting the pre-specified primary analysis results for the ITT and Macrilen test are shown below for all subjects (Groups A, B, C, and D combined) and for each group separately (see Table 3).  The estimates for negative and positive agreement between Macrilen and the ITT in the overall study population were 94% and 74% with lower 95% confidence interval bounds 85% and 63%, respectively.  Negative and positive agreement between Macrilen and the ITT in subjects with intermediate or low risk (Groups B and C) were 93% and 61% with lower 95% confidence interval bounds 80% and 43%, respectively. These results are based on peak growth hormone values (maximum growth hormone concentrations across all measurement timepoints).

      Repeatability was tested in a subset of 34 subjects who underwent two Macrilen tests.  Agreement between the result of the first test and the second test was observed in 31 cases (91.2%). 
 Overview of Endogenous Cushing’s Syndrome and Recorlev
 Overview of Endogenous Cushing’s Syndrome
 There are two variants of Cushing’s syndrome: exogenous, which is caused by factors outside the body (e.g., corticosteroid or cortisol-like medications) and endogenous, which is caused by factors within the body. The signs and symptoms may be the same in both forms. The more common form is exogenous Cushing’s syndrome, which is often found in people taking cortisol‑like medications for long periods of time or for shorter periods of time using very potent forms. Cortisol‑like medications are often used to treat inflammatory disorders such as asthma and rheumatoid arthritis. Unlike endogenous Cushing’s syndrome, exogenous Cushing’s syndrome may be alleviated by withdrawing the inciting medication.
 Endogenous Cushing’s syndrome is a rare endocrine disorder characterized by sustained elevated blood cortisol. Cortisol is a hormone produced in the adrenal gland and is naturally secreted as an end-product of the activity of the hypothalamic‑pituitary‑adrenal axis. Corticotropin‑releasing‑hormone (“CRH”) is secreted from the hypothalamus and stimulates the secretion and release of adrenocorticotropin (“ACTH”) from the pituitary gland, which in turn stimulates cortisol (and other hormone) secretion from the adrenal gland. Cortisol itself exerts negative feedback control on both CRH in the hypothalamus and ACTH in the pituitary gland, thereby reducing CRH and ACTH secretion, keeping cortisol levels in a normal range.
 The most common form of endogenous Cushing’s syndrome is called Cushing’s disease, which is typically caused by a benign pituitary tumor that secretes ACTH autonomously. Cushing’s disease represents approximately 70% to 80% of patients with endogenous Cushing’s syndrome. Other causes of endogenous ACTH-dependent Cushing’s syndrome include extrapituitary tumors producing ACTH, known as ectopic ACTH, or less often CRH (ectopic CRH). The source of ectopic ACTH/CRH secretion is most often small‑cell carcinoma of the lung or bronchial carcinoid tumors but neuroendocrine tumors found in many different organs can also be sources. In a smaller number of cases, approximately 20%, endogenous Cushing’s syndrome is ACTH‑independent, meaning that it does not arise through 

 
  11

 
tumor secretion of ACTH but rather results from excess secretion of cortisol itself in the adrenal gland by adrenocortical tumors, either benign or malignant, or by non‑malignant enlargement of the adrenal glands called hyperplasia.
 In patients with endogenous Cushing’s syndrome, the normal feedback mechanisms of the hypothalamic‑pituitary‑adrenal axis are disrupted as a result of a tumor autonomously secreting ACTH, CRH or cortisol. This causes chronic exposure to high circulating cortisol levels that give rise to the clinical state of Cushing’s syndrome. The most common signs and symptoms of the syndrome include: weight gain, especially in the upper body with a rounded face (“moon face”) and extra fat on the upper back and above the collarbones; high blood sugar or diabetes mellitus; high blood pressure or hypertension; thin bones or osteoporosis; muscle loss or sarcopenia; thin, fragile skin that bruises easily; purple‑red stretch marks called striae, usually over the abdomen and under the arms; depression and difficulty thinking clearly; too much facial hair, or hirsutism, usually noticed only in women; irregular or absent menstrual periods and infertility; reduced sex drive or libido; and in children, poor height growth.
 An estimated 25,000 patients in the United States and 40,000 patients in Europe are diagnosed with endogenous Cushing’s syndrome. When first diagnosed, patients are most commonly adults aged 20 to 50 and five times more often women than men. However, endogenous Cushing’s syndrome is believed to be underdiagnosed due to lack of disease recognition, which often leads to a delay in diagnosis of six years on average. Endogenous Cushing’s syndrome patients are believed to have a mortality risk two to three times that of the age-and-gender-matched general population, with cardiovascular disease, venous thrombosis and infections being the primary causes of death.
 Overview of Recorlev
 Recorlev (levoketoconazole) is a cortisol synthesis inhibitor that we are developing for the treatment of endogenous Cushing’s syndrome, a rare endocrine disorder characterized by excessive production of the stress hormone cortisol. In endogenous Cushing’s syndrome, elevated circulating cortisol gives rise to a severe disease with variable clinical signs and symptoms, including weight gain, characteristic changes in fat distribution, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, osteoporosis, muscle loss and depression. The active pharmaceutical ingredient in Recorlev, levoketoconazole exerts its therapeutic effect by blocking the synthesis of cortisol in the adrenal glands, leading to the reduction and, ideally, the normalization of blood cortisol. Recorlev has been granted orphan drug designation by the FDA and the EMA and is being developed using a dose regimen of twice daily oral administration. 
     Ketoconazole, used off‑label in the United States, is the most frequently prescribed drug therapy for endogenous Cushing’s syndrome. It is used to reduce blood cortisol and ameliorate comorbidities associated with Cushing’s syndrome. Molecules of ketoconazole form as mirror images, referred to as enantiomers. Manufactured ketoconazole consists of two enantiomers, 2R,4S‑ketoconazole and 2S,4R‑ketoconazole, that are found in equal amounts, and is therefore referred to as a racemate. Recorlev is a pure form of one (2S,4R‑ketoconazole) of the two enantiomers of ketoconazole. Single‑enantiomer drugs, like Recorlev, may offer safety and efficacy advantages over racemates because one of the enantiomers in a racemate can have safety issues or be less effective in the treatment of the disorder or disease.  The more therapeutically favorable enantiomer may be known as the eutomer.  We believe that levoketoconazole is the eutomer of ketoconazole with respect to cortisol synthesis inhibition and treatment of endogenous Cushing’s syndrome. 
 Recorlev inhibits the cortisol synthesis pathway at several points. In light of the shared mechanism of action with ketoconazole and the data from Phase 2 clinical trials, which were conducted in diabetes patients without Cushing’s syndrome, we believe Recorlev may have a similar beneficial impact on the reduction of significant comorbidities of endogenous Cushing’s syndrome, including those associated with cardiovascular disease risk, such as diabetes, weight gain, hypertension and elevation in LDL-cholesterol. In addition, based on preclinical data and human pharmacokinetics, we believe that Recorlev may offer an improved safety profile relative to existing approved drug therapies for endogenous Cushing’s syndrome. Therefore, we believe that Recorlev has the potential to become a new standard of care for the chronic drug therapy of endogenous Cushing’s syndrome.

 Current Treatment Landscape and Limitations on Current Treatment Options
 Treatment of endogenous Cushing’s syndrome varies depending on the cause of the disease. For patients with Cushing’s disease, initial treatment is almost always the attempted surgical removal of the pituitary tumor. In anticipation of surgery and when surgery is not effective or not feasible, drug or radiation therapy, or both, is used to suppress excessive cortisol production and the accompanying clinical symptoms. 

A typical approach to drug therapy is to inhibit cortisol synthesis through the oral administration of an inhibitor of enzymes that regulate adrenal cortisol synthesis. Ketoconazole acts in this way and is the most widely used drug therapy for endogenous Cushing’s syndrome in the United States.  Although approved in the European Union for this indication, ketoconazole is not approved for this indication by the U.S. FDA and is therefore prescribed “off-label”. The percentage of endogenous Cushing’s syndrome patients treated with ketoconazole monotherapy who achieve normalized levels of cortisol, assessed by measuring urinary free cortisol (“UFC”) has been reported from retrospective, uncontrolled studies, with varying definitions of normalization, to be between 33% and 100%. Data from a recent retrospective study of 200 patients in 14 French centers solely treated with ketoconazole for endogenous Cushing’s syndrome between 1995 and 2012 suggested that ketoconazole controlled cortisol in approximately 50% of patients and likewise improved clinical symptoms. Also, beneficial effects of oral ketoconazole on clinical symptoms and signs that drive the morbidity and mortality of endogenous Cushing’s syndrome have been reported including reduction in high blood pressure, improvement of diabetes, and normalization of hypokalemia, or low potassium blood levels. However, some patients treated with ketoconazole experience tolerability issues and, in some cases, liver injury (also known as hepatotoxicity). As a result of the hepatotoxicity risk the FDA has issued a boxed warning to prescribers concerning the use of ketoconazole to treat fungal infections, the only approved indication for ketoconazole in the United States. Although elevations in liver enzymes associated with ketoconazole are generally mild to moderate and reversible upon cessation of drug, in rare cases, severe hepatotoxicity may occur (estimated as one in every 10,000 to 15,000 patients). In extremely rare cases, ketoconazole-related liver injury may be irreversible and result in death or require liver transplantation. In July 2013, the Committee for Medical Products for Human Use (“CHMP”) recommended that ketoconazole be withdrawn for use as an antifungal agent in the European Union. The EMA adopted the CHMP recommendation in August 2013, and the recommendation was subsequently confirmed by the European Commission. In September 2014, HRA Pharma received a recommendation of approval from the EMA for ketoconazole for the treatment of endogenous Cushing’s syndrome, based on the well‑established use of ketoconazole in medical practice as well as documentation from retrospective studies in the literature.
 An alternative medical approach to treating Cushing’s syndrome targets pituitary tumors that produce ACTH (i.e. in Cushing’s disease). Among Cushing’s disease patients, the dopamine agonist cabergoline, which is not approved for use to treat Cushing’s disease in the United States, has been shown to achieve normalization of UFC levels, gold-standard evidence of disease control, in about 30% of patients. The SSA pasireotide, which is marketed as Signifor® for the treatment of Cushing’s disease in the United States, has shown normalization of UFC levels with stable dosing in 15% of patients at a dosage of 600 µg twice-daily and in 26% of patients at a dosage of 900 µg twice-daily over a 6-month period. Certain SSAs, including Signifor, are known to have undesirable side effects on glucose metabolism. Forty percent of patients with Cushing’s disease treated with Signifor in its Phase 3 clinical trial reported the occurrence of hyperglycemia‑related adverse events, and in the cohort receiving Signifor 900 µg twice-daily, glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) increased from 5.8% at baseline to 7.3% at Month 6.
 Another alternative, Korlym, or mifepristone, works by inhibiting the action of cortisol at the cortisol-receptor level but does not lower cortisol levels in the blood, which actually tend to increase during therapy. As a result of this mechanism of action, it is not possible to monitor response to Korlym by measuring UFC or cortisol levels (from blood or saliva), which are the standard ways clinicians monitor disease progression and response to treatment. As a result, Korlym is usually titrated and monitored through use of clinical signs and symptoms improvements, e.g. blood sugar reductions.  Korlym has been approved in the United States to control hyperglycemia secondary to hypercortisolism in patients with endogenous Cushing’s syndrome. Korlym is contraindicated in pregnant women and in women with a history of unexplained vaginal bleeding, as its side effects include termination of pregnancy, endometrial thickening and vaginal bleeding.

 We believe that the efficacy and usage limitations and safety concerns associated with currently available drug therapies for endogenous Cushing’s syndrome are an important reason why a significant unmet medical need exists among endogenous Cushing’s syndrome patients with persistent or recurrent disease post-surgery. In a survey we commissioned in 2014 of 89 U.S. physicians treating patients with Cushing’s syndrome, when asked, “Of your patients on medication to manage cortisol levels, what percentage are well controlled?”, the physicians estimated that only approximately 37% of such patients were well controlled. A recent multicenter study of 230 Cushing’s disease patients followed for up to 27.5 years and treated with any modality (i.e. surgery, radiation or drugs) found that only 49% had documented biochemical control. We believe that our potential addressable market for Recorlev includes diagnosed endogenous Cushing’s syndrome patients that at any time are eligible for drug therapy, a figure that represents patients anticipating surgery, for whom surgery or radiation is not feasible, is contraindicated or has been unsuccessful. This unmet need may also be impacted by what we believe to be the current lack of disease awareness among physicians and patients, resulting in a relatively low rate of diagnosis.
 Our Solution—Recorlev
 We believe that Recorlev has the potential to become a new standard of care for the drug therapy of endogenous Cushing’s syndrome because it may provide a favorable efficacy, safety and tolerability profile compared to current drug therapies, including ketoconazole, believed to be the most commonly used drug therapy for the treatment of endogenous Cushing’s syndrome in the United States. We believe Recorlev, based on its similar mechanism of action to that of ketoconazole, may reduce UFC and blood pressure, in contrast to Korlym, and may have an anti‑hyperglycemic effect, in contrast to Signifor. In addition, we believe Recorlev may have an improved safety profile compared with that of ketoconazole.
  Recorlev, like ketoconazole, is a cortisol synthesis inhibitor that inhibits the cortisol synthesis pathway at multiple points. The following graphic illustrates the cortisol synthesis pathway:

 Our preclinical and pharmacokinetic data suggest that Recorlev might have an efficacy profile at least as favorable as ketoconazole and might also confer less risk of liver injury:

· | In in vitro studies, Recorlev was found to have higher potency than ketoconazole and its mirror‑image enantiomer, 2R,4S‑ketoconazole, in inhibiting the key enzymes in cortisol synthesis (CYP11B1, CYP17, and CYP 21). Thus, we believe Recorlev may have the same or improved efficacy compared to ketoconazole at lower dosages, which may in turn reduce relative drug exposure and potentially contribute to improved safety and tolerability.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | The pharmacokinetics of the enantiomers also suggest a potentially larger therapeutic index of Recorlev relative to ketoconazole. The two enantiomers found within ketoconazole are present in equal amounts, but
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
  14

 

in a Phase 1 clinical study in healthy subjects, it was observed that administration of ketoconazole resulted in integrated blood concentrations (i.e., exposure) of the single enantiomer, 2S,4R‑ketoconazole (i.e., Recorlev) that exceeded those of the other enantiomer, 2R,4S‑ketoconazole, by approximately three times. This observation suggests but does not prove that 2R,4S‑ketoconazole is extracted by the liver to a greater extent than the other single enantiomer, 2S,4R‑ketoconazole (i.e., Recorlev), and may therefore contribute more than Recorlev to the observed liver toxicity of ketoconazole.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Compared with ketoconazole, it was observed in in vitro studies that Recorlev is less potent than the other enantiomer (i.e. its antipode, 2R,4S-ketoconazole) in inhibiting the activity of CYP7A. CYP7A is the first and rate‑limiting enzyme for production of bile acids in the liver. While a role of CYP7A in liver injury is not established, this finding suggests a possible differential effect of the ketoconazole enantiomers on metabolic and detoxifying enzymes in the liver contributing to reduced hepatotoxicity potential of Recorlev.

  Previously, levoketoconazole (then called DIO-902) was studied clinically for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. DiObex, our licensee from 2004 to 2008, initiated three clinical trials to investigate the use of levoketoconazole for treatment of type 2 diabetes and two clinical studies in healthy volunteers. In the Phase 2a clinical trial of type 2 diabetes patients, levoketoconazole demonstrated a significant dose response to reduce mean blood concentration levels of C‑reactive protein (“CRP”), whereas for ketoconazole, an increase in CRP was observed.  CRP tends to increase in the presence of inflammation. Thus, we believe that Recorlev may be associated with a decrease in inflammatory processes compared to ketoconazole. In the same study, levoketoconazole was also associated with dose-related reductions in cholesterol and body weight.  Recorlev, with the same mechanism of action as ketoconazole to reduce blood cortisol, may also have beneficial effects on cardiovascular risk markers in Cushing’s syndrome including weight loss, reduction in blood sugar, lowering of cholesterol and reduction in blood pressure.  Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of excess mortality in endogenous Cushing’s syndrome.
 Clinical and Preclinical Development of Recorlev

In the United States, Recorlev is considered a new molecular entity.  Upon completion of the clinical development program, we intend to file for marketing authorizations in the United States and elsewhere.  In the United States, an NDA, which is a prerequisite to marketing authorization, can be submitted under one of a number of approval paths defined in the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act.  Following consultations with the FDA, we determined that the 505(b)(2) approval pathway, which permits an NDA applicant to rely on data from studies that were not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference, is the appropriate pathway for a Recorlev NDA.  Because a 505(b)(2) NDA approval can rely in part on data already accepted by the FDA or otherwise publicly available, an abbreviated and reduced development program may be possible.  In the case of Recorlev, we intend to rely in our NDA on published literature and FDA’s prior findings concerning the safety and/or effectiveness of ketoconazole.  A similar marketing authorization path is available in most of the rest of the world, and we anticipate that the studies supporting U.S. approval will likewise support approvals to market Recorlev elsewhere, including in the European Union. The FDA has acknowledged that no additional preclinical investigations will be required for Recorlev prior to an NDA filing. The EMA’s Committee for Medical Products for Human Use (“CHMP”), has requested a study of reproductive toxicity that may be completed prior to filing for marketing authorization in Europe, pending further discussions.
 In July 2017, we completed enrollment of 94 patients in SONICS, a pivotal, multinational Phase 3 clinical trial for Recorlev investigating the safety and efficacy of Recorlev in subjects with endogenous Cushing’s syndrome. We anticipate top-line data for the primary efficacy analysis will be available in the mid-2018.    In addition, we have initiated LOGICS, a second pivotal Phase 3 study of Recorlev for the treatment of endogenous Cushing's syndrome. The LOGICS study will supplement the long-term efficacy and safety data from the ongoing SONICS study via a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled design that will randomize approximately 35 patients, of which up to approximately ½ will have completed the SONICS study.  Enrollment in the LOGICS study is anticipated to begin in the first quarter of 2018 and top-line data are expected in the first quarter of 2019.
 If SONICS can (1) demonstrate consistent and significant clinical benefit by meeting the primary endpoint of the trial, specifically the responder rate measured as normalization of UFC levels at the 6-month time point without need 

 
  15

 
for dose increase during the 6-month maintenance phase and (2) show consistent improvement of objectively quantifiable biomarkers of endogenous Cushing’s syndrome comorbidities, such as blood glucose, blood lipids, blood pressure or weight, and improvement of other clinical signs and symptoms of endogenous Cushing’s syndrome, we believe this would be regarded by regulators as adequate proof of efficacy in this rare disease with a high unmet medical need.  Therefore, we consider LOGICS as a mechanism for providing independent evidence of efficacy of Recorlev, rather than serving as sole or primary evidence of efficacy for Recorlev in endogenous Cushing’s syndrome.  Furthermore, if successful, LOGICS has the potential to provide adequate evidence of efficacy durability beyond one year of therapy in the subset of subjects who were previously enrolled in SONICS.  Finally, we believe that the combination of SONICS and LOGICS will provide an adequate demonstration of the long-term safety and tolerability of Recorlev in patients with endogenous Cushing’s syndrome.  In total over 100 unique subjects with this condition will have been treated with Recorlev during SONICS and LOGICS, and some subjects will be treated with a therapeutic dose of Recorlev for at least 1.5 years at the time of first NDA submission.  
 In addition to LOGICS, we intend to initiate a long-term open-label extension study with Recorlev to capture even longer-term safety, tolerability and efficacy data from subjects who complete either SONICS or LOGICS and who choose to continue therapy with Recorlev.  The open-label extension, named OPTICS, is planned to begin enrollment in the second half of 2018 and will continue to accrue data indefinitely, at least until the drug is first marketed.  We expect that we might be required by the FDA and the EMA to collect additional safety data post‑approval.  
 Phase 3 Clinical Trials
 SONICS Phase 3 Clinical Trial
 We enrolled 94 patients in our SONICS Phase 3 clinical trial in the United States, Canada, the European Union and the Middle East. This clinical trial is being conducted pursuant to a U.S. IND for Recorlev for the treatment of endogenous Cushing’s syndrome that took effect in May 2013. We plan to collect safety and efficacy data over a treatment period of at least one year for all enrolled patients who complete the trial. If we are able to confirm a favorable safety profile of Recorlev in clinical use, we plan to discuss differentiated safety and tolerability labeling from ketoconazole with regulatory authorities.
 Following a screening phase, SONICS has three distinct treatment phases. During the dose titration phase, patients start at 150 mg twice daily dosing (300 mg total daily dose) and titrate in 150 mg increments up to a maximum 600 mg twice daily dosing (1,200 mg total daily dose). Following the dose titration phase, once the therapeutic dose has been reached, patients enter the maintenance phase, during which the dose is fixed and cannot be changed other than for safety reasons, including loss of efficacy. At the end of the six-month maintenance phase, UFC levels are measured and the UFC responder rate, which is the primary endpoint of the clinical trial, is determined. Patients who have completed the maintenance phase may enter the extended evaluation phase, which we expect will provide additional safety and efficacy data. Throughout the entire clinical trial, various measurements for safety and efficacy are taken.

· | The primary endpoint of the clinical trial is the proportion of subjects with UFC response to Recorlev, defined as a reduction in mean 24‑hour UFC levels to levels that are equal to or less than the upper level of normal range following six months of treatment in the maintenance phase without a dose increase (during the maintenance phase).
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Key secondary endpoints include the number of patients with at least a 50% decrease in UFC levels, as well as changes in blood sugar, blood pressure, cholesterol and weight compared to baseline, and effects on clinical signs and symptoms of endogenous Cushing’s syndrome, quality of life measures obtained from the endogenous Cushing’s syndrome quality of life questionnaire and the severity of depression obtained from the Beck’s Depression Inventory II.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | The clinical trial is also designed to investigate the pharmacokinetics of Recorlev in patients with endogenous Cushing’s syndrome.

 Below is a diagram of the SONICS clinical trial design:
    
     Several elements of the SONICS clinical trial design were informed by the clinical development pathway of currently approved drug therapies in the United States and the European Union. Additionally, we incorporated advice from the CHMP and FDA into the design of the clinical trial. The FDA recommended use of a concurrent control group in SONICS. However, SONICS utilizes an open‑label, single‑arm design because use of a placebo control in a parallel-arm monotherapy design was considered unethical or infeasible to enroll, depending on the specific country or clinical trial site under consideration.  Studies lacking a concurrent control group are more likely to be subject to unanticipated variability in study results that can potentially lead to flawed conclusions because they do not allow for discrimination of patient outcomes. As a result, even if we achieve the clinical trial’s endpoints, the FDA or other regulatory authorities could view our study results as potentially biased.  We have attempted to control for bias introduction in SONICS via the use of strict evidence of active disease at baseline based on objective measures, an objectively measured primary endpoint with repeated longitudinal assessments and implementation of a strict data restriction plan that severely limits exposure to efficacy data at the Sponsor.
 LOGICS Phase 3 Clinical Trial    Rather than alter the design of SONICS to facilitate regulatory authority requests for a concurrent control group with which to compare the efficacy and safety of Recorlev, we initiated LOGICS, a second Phase 3 pivotal study.  LOGICS will include a concurrent comparison of Recorlev to matching placebo using a randomized, double-blind withdrawal design that we believe will be both feasible to enroll and ethical to conduct everywhere that SONICS is being conducted.  LOGICS will randomize approximately 35 subjects, of which up to approximately one-half will have previously completed the SONICS study. 
 Following a screening phase, LOGICS has three distinct treatment phases for patients who did not participate in SONICS and two distinct phases for most of those who did participate in SONICS. The first phase, which is only intended for patients new to levoketoconazole or for those who require re-establishment of a therapeutic dose, is dose titration and maintenance.  During the dose titration and maintenance phase, patients start at 150 mg twice daily dosing (300 mg total daily dose) and titrate in 150 mg increments up to a maximum 600 mg twice daily dosing (1,200 mg total daily dose) and remain at their individualized therapeutic dose.  The total duration of this phase is approximately 14 weeks.  SONICS-completers who are currently receiving a stable therapeutic dose skip dose titration and maintenance and proceed directly to the second phase, where they are joined by those who progressed through the first phase. The second phase is randomized-withdrawal, during which patients are randomly assigned to either continue active treatment with levoketoconazole or be switched to a matching placebo using the same tablet number.  The primary efficacy endpoint comes at the end of the randomized-withdrawal period, which lasts no more than 9.5 weeks for each patient 

 
  17

 
(and may end sooner if a “rescue” is needed).  The primary endpoint is the proportion of patients with a loss of established UFC response in the placebo group compared with the proportion in the levoketoconazole group.  The final phase of LOGICS is the restoration phase, during which all patients once again receive active therapy; however, in order to conceal the therapy in the randomized-withdrawal phase, it was necessary to blind the therapy during recovery using twice the number of tablets (one active and one placebo).  Throughout the entire clinical trial, various measurements for safety and efficacy are taken. 
 Below is a diagram of the LOGICS clinical trial design:

     Clinical Trials in Type 2 Diabetes
 Historically, levoketoconazole (then called DIO-902) was studied as a treatment for type 2 diabetes. An IND was filed in 2005 for investigation of the use of levoketoconazole in diabetes. DiObex, our licensee at the time, initiated three clinical trials to investigate the use of levoketoconazole for type 2 diabetes and two studies in healthy volunteers. A total of 159 subjects received at least one dose of levoketoconazole in these clinical trials, including 41 healthy subjects during Phase 1 clinical trials, and 118 patients with type 2 diabetes during Phase 2 clinical trials. Doses of levoketoconazole were administered over the range of 200 mg to 600 mg once a day, or QD, and 400 mg twice a day, or BID, for a single patient for up to 14 days, and 150 mg to 450 mg QD for up to four months.
 The pharmacokinetics of levoketoconazole were studied in patients with type 2 diabetes and in normal volunteers in whom the effects of levoketoconazole on the pharmacokinetics of felodipine, a drug used to treat high blood pressure, and atorvastatin (Lipitor), a drug used to lower cholesterol, were evaluated. These drugs were chosen specifically as probes for interaction, because they were intended to be frequently used concomitantly during treatment of type 2 diabetes. In the completed Phase 2a clinical trial, dose dependent reductions from baseline in cholesterol levels contained in lipoproteins, in the form of low‑density lipoprotein-cholesterol (“LDL-chol”), and cholesterol incorporated into high‑density lipoprotein (“HDL-chol”), as well as total cholesterol were observed, but no differences in measures of glycemic control relative to placebo were detected. A Phase 2b randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, study in diabetes (DIO-502) was initiated to test doses of levoketoconazole up to 450 mg daily plus metformin as compared with atorvastatin 10 mg plus metformin in combination or placebo. Additionally, an open-label extension study (DIO-503) was started in parallel.  However, in 2008, in light of negative safety reports for other diabetes treatments such as Avandia, DiObex made the decision to voluntarily terminate the development of levoketoconazole for the treatment of diabetes due to the perceived high regulatory and commercial hurdles for its approval and use in type 2 diabetes and considering the emerging efficacy and safety profile of levoketoconazole in type 2 diabetes (as described below). 

 
  18

 
Thereafter, the IND was closed and DiObex terminated the two ongoing Phase 2 clinical trials. DiObex conducted the following five clinical trials with Recorlev in type 2 diabetes pursuant to an IND filed by them in November 2005:

Clinical Trial Number | Clinical Trial Description | SubjectsEnrolled | Year andStatus | Location | Dose 
DIO‑501 | Phase 1/2a, Trial of Levoketoconazole or Placebo in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus | 37 | 2006/2007Completed. Study report issued. | United States | 200‑600 mg QD; 400 mg BID
DIO‑502 | Phase 2b Trial of Levoketoconazole or Placebo in Addition to Metformin and Atorvastatin or Atorvastatin Placebo for Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus | 133 | 2007/2008Terminated early. Study report issued. | United States, Australia, New Zealand | 150‑450 mg QD 
DIO‑503 | Phase 2 Open‑Label Trial and Pharmacodynamic for 24‑Week Study with Levoketoconazole in Combination with Metformin and Atorvastatin in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus | 13 | 2007/2008Terminated early. Study report issued. | United States, Australia, New Zealand | 150‑450 mg QD 
AA34509 | Phase 1 Pharmacokinetic Drug Interaction Trial of Levoketoconazole with Felodipine in Healthy Adult Volunteers Under Fasting Conditions | 18 | 2006/2007Completed. Study report issued. | United States | 400 mg QD 
AA34510 | Phase 1 Pharmacokinetic Drug Interaction Trial of Levoketoconazole and Ketoconazole with Atorvastatin in Healthy Adult Volunteers Under Fasting Conditions | 24 | 2006/2007Completed. Study report issued. | United States | 400 mg QD 

      Phase 2 Clinical Trials
 DIO‑501 Clinical Trial
 The DIO-501 clinical trial was a double‑blind, placebo‑controlled, parallel‑group clinical trial conducted in patients aged 18 to 70 with a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes. A total of 35 patients were treated: 21 with levoketoconazole (10 at 200 mg QD, six at 400 mg QD, four at 600 mg QD and one at 400 mg BID); eight with ketoconazole (400 mg QD); and six with placebo. Trial drugs were administered for 14 days.
 In this clinical trial, the mean 12‑hour plasma cortisol area under the concentration‑time curve (“AUC”), levels were modestly reduced in the levoketoconazole treatment groups at day 15 compared to baseline, which is consistent with the known mechanism of action of levoketoconazole. However, counter‑regulation in diabetic patients with a normal hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis may have limited the observed cortisol suppression. A small, nonsignificant effect on glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), and fasting glucose levels was observed. Consistent with the known inhibitory effect of ketoconazole on cholesterol synthesis, total cholesterol, LDL-chol, and to a lesser extent HDL-chol levels, but not triglycerides, were significantly decreased in a dose‑dependent manner by levoketoconazole. The mean change from baseline in total cholesterol, LDL-chol and HDL-chol at a dose of 400 mg QD was similar to those observed in 400 mg QD ketoconazole and higher in the 600 mg QD levoketoconazole group. Also, for the levoketoconazole treatment groups, there was a statistically significant dose response in the reduction in mean levels of CRP on day 15 compared with baseline, with a p-value of 0.027. In contrast, mean levels of CRP increased in the ketoconazole‑treated group and less so in the placebo group. CRP is an indicator of systemic inflammation, including vascular inflammation. The reduction in cholesterol and CRP observed in patients with type 2 diabetes may indicate a potential beneficial effect of levoketoconazole on cardiovascular risk factors. Notably, patients with endogenous Cushing’s syndrome tend to have elevated circulating CRP.
 Plasma AUC and maximum concentration in blood (“Cmax”), increased in a non‑proportional manner over the dose range of 200 mg to 400 mg on days one and 14. Clearance values were similar for the 200 mg and 400 mg doses of levoketoconazole, but significantly decreased at the 600 mg levoketoconazole dose, on days one and 14.

 Levoketoconazole was generally well‑tolerated. Headache and nausea were the most frequently reported adverse events, some of which were considered drug‑related. There were no serious adverse events, and no clinically meaningful changes in hematology, blood chemistry and urinalysis were noted in any treatment group. No treatment‑related changes in liver function tests (“LFTs”), were detected.
 DIO‑502 and DIO‑503 Clinical Trials
 The DIO-502 clinical trial was a four‑month, double‑blind, randomized, placebo‑controlled, dose‑ranging study of levoketoconazole with concomitant with metformin and atorvastatin (or atorvastatin placebo) that enrolled 133 of a planned 200 patients with type 2 diabetes, consisting of males and females between the ages of 18 and 70. Enrolled subjects were already receiving metformin treatment with a minimum daily dose of 500 mg and had a glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) level of 7% to 10%. Additionally, all patients were treated with 10 mg atorvastatin or its placebo to evaluate the effect of levoketoconazole on lipid profiles given cholesterol‑lowering drugs. Thus, patients were randomized into eight separate arms in the clinical trial: placebo or levoketoconazole at 150 mg; 300 mg; and 450 mg with either atorvastatin 10 mg or atorvastatin placebo; all received metformin concomitantly.
 The DIO-503 clinical trial was an open‑label, extension to DIO‑502 to evaluate safety, tolerability and pharmacodynamics after 24 weeks of dosing with levoketoconazole in combination with metformin, with and without atorvastatin in subjects with type 2 diabetes.
 DiObex terminated these clinical trials prior to their planned completion milestones. At the time of trial termination, a total of 133 patients were enrolled in the DIO‑502 and DIO‑503 trials, and 129 patients in total had been treated with a study drug, of which 97 patients received at least one dose of levoketoconazole. The investigators subsequently elected to defer efficacy and pharmacokinetics inferences based on incomplete datasets. The frequency of adverse events reported was generally similar across treatment arms. Diarrhea was the most frequently reported adverse event overall with administration of levoketoconazole. No serious adverse events were reported in the terminated studies.
 A safety signal of elevated liver enzymes sufficiently abnormal to be classified as potentially clinically significant was identified in 10 (7.7%) of the 129 treated patients in the DIO‑502 and DIO‑503 trials combined. With respect to levoketoconazole treatment, in one of the ten, the LFT abnormality was first noted during placebo treatment, whereas in the other nine, the abnormality was first noted during active treatment. No case of Hy’s law (i.e., an increase of liver transaminases at or above three times the upper level of normal values; increase in total bilirubin at or above two times the upper level of the normal value; no or little sign of cholestasis; and absence of other reasons for liver injury, such as viral hepatitis) was observed. An observation of Hy’s Law would have indicated a high risk of potentially serious drug-related hepatotoxicity.  Three of the treated patients were withdrawn from the clinical trials as required in the safety monitoring plan. In these three patients, LFT levels returned to normal after study drug was discontinued. In addition, three other patients had modest elevations in LFT levels. While these levels did not require termination by the trial protocol, the investigators elected to terminate these patients from the clinical trial. LFTs in these patients also returned to normal after the study drug was discontinued. Four additional patients required close monitoring per the protocol, and had resolution of their LFT abnormalities while on the study drug. The first case of elevated liver enzymes occurred in a patient who admitted to excessive alcohol consumption. The remaining cases developed over the following three months. An independent external safety review committee recommended continuation of the studies with no modifications.
 Due to the design of these clinical trials, the independent data safety monitoring board for the trials stated that it was impossible to interpret which of the two drugs, levoketoconazole or atorvastatin, was primarily associated with the side effect profile observed (i.e. LFT abnormalities) in these trials. A more detailed analysis of the liver transaminase elevations in this clinical trial by an expert panel showed that there was no correlation between the dose of levoketoconazole and abnormal liver transaminases.
 Phase 1 Clinical Trials
 AA34509 Clinical Trial
 The AA34509 clinical trial was designed primarily to evaluate the effect of levoketoconazole on the pharmacokinetics of concurrently administered felodipine. Healthy volunteers were administered 400 mg of 

 
  20

 
levoketoconazole or placebo QD for eight days. On the fifth day of the trial, subjects received a single 5 mg dose of felodipine. Beginning on day five, pharmacokinetics of levoketoconazole were monitored for 24 hours, and pharmacokinetics of felodipine were monitored for 72 hours. The trial was a cross‑over trial involving 18 subjects, 16 of whom completed the trial. AA34510 Clinical Trial
 This clinical trial was designed primarily to evaluate the effect of concomitant administration of levoketoconazole or ketoconazole on the pharmacokinetics of atorvastatin. Healthy volunteers were administered 400 mg of levoketoconazole, 400 mg of ketoconazole or placebo daily for seven days. On day five, all subjects received a single 80 mg dose of atorvastatin. After administration of the racemate, ketoconazole, pharmacokinetics of the two single enantiomers 2R,4S‑ketoconazole and 2S,4R‑ketoconazole, were evaluated for 24 hours on day five using a chiral bioanalytical method, to distinguish the enantiomers in plasma (blood). Pharmacokinetics of atorvastatin were evaluated for 60 hours starting at the time of administration on day five. The trial was a cross‑over trial involving 24 subjects, all of whom completed the clinical trial.
 Key Findings from the Clinical Trials of Recorlev (levoketoconazole)
 Phase 2 Efficacy and Safety Trials in Diabetic Patients:

· | AUC and Cmax values were approximately 50% higher with levoketoconazole in comparison with ketoconazole at the same dose of 400 mg. All pharmacokinetic parameters were highly variable, in the sense that they differed within and among subjects.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Following administration of ketoconazole, plasma levels (AUC or Cmax) of levoketoconazole (2S,4R-ketoconazole) were approximately three times those of the other enantiomer, 2R,4S‑ketoconazole. Possible explanations could be reduced absorption of 2R,4S-ketoconazole or decreased uptake and metabolism of levoketoconazole in the liver compared to the other enantiomer.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Levoketoconazole produced a decrease in some lipid measures, or blood fat, including reduced total cholesterol, LDL-chol and HDL-chol.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | A significant dose‑related effect of levoketoconazole for reduction of CRP was observed.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Trends for reductions in serum cortisol, measured as AUC (0-12 hours), were found after 14 days of treatment with levoketoconazole in diabetic patients.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | In the DIO‑501 clinical trial, headache and nausea were the most frequently reported adverse events. No treatment related changes in LFTs were detected. In the DIO‑502/503 clinical trials, diarrhea was the most frequently reported adverse event.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | LFTs were elevated in the DIO‑502/503 clinical trials in 10 out of the 129 patients treated with either the combination of levoketoconazole and atorvastatin or levoketoconazole alone, in each case co‑administered with metformin. The independent data safety monitoring board for the trial stated that it was impossible to interpret which of drugs was primarily associated with the side effect profile observed in the trial.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Phase 1 Drug Interaction Clinical Trials in Normal Volunteers:

· | The AUC and the Cmax of felodipine were 10‑fold higher when taken with levoketoconazole compared with felodipine alone.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | The AUC of atorvastatin was increased by 50% when administered with levoketoconazole compared with atorvastatin alone.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | A small, but statistically significant decrease of serum cortisol (AUC zero to six hours) was found for levoketoconazole compared with placebo and ketoconazole.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
 
  21

 


· | Headache, nausea, dizziness and back pain were reported as the most frequent adverse events across the two studies.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | In the drug interaction study with atorvastatin, two subjects had elevated LFT values. The subjects had received levoketoconazole plus atorvastatin or ketoconazole plus atorvastatin in the immediately previous study periods in this cross‑over study.

  Veldoreotide Modified-Release —a Novel Somatostatin Analogue
 Overview
 In June 2015, we acquired veldoreotide, a novel multi‑receptor targeted SSA that was previously in Phase 2 development as an immediate-release formulation and has the potential to provide a new and differentiated treatment option for patients with acromegaly and potential additional applications in other conditions amenable to somatostatin receptor activation. We acquired veldoreotide as part of our strategy to build our rare endocrine franchise. At the time of acquisition, veldoreotide was in Phase 2 clinical development as a treatment for acromegaly in its original, immediate-release formulation.  Acromegaly is a rare endocrine disorder that most commonly results from a benign tumor of the pituitary gland, leading to excess production of growth hormone and IGF‑1. The treatment goal is the normalization of growth hormone and IGF‑1, which is the main cause of the detrimental clinical signs and symptoms of acromegaly.
 SSAs are peptides that are administered as deep subcutaneous or intramuscular injections, typically as long-acting formulations for monthly injections.  They are the most commonly used drug therapy for the treatment of acromegaly and work by binding to specific subtypes of SSTRs that are expressed by the tumor. Binding of SSAs to these SSTRs leads to the beneficial inhibition of growth hormone secretion but can also result in the unwanted inhibition of secretion of other endocrine hormones such as insulin and glucagon in the pancreas and elsewhere. Like other SSAs, veldoreotide is a peptide that we are developing for subcutaneous injection. In contrast to approved SSAs, veldoreotide activates a different subset of SSTRs. Like pasireotide, it activates SSTR2 and SSTR5. However, in contrast to pasireotide, it possesses a similar affinity for SSTR2 than SSTR5. Veldoreotide is also the only SSA with a high affinity for SSTR4. Veldoreotide does not bind to SSTR3 or the opiate receptor at pharmacological concentrations. Although the functional consequences of the binding of SSAs to the opiate receptor are not fully understood, it has been suggested as a mechanism contributing to inhibition of insulin secretion by SSAs and may also influence their effect on gastrointestinal motility. In vitro data suggest that a higher number of adenomas are a target for growth hormone inhibition by veldoreotide as compared to octreotide, which is referred to as a single receptor targeted SSA that binds and activates predominantly via SSTR2, potentially resulting in an increased responder rate. Preclinical data from animal studies, and clinical data in healthy subjects and patients with acromegaly, showed that insulin secretion was less inhibited, potentially resulting in reduced side effects on blood glucose and an improved safety and tolerability profile. Preclinical data further suggest a reduced effect on gallbladder motility, or flow from the gallbladder.
 Based on the differentiated activation pattern of immediate-release veldoreotide upon binding to SSTR subtypes and preclinical and clinical data, we believe that modified-release veldoreotide may offer an improved efficacy and safety profile relative to existing drug therapies for acromegaly and other conditions that are modifiable through activation of somatostatin receptors. In the five clinical studies of immediate-release veldoreotide completed to date outside the United States in healthy subjects and patients with acromegaly, a beneficial reduction of growth hormone was observed, and, when compared with immediate-release subcutaneous octreotide, there was less blunting of insulin in response to a mixed meal or oral glucose load. Veldoreotide has been granted orphan drug designation for the treatment of acromegaly by the FDA and the EMA.
 We have completed the screening of potential modified-release technologies for veldoreotide and have selected a formulation based upon PLGA microspheres. PLGA is a well-known polymer, which has been widely applied in modified-release formulations due to its biocompatibility, biodegradability, and favorable release kinetics. We are in the process of securing intellectual property protection for the lead formulation, which could, if granted by the relevant patent authorities, extend the period of marketing exclusivity for the finished drug product. We expect to initiate a series of pre-clinical studies that seek to determine additional differentiating features of veldoreotide in both endocrine and non-endocrine conditions. Therefore, depending on the results of these studies, we may elect to pursue a development 

 
  22

 
pathway for veldoreotide modified-release that includes a therapeutic use outside of endocrinology.  Regardless of indication(s) to be pursued, further development will require preclinical safety (toxicology) studies as well as manufacturing scale-up before the newly formulated product can enter clinical testing.  We anticipate that preclinical studies, once begun, will take at least 18 months to complete.
 Completed Clinical Trials
 Five clinical trials of veldoreotide have been performed to date: three in healthy male volunteers and two in patients with acromegaly, all of which employed an immediate release, short‑acting formulation injected subcutaneously. At the time, the clinical trials described below were conducted, veldoreotide was named DG3173. These trials were conducted by Aspireo Pharmaceuticals Ltd., other than DG3173‑I‑001, which was conducted by Develogen AG.
 In four clinical trials with single subcutaneous injections or infusion and in one six‑day clinical trial, all of which were conducted with an immediate release formulation of veldoreotide in healthy subjects or patients with acromegaly, veldoreotide was observed to have a tolerability profile comparable to that of octreotide. However, unlike octreotide, subjects treated with veldoreotide were observed to have less or no reduction in peak insulin secretion after a meal. We believe these preliminary clinical findings corroborate the profile of veldoreotide observed in preclinical studies, which suggested inhibition of growth hormone secretion without detrimental effects on post‑meal insulin or glucose metabolism. These studies were too short to assess the effect on flow from the gallbladder. These preliminary findings contrast favorably with the well‑described insulin and glucose perturbations caused by octreotide, lanreotide and pasireotide, and we intend to conduct additional clinical trials to evaluate the clinical profile of veldoreotide and its differentiation from existing SSAs. With the potentially superior efficacy, safety and tolerability profile suggested by preclinical studies and early clinical trials, we believe veldoreotide has the potential to become the standard‑of‑care SSA, with distinct therapeutic advantages relative to currently approved SSAs as treatment of acromegaly.

 The following table summarizes these trials.

Clinical TrialNumber | Clinical Trial Descriptions | SubjectsEnrolled | Year and Status | Location | Dose 
DG3173‑II‑02 | Phase 2 The Effect of Subcutaneous Infusion of Three Doses of Veldoreotide on Growth Hormone Levels in Untreated Acromegaly Patients | 8 | 2013/2014 Completed. Bioanalytical report issued. | Ukraine | 920‑5520 µg continuous infusion over 23 hours
DG3173‑II‑01 | Phase 2 Trial of the Effect of Veldoreotide and 300 µg Octreotide on Human Growth Hormone Levels in Untreated Acromegaly Patients | 20 | 2012 Completed. Study report issued. | Ukraine | 300‑1800 µg QD 
DG3173‑I‑003 | Phase 1 Placebo‑Controlled, Phase 1 Trial to Assess the Pharmacodynamics Effect on Glucose Metabolism of Single Doses Compared to Veldoreotide Octreotide and Placebo in Healthy Male Subjects | 8 | 2013 Completed. Study report issued. | Switzerland | 300‑1800 µg QD 
DG3173‑I‑002 | Phase 1 Trial to Compare the Safety and Pharmacologic Activity of Repeated Doses of Veldoreotide and Veldoreotide Plus Octreotide with Octreotide and Placebo and Establish Their Pharmacokinetic Interaction in Healthy Male Subjects | 42 | 2012/2013 Completed. Study report issued. | Switzerland | 100‑1800 µg TID 
DG3173‑I‑001 | Phase 1 Double‑Blind Trial to Investigate Safety, Tolerability and Pharmacokinetics of Single Escalating Dosing of Veldoreotide in Healthy Male Subjects | 72 | 2008 Completed. Study report issued. | Germany | 10‑2000 µg QD 

      The clinical trials involved 122 healthy subjects in the Phase 1 trials and 28 patients with acromegaly in the Phase 2 clinical trials. No serious adverse events were observed, and mostly mild adverse events typical for SSAs such as injection site reactions and gastrointestinal side effects were reported. There was no evidence that veldoreotide adversely affects the liver, kidneys or other organ systems, including the cardiovascular system. Data from the multiple ascending dose clinical trial in healthy subjects (Study I‑002) showed inhibition of growth hormone comparable to octreotide, but no or less inhibition of insulin secretion and less effect on glucose levels. The single ascending dose trial in patients with acromegaly (Study II‑01) and the continuous infusion study in patients with acromegaly (Study II‑02) confirmed that veldoreotide also suppresses excessively produced growth hormone to a similar maximal extent as octreotide.
 Commercialization Strategy 
 Our existing commercial infrastructure is limited and is focused on Keveyis.  After acquiring the U.S. marketing rights for Keveyis in December 2016, we established sales, marketing, market access and patient service 

 
  24

 
capabilities. We believe, based on our market research, that there are approximately 4,000 to 5,000 patients in the United States diagnosed with PPP and we believe that we can address the market by targeting physicians who are managing patients with PPP, including neuromuscular specialists, general neurologists and primary care physicians. 
 With the recent acquisition of Macrilen in January 2018, we are in the process of expanding our commercial infrastructure to support the planned product launch in mid-2018.  We plan to build-out a separate and dedicated sales and marketing team to support the launch and ongoing commercialization of Macrilen.  Further, we plan to leverage our current commercial operations infrastructure to support Macrilen.  Based on our current market research, we believe there are approximately 50,000 adult growth hormone deficiency tests conducted per year. We plan to focus our launch activity on targeted pituitary centers and select community-based endocrinologists. 
 Given the current stage of product development of our product candidates, we do not have a commercialization infrastructure for those product candidates, although we do plan to leverage our current commercial infrastructure when possible. As with Keveyis and Macrilen, we intend to independently commercialize our rare disease‑focused product candidates, if approved, in the United States, the European Union and other key global markets. We believe that we can address the markets of our current product candidates by targeting endocrinologists that are focused on the diagnosis and treatment of rare pituitary disorders primarily stemming from benign tumors. Given the relatively concentrated specialty prescriber base, we plan to create a sales force of approximately 30 representatives in the United States as well in the European Union to market our endocrine product candidates, if approved. In building our sales force, we intend to recruit representatives with experience calling on endocrinologists and marketing orphan drug designated products.
 Our commercial strategy for our product candidates, if approved, will encompass promoting their unique benefits, as well as a concerted effort to raise awareness about the underlying disease among the physician/patient community with the goal of increasing the rate of diagnosis when the symptoms may otherwise be overlooked. We believe the combination of our commercial efforts and our product candidate profiles will facilitate our ability to successfully penetrate our target markets.
 Manufacturing
 We do not have internal manufacturing capabilities and intend to continue to rely on third parties to produce Keveyis, Macrilen and our product candidates. 
 We have a supply agreement with Taro to produce Keveyis. We are obligated to purchase certain annual minimum amounts of product totaling approximately $29 million over a six-year period from Taro. The supply agreement may extend beyond the orphan exclusivity period unless terminated by either party pursuant to the terms of the agreement. If terminated by Taro at the conclusion of the orphan exclusivity period, we have the right to manufacture the product on our own or have the product manufactured by a third party on our behalf.
 We have an interim supply agreement with Aeterna Zentaris GmbH to purchase Macrilen materials (including drug substance, drug product, and finished goods) until such time that we can negotiate supply agreements directly with the third parties that manufacture these materials.  We are obligated to purchase certain amounts of these Macrilen materials totaling approximately $1.26 million over a nine-month period from Aeterna Zentaris GmbH.
 The manufacturing, packaging and distribution of Recorlev drug product for clinical trials following Good Manufacturing Practices (“GMPs”), is currently outsourced under contracts to experienced contract manufacturers. We expect to enter into similar arrangements for veldoreotide.
 Intellectual Property of our Products and Product Candidates in Development 
 We actively seek to protect the intellectual property and proprietary technology that we believe is important to our business, including seeking, maintaining, enforcing and defending patent rights for our product candidates and methods of treatment, whether developed internally or licensed from third parties. Our success will depend on our ability to obtain and maintain patent and other protection including data or market exclusivity for our product candidates and methods of treatment, preserve the confidentiality of any know‑how and operate without infringing the valid and enforceable patents and proprietary rights of third parties.

 
  25

 

 Our policy is to seek to protect our proprietary position generally by filing patent applications initially at the USPTO. After this initial phase, patent applications claiming priority to the initial application are filed in various countries, including the United States, Europe and Canada. In each case, we determine the strategy and territories required after discussion with our patent professionals with the goal of obtaining relevant coverage in territories that are commercially important to us and our product candidates. We will additionally rely on data exclusivity and patent term extensions when available, including the relevant exclusivity through orphan drug designation. We also rely on trade secrets and know‑how relating to our underlying product technologies. Prior to making any decision on filing any patent application, we consider with our patent professionals whether patent protection is the most sensible strategy for protecting the invention concerned or whether the invention should be maintained as confidential.
 We own or license 53 granted patents, of which three are U.S. issued patents, and 7 pending patent applications, of which 6 are U.S. patent applications and one allowed U.S. patent application. 
 We have ten trademark registrations for Strongbridge Biopharma in the United States, Australia, Brazil, China, Europe, Israel, India, Japan, Mexico, and Turkey and one pending trademark application for Strongbridge Biopharma in Canada. We have five trademark registrations for Corynthia in Australia, China, Europe, Japan, Turkey and five pending trademark applications for Corynthia in the United States, Brazil, Canada, Israel and India.  We have seven trademark registrations for Corynthia in Australia, China, Europe, India, Japan, Mexico and Turkey and four pending trademark applications for Recorlev in the United States, Brazil, Canada and Israel.  We have one trademark registration for Normocort in Europe.
 Keveyis
 We acquired U.S. marketing rights to Keveyis in late 2016.  We are not aware of any issued patents or pending patent applications related to Keveyis. Although we intend to rely primarily on orphan exclusivity for Keveyis, we also expect to explore additional life cycle management opportunities. Macrilen
 In January 2018, we acquired the U.S. and Canadian rights to manufacture and commercialize Macrilen. We also obtained a license to three U.S. patents, one Canadian patent and one U.S. patent application, as well as to the Macrilen trademark.  The Canadian patent expires in 2021 and two of the U.S. patents expire in 2022.  The third U.S. patent expires in 2027.     Recorlev
 We own 43 issued patents related to our product candidate, Recorlev. Issued claims in these patents are directed to methods of treatment of various diseases or conditions associated with elevated cortisol levels or activity using Recorlev.  The patents have been granted in major territories including Europe, China and Japan and expire in 2026 and 2027. We have five pending U.S. patent applications and one allowed U.S. patent application directed to methods of treating a disease or condition associated with elevated cortisol levels or activity, including Cushing’s syndrome, with Recorlev. The patent to issue from the allowed U.S. patent application will expire in 2026.  We also have an issued patent in the United States directed to reducing C-reactive protein levels and systemic inflammation through administration of a once-daily dose of Recorlev that expires in 2030. 
 Veldoreotide
 While we own granted patents related to our product candidate veldoreotide in the United States and other major territories, including Europe and Canada, the terms of these patents may not extend beyond the launch date of this product candidate. We have also filed a PCT and U.S. application directed to various methods and formulations of veldoreotide. To the extent we are not able to obtain further patent exclusivity as a result of the PCT application or other future patent filings, we intend to rely on orphan and data/marketing exclusivity for veldoreotide.

 Laws and Regulations Regarding Patent Terms
 The term of individual patents depends upon the legal term of the patents in the countries in which they are obtained. In most countries in which we file, the patent term is 20 years from the earliest date of filing a non‑provisional application. In the United States, a patent term may be shortened if a patent is terminally disclaimed over another patent or as a result of delays in a patent prosecution by the patentee. A patent’s term may be lengthened by a patent term adjustment, which compensates a patentee for administrative delays by the USPTO in granting a patent. The patent term of a European patent is 20 years from its effective filing date, which, unlike in the United States, is not subject to patent term adjustments in the same way as U.S. patents.
 The term of a patent that covers a FDA‑approved drug or biologic may also be eligible for patent term extension, which permits patent term restoration as compensation for the patent term lost during the FDA regulatory review process. The Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984 (the “Hatch‑Waxman Act”) permits a patent term extension of up to five years beyond the expiration of the patent. The length of the patent term extension is related to the length of time the drug or biologic is under regulatory review. Patent extensions cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the date of product approval and only one patent applicable to an approved drug may be extended. Similar provisions are available in Europe and other jurisdictions to extend the term of a patent that covers an approved drug, for example Supplementary Protection Certificates. In the future, if and when our products receive FDA approval, we expect to apply for patent term extensions on patents covering those products. We anticipate that some of our issued patents may be eligible for patent term extensions but such extensions may not be available and therefore our commercial monopoly may be restricted.
 Competition
 The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition and a strong emphasis on proprietary products. While we believe that our scientific knowledge, technology, and development experience provide us with competitive advantages, we face potential competition from many different sources, including major pharmaceutical, specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions, governmental agencies and public and private research institutions. Any product candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize will compete with existing products and new products that may become available in the future. Many of our competitors, alone or with their strategic partners, have greater experience than we do in conducting preclinical studies and clinical trials, and obtaining FDA, EMA and other regulatory approvals, and have substantially greater financial, technical and other resources than we do, such as larger research and development, clinical, marketing and manufacturing organizations. As a result, these companies may obtain regulatory approval for competing products more rapidly than we are able and may be more effective in selling and marketing their products. Companies that complete clinical trials, obtain required regulatory authority approvals and commence commercial sale of their drugs before their competitors may achieve a significant competitive advantage, and our commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if competitors develop and commercialize products that are safer, more effective, have fewer or less severe side effects, are more convenient or are less expensive than any products that we may develop. Drugs resulting from our research and development efforts or from our joint efforts with collaboration partners therefore may not be commercially competitive with our competitors’ existing products or products under development.
 We are aware of several companies focused on developing or marketing therapies for rare neuromuscular and endocrine disorders. For our product candidates, the main competitors include:

· | Keveyis: Acetazolamide, another oral carbonic anhydrase inhibitor, is used frequently off-label for the prophylactic and sometimes acute treatment of PPP. Potassium supplements, are indicated for use in hypokalemic periodic paralysis in the United States and are frequently used either chronically or for emergency treatment of episodes in that form of PPP. Several other types of drugs have been reported to have benefits for chronic or acute use in one or more than one PPP variant, including potassium-sparing diuretics, beta receptor agonists, mexelitine and other sodium channel blockers, and others. We are not aware of drugs currently in development for prophylactic chronic treatment of PPP. A Phase 2 clinical study of bumetanide, a loop diuretic, is underway in England for acute treatment of paralytic attacks.

· | Macrilen: Measurement of blood levels of IGF-1, which is typically used as the first test when GHD is suspected. However, this test is not used to definitively diagnose GHD because many GHD patients show normal IGF-1 levels.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

      From a diagnostic performance perspective, the Insulin Tolerance Test (ITT) has historically been considered the reference standard for the evaluation of AGHD because of its high sensitivity and specificity. However, the ITT is inconvenient to both patients and physicians, administered intravenously (IV), and contra-indicated in certain patients, such as patients with coronary heart disease or seizure disorder, because it requires the patient to experience hypoglycemia to obtain a result. Some physicians will not induce full hypoglycemia, intentionally compromising accuracy to increase safety and comfort for the patient. Furthermore, administration of the ITT includes additional costs associated with the patient being closely monitored by a physician for the two- to four-hour duration of the test, and the test must be administered in a setting where emergency equipment is available and where the patient may be quickly hospitalized. The ITT is not used for patients with co-morbidities, such as cardiovascular disease, seizure disorder or a history of brain cancer or for patients who are elderly and frail, due to safety concerns.
 The Glucagon Stimulation Test (“GST”) is considered relatively safe by endocrinologists. The mechanism of action for this test is unclear. Like the ITT, this test takes at least three and up to four hours to complete and requires parenteral drug administration, typically intramuscular. It produces side effects in up to one-third of the patients with the most common being nausea during and after the test; delayed hypoglycemia also occurs uncommonly. The GST must be used in caution in the elderly as serious cardiovascular adverse effects have been reported.  Interpretation of the GST is complicated by variability of the peak growth hormone response, which is strongly influenced by the patient’s body mass and glucose status (i.e. prediabetes, diabetes).
 The GHRH + ARG test (growth hormone releasing hormone-arginine stimulation) is an easier test to perform in an office setting and has a good safety profile. The drug components are typically more expensive than insulin or glucagon. GHRH + ARG is used in the EU and has been proposed to be the best alternative to ITT, but GHRH in the form of GEREF, a GHRH analog, is no longer marketed in the United States. This test is administered intravenously (IV).
    
· | Recorlev: A number of therapies are currently approved and in various stages of development for endogenous Cushing’s syndrome. Currently, there are no therapies broadly marketed for the treatment of endogenous Cushing’s syndrome patients in the United States. Two therapies have limited indications in Cushing’s syndrome. Korlym (mifepristone) is a cortisol receptor blocker indicated to control hyperglycemia secondary to hypercortisolism in adult patients with endogenous Cushing’s syndrome who have type 2 diabetes mellitus or glucose intolerance and have failed surgery or are not candidates for surgery. Signifor (pasireotide) marketed by Novartis in the United States is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with Cushing's disease (a subset of Cushing’s syndrome) for whom pituitary surgery is not an option or has not been curative.

  Ketoconazole, metyrapone and mitotane are marketed by HRA Pharma in certain European countries. Novartis has submitted a NDA/MAA for Signifor (pasireotide) LAR in Cushing’s disease.  Osilodrostat (LCI699), an 11β-HSD2 inhibitor, is currently in Phase 3 clinical development by Novartis in Cushing’s disease.  Corcept is developing relacorilant (CORT125134), a selective glucocorticoid receptor antagonist, currently in Phase 2 for Cushing’s syndrome.  HRA Pharma is developing metyrapone for the European market. Millendo is developing ATR-101, a selective acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase 1 (ACAT) inhibitor, currently in Phase 2. The University of Oxford, in collaboration with AstraZeneca is studying the selective 11β-HSD1 inhibitor, AZD4017, now in Phase 2.  Cedars-Sinai is developing R-roscovitine in Phase 2.

· | Veldoreotide: A number of acromegaly therapies are currently approved and in various stages of development. There are currently three approved SSA therapies for acromegaly in the United States: Sandostatin LAR (octreotide) marketed by Novartis; Signifor LAR (pasireotide) marketed by Novartis; and

Somatuline Depot (lanreotide) marketed by Ipsen. There is one growth hormone receptor antagonist, Somavert (pegvisomant), marketed by Pfizer. Chiasma had filed an NDA in the United States for RG-3806 (Mycapssa®), an oral octreotide formulation in 2015, and received a Complete Response Letter wherein FDA stated that it did not believe the company’s application had provided substantial evidence of efficacy to warrant approval, and advised Chiasma that it would need to conduct another clinical trial in order to overcome this deficiency. Four additional therapies are in Phase 2 clinical development for acromegaly: octreotide long‑acting depot (CAM‑2029) developed by Novartis and Camurus; ITF‑2984 developed by Italfarmaco; BIM-23B065 developed by Ipsen; and ATL-1103 developed by Antisense Therapeutics.

  Government Regulation
 Product Approval Process
 The safety, clinical testing, manufacturing, quality, labeling, storage, distribution, record keeping, advertising, promotion, import, export and marketing, among other things, of our product candidates are subject to extensive regulation by governmental authorities in the United States and other countries. The FDA under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act regulates pharmaceutical products in the United States. The steps required before a drug may be approved for marketing in the United States generally include:
· | the completion of preclinical laboratory tests and animal tests conducted under Good Laboratory Practices, (“GLPs”), and other applicable regulations;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the submission to the FDA of an IND application for human clinical testing, which must be reviewed by the FDA and become effective before human clinical trials commence;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the successful performance of adequate and well‑controlled human clinical trials conducted in accordance with cGCP to establish the safety and efficacy of the product candidate for each proposed indication;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | analysis of clinical trial data and preparation of submission to the FDA of an NDA;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the submission to the FDA of an NDA;
--+-------------------------------------


· | the FDA’s acceptance of the NDA;
--+---------------------------------


· | satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facilities at which the product is made to assess compliance with cGMPs to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the drug’s identity, strength, quality and purity;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | satisfactory completion of FDA inspections of clinical trial sites and GLP toxicology studies; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the FDA’s review and approval of an NDA prior to any commercial marketing or sale of the drug in the United States.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  The testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort and financial resources, and the receipt and timing of any approval is uncertain.
 Preclinical studies include laboratory evaluations of the product candidate, as well as animal studies to assess the potential safety and efficacy of the product candidate. The results of the preclinical studies, together with manufacturing information, analytical data and a proposed clinical trial protocol, are submitted to the FDA as part of the IND, which must become effective before clinical trials may be commenced. The IND will become effective automatically 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA raises concerns or questions about the conduct of the clinical trials as outlined in the IND prior to that time and places the IND on clinical hold. In this case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before clinical trials can proceed. A clinical hold may occur at any time during the life of an IND, due to safety concerns or non‑compliance, and may affect one or more specific studies or all studies conducted under the IND.

 Clinical trials involve the administration of the product candidates to healthy volunteers or patients with the disease to be treated under the supervision of a qualified principal investigator. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety, and the efficacy criteria to be evaluated. A protocol for each clinical trial and any subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Further, each clinical trial must be reviewed and approved by an independent institutional review board (“IRB”), either centrally or individually at each institution at which the clinical trial will be conducted. The IRB will consider, among other things, ethical factors, the safety of human subjects and the possible liability of the institution. Progress reports detailing the status of the clinical trials must be submitted to the FDA annually. Sponsors must also report to the FDA serious and unexpected adverse reactions, any clinically important increase in the rate of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigation brochure, or any findings from other studies or animal or in vitro testing that suggest a significant risk in humans exposed to the drug. There are also requirements governing the reporting of ongoing clinical trials and clinical trial results to public registries.
 Clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases prior to approval, but the phases may overlap. These phases generally include the following:

· | Phase 1. Phase 1 clinical trials represent the initial introduction of a product candidate into human subjects, frequently healthy volunteers. In Phase 1, the product candidate is usually tested for safety, including adverse effects, dosage tolerance, absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion and pharmacodynamics. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Phase 2. Phase 2 clinical trials usually involve studies in a limited patient population to (1) evaluate the efficacy of the product candidate for specific indications, (2) determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage, and (3) identify possible adverse effects and safety risks. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Phase 3. Phase 3 clinical trials are conducted to further demonstrate clinical efficacy, optimal dosage and safety within an expanded patient population at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites, and to provide sufficient data for the statistically valid evidence of safety and efficacy. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Phase 4 clinical trials are conducted after approval to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication and to document a clinical benefit in the case of drugs approved under accelerated approval regulations, or when otherwise requested by the FDA in the form of post‑market requirements or commitments. Failure to promptly conduct any required Phase 4 clinical trials could result in withdrawal of approval.
     Clinical trials are inherently uncertain and any phase may not be successfully completed. A clinical trial may be suspended or terminated by the FDA, IRB or sponsor at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Additionally, some clinical trials are overseen by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical trial sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board or committee. This group provides ongoing oversight and safety reviews to determine whether or not a clinical trial may move forward at designated check points based on access to certain data from the clinical trial. We may also suspend or terminate a clinical trial based on evolving business objectives and/or competitive climate.
 Sponsors have the opportunity to meet with the FDA at certain points during the development of a new drug to share information about the data gathered to date and for the FDA to provide advice on the next phase of development. These meetings may be held prior to the submission of an IND, at the end of Phase 2 and/or before an NDA is submitted. Meetings may be requested at other times as well.
 The results of preclinical studies and clinical trials, including negative or ambiguous results as well as positive findings, together with detailed information on the manufacture, composition and quality of the product, proposed labeling and other relevant information are submitted to the FDA in the form of an NDA requesting approval to market the product. The NDA must be accompanied by a significant user fee payment. The FDA has substantial discretion in the approval process and may refuse to accept any application, for example if the NDA is not sufficiently complete, or decide that the data is insufficient for approval and require additional preclinical, clinical or other studies.

 
  30

 

 In addition, under the Pediatric Research Equity Act (“PREA”), an NDA or supplement to an NDA must contain data to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The FDA may grant deferrals for submission of data or full or partial waivers. Unless otherwise required by regulation, PREA does not apply to any drug for an indication for which orphan drug designation has been granted. However, if only one indication for a product has orphan drug designation, a pediatric assessment may still be required for any applications to market that same product for the non‑orphan indication(s).
 Once the NDA submission has been submitted, the FDA has 60 days after submission of the NDA to conduct an initial review to determine whether it is sufficient to accept for filing. NDAs receive either a standard or priority review. Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, the FDA sets a goal date by which it plans to complete its review. For a standard review, this is typically 10 months from the date of submission of the NDA application. The review process is often extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification. Before approving an NDA, the FDA will inspect the facilities at which the product is manufactured and will not approve the product unless the manufacturing facility complies with cGMPs and may also inspect clinical trial sites for integrity of data supporting safety and efficacy. The FDA may also convene an advisory committee of external experts to provide input on certain review issues relating to risk, benefit and interpretation of clinical trial data. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but generally follows such recommendations in making its decisions. The FDA may delay approval of an NDA if applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied and/or the FDA requires additional testing or information. The FDA may require post‑marketing testing and surveillance to monitor safety or efficacy of a product.
 After the FDA evaluates the NDA and conducts inspections of manufacturing facilities where the drug product and/or its API will be produced, it may issue an approval letter or a Complete Response Letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A Complete Response Letter generally outlines the deficiencies in the NDA submission and may require substantial additional clinical testing, such as an additional pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial(s), clinical data, and/or other significant, expensive and time consuming requirements related to clinical trials, preclinical studies or manufacturing. Even if such additional information is submitted, the FDA may ultimately decide that the NDA does not satisfy the criteria for approval.
 The FDA may approve the NDA with a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (“REMS”), plan to mitigate risks, which could include medication guides, physician communication plans, or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries and other risk minimization tools. The FDA also may condition approval on, among other things, changes to proposed labeling, development of adequate controls and specifications, or a commitment to conduct one or more post‑market studies or clinical trials. Such post‑market testing may include Phase 4 clinical trials and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product’s safety and effectiveness after commercialization.
 Orphan Drug Designation
 Under the Orphan Drug Act of 1983, the FDA may grant orphan drug designation to a drug or biological product intended to treat an orphan disease or condition, which is a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or if it affects more than 200,000 individuals in the United States, there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making a drug product available in the United States for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product. Orphan product designation must be requested before submitting an NDA. After the FDA grants orphan product designation, the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Orphan product designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process.
 If a product that has orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease or condition for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan product exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug or biological product for the same indication for seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as demonstrating clinical superiority to the product with orphan exclusivity. The designation of such drug also entitles a party to financial incentives, such as opportunities for grant funding towards clinical trial costs, tax advantages and user‑fee waivers. Competitors, however, may receive approval of 

 
  31

 
different products for the indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity or obtain approval for the same product but for a different indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity. Orphan product exclusivity also could block the approval of one of our products for seven years if a competitor obtains approval of the same drug or biological product as defined by the FDA or if our product candidate is determined to be contained within the competitor’s product for the same indication or disease. If a drug product designated as an orphan product receives regulatory approval for an indication broader than that for which it is designated, it may not be entitled to orphan product exclusivity. Orphan drug status in the European Union has similar but not identical benefits in that jurisdiction.
 Post‑Approval Requirements
 Drugs manufactured or distributed pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to recordkeeping, periodic reporting, product distribution, advertising and promotion, and reporting of adverse experiences with the product. After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims, are subject to prior FDA review and approval and may require additional clinical trials and NDA submissions. There also are continuing, annual user fee requirements for any marketed products and the establishments at which such products are manufactured, as well as new application fees for supplemental applications with clinical data.
 In addition, drug manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are required to register their establishments with the FDA and state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and these state agencies for compliance with cGMP requirements. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated and often require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon the sponsor and any third‑party manufacturers that the sponsor may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance.
 Once an approval is granted, the FDA may withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained, or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information, imposition of post‑market studies or clinical trials to assess new safety risks, or imposition of distribution or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, but are not limited to:

· | restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | fines, warning letters or holds on post‑approval clinical trials;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------


· | refusal of the FDA to approve pending NDAs or supplements to approved NDAs, or suspension or revocation of product license approvals;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; or
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------

  The FDA strictly regulates marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of products that are placed on the market. Drugs may be promoted only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off‑label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off‑label uses may be subject to significant liability.
 Moreover, the recently enacted federal Drug Supply Chain Security Act imposes new obligations on manufacturers of pharmaceutical products, among others, related to product tracking and tracing. Among the requirements of this new federal legislation, manufacturers will be required to provide certain information regarding the drug product to individuals and entities to which product ownership is transferred, label drug product with a product 

 
  32

 
identifier, and keep certain records regarding the drug product. Further, under this new legislation, manufacturers will have drug product investigation, quarantine, disposition, and notification responsibilities related to counterfeit, diverted, stolen, and intentionally adulterated products, as well as products that are the subject of fraudulent transactions or which are otherwise unfit for distribution such that they would be reasonably likely to result in serious health consequences or death.
 Foreign Regulation
 In order to market any product outside of the United States, we would need to comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements of other countries and jurisdictions regarding quality, safety and efficacy and governing, among other things, clinical trials, marketing authorization, commercial sales and distribution of our products. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we would need to obtain the necessary approvals by the comparable foreign regulatory authorities before we can commence clinical trials or marketing of the product in foreign countries and jurisdictions. Although many of the issues discussed above with respect to the United States apply similarly in the context of the European Union, the approval process varies between countries and jurisdictions and can involve additional product testing and additional administrative review periods. The time required to obtain approval in other countries and jurisdictions might differ from and be longer than that required to obtain FDA approval. Regulatory approval in one country or jurisdiction does not ensure regulatory approval in another, but a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one country or jurisdiction may negatively impact the regulatory process in others. Other Healthcare Laws
 In addition to FDA restrictions on the marketing of pharmaceutical products, federal and state healthcare laws restrict certain business practices in the biopharmaceutical industry. Although we currently do not have any products on the market, we may be subject, and once our product candidates are approved and we begin commercialization, will be subject to additional healthcare laws and regulations enforced by the federal government and by authorities in the states and foreign jurisdictions in which we conduct our business. These laws include, but are not limited to, anti‑kickback, false claims, data privacy and security, and transparency statutes and regulations.
 The federal Anti‑Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving any remuneration, directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind, to induce, or in return for, purchasing, leasing, arranging for, ordering or recommending any good, facility, item or service for which payment is made, in whole or in part, under Medicare, Medicaid or any other federal healthcare programs. The term “remuneration” has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value, including for example, gifts, discounts, the furnishing of supplies or equipment, credit arrangements, payments of cash, waivers of payment, ownership interests and providing anything at less than its fair market value. The federal Anti‑Kickback Statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on the one hand, and prescribers, purchasers and formulary managers on the other. Although there are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting certain common activities from prosecution, the exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly, and our future practices may not in all cases meet all of the criteria for a statutory exception or safe harbor protection. Practices that involve remuneration that may be alleged to be intended to induce prescribing, purchases or recommendations may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exception or safe harbor. Failure to meet all of the requirements of a particular applicable regulatory safe harbor does not make the conduct per se illegal under the federal Anti‑Kickback Statute. Instead, the legality of the arrangement will be evaluated on a case‑by‑case basis based on a cumulative review of all of its facts and circumstances. Several courts have interpreted the statute’s intent requirement to mean that if any one purpose of an arrangement involving remuneration is to induce referrals of federal healthcare program covered business, the statute has been violated. Additionally, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act (collectively, the “PPACA”), amended the intent requirement under the Anti‑Kickback Statute and criminal healthcare fraud statutes (discussed below) such that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or the specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. In addition, PPACA provides that the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti‑Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the civil False Claims Act (discussed below). Due to the breadth of these federal and state anti‑kickback laws, and the potential for 

 
  33

 
additional legal or regulatory change in this area, it is possible that our current and future sales and marketing practices and/or our future relationships with physicians might be challenged under these laws, which could cause harm to us.
 The civil monetary penalties statute imposes penalties against any person or entity who, among other things, is determined to have presented or caused to be presented a claim to a federal health program that the person knows or should know is for an item or service that was not provided as claimed or is false or fraudulent.
 The federal false claims laws prohibit, among other things, any person or entity from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment or approval to the federal government or knowingly making, using or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim to the federal government. As a result of a modification made by the Fraud Enforcement and Recovery Act of 2009, a claim includes “any request or demand” for money or property presented to the U.S. government. Recently, several pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies have been prosecuted under these laws for, among other things, allegedly providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product. Other companies have been prosecuted for causing false claims to be submitted because of the companies’ marketing of the product for unapproved, and thus non‑covered, uses.
 The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”), created new federal criminal statutes that prohibit knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud or obtain, by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations, or promises, any of the money or property owned by, or under the custody or control of, any healthcare benefit program, including private third‑party payors, and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of, or payment for, healthcare benefits, items or services.
 In addition, we may be subject to data privacy and security regulation by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (“HITECH”), and its implementing regulations, imposes certain requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information. Among other things, HITECH makes HIPAA’s security standards directly applicable to business associates—independent contractors or agents of covered entities that receive or obtain protected health information in connection with providing a service on behalf of a covered entity. HITECH also created four new tiers of civil monetary penalties, and newly empowered state attorneys general with the authority to enforce HIPAA. In January 2013, the Office for Civil Rights of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services issued the Final Omnibus Rule under HIPAA pursuant to HITECH that makes significant changes to the privacy, security, and breach notification requirements and penalties. The Final Omnibus Rule generally took effect in September 2013 and enhances certain privacy and security protections, and strengthens the government’s ability to enforce HIPAA. The Final Omnibus Rule also enhanced requirements for both covered entities and business associates regarding notification of breaches of unsecured protected health information. In addition, state laws govern the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways. These state laws may not have the same effect and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts.
 Additionally, PPACA also included the federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act, which requires certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologicals and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program (with certain exceptions) to report annually information related to certain payments or other transfers of value made or distributed to physicians and teaching hospitals, or to entities or individuals at the request of, or designated on behalf of, the physicians and teaching hospitals and to report annually certain ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. Failure to comply with required reporting requirements could subject applicable manufacturers and others to substantial civil money penalties.
 Also, many states have similar healthcare statutes or regulations that apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in several states, apply regardless of the payor. Certain states require pharmaceutical companies to implement a comprehensive compliance program that includes a limit or outright ban on 

 
  34

 
expenditures for, or payments to, individual medical or health professionals and/or require pharmaceutical companies to track and report gifts and other payments made to physicians and other healthcare providers.
 Because we intend to commercialize products that could be reimbursed under federal and other governmental healthcare programs, we plan to develop a comprehensive compliance program that establishes internal controls to facilitate adherence to the rules and healthcare program requirements. Although compliance programs and adherence thereto may mitigate the risk of violation of and subsequent investigation and prosecution for violations of the above laws, the risks cannot be entirely eliminated. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the health care laws or regulations described above or any other laws that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including potentially significant criminal, civil and/or administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, individual imprisonment, exclusion of products from reimbursement under government programs, contractual damages, reputational harm, administrative burdens, diminished profits and future earnings and/or the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations. To the extent that any of our products will be sold in a foreign country, we may be subject to similar foreign laws and regulations, which may include, for instance, applicable post‑marketing requirements, including safety surveillance, fraud and abuse laws, and implementation of corporate compliance programs and reporting of payments or transfers of value to healthcare professionals.
 Pharmaceutical Coverage, Pricing and Reimbursement
 In both domestic and foreign markets, our sales of any future approved products, if and when commercialized, will depend in part on the availability of coverage and adequate reimbursement from third‑party payors. Third‑party payors include government authorities, managed care providers, private health insurers and other organizations. Patients who are prescribed treatments for their conditions and providers performing the prescribed services generally rely on third‑party payors to reimburse all or part of the associated healthcare costs. Patients are unlikely to use our products, if approved, unless coverage is provided and reimbursement is adequate to cover a significant portion of the cost of our products. Sales of our products will therefore depend substantially, both domestically and abroad, on the extent to which the costs of our products will be paid by third‑party payors. These third‑party payors are increasingly focused on containing healthcare costs by challenging the price and examining the cost‑effectiveness of medical products and services.
 In addition, significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of newly approved healthcare product candidates. The market for our product candidates for which we may receive regulatory approval will depend significantly on access to third‑party payors’ drug formularies, or lists of medications for which third‑party payors provide coverage and reimbursement. The industry competition to be included in such formularies often leads to downward pricing pressures on pharmaceutical companies. Also, third‑party payors may refuse to include a particular branded drug in their formularies or otherwise restrict patient access to a branded drug when a less costly generic equivalent or other alternative is available. Furthermore, third‑party payor reimbursement to providers for our product candidates may be subject to a bundled payment that also includes the procedure administering our products. To the extent there is no separate payment for our product candidates, there may be further uncertainty as to the adequacy of reimbursement amounts. Because each third‑party payor individually approves coverage and reimbursement levels, obtaining coverage and adequate reimbursement is a time consuming, costly and sometimes unpredictable process. We may be required to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of any product to each third‑party payor separately with no assurance that approval would be obtained, and we may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the cost‑effectiveness and/or medical necessity of our products. This process could delay the market acceptance of any product and could have a negative effect on our future revenues and operating results. We cannot be certain that our product candidates will be considered cost‑effective or medically necessary. Because coverage and reimbursement determinations are made on a payor‑by‑payor basis, obtaining acceptable coverage and reimbursement from one payor does not guarantee the Company will obtain similar acceptable coverage or reimbursement from another payor. A payor’s decision to provide coverage for a product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. If we are unable to obtain coverage of, and adequate reimbursement and payment levels for, our product candidates from third‑party payors, physicians may limit how much or under what circumstances they will prescribe or administer them and patients may decline to purchase them. This in turn could affect our ability to successfully commercialize our products and impact our profitability, results of operations, financial condition and future success.

 
  35

 

 Furthermore, in many foreign countries, particularly the countries of the European Union, the pricing of prescription drugs is subject to government control. In some non‑U.S. jurisdictions, the proposed pricing for a drug must be approved before it may be lawfully marketed. The requirements governing drug pricing vary widely from country to country. For example, the European Union provides options for its member states to restrict the range of medicinal products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. A member state may approve a specific price for the medicinal product or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the medicinal product on the market. We may face competition for our product candidates from lower‑priced products in foreign countries that have placed price controls on pharmaceutical products. In addition, there may be importation of foreign products that compete with our own products, which could negatively impact our profitability.
 Healthcare Reform
 In the United States and foreign jurisdictions, there have been, and we expect there will continue to be, a number of legislative and regulatory changes to the healthcare system that could affect our future business and operations if and when we begin to directly commercialize our products.
 In particular, there have been and continue to be a number of initiatives at the U.S. federal and state level that seek to reduce healthcare costs. Initiatives to reduce the federal deficit and to reform healthcare delivery are increasing cost‑containment efforts. We anticipate that Congress, state legislatures and the private sector will continue to review and assess alternative controls on healthcare spending through limitations on the growth of private health insurance premiums and Medicare and Medicaid spending, the creation of large insurance purchasing groups, price controls on pharmaceuticals and other fundamental changes to the healthcare delivery system. Any proposed or actual changes could limit or eliminate our spending on development projects and affect our ultimate profitability.
 In March 2010, PPACA was signed into law. PPACA has substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers. PPACA, among other things: established an annual, nondeductible fee on any entity that manufactures or imports certain branded prescription drugs and biologic agents, apportioned among these entities according to their market share in certain government healthcare programs; revised the methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers for covered outpatient drugs under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated; increased the statutory minimum Medicaid rebates owed by most manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program; addressed a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted, or injected; extended the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program to prescriptions of individuals enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations; required manufacturers to offer 50% point‑of‑sale discounts on negotiated prices of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period, as a condition for the manufacturer’s outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D; and implemented payment system reforms including a national pilot program on payment bundling to encourage hospitals, physicians and other providers to improve the coordination, quality and efficiency of certain healthcare services through bundled payment models. For years the U.S. Congress has been assessing new legislation designed to repeal and replace core sections of the PPACA.  On December 22, 2017, for instance, the President signed into law the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, which repealed the “individual mandate” of the PPACA. The repeal of the individual mandate is expected to cause millions fewer Americans to be insured in 2027 and premiums in insurance markets may rise. The Trump Administration has also taken executive actions to undermine or delay implementation of the PPACA. In January 2017, the President signed an Executive Order directing applicable federal agencies to waive, defer, grant exemptions from, or delay the implementation of any provision of the PPACA that would impose a fiscal or regulatory burden on states, individuals, healthcare providers, health insurers, or manufacturers of pharmaceuticals or medical devices.
 In the future, there may continue to be additional proposals relating to the reform of the U.S. healthcare system, some of which could further limit the prices we will be able to charge for our product candidates, or the amounts of reimbursement available for our product candidates. If future legislation were to impose direct governmental price controls and access restrictions, it could have a significant adverse impact on our business. Managed care organizations, as well as Medicaid and other government agencies, continue to seek price discounts. Some states have implemented, and other states are considering, measures to reduce costs of the Medicaid program, and some states are considering implementing measures that would apply to broader segments of their populations that are not Medicaid‑eligible. Due to 

 
  36

 
the volatility in the current economic and market dynamics, we are unable to predict the impact of any unforeseen or unknown legislative, regulatory, payor or policy actions, which may include cost containment and healthcare reform measures. Such policy actions could have a material adverse impact on our profitability.

Prior to becoming a domestic filer on January 1, 2018, we also filed annual reports on Form 20-F and Reports on Form 6-K. The public may obtain copies of these filings at the SEC’s Public Reference Room at 100 F Street, NE, Washington, DC 20549 or by calling the SEC at 1-800-SEC-0330. The SEC also maintains a website at http://www.sec.gov that contains reports, proxy and information statements and other information regarding Strongbridge Biopharma plc and other companies that file materials with the SEC electronically. As soon as practicable after filing with the SEC, we make copies of these reports available to the public, free of charge, through the investor relations tab on our web site, www.strongbridgebio.com. The information found on our website is not part of this or any other report that we file with or furnish to the SEC.
