Overview 
 Zosano Pharma Corporation is a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company focused on providing rapid systemic administration of therapeutics to patients using our proprietary Adhesive Dermally-Applied Microarray, or ADAM, technology. In February 2017, we announced positive results from our ZOTRIP pivotal efficacy trial, or ZOTRIP trial, that evaluated M207, which is our proprietary formulation of zolmitriptan delivered via our ADAM technology, as an acute treatment for migraine. We are focused on developing products where rapid administration of established molecules with known safety and efficacy profiles provides an increased benefit to patients, for markets where patients remain underserved by existing therapies. 
 ADAM is our proprietary, investigational technology platform designed to offer rapid drug absorption into the bloodstream, which can result in an improved pharmacokinetic profile compared to original dosage forms. ADAM consists of an array of drug-coated titanium microprojections mounted on an adhesive backing that is pressed on to the skin using a reusable handheld applicator. The microprojections penetrate the stratum corneum and allow the drug to be absorbed into the microcapillary system of the skin. We focus on developing products based on our ADAM technology for indications in which rapid onset, ease of use and stability offer significant therapeutic and practical advantages, for markets where there is a need for more effective therapies. 
 Our development efforts are focused on our product candidate, M207. M207 is our proprietary formulation of zolmitriptan delivered utilizing our ADAM technology. Zolmitriptan is one of a class of serotonin receptor agonists known as triptans and is used as an acute treatment for migraine. Migraine is a debilitating neurological disease, symptoms of which include moderate to severe headache pain, nausea and vomiting, and abnormal sensitivity to light and sound. The objective of M207 is to provide faster onset of efficacy and sustained freedom from migraine symptoms by delivering rapid absorption while avoiding exposure to the gastrointestinal, GI, tract. Feedback from the United States Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, on M207s regulatory path has confirmed that one positive pivotal efficacy study, in addition to the required safety study, would be sufficient for approval of M207 for the treatment of migraine. 
 ZOTRIP Phase 3 Trial Results 
 The ZOTRIP trial was a multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial comparing three doses of M207 (1.0mg, 1.9mg, and 3.8mg) to placebo for the treatment of a single migraine attack. As illustrated in the table below, the ZOTRIP trial results showed that the 3.8mg M207 dose demonstrated statistically significant pain freedom and most bothersome symptom freedom at two hours, the co-primary endpoints of the study.   ZOTRIP Trial Primary Endpoints Results 
 

Primary endpoint | Placebo | 3.8mg M207 | p-value*
Pain freedom | 14.3% | 41.5% | 0.0001 
Most bothersome symptom freedom | 42.9% | 68.3% | 0.0009 

 The 3.8mg dose also achieved statistical significance in the secondary endpoints of pain freedom at 45 minutes and 60 minutes and showed durability of effect on pain freedom at 24 and 48 hours. While the 1.0mg and 1.9mg doses of M207 demonstrated statistical significance in pain freedom at two hours, they did not demonstrate statistical significance in freedom from most bothersome symptom at two hours.

 M207 Long Term Safety Study 
In November 2017, we announced the initiation of enrollment in our long-term safety study for M207 as an acute treatment of migraine (M207-ADAM). M207-ADAM is an open label study evaluating the safety of the 3.8mg dose of M207 in migraine patients who have historically experienced at least two migraines per month. Patients are expected to treat a minimum of two migraines per month, with no maximum treatment limits. The M207-ADAM study will evaluate 150 patients for six months, and 50 patients for a year at approximately 30 sites in the U.S. The study is open-label, with investigator visits at months one, two, three, six, nine and twelve to record adverse events. We may elect to enroll more than the required number of patients to ensure a robust data set, and achievement of evaluable patients at each time point. The primary objective of M207-ADAM is to assess safety of M207 during repeated use over six and twelve months. Other endpoints are electrocardiography and laboratory parameters, as well as percentage of headaches with pain-free response. 
Our Strategy 
 Our goal is to make intracutaneous drug delivery a preferred delivery modality for indications where fast onset provides a therapeutic benefit to patients. Our near term focus is the continued development of our lead product candidate, M207. The key elements of our strategy are to: 

 | Develop and commercialize M207. We believe that M207, if approved by the FDA, will offer significant therapeutic and practical advantages as compared to existing migraine therapeutics, including its rapid onset, ease of use and stability. We have retained worldwide commercial rights to M207. While we currently intend to develop M207 through FDA approval and commercialization in the United States ourselves, we remain open to opportunities with potential strategic partners to maximize the strategic value of our product and our company.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 | Focus on regulatory support and market opportunities for M207. We intend to focus our resources on non-clinical and clinical studies required for NDA filing and, if approved, would support market acceptance and expansion for M207. For example, certain preclinical studies, such as 30 day toxicity studies, are required in order to file an NDA.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Pursue indications outside migraine for external partnering. We have performed initial feasibility studies on a number of compounds, both within CNS and in other therapeutic indications, where rapid drug delivery could provide a therapeutic benefit to patients. For product candidates that are outside the area of migraine, or where a partner can contribute specific expertise, we intend to evaluate collaborations with strategic partners to further the clinical and commercial development of such product candidates. In addition, we continue to explore opportunities to combine a partners proprietary molecule with our ADAM technology to create new therapeutic options for patients.

 M207 for Migraine 
 The focus of our development efforts is on our product candidate M207, our proprietary formulation of zolmitriptan, a class of serotonin receptor agonists known as triptans, used for the treatment of migraine. Migraine is a debilitating neurological disease, symptoms of which include moderate to severe headache pain, nausea and vomiting, and abnormal sensitivity to light and sound. Our M207 intracutaneous delivery system is applied to an individuals upper arm to deliver zolmitriptan to the circulation, with the objective of providing rapid absorption of drug and sustained freedom of migraine symptoms while avoiding exposure to the GI tract. 
 According to the Migraine Research Foundation, migraine is the third most prevalent illness in the world. Migraine affects approximately 39 million people in the United States, representing approximately 18% of women, 6% of men and 10% of children in the country. Nearly one in four United States households includes someone who suffers from migraine. Migraines often last between four and 24 hours, but they may last as long as three days. According to published studies, 63% of migraine patients experience one or more migraines per month and 48% of migraine attacks occur in early morning and are already at peak intensity on awakening. Physicians recommend treating migraine at earliest detection. However, because treatment for morning migraines is often delayed, these migraines can be more difficult to treat. 
 The Migraine Research Foundation provides that, among women, who are disproportionately affected by migraine, 25% of migraine sufferers experience four or more severe attacks per month. Migraine attacks are estimated to lead to lost productivity costs as high as $36 billion annually in the United States and, in 2015, the medical cost of treating chronic migraine was more than $5.4 billion. In addition, more than 90% of migraine sufferers are unable to work or function normally during an attack. According to market data from Symphony Health, triptans constitute over a $4.8 billion market in the United States. 
 We believe that each of the currently available methods of non-oral administration, including nasal spray and subcutaneous injection, have significant disadvantages. Nasal sprays have been associated with taste disturbances. Patients are hesitant to self-administer injections and thus primarily seek an injectable triptan at an urgent care setting or at the physicians office. There are other delivery technologies in development, such as pulmonary delivery. However, none has been approved to date. 
 ZOTRIP Phase 2/3 Trial achieved statistical significance on co-primary endpoints with the 3.8mg dose 
 On February 13, 2017 the Company announced the results of our ZOTRIP pivotal efficacy trial for M207. Our ZOTRIP trial was a multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial comparing three doses of M207 (1.0mg, 1.9mg, and 3.8mg) to placebo for the treatment of a single migraine attack. Subjects were enrolled in the ZOTRIP trial at 36 centers across the United States. Those subjects recruited into the trial had a history of at least one year of migraine episodes with or without aura. Upon recruitment, the subjects entered a one-month run-in period that ensured they met the key eligibility criteria of two to eight migraine attacks per month, which was documented using an electronic diary or an app on their cell phone. Subjects also identified the most bothersome symptoms and indicated the presence or absence of nausea, phonophobia or photophobia,

   during the episodes in the run-in period. Successfully screened subjects were then randomized into the treatment/dosing period in which they had 8 weeks to confirm and receive blinded treatment for a single migraine attack, termed qualifying migraine, in which the subjects most bothersome symptom had to be present. During a qualifying migraine, subjects scored the severity of pain on a 4-point scale, the presence or absence of migraine-associated symptoms (phonophobia, photophobia, or nausea), starting pre-dose and then at several intervals over 48 hours post-dose. The co-primary endpoints for the trial were those defined in the October 2014 FDA Draft GuidanceMigraine: Developing Drugs for Acute Treatment as pain freedom and most bothersome symptom freedom at two hours. Safety was assessed by adverse events reported and other standard safety measures. 
 Five hundred and eighty nine subjects were enrolled in the ZOTRIP trial, of which 365 were randomized. Of those randomized, 333 subjects were treated and are included in the safety analysis, and 321 qualified for the modified intent-to-treat (mITT) population. With the multiple doses and multiple endpoints in the trial, a sequential testing procedure was used beginning with the highest dose and the co-primary endpoints. Since statistical significance was not achieved for most bothersome symptom in the 1.9 mg group, p-values for secondary endpoints should be considered nominal p-values.
As illustrated in the tables and figure below, the ZOTRIP trial results demonstrated that the 3.8 mg M207 dose achieved statistically significant pain freedom and most bothersome symptom freedom at two hours. The 3.8mg dose also achieved statistical significance in the secondary endpoints of pain freedom at 45 minutes and 60 minutes and showed durability of effect on pain freedom at 24 and 48 hours. Additionally, M207 was not associated with any SAEs. While the 1.0 mg and 1.9 mg doses of M207 demonstrated statistical significance in pain freedom at two hours, they did not achieve statistical significance in freedom from most bothersome symptom at two hours. Statistical significance is an indicator of the likelihood of an observed effect being due to the study drug rather than due to chance. The p value is the probability of an event occurring by chance alone. When the p value is less than 5% (0.05) the results are considered to be statistically significant. 
 ZOTRIP Trial Co-Primary Endpoint Results for 3.8mg 
 

Primary endpoint | Placebo | 3.8mg M207 | p-value
Pain freedom | 14.3% | 41.5% | 0.0001

Pain freedom at 48 hours | 39.0% | 64.6% | 0.0013 

 M207 was generally well-tolerated with no SAEs reported in the ZOTRIP trial. The most frequently reported adverse event was redness at the application site (18.3% of subjects) and all cases of redness resolved. Thirteen subjects (3.9%) reported pain at the application site; with application site pain reported as mild in all but three subjects. Additionally, five (1.5%) subjects across M207-treated groups reported dizziness versus zero subjects in the placebo group, and four (1.2%), subjects across M207-treated groups reported nausea whereas zero subjects in the placebo group reported this event.

  M207 Long Term Safety Study 
 In November 2017, we announced enrollment of the first patient in our long-term safety study for M207-ADAM. The M207-ADAM is an open label study evaluating the safety of the 3.8mg dose of M207 in migraine patients who have historically experienced at least two migraines per month. Patients are expected to treat a minimum of two migraines per month, with no maximum treatment limits. The M207-ADAM study will evaluate approximately 150 patients for six months, and approximately 50 patients for a year at approximately 30 sites in the U.S. The study is open-label, with investigator visits at months one, two, three, six, nine and twelve to record adverse events. We expect to have completed enrollment of approximately 100 patients by the end of the first quarter of 2018 and approximately 250 patients by the end of the second quarter of 2018 in order to meet our overall objectives of evaluating repeat use of M207 in 150 subjects for six months and 50 subjects for a year. The primary objective of M207-ADAM is to assess safety of M207 during repeated use over six and twelve months. Other endpoints are electrocardiography and laboratory parameters, as well as percentage of headaches with pain-free response. Based on enrollment projections, we anticipate six month safety data will be available around the end of the fourth quarter of 2018 and twelve month safety data around the end of the first quarter of 2019. 
Our Research Programs 
 Our internal research and development programs use molecules with demonstrated safety and efficacy that are formulated to enable delivery through our proprietary ADAM technology. We intend to pursue product development opportunities that utilize the Section 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway, which may reduce clinical development and regulatory timelines relative to new chemical entity development. In selecting our development candidates, we consider the therapeutic advantage of rapid onset, the size of the market, the level of competition and the potential selling price. 
 Our ADAM technology patch consists of a 3 cm2 to 6 cm2 array of titanium microneedles approximately 200-350 microns in length, coated with a hydrophilic formulation of drug, and attached to an adhesive patch. The maximum amount of drug that can be coated on a patchs microneedle array depends on the active molecule of the drug formulation, the weight of the excipients in the drug formulation, and the coatable surface area of the microneedle array. For example, we use patches with 2 cm2, 3 cm2 and 6 cm2 microneedle arrays. In the pivotal trial for M207 we used two 3 cm2 patches to deliver the appropriate dose. Based on our testing, we believe 3.8mg of zolmitriptan could also be coated on a single patch with a 6 cm2 microneedle array while maintaining acceptable tolerability. The patch is applied with a hand-held applicator that presses the microneedles into the skin to a uniform depth in each application, close to the capillary bed, allowing for dissolution and absorption of the drug, but not deep enough to contact the nerve endings in the skin. The typical patch wear time is generally thirty to sixty minutes. 
 We have tested our ADAM technology in preclinical and clinical proof of concept studies that demonstrated its technical feasibility with multiple compounds, ranging from small molecules to proteins. Based on this research, we believe that our ADAM technology can be used to deliver treatments for a wide variety of indications in which rapid absorption can enhance onset of efficacy and sustainability of effect. That coupled with ease of use might offer particularly important therapeutic, practical, and commercial advantages over existing options. 
 Competition 
 Competition for our product candidates 
 The development and commercialization of new products to treat migraine is highly competitive. We expect to have considerable competition from major pharmaceutical, biotechnology and specialty pharmaceutical companies. Many of our competitors have substantially greater financial, technical and other resources than we do. In addition, many of these companies have longer operating histories and more experience than us in preclinical and clinical development, manufacturing, regulatory and global commercialization.

Index to Financial Statements
  Companies marketing products that treat migraine that may compete with our M207 product candidate include Teva Pharmaceutical Industries, Inc., GlaxoSmithKline plc, Eli Lilly & Company, AstraZeneca plc, Allergan, Inc, Biohaven Pharmaceuticals, Alder Biopharmaceuticals, Amgen Inc. and Promius Pharma, LLC. 
 Competition in drug delivery platforms 
 In addition to competition from major pharmaceutical, biotechnology and specialty pharmaceutical companies that develop and market products that compete against those that we develop, we face additional competition from companies that may develop and license drug delivery platforms similar to ours, and from alternative formulations and methods of delivery of the drugs on which we have focused, including oral formulations, nasal sprays, intracutaneous patches, intramuscular and subcutaneous injections and infusions. Such companies include, but are not limited to, 3M Company, Endo Pharmaceuticals, Corium International, Inc. and Pantec Biosolutions AG. 
 Research and Development and Manufacturing 
 As of December 31, 2017, our research and development group consisted of 36 employees, located in our headquarters in Fremont, California. Our research and development staff have broad knowledge and skills in a range of disciplines applicable to formulation of drugs and the design and manufacture of our ADAM technology. Our research and development group has particular expertise in two areas critical to our success: developing drug formulations that can be delivered using our ADAM technology and optimizing the technology to deliver those drugs. 
 The goals of our research and development efforts are to identify and develop drugs that can be delivered using our intracutaneous delivery system. In the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, we incurred $20.2 million and $20.5 million, respectively, of research and development expense. See Part IIItem 7Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of this report for additional detail regarding our research and development activities. 
 We operate a current good manufacturing practices (cGMP) compliant manufacturing facility in Fremont, California, and believe we have adequate manufacturing capabilities and capacity to produce our ADAM technology for preclinical and Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical trials of all of our product candidates, and pivotal Phase 3 trials of most of our product candidates. We continue to expand our manufacturing capabilities and have implemented automation of certain processes to further expand our capacity. We expect to produce GMP batches of M207 in the third quarter of 2018. We purchase various components or intermediates of our ADAM technology from third-party vendors, including the titanium foil and formed micro-arrays, active pharmaceutical ingredients and excipients, inner ring, adhesive backing, ring and backing assembly, outer ring and primary and secondary packing components. The majority of these components and intermediaries are available from multiple sources. We also outsource the manufacturing of our applicators. 
 The manufacturing process for our ADAM technology patch consists of two primary operations: (1) the formation of the microneedle array, involving etching of titanium foil and subsequent pad-forming; and (2) application of the drug formulation to the microneedle array. 
 Intellectual Property 
 Our strategy is to rely on a combination of patent, trade secret and trademark laws in the United States and other jurisdictions, and to rely on license and confidentiality agreements to protect our proprietary technology and brand. The laws of some countries in which our products are licensed may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. 
 As of January 8, 2018, we held exclusive licenses to or owned 28 United States patents and 5 United States patent applications, as well as three Patent Cooperation Treaty patent applications, covering key features of our intracutaneous delivery system, such as formulation, methods of treatment, coating, array design, patch

   anchoring, patch application, delivery, manufacturing and packaging. In December 2017, we received a Notice of Allowance from the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office for our patent application directed to M207 titled Method of Rapidly Achieving Therapeutic Concentrations of Triptans for Treatment of Migraines. This newly-allowed patent application contains claims generated from formulation, preclinical and clinical studies, and highlights the unique aspects of our technologies and their applicability for the treatment of migraine. This application will issue on March 20, 2018, as U.S. Patent No. 9,918,932 and will expire on 2037. In late January 2018, a continuation application was filed from this parent application that will advance the protection for this technology. 
 We license all of these patents and patent applications, other than an issued US patent and pending US and international applications for D107 and M207 formulation and a new applicator design described below, from ALZA Corporation, or ALZA, on an exclusive basis for all countries. These patents and patent applications are foundational and apply generally to each of our product candidates and their related applicators. Under the terms of the license agreement with ALZA, we are responsible for all development and development costs related to our intracutaneous delivery system. We are also responsible for commercializing our intracutaenous delivery system, including preparing and paying for all related regulatory filings. We are obligated to pay ALZA royalties in the low to mid-single digits on sales by us of products that would otherwise infringe one of the licensed patents or that is developed by us based on certain ALZA know-how or inventions, and to pay ALZA amounts equal to the greater of royalties in the low to mid- single digits on sales by our sublicensees of such products or a percentage in the mid-tens to low twenties of royalties received by us on sales by our sublicensees of such products. We are also obligated to pay ALZA a percentage of non-royalty revenue that we receive from our sublicensees based on sales of such products. The license agreement will terminate upon the expiration of our obligations to make the royalty and other payments described above to ALZA. Additionally, we may terminate the agreement at any time for convenience upon prior written notice to ALZA, and either party may terminate the agreement upon a material breach of the agreement by the other party. 
 We have filed four pending United States patent applications, two pending European applications, a pending Patent Cooperation Treaty application covering our single-use applicator and formulations of D107 and zolmitriptan. The D107 patent was issued in November 2015 with an expiration date of 2034. The last of our issued technology platform patents will expire in 2027. 
 We rely on trade secrets to protect substantial portions of our technology. We generally seek to protect these trade secrets by entering into non-disclosure agreements and other contractual provisions with our employees, consultants and customers, and have restricted access to our manufacturing facilities and other technology. 
 We have one registered trademark to Zosano, ZOSANO PHARMA, Reg. No. 3705884 and one pending trademark application for ADAM, App. No. 87525805. 
 Government Regulation and Product Approval 
 United StatesFDA Process 
 The research, development, testing, manufacture, labeling, promotion, advertising, distribution and marketing, among other things, of our products are subject to extensive regulation by governmental authorities in the United States and other countries. In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, or the FDCA, and its implementing regulations. Failure to comply with the applicable United States requirements may subject us to administrative or judicial sanctions, such as FDA refusal to approve pending new drug applications (NDAs) warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions and/or criminal prosecution. We expect each of our product candidates will be subject to review by the FDA as a drug/device combination product under NDA standards. Medical products containing a combination of new drugs, biological products or medical devices are regulated as combination products in the United States. A combination product generally is defined as a product comprised of components from two or more regulatory categories (e.g., drug/device, device/biologic, drug/biologic). Each component of a combination product is subject to the requirements established by the FDA for that type of 
 
9 


Index to Financial Statements
   component, whether a new drug, biologic or device. In order to facilitate pre-market review of combination products, the FDA designates one of its centers to have primary jurisdiction for the pre-market review and regulation of the overall product based upon a determination by the FDA of the primary mode of action of the combination product. The determination whether a product is a combination product or two separate products is made by the FDA on a case-by-case basis. We have discussed our development strategy with the FDA on our M207 program. 
 Drug Approval Process 
 None of our product candidates may be marketed in the United States until the product has received FDA approval. The steps to be completed before a drug may be marketed in the United States include: 

 | preclinical laboratory tests, animal studies, and formulation studies, all performed in accordance with the FDAs Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) regulations;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | submission to the FDA of an investigational new drug application (IND) for human clinical testing, which must become effective before human clinical trials in the U.S. may begin and must be updated annually;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the drug for each indication to the FDAs satisfaction;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | submission to the FDA of an NDA;
--+---------------------------------


 | satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the drug is produced to assess compliance with cGMP regulations; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | FDA review and approval of the NDA.
--+------------------------------------

 Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry, toxicity and formulation, as well as animal studies. The results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information and analytical data, are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND, which must become effective before human clinical trials in the U.S. may begin. An IND will automatically become effective thirty days after receipt by the FDA, unless before that time the FDA raises concerns or questions about issues such as the conduct of the trials as outlined in the IND. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding FDA concerns or questions before clinical trials can proceed. We submitted an IND for M207 in the second quarter of 2016. 
 Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational drug to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing the objectives of the trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. Each protocol must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Clinical trials necessary for product approval are typically conducted in three sequential phases, but the phases may overlap. The trial protocol and informed consent information for trial subjects in clinical trials must also be approved by an Institutional Review Board (IRB) for each institution where the trials will be conducted, and each IRB must monitor the trial until completion. Trial subjects must sign an informed consent form before participating in a clinical trial. Clinical testing also must satisfy extensive good clinical practice (GCP) regulations and regulations for informed consent and privacy of individually identifiable information. 
 Assuming successful completion of the required clinical testing, the results of the preclinical studies and of the clinical trials, together with other detailed information, including information on the manufacture and composition of the drug, are submitted to the FDA in the form of an NDA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. Section 505(b)(1) and Section 505(b)(2) of the FDCA are the provisions governing the type of NDAs that may be submitted under the FDCA. Section 505(b)(1) is the traditional pathway for new chemical entities when no other new drug containing the same active pharmaceutical ingredient or active moiety, which is the molecule or ion responsible for the action of the drug substance, has been approved by the FDA. As an alternate pathway to FDA approval for new or improved formulations of previously approved

   products, a company may file a Section 505(b)(2) NDA. Section 505(b)(2) permits the submission of an NDA where at least some of the information required for approval comes from studies not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference. The FDA reviews any NDA submitted to ensure that it is sufficiently complete for substantive review before the FDA accepts the NDA for filing. The FDA may request additional information rather than accept the NDA for filing. Even if the NDA is filed, companies cannot be sure that any approval will be granted on a timely basis, if at all. The FDA may also refer the application to an appropriate advisory committee, typically a panel of clinicians, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of the advisory committee, but it typically follows such recommendations. 
 The FDA may require that certain contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling, or may condition the approval of an NDA on other changes to the proposed labeling, development of adequate controls and specifications, or a commitment to conduct post-marketing testing or clinical trials and surveillance programs to monitor the safety of approved products that have been commercialized. Further, the FDA may place conditions on approvals including the requirement for a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) to assure the safe use of the drug. If the FDA requires a REMS, the sponsor of the NDA must submit a proposed REMS; the FDA will not approve the NDA without an approved REMS, if required. A REMS could include medication guides, physician communication plans, or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries and other risk minimization tools. Any of these limitations on approval or marketing could restrict the commercial promotion, distribution, prescription or dispensing of products. Product approvals may be withdrawn for non-compliance with regulatory standards or if problems occur following the initial marketing of the product. 
 Before approving an NDA, the FDA usually will inspect the facility or the facilities at which the drug is manufactured and will not approve the product unless the manufacturing is in compliance with cGMP regulations. If the NDA and the manufacturing facilities are deemed acceptable by the FDA, it may issue an approval letter, or in some cases, an approvable letter followed by an approval letter. Both letters usually contain a number of conditions that must be met in order to secure final approval of the NDA. When and if those conditions have been met to the FDAs satisfaction, the FDA will issue an approval letter. The approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug for specific indications. As a condition of NDA approval, the FDA may require post-marketing testing and surveillance to monitor the drugs safety or efficacy, or impose other conditions. Approval may also be contingent on an approved REMS that limits the labeling, distribution or promotion of a drug product. Once issued, the FDA may withdraw product approval if ongoing regulatory requirements are not met or if safety problems occur after the product reaches the market. 
 After approval, certain changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, making certain manufacturing changes or making certain additional labeling claims, are subject to further FDA review and approval. Before a company can market products for additional indications, it must obtain additional approvals from the FDA. Obtaining approval for a new indication generally requires that additional clinical trials be conducted. A company cannot be sure that any additional approval for new indications for any product candidate will be approved on a timely basis, or at all. 
 Post-Approval Requirements 
 Oftentimes, even after a drug has been approved by the FDA for sale, the FDA may require that certain post-approval requirements be satisfied, including the conduct of additional clinical trials. If such post-approval conditions are not satisfied, the FDA may withdraw its approval of the drug. In addition, holders of an approved NDA are required to (i) report certain adverse reactions to the FDA, (ii) comply with certain requirements concerning advertising and promotional labeling for their products, and (iii) continue to have quality control and manufacturing procedures conform to cGMP regulations after approval. The FDA periodically inspects the sponsors records related to safety reporting and/or manufacturing facilities. This latter effort includes assessment of ongoing compliance with cGMP regulations. We have used and intend to continue to use third- party manufacturers to produce active pharmaceutical ingredients, (API), for our products in clinical and

   commercial quantities, and future FDA inspections may identify compliance issues at the facilities of our contract manufacturers that may disrupt production or distribution, or require substantial resources to correct. In addition, discovery of problems with a product after approval may result in restrictions on a product, including withdrawal of the product from the market. 
 Hatch-Waxman Act 
 As part of the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, Section 505(b)(2) of the FDCA was enacted, otherwise known as the Hatch-Waxman Amendments. Section 505(b)(2) permits the filing of an NDA where at least some of the information required for approval comes from studies not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference. The Hatch-Waxman Amendments permit the applicant to rely upon certain preclinical or clinical studies conducted for an approved product. The FDA may also require companies to perform additional studies or measurements to support the change from the approved product. The FDA may then approve the new product for all or some of the label indications for which the referenced product has been approved, as well as for any new indication sought by the Section 505(b)(2) applicant. 
 To the extent that the Section 505(b)(2) applicant is relying on studies conducted for an already approved product, which is referred to as the Reference Listed Drug, the applicant is required to certify to the FDA concerning any listed patents in the FDAs Orange Book publication that relate to the Reference Listed Drug. Specifically, the applicant must certify for all listed patents one of the following certifications: (i) the required patent information has not been filed by the original applicant; (ii) the listed patent already has expired; (iii) the listed patent has not expired, but will expire on a particular date and approval is sought after patent expiration; or (iv) the listed patent is invalid or will not be infringed by the manufacture, use or sale of the new product. 
 If a Paragraph I or II certification is filed, the FDA may make approval of the application effective immediately upon completion of its review. If a Paragraph III certification is filed, the approval may be made effective on the patent expiration date specified in the application, although a tentative approval may be issued before that time. If an application contains a Paragraph IV certification, a series of events will be triggered, the outcome of which will determine the effective date of approval of the 505(b)(2) application. The Section 505(b)(2) application also will not be approved until any non-patent exclusivity, such as exclusivity for obtaining approval of a new chemical entity, listed in the Orange Book for the Referenced Listed Drug has expired. 
 A certification that the new product will not infringe the Reference Listed Drugs listed patents or that such patents are invalid is called a Paragraph IV certification. If the applicant has provided a Paragraph IV certification to the FDA, the applicant must also send notice of the Paragraph IV certification to the NDA and patent holders for the Reference Listed Drug once the applicants NDA has been accepted for filing by the FDA. The NDA and patent holders may then initiate a legal challenge to the Paragraph IV certification. The filing of a patent infringement lawsuit within 45 days of their receipt of a Paragraph IV certification automatically prevents the FDA from approving the Section 505(b)(2) NDA by imposing a 30-month automatic statutory injunction, which may be shortened by the court in a pending patent case if either party fails to reasonably cooperate in expediting the case. The 30-month stay terminates if a court issues a final order determining that the patent is invalid, unenforceable or not infringed. Alternatively, if the listed patent holder does not file a patent infringement lawsuit within the required 45-day period, the applicants NDA will not be subject to the 30-month stay. 
 The Hatch-Waxman Act provides five years of data exclusivity for new chemical entities which prevents the FDA from accepting Abbreviated New Drug Applications and 505(b)(2) applications containing the protected active ingredient. The Hatch-Waxman Act also provides three years of exclusivity for applications containing the results of new clinical investigations (other than bioavailability studies) essential to the FDAs approval of new uses of approved products such as new indications, delivery mechanisms, dosage forms, strengths, or conditions of use.

  Pricing and Reimbursement 
 Sales of products that we market in the future, and our ability to generate revenues on such sales, are dependent, in significant part, on the availability and level of reimbursement from third-party payers such as state and federal governments, managed care providers and private insurance plans. Private insurers, such as health maintenance organizations and managed care providers, have implemented cost-cutting and reimbursement initiatives and likely will continue to do so in the future. These include establishing formularies that govern the drugs and biologics that will be offered and also the out-of-pocket obligations of member patients for such products. In addition, particularly in the United States and increasingly in other countries, we are required to provide discounts and pay rebates to state and federal governments and agencies in connection with purchases of our products that are reimbursed by such entities. We have consciously selected compounds for development that offer therapeutic benefit based on fast onset of action. If our products are approved by the FDA, we intend to work with payers to demonstrate the clinical benefits of our products over other delivery modalities to secure adequate and commercially favorable pricing and reimbursement levels. 
Other Governmental Regulations, Healthcare Laws and Environmental Matters 
 The FDA regulates all advertising and promotion activities for products under its jurisdiction both prior to and after approval. A company can make only those claims relating to safety and efficacy that are approved by the FDA. Physicians may prescribe legally available drugs for uses that are not described in the drugs labeling and that differ from those tested by us and approved by the FDA. Such off-label uses are common across medical specialties, and often reflect a physicians belief that the off-label use is the best treatment for the patients. The FDA does not regulate the behavior of physicians in their choice of treatments, but FDA regulations do impose stringent restrictions on manufacturers communications regarding off-label uses. Failure to comply with applicable FDA requirements may subject a company to adverse publicity, enforcement action by the FDA, corrective advertising, consent decrees and the full range of civil and criminal penalties available to the FDA. 
 In addition, under the Pediatric Research Equity Act (PREA), an NDA or supplement to an NDA must contain data that are adequate to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations, and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The FDA has indicated that our product candidate M207 is covered by the PREA, but the FDA may, on its own initiative or at the request of an applicant, grant deferrals for submission of some or all pediatric data until after approval of the product for use in adults, or full or partial waivers from the pediatric data requirements. 
 Although we currently do not have any products on the market, we may be subject to additional healthcare regulation and enforcement by the federal government and by authorities in the states and foreign jurisdictions in which we conduct our business. Such laws include, without limitation, state and federal anti-kickback, fraud and abuse, false claims, privacy and security and physician sunshine laws and regulations, many of which may become more applicable to us if our product candidates are approved and we begin commercialization. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of such laws or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including, without limitation, civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs and imprisonment, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results. 
 If we establish international operations, we will be subject to compliance with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or the FCPA, which prohibits corporations and individuals from paying, offering to pay, or authorizing the payment of anything of value to any foreign government official, government staff member, political party, or political candidate in an attempt to obtain or retain business or to otherwise influence a person working in an official capacity. We also may be implicated under the FCPA for activities by our partners, collaborators, contract research organizations, vendors or other agents.

 As of December 31, 2017, we had 51 employees, all of whom are full time, 5 of whom hold doctorate degrees in their respective scientific and pharmaceutical fields and 1 of whom holds a Doctor of Medicine degree. We make extensive use of third party contractors, consultants and advisors to perform many of our present activities. 
Special Stockholder Meeting, Reverse Split and Authorized Share Increase 
 On January 23, 2018, we held a special meeting of stockholders. At the special meeting, the stockholders approved, among other things, an amendment to our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation to increase the number of authorized shares of common stock from 100,000,000 to 250,000,000 shares. A Certificate of Amendment to the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation authorizing the authorized share increase was filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware on January 24, 2018, and the authorized share increase became effective in accordance with the terms of the Certificate of Amendment upon filing with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware. 
 The stockholders also approved a proposal authorizing the board of directors, in its discretion, to effect a reverse stock split of our outstanding shares of common stock at a ratio ranging from 1-for-5 to 1-for-20 to be determined by the Board of Directors and effected, if at all, no later than November 23, 2018. On January 23, 2018, following the special stockholder meeting, the board of directors approved a 1-for-20 reverse stock split of the common stock and the filing of a Certificate of Amendment to the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation of the Company to effectuate the reverse stock split. A Certificate of Amendment to the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation authorizing the reverse stock split was filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware on January 24, 2018, and the reverse stock split became effective in accordance with the terms of the Certificate of Amendment at 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time on January 25, 2018, which we refer to as the Effective Time. 
 At the Effective Time, every twenty shares of common stock issued and outstanding was automatically combined into one share of issued and outstanding common stock, without any change in the par value per share. The reverse stock split did not affect the number of authorized shares of common stock, which, after giving effect to the authorized share increase, is 250,000,000 shares. In addition, a proportionate adjustment will be made to the per share exercise price and the number of shares issuable upon the exercise of the Companys outstanding equity awards, options and warrants to purchase shares of common stock and the number of shares reserved for issuance pursuant to the Companys equity incentive compensation plans.
