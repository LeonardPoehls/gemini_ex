Forward-Looking Statements
 
This document contains forward-looking statements, including statements regarding the Company's strategy, plans for growth and anticipated sources of capital and revenue.  The Company's actual results may differ dramatically from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements.  The differences may result from one or more of the risk factors described below or from events that we have not foreseen.
 
Risk Factors
 
LD Holdings has very limited financial resources.  In order to implement our business plan, we will have to raise capital.  If we are unsuccessful in raising capital, our business will not grow.
 
Because of our limited operating history, LD Holdings has little historical financial data on which to base our plans for future operations.  Management will have to budget capital investment and expenses based, in large part, on our expectation of future revenues.  If those expectations are not met, LD Holdings Inc. may exhaust its capital resources before it achieves operational stability.
 
Corporate Strategy
 
LD Holdings, Inc., (symbol LDHL), has developed a business model that seeks to capitalize on the massive transfer of generational assets as the "Baby-Boomer" generation transitions from the ownership of small businesses into retirement.  The Baby-Boomer generation is represented by almost 78 million individuals born between 1946 and 1964.  Over the next 20 years as these Baby-Boomers are retiring, there are going to be businesses worth trillions of dollars that need to be sold by this Boomer generation.
 
Historically, the sellers typically wanted to provide minimal or no financing to the buyer.  These types of transactions were too large for most individuals to finance, too risky for banks based upon the company's individual merits (as opposed to the buyer's personal balance sheet) and too small to interest most institutional investors (hedge funds and private equity groups) to consider.  The lack of liquidity makes it difficult to raise funds privately from anyone but friends and relatives.
 
The company seeks to take a seemingly negative funding situation and turn it into a positive one.  Many of these Baby Boomer businesses being sold, whether the sellers want to or not, will be forced to provide a major portion, or all, of the financing in order to sell their businesses or will be forced to sell them below their true market value in order to get the business sold.
 
The company plans to focus its efforts on becoming a "known buyer" of small companies that meet its acquisition criteria, which it intends to widely distribute to business sellers directly and to others on its websites.  The 5-Year Plan is to accumulate at least 45 of these small companies and to slowly meld them into cohesive business units.  Using $8.33 million of revenues as an average in years 1 through 3, and $10 million of revenues as an average in years 4 and 5, would result in consolidated total revenues of $420 Million by the end of year 5.
 
The company's objective, through aggressive use of the Internet, is to put an outside investor base in place that shares the company's vision and objectives while the search for acquisitions is being conducted.  The company will stress on its affiliated websites and in its investor information that it is looking for long-term investors who are willing to hold their positions for a year or more.
 
The company plans to acquire at least 3 companies with $25 million sales and EBIT of $2.5 million.   At 15 x EBIT, this would place a market capitalization of $37 million on the company.  In order to accomplish its objectives, and as explained in the next section, the company has developed a 4-Step Process in which to accomplish its plans.
 
The company is establishing an Area Sales Director Business Model in a three state area (Ohio, Michigan and Indiana) initially.  If this three state model proves successful, a national rollout would follow.

Current Business Operations
 
LD Holdings, Inc., (Symbol LDHL), is a Financial and Management Holding Company that has identified a significant business opportunity that will fill a void in the small business world.  That void is the sale and transfer of businesses from one generation (the Baby Boomer) to the next.
 
With over 25 million small businesses in the USA and 15 trillion dollars of businesses to be sold over the next 15-20 years, there will be many opportunities for wealth generation.  The following services will be needed:
 

1* | There will be a need for Marketing, Sales and other Business Services to prepare the businesses for sale.
---+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2* | There will be a need for buyers for these businesses. 
3* | There will be a need for entrepreneur managers to manage these businesses. 
4* | There will be a need for the financing of these businesses. 

 
LD Holdings, Inc., as a Financial and Management Holding Company, will take advantage of this opportunity and manage the portfolio companies in which LD Holdings, Inc. will have varying percentages of ownership.
 
LD Holdings, Inc. will concentrate on businesses with sales between $2 million and $20 million and EBIT between $500,000 and $3 million.  This is where the real void exists. Owners of these businesses have a difficult time getting full value because the financing of these companies is too large for most individuals to finance, too risky for banks based upon the company's individual merits (as opposed to the buyer's personal balance sheet) and too small to interest most institutional investors (hedge funds and private equity groups) to consider.  A lack of liquidity makes it difficult to raise funds privately from anyone but friends and relatives.
 
LD Holdings, Inc. will provide the following services:
 
1* The Marketing, Sales and Other Business Services represent specifically target services to position client companies for both sales and profit growth in preparation for their eventual sale.  The lead service involves the client company outsourcing some portion of the sales function to us as an Independent Sales Organization (ISO).  This enhances the value of the company because it is no longer dependent upon the selling management's relationship with the company's customers.  We provide this service under a variety of formats and compensation arrangements.  Typically, these are long-term joint-venture marketing efforts that result in recurring revenue streams to the company.  The auxiliary consulting services provided include helping the client company to finance its growth and to prepare it for sale under the most advantageous terms possible to the client.  In many cases, we will participate in the incremental value created.
 
2* LD Holdings, Inc. maintains an ongoing data base of businesses for sale.  This allows the company to look for synergistic opportunities to combine one or more acquisition candidates at some future date.  This database also provides the company with a historical perspective of different industries and distribution channels along with any type of geographical variation in the valuation of businesses.
 
3* LD Holdings, Inc. maintains a database of individuals with specific backgrounds and expertise that will be available for both acquisition evaluation, and strategizing the post-acquisition business model for each potential acquisition candidate, once the financial aspects of the transaction are determined.  Particular attention will be given to developing relationships with those entrepreneurs and managers that want to perform in a results-driven environment, which has the associated incentives in place to create personal wealth for them and an above average return for the company's stockholders.  What distinguishes these individuals is that they are self-motivated, looking for a rewarding opportunity and are willing to put in whatever time is needed.
 
4* LD Holdings, Inc. maintains an ongoing data base of investors that share the company's vision and objectives.  The company is looking for long-term investors who are willing to hold their positions for a year or more for superior rates of return.  Investors that want to participate in ground floor investment opportunities that the company's Business Model represents have a special wealth building vehicle available to them.  The company's stock is thinly traded with a relatively small float.  This will allow the company to look for synergistic opportunities to combine one or more acquisition candidates.
 
Boomer's Diner, Inc., a Michigan corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of LD Holdings, Inc. (LDHL), opened for business in Monroe, Michigan in October 2010.  On August 28, 2011, the company closed its Monroe, Michigan diner, and on October 17, 2011, the company opened a Boomers Diner in Toledo, Ohio.  In January 2014, the Company closed its Toledo, Ohio diner.
 
This subsidiary's business plan complements the business plan of LDHL, which is to help facilitate the transfer of "Baby Boomer" businesses in the $2-$20 million annual sales range to younger generations.  Collaboration of business resources, lead generation and other business services will expand and leverage the footprint of LDHL.

As the Company grows, it will develop a group of full time employees that will be supplemented with temporary labor.
