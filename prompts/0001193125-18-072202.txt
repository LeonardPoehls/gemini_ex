--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Mission-critical services delivered by a trusted provider with global operations: Our longstanding relationships with the customers we serve provides us with an in-depth understanding of the mission-critical needs of our customers that enables us to tailor our services to their requirements. Our network availability and responsive customer service, along with the high switching costs associated with changing remote communications providers, provide us with a high rate of customer retention. Our global presence allows us to serve our clients around the world, except where government restrictions may apply. Our global terrestrial network also allows us to provide quality of service to prioritize various forms of data traffic for a more effective way to prioritize network traffic. Our ability to offer our customers global coverage sets us apart from regional competitors and allows us to match the breadth of their global operations and speed of deployment. The addition of Cyphre allows us to offer state-of-the-art encryption and network security services for the data communications necessary to safely and efficiently manage remote operations. In addition, our OTT offerings allow us to leverage our network to provide additional offerings for safety, business productivity improvement and crew comfort. 
 High-quality customer support with full-time monitoring and regional service centers: Our MPLS global network allows us to provide high quality customer care by enabling us to monitor the network end-to-end so that we can easily and rapidly identify and resolve any network problems that our customers may experience. As of December 31, 2017, we had 33 service operations centers and warehouses to support and service our customers remote sites. We maintain field technicians as well as adequate spare parts and equipment inventory levels in these service operations centers. Our Global Customer Care (GCC) team staffs our Network Operations Center (NOC) 24 hours per day, 365 days per year and provides engineering, service delivery and change management to customers globally. We provide non-stop, end-to-end monitoring and technical support for every customer. This proactive network monitoring allows us to detect problems instantly and keep our services running at optimum efficiency. Fully managed technology is a key reason why we can support solutions that deliver high performance and new technologies that improve productivity.

Operational leverage and multiple paths to growth supported by a plug-and-play MPLS platform: Our scalable, standardized communications platform provides us with plug-and-play capabilities to easily expand or improve service offerings. Our MPLS global platform allows us the ability to add additional services to our standard offerings or change our service offerings on a rig, production platform or energy support vessel with little incremental cost once installed onsite. We can offer these services to all users of the rig, production platform or energy support vessel, including drilling contractors, operators and service companies. We expect this operating leverage to increase profitability as we grow. Our MPLS global platform provides an important advantage by offering higher availability, scalability, flexibility and security than conventional switched transports and accounts for what we believe to be a key reason for the market share we have today of remote installations on offshore and onshore facilities with the potential that we can lift that market share over time. 
 Scalable systems using standardized equipment that leverages our global infrastructure: We have built our global satellite and terrestrial network with a sufficient amount of flexibility to support our growth without substantial incremental capital investment. Our knowledge and capabilities can be applied to remote sites located anywhere in the world. We install standardized equipment at each remote site, which allows us to provide support and maintenance services for our equipment in a cost-efficient manner. Not all of the components of equipment that we install at each site are the same, but the components that vary are limited in number and tend to be the same for rigs located in the same geography. As of December 31, 2017, we leased capacity from 41 satellites and are co-located at 19 teleports and 33 datacenters worldwide in order to provide our end-to-end solutions. By leasing rather than owning our network enablers and owning the on-site equipment at each site, we are able to both minimize the capital investment required by the base network infrastructure and maintain the flexibility to install high quality equipment at each site tailored to its locale and environmental conditions. We do own and manage the IP layer end-to-end. The standardized nature of our equipment minimizes execution risk, lowers maintenance and inventory carrying costs and enables ease of service support. In addition, we are able to remain current with technology upgrades due to our back-end flexibility. 
 Customized systems integration solutions provided by expert telecoms systems engineers: Through our acquisition of Nessco Group Holdings Ltd (Nessco) in 2012, Inmarsats Enterprise Energy business unit in 2014 and TECNOR in 2016 we provide global customized systems integration solutions through our Systems Integration business. As the demand for additional telecommunications products and telecoms systems increase with each new technological advance, the need for well-designed, efficient and reliable network infrastructures becomes increasingly vital to customers. Our solutions are custom designed, built and tested by expert engineers based on the customers specifications and requirements, as well as international industry standards and best practices. For those customers requiring reliable remote communications services, maintenance and support services and customized solutions for their network infrastructures, RigNet provides a one-stop-shop to satisfy these demands. 
 Flexible, provider-neutral technology platform: Because we procure communications connections and networks and equipment from third parties, we are able to customize the best solution for our customers needs and reduce our required fixed capital investments. We aim to preserve the flexibility to select particular service providers and equipment so that we may access multiple providers and avoid downtime if any of our initial providers were to experience any problems. By procuring bandwidth from a variety of communications providers instead of owning our own satellites, we are able to minimize capital investment requirements and can expand our geographic coverage in response to customers needs with much greater flexibility. Our product and service portfolio offers best-in-class technology platforms using the optimal suite of communications and networking capabilities for customers. 
 Long-term relationships with leading companies in the oil and gas, maritime, pipeline and engineering and construction industries: We have established relationships with some of the largest companies in the oil and gas, maritime, pipeline and engineering and construction industries. Some of our key customers are the leading drilling contractors around the world, with combined offshore fleets of hundreds of rigs, as well as leading oil and gas, oilfield service, maritime, pipeline and engineering and construction companies. In most cases, these customers have high standards of service that favor strategic providers such as RigNet and work in partnership with us to serve their remote operations. 
 The ability to design and implement a broad range of communication solutions using a range of frequencies and modes of communication: We have the ability to design and implement a broad range of communication solutions using a range of frequencies and modes of communication. These modes of communication include wired, wireless satellite Ku, C and L frequency bands, as well as wireless WiMAX and Line-of-Sight (LOS) microwave. This range of communications solutions allows us to offer competitive and reliable communications solutions in a broad range of remote geographic locations where our customers operate. This helps us meet our customers requirements for choosing their provider(s) based on network availability while factoring in price.

As a result, our customers enjoy a near real-time experience on the corporate data and latency sensitive applications that improves their productivity. The price for these solutions is generally included in the day rate and becomes the basis of the recurring revenue. 
 Apps & IoT 
 Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) 
 SCADA systems provide the ability to monitor, gather and process data while interacting with machines and devices such as pipelines, valves, pumps and motors. SCADA systems are connected to Human-Machine-Interface (HMI) software and logs events. Our customers deploy SCADA solutions to closely monitor operations when the cost, location and complexity or frequency requirements make technology the best and most practical means of monitoring operations. Our SCADA systems allow us to market to pipeline customers in addition to our traditional drilling and production customers. 
Data Analytics 
 As the demand for Data Analytics expands, we offer our customers Data Analytics that leverage our AVI services to enhance customer productivity and safety. We offer Data Analytics solutions that analyze AVI video and will alert if personnel fall or enter prohibited areas of drilling rigs, production sites, vessels and other mission critical remote sites. We continue to explore expansion (both organically and through acquisition) of our data analytics service offerings to support our customers safety and productivity. When we close our recently announced acquisition of Intelie, we will add powerful real-time data analysis tools that incorporate machine-to-machine learning and other applications that will increase both safety and efficiency of remote operations. 
 MetOcean 
 MetOcean provides accurate, reliable weather data monitoring primarily in the North Sea to support safe and efficient operations. 
 Adaptive Video Intelligence (AVI) and Video Collaboration Solutions 
 Our two AVI services increase situational awareness by supporting a live viewing application and are complemented by our Collaboration Service Offering, which utilizes wearable remote presence devices. These offerings enhance the safety and efficiency of our customers. These video services allow our customers to leverage Data Analytics, monitor the performance of key functions and collaborate with crews at remote sites to troubleshoot equipment, which can save customers time and money. Remote presence devices such as the RigNet Helmet Cam, patent pending, can send video from remote locations to onshore engineers and experts. This allows for real-time decision making that reduces operational downtime, saves travel costs and improves productivity. We continue to explore additional video-based service offerings supporting remote telemedicine, which supports crew well-being and welfare.

 Wi-Fi Hotspot 
 We offer Wi-Fi hotspot solutions that facilitate access to the Internet by personnel in remote facilities. This is advantageous for employers who seek to improve the quality of life for employees by providing Internet access in the living quarters, and for service companies that seek office-like connectivity for their technicians and engineers. The Wi-Fi hotspot solutions provide ready access with a familiar user interface without requiring specialized equipment to connect to the service. 
 Systems Integration 
 As the demand for additional telecommunications products and telecoms systems increase with each new technological advance, the need for well-designed, efficient and reliable network infrastructures becomes increasingly vital to our customers. Our Systems Integration solutions provide a complete package of communications infrastructure required to support onshore and offshore facilities for the oil and gas industry. Systems Integration services include the design, procurement, assembly and test, installation and commissioning of communications systems which can include WAN/LAN connectivity, Closed Circuit Television (CCTV) for monitoring and security, access control, public address (PAGA) systems, microwave systems and monitoring and control systems. We also offer a complete package of on-site and remote support and on-going maintenance capabilities in support of our customers installed infrastructure. 
 In order to service customers on a global scale, Systems Integration Engineering and Procurement (EP) services are provided from facilities in Aberdeen, Houston and Monterrey. We have the ability to facilitate the end-to-end process of telecoms systems mechanical fabrication, build and assembly through to final testing and Factory Acceptance Testing (FAT). 
 Combining the engineering and service capabilities of our Systems Integration services with our other services and solutions such as our NOC services, OTT offerings, and other managed services allows us to offer our Systems Integration customers a long-term package of maintenance and support options. These offerings provide customers an opportunity to reduce their operational and support costs while ensuring a highly reliable communications infrastructure. 
 Customer Contracts 
 In order to streamline the addition of new projects and solidify our position in the market, we have signed contracts with most customers. The specific services being provided are defined under individual service orders that generally have a term of one to three years with renewal options, while land-based locations are generally shorter term or terminable on short notice without penalty. Service orders are executed under the contracts for individual remote sites or groups of sites, and generally may be terminated early on short notice without penalty in the event of force majeure, breach of the agreement or cold stacking of a drilling rig. 
Customers 
 We have an international customer base comprising many of the largest drilling, exploration and production and oilfield service, maritime, pipeline and engineering and construction companies. Although no single customer accounted for 10.0% or more of revenue in 2017, our top 5 customers accounted for 26.8% of our total revenue for 2017. 
 
8 
 
Suppliers 
 Although we have preferred suppliers of technology, telecommunications and networking equipment, nearly all technology utilized in our solutions is available from more than one supplier. The standardized equipment may be deployed across any site in any geographic area. 
 In addition, we do not rely on one satellite provider for our entire satellite bandwidth needs except for certain instances in which only one satellite bandwidth provider is available in an operating location, which is typically due to licensing restrictions or only one satellite provider can offer a particular bandwidth. This approach generally allows us flexibility to use the satellite provider that offers the best service for specific areas and to change providers if one provider experiences any problems. 
 Competition 
 The technology and remote telecommunications industry is highly competitive. We expect competition in the markets that we serve to persist, intensify and change. We face varying degrees of competition from a wide variety of companies, including new potential entrants from providers to adjacent vertical markets and from forward integration by some of our suppliers deeper in the industry value chain, since successful service and system development is not necessarily dependent upon substantial financial resources. 
 Our primary global competitor is Speedcast International Ltd. In addition, there are a range of regional providers serving smaller customers. Specifically, in our U.S. onshore operations, we also face competition from: wireless network providers, drilling instrumentation providers, living quarters companies, and other pure-play providers like us. 
 Our customers generally choose their provider(s) based on the quality and availability of the service and the ability to restore service quickly when there is an outage. Pricing and breadth of service offerings is also a factor. Our customers depend on maximum availability, quality and continuity of products and service. Established relationships with customers and proven performance serve as significant barriers to entry. 
 Government Regulation 
 The telecommunications industry is highly regulated. Most of the services we provide require approvals from national and local authorities and compliance with laws and regulations from multiple authorities. In the United States, we are subject to the regulatory authority of the United States, primarily the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). Regulation of the telecommunications industry continues to change rapidly. Our U.S. services are currently provided on a private carrier basis and are therefore subject to lighter regulation under the U.S. Communications Act of 1934, as amended (the Act), and the rules and regulations of the FCC than if we were a common carrier. If the FCC or one or more state public utility commissions determine that these services or the services of our subsidiaries or affiliates constitute common carrier offerings subject to common carrier regulations, we may be subject to significant costs to ensure compliance with the applicable provisions of those laws and regulations or we may have to materially alter our service offerings to maintain our private carrier status. We may be subject to enforcement actions including, but not limited to, fines, cease and desist orders, or other penalties if we fail to comply with all applicable requirements. 
 In 2014, we completed the purchase of Inmarsats Enterprise Energy business unit. As part of the acquisition Inmarsat transferred licenses with rights to the electromagnetic spectrum, including fixed microwave licenses, very small aperture terminal (VSAT) earth station licenses, various private and commercial mobile radio service licenses, broadband radio licenses and leases for wireless communications service licenses. Failure to maintain appropriate licenses could subject RigNet to fines imposed by the FCC.
 The following is a summary of the regulatory environment in which we currently operate and does not describe all present and proposed international, federal, state and local legislation and regulations affecting the communications industry, some of which may change the way the industry operates as a result of administrative or judicial proceedings or legislative initiatives. We cannot predict the outcome of any of these matters or the impact on our business. 
 As an evolving non-dominant international and domestic carrier under the Act, among other requirements, RigNet must pay various fees including contribution of a percentage of its revenues from telecommunications services to the FCCs Universal Service Fund (USF) and other federal program funds to subsidize certain user segments, file various reports, and comply with rules that protect customer information and the processing of emergency calls. RigNet is also

 subject to the Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act (CALEA) and associated FCC regulations that require telecommunications service providers and VoIP providers to configure their networks to facilitate electronic surveillance by law enforcement authorities. 
 Like the FCC, the state public utility commissions (PUCs) impose various regulatory fees, universal service requirements, reporting and prior approval requirements for transfer or assignments. The FCC and state PUCs have jurisdiction to hear complaints regarding the compliance or non-compliance with these and other common carrier requirements of the Act and the FCCs rules, and similar state laws and regulations. 
 If the FCC or any state PUC determines that RigNet has not complied with federal and/or state regulatory requirements, we may be subject to enforcement actions including, but not limited to, fines, cease and desist orders, license revocation, or other penalties. 
 Several proceedings pending before the FCC have the potential to significantly alter our USF contribution obligations. The FCC is considering: (1) changing the basis upon which USF contributions are determined from a revenue percentage measurement, as well as increasing the breadth of the USF contribution base to include certain services now exempt from contribution; (2) the classification of MPLS; and (3) the classification of various IP-enabled services. Adoption of these proposals could have a material adverse effect on our costs of providing service. We are unable to predict the timing or outcome of these proceedings. We cannot predict the application and impact of changes to the federal or state USF contribution requirements on the communications industry generally and on certain of our business activities in particular. 
 We generally have to register to provide our telecommunications services in each country in which we do business. The foreign laws and regulations governing these services are often complex and subject to change with short or no notice. At times, the rigs or vessels on which our equipment is located and to which our services are provided will need to operate in a new location on short notice and we must quickly make regulatory provisions to provide our services in such countries. Failure to comply with any of the laws and regulations to which we are subject may result in various sanctions, including fines, loss of authorizations and denial of applications for new authorizations or for renewal of existing authorizations. 
 We must comply with export control laws and regulations, trade and economic sanction laws and regulations of the United States and other countries with respect to the export of telecommunications equipment and services. State and local regulation additionally apply to certain aspects of our business. We are also subject to various anti-corruption laws, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, that prohibit the offering or giving anything of value to government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or for gaining an unfair advantage. 
 Employees 
 As of December 31, 2017, we had approximately 503 full time employees consisting of 55 employees in sales and marketing, 77 employees in finance and administration, 360 employees in operations and technical support and 11 employees in management.

 Other Information 
 Corporate Structure and History 
 We were incorporated in Delaware on July 6, 2004. Our predecessor began operations in 2000 as RigNet Inc., a Texas corporation. In July 2004, our predecessor merged into us. The communications services we provide to the offshore drilling and production industry were established in 2001 by our predecessor, who established initial operations in the Asia Pacific region. We have since evolved into one of the leading global providers of remote communications services.

Our organic growth has also been complemented by several strategic acquisitions which have expanded our service offerings. 
 In January 2018, we entered into an agreement to purchase Intelie. Intelie is a real-time, predictive analytics company that combines an operational understanding with a machine learning approach. Intelie facilitates innovation via Intelie Pipes, a distributed query language with a complex event processor to aggregate and normalize real-time data from a myriad of data sources. This technology enables the Intelie LIVE platform to solve data integration, data quality, data governance and monitoring problems. Intelie LIVE is an operational intelligence platform that empowers clients to make timely, data-driven decisions in mission-critical real-time operations, including drilling, and longer-term, data-intensive projects, such as well planning. The acquisition will leverage Intelies unique capabilities and market position to distinguish and enhance our bundled communications services. Additionally, Intelies team of data scientists and software developers will accelerate our strategy to move up the technology stack, furthering the development of effective applications powered by data. The acquisition of Intelie is subject to certain customary closing conditions, including certain approvals of the Brazilian government. We expect to close the acquisition of Intelie in the first quarter of 2018. 
 In 2017, we acquired substantially all the assets of ESS, which expanded our product offering, added to our existing midstream SCADA customer portfolio, and strengthened our IoT market position. Additionally, in 2017, we acquired substantially all the assets of DTS, which enhanced our comprehensive communications and IT services to the onshore, offshore, and maritime industries, as well as disaster relief solutions to global corporate clients. Furthermore in 2017, we completed our acquisition of Cyphre, which expanded us into cybersecurity with advanced enterprise data protection leveraging BlackTIE hardware-based encryption. In 2016, with the acquisition of TECNOR, we expanded our services to include a wide array of equipment, voice and data services, satellite coverage and bandwidth options in Mexico serving military, government, maritime, oil and gas customers.
