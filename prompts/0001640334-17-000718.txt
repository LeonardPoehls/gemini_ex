Item 1. Business.
Overview
 
Since May 18, 2016, Love International Group, Inc. (formerly known as Quintec Corp.) (the "Company" or “we” or “us” or “our”) has shifted its business focus from developing and launching an online, cross-border e-commerce platform to promote and market worldwide premium specialties and other well-known branded products with highly comparable discount pricing to developing and launching an online platform to promote cheap airline tickets and hotels as well as developing and launching a "Do-It-Yourself" ("DIY") system for the Company's customers to put together a trip with exotic activities such as hunting, flying a plane, or even piloting a submarine.
Business Strategy
 
The Company is currently developing and launching the online platform to promote cheap airline tickets and hotels as well as developing and launching the DIY system. The Company anticipates the prices of the airline tickets and hotel rooms promoted on its online platform will be priced competitively, if not lower, than the marketplace as the Company plans on partnering with some of the airlines and big airline ticket wholesalers. As for the DIY system, the Company anticipates gaining market share based on the originality and specialty of the travel activities to be offered on the Company's online platform through local travel companies and/or travel specialists that the Company is going to partner with.
 
The Company does not yet have any operations and the development of its business is speculative. The Company will require additional financing, either through a stock offering, or standard or convertible debt. Until and unless the Company is able to secure adequate financing, its business development will be curtailed.
 
Service Offerings
 
Through our anticipated online travel service platform, we anticipate connecting consumers with travel service providers of cheap airline tickets and hotel rooms as well as original and special travel activities. The Company anticipates partnering with airlines and big airline ticket wholesalers as to providing cheap airline tickets and local travel companies and/or travel specialists as to providing original and special travel activities.
Marketing Plan
 
In the beginning, the Company anticipates targeting potential customers in mainland China and Hong Kong as to the promotion of airline tickets and hotel rooms. The airline tickets and hotel booking selections may be limited upon the launch of the Company's online platform. The Company anticipates focusing the DIY activities upon the launch of the online platform in Southeast Asia, Canada, United States and Australia.
Research and Development
 
Management plans to develop and launch an online platform to promote cheap airline tickets and hotels as well as develop and launch a "Do-It-Yourself" ("DIY") system for the Company's customers to put together a trip with exotic activities. 
Competition
 
We will compete with online and traditional providers of airline tickets and hotel rooms as well as operators of tourist activities. The markets for the provision of cheap airline tickets and hotel rooms and provision of tourist activities, are intensely competitive, a trend we expect to continue, and current and new competitors can launch new services at a relatively low cost. Some of our potential competitors, such as Priceline, Google, Alibaba, and Amazon, have access to significantly greater and more diversified resources than we do, and they may be able to leverage other aspects of their businesses (e.g., search or mobile device businesses) to enable them to compete more effectively with us. Potential competitors also include traditional travel agencies, travel management companies, wholesalers and tour operators, many of which combine physical locations, telephone services and online services. In addition, travel service providers, including airlines, hotel chains, and tourism operators with which we conduct business, compete with us in online channels to drive consumers to their own websites in lieu of third-party distributors such as us. Travel service providers may charge lower prices and, in some instances, offer advantages such as loyalty points or special discounts to members of closed user groups (such as loyalty program participants or customers with registered accounts), any of which could make their offerings more attractive to consumers than our services. Further, consolidation among travel service providers, could result in lower rates of commission paid to online travel companies, increased discounting and greater incentives for consumers to join closed user groups as such travel service providers expand their offerings.

Intellectual Property
 
At the present moment, the Company does not own any intellectual property.
 
Seasonality
 
We anticipate seasonal fluctuations in our net revenues and net income from our services once we commence operations. We anticipate increased revenues during summer months and holiday peak months due to increased leisure travel. The seasonality of our business may cause fluctuations in our quarterly operating results. As we expand into new markets and geographical locations, we may experience increased or different seasonality dynamics that create fluctuations in operating results.
Government Regulation
 
We must comply with laws and regulations applicable to online commerce. Increased regulation of the internet (“Internet”) or different applications of existing laws might slow the growth in the use of the Internet and commercial online services, which could decrease demand for our services, increase the cost of doing business or otherwise reduce our sales and revenues. The statutes and case law governing online commerce are still evolving, and new laws, regulations or judicial decisions may impose on us additional risks and costs of operations. In addition, new regulations, domestic or international, regarding the privacy of our users' personally identifiable information may impose on us additional costs and operational constraints.
Corporate History
 
The Company was incorporated on May 23, 2013 under the laws of the state of Nevada under the name Quintec Corp. At formation, the Company was authorized to issue 100,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per share.
 
The Company was originally formed to develop a way to make toy and trinket shopping more interactive and more fun. Prior to November 2015, when the Company underwent a change in control and a change in management, and the new management adopted a new business plan based on the development of an online, cross-border e-commerce platform for promotion and sales of foreign specialties and other discount branded products to worldwide customers, our primary mission was to develop and install 3D printing kiosks in shopping centers throughout Chile and eventually all of South America, which will allow customers to create 3D printed products on location, while they wait or shop for other items. The idea behind the technology was to allow customers to print toys and gifts at a low price, in a very interactive manner.
 
On August 13, 2013, we increased the number of authorized shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, from 100,000,000 to 150,000,000.
 
On November 11, 2015, a change in control of the Company occurred, whereby Walter Lee, the-then sole officer and director, sold 15,000,000 of his shares of common stock, representing 51.8% of the voting power of the issued and outstanding capital stock of the Company, in a private transaction to Yong Qiang Yang (8,250,000 shares) and Wei Min Jin (6,750,000 shares), who subsequently became officers and directors of the Company. Mr. Lee sold the remainder of his shares (5,000,000 shares) to other individuals in separate transactions not involving a public sale or distribution. After the sale of stock, Walter Lee had no further ownership of any voting securities of the Company.
 
On November 30, 2015, the Company accepted the resignation of Walter Lee from his positions as President, Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and member of the Board of Directors. The Board of Directors appointed Yong Qiang Yang as President of the Company, and as a member of the Board of Directors, and Wei Min Jin as Chief Financial Officer and Secretary of the Company and a member of the Board of Directors, effective November 30, 2015.

Emerging Growth Company and Smaller Reporting Company Status
 
Emerging Growth Company
 
We are an “emerging growth company” as defined in Section 2(a)(19) of the Securities Act, as modified by the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the “JOBS Act”). As such, we are eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not “emerging growth companies” including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the “Sarbanes-Oxley Act”), reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. We intend to take advantage of all of these exemptions.
 
In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an “emerging growth company” can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards, and delay compliance with new or revised accounting standards until those standards are applicable to private companies. We have elected to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period.
 
We could be an emerging growth company until the last day of the first fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of our first common equity offering, although circumstances could cause us to lose that status earlier if our annual revenues exceed $1.0 billion, if we issue more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt in any three-year period or if we become a “large accelerated filer” as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act.
 
Smaller Reporting Company
 
We also qualify as a “smaller reporting company” under Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act, which is defined as a company with a public equity float of less than $75 million. To the extent that we remain a smaller reporting company at such time as are no longer an emerging growth company, we will still have reduced disclosure requirements for our public filings, some of which are similar to those of an emerging growth company, including not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements.
