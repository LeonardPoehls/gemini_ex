Item 1. | Business

Overview
Maxwell was incorporated under the name Maxwell Laboratories, Inc. in 1965. The Company made an initial public offering of common stock on the NASDAQ Stock Market in 1983, and changed its name to Maxwell Technologies, Inc. in 1996. We are headquartered in San Diego, California, and have design, sales and manufacturing locations in the United States, Switzerland, Germany, China and South Korea. We develop, manufacture and market energy storage and power delivery products for transportation, industrial and other applications. We have three differentiated and unique businesses:

• | Dry Battery Electrode Technology: We have developed and transformed our patented, proprietary and fundamental dry electrode manufacturing technology that we have historically used to make ultracapacitors to create a breakthrough technology that can be applied to the manufacturing of batteries. Using this technology, we believe we can create significant performance and cost benefits as compared to today’s state of the art lithium-ion batteries. Our dry battery electrode technology has the potential to be a groundbreaking technology within the battery industry with a substantial market opportunity, particularly for use in electric vehicles.


• | Energy Storage: Our market leading ultracapacitor products are energy storage devices that possess a unique combination of high power density, extremely long operational life and the ability to charge and discharge very rapidly. Our ultracapacitor cells, multi-cell packs, modules and subsystems provide highly reliable energy storage and power delivery solutions for applications in multiple industries, including automotive, grid energy storage, wind, bus, industrial and truck. Our lithium-ion capacitors are energy storage devices with the power characteristics of an ultracapacitor combined with the enhanced energy storage capacity approaching that of a battery and are uniquely designed to address a variety of applications in the rail, grid, and industrial markets where energy density and weight are differentiating factors.


• | High-Voltage: Our CONDIS® high-voltage capacitors are designed and manufactured to perform reliably for decades in all climates. These products include grading and coupling capacitors, electric voltage transformers and metering products that are used to ensure the safety and reliability of electric utility infrastructure and other applications involving transport, distribution and measurement of high-voltage electrical energy.

Industry Trends
There are three fast approaching, disruptive megatrends which we believe will drive and create unique long-term growth opportunities in our industry. These megatrends include renewable power generation in the grid, electrification of combustion engine vehicles and the revolution of battery electric vehicles.

• | First, as costs for renewable power generation continue to decline and converge on those of traditional forms, renewable penetration on the grid is increasing at accelerated rates. This increasing penetration requires advanced energy storage and power delivery technologies for successful integration and to stabilize the grid as this modernization takes effect.


• | Second, as the use of premium features such as e-active suspension, autonomous driving and other power demanding applications continue to penetrate the automotive market, high power and rapid response energy storage and power delivery solutions are increasingly required to address the new technological challenges that these advanced features will create.


• | Third, as global emission policies continue to tighten and the cost for lithium-ion batteries continues to fall, the automotive industry is on the verge of an electric vehicle revolution, which we believe will fundamentally change the industry and how automobiles are made and used. Advanced lithium-ion battery performance and reduced costs are at the center of this fundamental change and we believe that innovation in this area could be a major factor in determining the winners and losers in the future of the highly competitive automotive industry.

In the global high-voltage market, a paradigm shift is occurring, particularly in the United States, China, and India, where a proliferation of projects to increase the availability of electrical energy as well as infrastructure modernization and renovation will likely continue to increase demand in the years to come. Additionally, consolidation and changes in market dynamics could generate new opportunities. As the substation becomes increasingly digitized, metering solutions, which protect and control energy flows into the electrical substation through optical fiber, are developing into an additional, new growth opportunity.

In recent years, we have also experienced a shift in customer demand from cells to sophisticated, complete subsystem solutions, which require increased intelligence and integration with existing networks, particularly in areas such as the automobile drive train and the energy grid. 
Strategy
Our primary corporate objective is to offer innovative products to our customers and to diversify our business which we expect will lead to increased revenue, further positioning the Company for accelerated, profitable growth to ultimately create value for our shareholders. In order to accomplish our primary objective, in 2015 we commenced with a series of initiatives with the goal to transform the business in line with our strategy. We started with the revitalization of our core, which included multiple organizational restructurings that had the effect of right sizing the business, putting the cost structure in line with the magnitude of revenue. Next, we ramped up our innovation engine, with the goal to provide innovative products at a faster rate to our customers and partners, and strengthened the management team. We continued with the optimization of our portfolio, which included the divestiture of our Microelectronics product line in 2016 and the acquisition of the core business and operating entities of Nesscap Energy, Inc. in 2017. Also in 2017, we significantly strengthened our balance sheet by raising $46 million in a convertible debt financing. Our strategy consists of three key objectives: 
Objective #1: Dry Battery Electrode
The first part of our strategy is focused on commercializing our dry battery electrode technology, which we believe is a unique and innovative technology with a potentially large market opportunity, particularly in electric vehicles. A significant megatrend is fast approaching in the automotive industry as global emission policies continue to tighten and the cost of lithium-ion batteries continues to fall. The shift towards hybrid and electric vehicles is accelerating and is likely to fundamentally change the industry, including how automobiles are made and used. Lithium-ion batteries are attracting substantial investment as auto makers drive toward lower cost electric vehicles with longer range between charges. We believe that improved lithium-ion batteries are the key enabling technology for vehicle electrification, and as such, cost reduction and performance improvement have become critical targets for the world’s leading lithium-ion battery manufacturers and automotive OEMs. We believe that our patent-protected, proprietary manufacturing process, which has been utilized through many years of ultracapacitor production, can be applied to the manufacturing of battery electrode without the use of solvents to produce a highly reliable electrode material with uniform characteristics resulting in enhanced product performance, long-term durability, and lower manufacturing cost. 
By applying our proprietary dry manufacturing process and trade secrets to the production of lithium-ion batteries, we believe that we can create significant performance and cost benefits when compared to today’s state of the art technology. In 2016, we signed a joint development agreement with a leading global automotive OEM and a global tier one automotive supplier on a proof-of-concept basis to validate dry battery electrode performance on a pilot scale. This program targeted a specific electric vehicle platform expected to be released in approximately 2022. We have materially completed this proof-of-concept, which we believe has demonstrated the significant performance and cost advantages of our dry electrode manufacturing process compared with wet electrode manufacturing, while providing the required consistency and reproducibility in manufacturing a pilot-scale dry electrode roll. 
As the trend toward battery electric vehicles continues to increase, efforts are accelerating in the automotive and energy storage industries to prepare for this coming demand. We believe that our dry battery electrode technology could be a central enabling technology for the battery electric vehicle market. We have experienced increasing interest from additional large, brand name, global players in the energy storage and automotive industries regarding future joint development and commercialization efforts and we are currently in discussions with potential partners regarding broader collaborations, with the ultimate goal of commercialization, which we believe could unlock significant value for our customers, partners and shareholders. Given the recent successes in the proof-of-concept and the increasing interest from global leaders from automotive and energy storage markets, we have begun to shift more investment towards the development of dry battery electrode technology. Moreover, in 2018 we intend to begin to build a state-of-the art pilot-scale manufacturing facility to further prove the benefits and manufacturability of this technology. In 2018, we also expect to be highly focused on attaining broader, scale-up agreements with our current and prospective partners that could accelerate the commercialization of this breakthrough technology.

Objective #2: Energy Storage
The second part of our strategy is to optimize our energy storage portfolio to drive business diversification, achieve scale, and to transition our business to higher growth opportunities in a large and growing $1.35 billion addressable market by 2022. Over the last year, we have made steady progress leveraging our core competencies and diversifying our ultracapacitor products as we transition to higher growth market opportunities in automotive, grid energy storage, rail and wind. Our cumulative design wins in our target markets have tripled over the last three years. In 2017, we acquired the core business and operating entities of Nesscap Energy, Inc. in order to drive customer diversification, achieve scale and position the business to win high growth opportunities. We combined Nesscap’s best-in-class small cell product portfolio with Maxwell’s leadership in large cell solutions to create the most complete portfolio available in the market for our customers. Through this acquisition, we have experienced increased demand for small and medium cells such that our manufacturing facility in South Korea was close to 100% utilization at the end of 2017. In response, we are investing to expand production capabilities in 2018. We are leveraging the talent of our newly combined R&D teams and plan to launch several new products in 2018 to meet the needs of our wind and small cell industrial customers. Additionally, with the factory expansion and the transitioning of customers to our now optimized portfolio, we expect to begin to capitalize on manufacturing synergies by increasing scale, which will lead to margin expansion. As we move into 2018, we believe that the progress we are making in energy storage has positioned us to intersect megatrends in renewable power generation and vehicle electrification, which we expect will accelerate our design in momentum as well as advance our strategy to deliver long-term value to our customers, partners and shareholders. Additionally, we have begun to expand our product portfolio by adding intelligent, application specific, standard subsystem products.
We believe that our automotive business, which has historically contributed a modest, but consistent revenue stream, has the largest growth potential. As features that demand increased and reliable electrical power grow with the proliferation of hybrid electric vehicles and the advent of autonomous driving, the need for high power and rapid response energy storage and power delivery solutions is becoming increasingly important. Automakers are evaluating new electrification strategies to meet the future CO2 emission standards in vehicles while increasing the level of performance and features. Several of these new technologies will likely be adopted in mild-hybrid vehicles where an electric motor assists the combustion engine, allowing it to turn off for longer periods of time while the car is coasting, as well as during short accelerations or braking. However, there are times when additional power is required, such as when stepping on the gas pedal to accelerate the vehicle, and the combustion engine must be powered back on. In this case, we believe that ultracapacitors fit in particularly well to provide the short-term burst of power needed to turn the combustion engine on while, in parallel, the electric motor is fueling the other power needs of the vehicle. As vehicle electrification continues to accelerate, we continue to see increased interest from key OEMs, especially in our newer, complete system solutions, and particularly for autonomous driving applications. We are encouraged by the continued ramp of eActive Suspension and Back-up and Peak Power applications. In particular, we now have 14 confirmed automotive design wins at various stages of progress and in several different applications including Start/Stop, eActive Suspension, eTurbo and Back-up Power for Autonomous Driving and expect to see an initial inflection point for our products begin to take shape in late 2018 with a positive impact to top line revenue in fiscal years 2019 and 2020. 
In the grid energy storage market, as costs for renewable power generation continue to fall and converge toward those of traditional forms, renewable penetration into the grid is increasing at accelerated rates. Efficient integration of renewable power sources into the existing grid requires advanced energy storage, stabilization, and power delivery technologies. We believe we are making excellent progress as we are experiencing increasing levels of engagement from customers and are moving rapidly from pilot projects to both large utility-scale as well as small to mid-scale commercial projects at the micro-grid level. Our first utility-scale power stabilization project with a leading global OEM has been confirmed and is set for deployment in the 2018 to 2019 timeframe. Additionally, the launch date of our new grid products, which include an open cell pack and a subsystem design, is planned in mid-2018. These products are configurable from sub-1 megawatt to hundreds of megawatts, directly addressing existing and growing power quality issues facing the grid infrastructure by delivering fast responding power for applications including voltage support, frequency response and renewables power smoothing for utilities, power generators, and commercial and industrial customers across the globe. Due to the high reliability and long life of ultracapacitors, our customers are also requesting these products as support systems to improve the performance and lifetime of batteries that are already installed in the grid. We have spent multiple years developing these products due to the complex nature and increased intelligence desired by our customers. Given the demands from the megatrend of renewables entry into the grid and our new product introductions, which directly address these demands, we have a growing number of project opportunities under development in the US, Europe, and Australia for applications both in front of and behind the meter and expect to see an inflection point for our products in this market beginning in 2019.

We believe the rail market is also poised for future growth, driven by a significant light rail infrastructure build-out in China to support continued urbanization. We have partnered with China Railway Rolling Rock Corporation, or CRRC-SRI, in China to develop lithium-ion capacitor based light rail on-board systems and expect to transition from the current pilot scale production to full-scale commercial manufacturing at CRRC-SRI in late 2018. We are also investing in the advancement of our Generation 2 lithium-ion capacitor technology development and are on track to meet program milestones in 2018, including improvement in low temperature capability, lower resistance and increased energy density. We expect that the grid and rail markets could become more significant contributors to our revenue growth in the coming years.
The wind market in China continues to be a significant revenue contributor to Maxwell with growth opportunities coming from the ongoing development of offshore wind resources in China and the deployment of our new wind pitch retrofit systems for existing commercial wind farms in North America and Europe. Our retrofit modules are designed to replace existing battery-based emergency pitch control systems for reliable and fail-safe performance, and can considerably reduce the cost of ownership for operating wind energy. Already in several pilots with commercial wind farms, we see evidence of considerably increased reliability and life as well as a lower cost of ownership for operating turbines, and we expect deployment of retrofit modules to begin to ramp into commercial wind farms in 2018. Overall, we believe Maxwell is well positioned in the wind market and we anticipate the market to moderately grow in the future. 
Over the past year, demand for our ultracapacitors in the China hybrid bus market significantly decreased due to changes in the government subsidy program as well a requirement to localize product manufacturing. To reduce our dependency on China government influences, we established a localized manufacturing partnership with CRRC-SRI, thus positioning the Company for future revenue opportunities. 
We are constantly working on improving technical performance of our products, such as higher temperature capability, higher voltage levels and higher power density as well as increasing reliability and ruggedness of our products for an extended application lifetime. We are increasing our focus on developing entire system solutions and supporting rapid product implementations in emerging markets and applications. We expect this could lead to higher gross margin opportunities. In order to develop new, innovative solutions and accelerate time-to-market for these solutions, we are focused on developing these capabilities ourselves and on establishing technical and commercial relationships with value-added partners within our target market segments and applications, including value-added distributors, solution level integrators and tier-one suppliers.
Objective #3: High-Voltage
The third part of our strategy is to maintain and expand our leadership position and market share for our high-voltage product line, which provides the opportunity for steady long-term growth in a $150 million addressable market by 2022. Our strategy is to intersect a paradigm shift happening now in the global high-voltage market, particularly in the United States, China, and India, where we believe projects to increase the availability of electrical energy as well as infrastructure modernization and renovation may continue to increase demand for our high-voltage direct-current products and solutions in the years to come. Additionally, we believe that consolidation and changes in market dynamics will generate new opportunities. As the substation becomes increasingly digitized, metering solutions, which protect and control energy flows into the electrical substation through optical fiber, are developing into a new opportunity where we anticipate growth. Leveraging our market leadership, we intend to grow revenue over the next five years by capitalizing on new products that we introduced which offer a technological advantage for our customers. In the coming year, our top focus areas include the design in of our Ultra High-Voltage DC circuit breaker solutions, partnering with leading global OEMs, to address new electrical networks worldwide, the proliferation of our metering solutions and to maximize the market share for our high tech capacitor designs, which provide a technology leading solution as compared to existing ceramic capacitors. Factory capacity constraints have limited our revenue potential for high-voltage products to about $50 million annually, and thus to meet growing demand, we embarked on a factory expansion in 2017 that will enable an increased revenue potential. We expect the factory expansion will be completed in late 2018.

General Product Line and Technology Overview
Dry Battery Electrode Technology
Our dry battery electrode technology leverages our core dry electrode process technology currently used to manufacture ultracapacitors. This unique electrode manufacturing process expands our core technology into batteries of varying chemistry with value-added performance features over wet-coated electrode technology at a reduced production cost. The performance differentiators afforded by dry coating technology are higher energy density, longer operating lifetime, high temperature operating robustness and higher charge/discharge rate capability. As a solvent-less process technology, dry electrode manufacturing is less costly and much more environmentally friendly. We believe that the investment in manufacturing equipment for dry processing is significantly less than wet coating technology, with much lower energy consumption as there is no need to use, remove and recapture solvent from electrode during fabrication. In addition to offering benefits over today’s battery chemistries, dry process technology enables electrode production using high energy density, liquid sensitive materials that are more encumbered by wet coating processes. 
Energy Storage
Our energy storage products consist primarily of ultracapacitors. Ultracapacitors enhance the efficiency and reliability of devices or systems that generate or consume electrical energy. They differ from other energy storage and power delivery products by combining rapid charge/discharge capabilities typically associated with film and electrolytic capacitors with energy storage capacity generally associated with batteries. Although batteries store significantly more electrochemical energy than ultracapacitors, they cannot charge and discharge as rapidly and efficiently as ultracapacitors. Conversely, although electrolytic capacitors can deliver bursts of high power very rapidly, they have limited energy storage capacity, and therefore cannot sustain power delivery as long as ultracapacitors. Also, unlike batteries, which store energy by means of a chemical reaction and experience gradual depletion of their energy storage and power delivery capability over hundreds to a few thousand charge/discharge cycles, ultracapacitors’ energy storage and power delivery mechanisms involve minimal chemical reactions, so they can be charged and discharged hundreds of thousands to millions of times in typical operating environments with negligible performance degradation. This ability to store energy, deliver bursts of power and perform reliably for many years, with little or no maintenance, makes ultracapacitors an attractive and efficient energy storage option for a wide range of energy-consuming and generating devices and applications.
The core of our technology for the majority of our ultracapacitor products is a proprietary, solvent-free or dry, electrode manufacturing process. This high throughput roll-to-roll process produces high-reliability electrode material with uniform thickness resulting in enhanced product performance and long-term durability. The process enables a favorable cost position versus competitors. As part of our offerings, we market our dry processed electrode material to other ultracapacitor manufacturers. We have licensed our proprietary cell architecture to manufacturers in China, Taiwan and Korea to expand and accelerate acceptance of ultracapacitor products in large and rapidly growing global markets. In addition to our dry electrode process technology, in 2017, we broadened our technology base and product portfolio through our acquisition of a Korea-based manufacturer specializing in small cell technology utilizing a wet electrode manufacturing process. 
Complementary to our ultracapacitor products, lithium-ion capacitors are energy storage devices, which due to their unique materials and design, have more than three times the energy density, similar power density, and a similarly long cycle life compared with ultracapacitors, as well as very low self-discharge similar to lithium-ion batteries. 
High-Voltage Capacitors
High-voltage grading and coupling capacitors and electronic voltage transformers are used mainly in the electric utility industry. Grading and coupling capacitors are key components of circuit breakers that prevent high-voltage arcing that can damage switches, step-down transformers and other equipment that transmits or distributes high-voltage electrical energy within electricity network infrastructure and also within high-voltage laboratories. Electronic voltage transformers measure voltage and power levels within electric utility infrastructure. The market for these products consists of expansion, upgrades and maintenance of existing infrastructure and new infrastructure installations in developing countries. Such initiatives are capital-intensive and frequently are subject to regulation, availability of government funding and prevailing economic conditions. 
Products and Applications
Our products incorporate our know-how and proprietary energy storage and power delivery technologies at both the component and system levels for specialized, high-value applications that demand “life-of-the-application” reliability.

Dry Battery Electrode
The critical and performance governing components in a given battery are the electrodes. Battery devices are comprised of at least two electrodes, a negative electrode paired with a positive electrode, interposed by an ionically conductive film in between the electrochemical couple and filled with electrolyte in a sealed package. The incumbent wet electrode coating technology is limited by at least one of the following values: cost, electrode architecture, material platform and safety. Solvent used in wet coated electrode manufacturing imparts higher system cost, limits specific energy of the electrode due to thickness barrier, limits liquid sensitive battery material usage and is inherently toxic. As such, our dry battery electrode process technology, a solvent-free manufacturing method, is expected to deliver all the noted values since no solvent and/or liquid is required. Value-added benefits include reduction in system cost by simplifying electrode production, enablement of broad-range material use, flexibility in electrode architecture for high specific energy design and accommodation of eco-friendly manufacturing. Our patent portfolio extends to certain of these technologies. Our dry electrode process technology can be used to produce batteries for consumer electronics, healthcare products, industrial goods, grid energy storage systems and automotive applications, which comprise an enormous market potential. In applications that demand high energy density and long runtime, our dry electrode is advantageously positioned as we can furnish electrode architectures that are unmatched by today’s product offering in an economical and socially responsible fashion. The dry electrode can be further applied to advanced battery chemistries, offering well over 300 Wh/kg at the cell level.
Energy Storage
Ultracapacitors, also known as electrochemical double-layer capacitors (“EDLC”) or supercapacitors, store energy electrostatically. Although ultracapacitors are electrochemical devices, minimal chemical reactions are involved in their energy storage mechanism. Their electrostatic energy storage mechanism is fully reversible, allowing ultracapacitors to be rapidly charged and discharged hundreds of thousands to millions of times with minimal performance degradation.
Compared with batteries, which require minutes or hours to fully charge or discharge, ultracapacitors discharge and recharge in as little as fractions of a second. Although ultracapacitors store only about five to ten percent as much electrical energy as a battery of comparable size, they can deliver or absorb electric energy up to 100 times more rapidly than batteries. Because they operate reliably through hundreds of thousands to millions of charge cycles, compared with only hundreds to a few thousand equivalent cycles for batteries, ultracapacitors have significantly higher lifetime energy throughput, which equates to significantly lower cost on a life cycle basis. Our ultracapacitor products have significant advantages over batteries, including:

• | the ability to charge and discharge up to 100 times faster;


• | significantly lower weight per unit of power delivery;


• | higher charge/discharge turnaround efficiency, minimizing energy loss;


• | the ability to operate reliably and continuously in extreme temperatures (-40º C to +65º C);


• | minimal to no maintenance requirements;


• | “life of the application” durability; and


• | minimal environmental issues associated with disposal because they contain no heavy metals.

With no moving parts and negligible chemical reactions involved in their energy storage mechanism, ultracapacitors provide a simple and highly reliable solution to buffer short-term mismatches between power available and power required. Additionally, ultracapacitors offer the advantage of storing energy in the same form in which it is used, as electricity.
Maxwell offers ultracapacitor cells with capacitances ranging from 1 to 3,400 farads. We link our ultracapacitor cells together in multi-cell modules and subsystems to satisfy energy storage and power delivery requirements of specific applications. Applications include peak power assistance and back-up power of mission critical functions in vehicles, stabilization of the grid with incremental use of solar and wind energy, and highly reliable, maintenance-free, energy storage for various types of industrial installations and heavy transportation. 
7

In many applications, power demand varies widely from moment to moment, and peak power demand typically is much greater than the average power requirement. For example, automobiles require 10 times more power to accelerate than to maintain a constant speed, and forklifts require more power to lift a heavy pallet of material than to move from place to place within a warehouse. Engineers historically have addressed transient peak power requirements by over-sizing the engine, battery or other primary energy source to satisfy all of a system’s power demands, including demands that occur infrequently and may last only fractions of a second. Sizing a primary power source to meet brief peak power requirements, rather than for average power requirements, is costly and inefficient. When a primary energy source is coupled with ultracapacitors, which can deliver or absorb brief bursts of high power on demand for periods of time ranging from fractions of a second to several minutes, the primary energy source can be smaller, lighter and less expensive.
To facilitate the adoption of ultracapacitor subsystems, we have developed integration technologies, including proprietary hardware and software solutions supported by robust mechanical designs, with a dedicated team of employee experts who are capable of translating complex customer requirements into application specific standard products. We hold patents for certain of these technologies. Our subsystem products incorporate a range from 6 to 60 of our ultracapacitor cells to provide “plug and play” solutions for applications requiring from 12 to 160 volts, and can intelligently interface with a host controller to enhance the overall performance, reliability and safety of the system. 
High-Voltage Capacitors
Electric utility infrastructure includes switches, circuit breakers, step-down transformers, overvoltage protection devices and measurement instruments that transmit, distribute and measure high-voltage electrical energy. High-voltage capacitors are used to measure the voltage or to increase the ampere interrupting capacity of the circuit breaker. With operational lifetimes measured in decades, these applications require high reliability and durability.
Under our CONDIS® line of high-voltage capacitor products, Maxwell has more than 100 years of experience in this industry, and is the world’s largest producer of such products for use in utility infrastructure. Engineers with specific expertise in high-voltage systems develop, design and test our high-voltage capacitor products in our development and production facility in Rossens, Switzerland. Our high-voltage capacitors are produced through a proprietary assembly and automated winding and drying process to ensure consistent quality and reliability. We are continuously upgrading and expanding our high-voltage capacitor production facility and high-end laboratory which has resulted in a doubling of our output capacity and significant shortening order-to-delivery intervals.
We sell our high-voltage capacitor products to large systems integrators, which install and service power plants and electrical utility infrastructure worldwide.
Manufacturing
Our internal manufacturing operations are conducted in production facilities located in Peoria, Arizona; Rossens, Switzerland and Yongin, South Korea. We have made substantial capital investments to expand our internal production facilities and incorporate mechanization and automation techniques and processes. We have trained our manufacturing personnel in advanced operational techniques, added information technology infrastructure and implemented new business processes and systems to increase our manufacturing capacity and improve efficiency, planning and product quality. Our dry-processed ultracapacitor electrode material is currently produced exclusively at our Peoria facility and our wet-processed ultracapacitor electrode material is produced exclusively at our Korean facility. We outsource the assembly of our 60 mm diameter large cell ultracapacitors, and subsequently, assembly of large cell-based multi-cell modules as well as assembly of our mid-size D-cell ultracapacitor products and D-cell-based multi-cell modules to contract manufacturers based in China. Considering our plans to expand our manufacturing facility for certain product lines as further described below, we believe that we have sufficient capacity to meet near-term demand for all of our product lines.
Energy Storage
We produce our dry-processed electrode material for our own ultracapacitor products, and for sale to other ultracapacitor manufacturers such as Yeong-Long Technologies Co., Ltd. (“YEC”) at our Peoria facility. In 2013, we completed a major electrode capacity expansion in our Peoria facility. This facility gives us sufficient capacity to support both our current ultracapacitor production requirements and external electrode demand in the near term. As demand increases, additional increments of electrode production capacity can be added within a year through the utilization of established equipment vendors. Additionally, in our South Korea manufacturing facility, we produce wet-processed ultracapacitor electrode material and assemble this material into small and medium cell ultracapacitors; we plan to make investments in 2018 to expand the capacity of this plant in order to meet projected demand for these products.
As noted above, we have outsourced assembly of all other cell types and multi-cell modules to contract manufacturers in Asia. 
8

To increase reliability, reduce cost, simplify assembly and facilitate automation, we have designed our ultracapacitor products to incorporate lower-cost materials and to reduce both the number of parts in a finished cell and the number of manufacturing process steps required to produce them. We intend to continue using outsourced cell and module assembly in countries with cost-efficient value-added services, but plan to continue to produce our proprietary electrode material only in internal production facilities to ensure the continued protection of our intellectual property.
High-Voltage Capacitors
We produce our high-voltage grading and coupling capacitors and electronic voltage transformers in our Rossens, Switzerland facility. In 2018, we plan to make investments to expand the capacity of this plant in order to meet projected demand for our high-voltage capacitor products.
We believe we are the only high-voltage capacitor producer that manufactures its products with stacking, assembly and automated winding processes. This enables us to produce consistent, high quality and highly reliable products, and gives us sufficient capacity to satisfy anticipated global customer demand. We operate the assembly portion of the manufacturing process using a “just-in-time” design, allowing us to increase production capacity without adding direct labor, and significantly shortening order-to-delivery intervals. 
Suppliers
We generally purchase components and materials, such as carbon powder, certain electronic components, dielectric materials, and ceramic insulators from a variety of suppliers. For certain products, we rely on a limited number of suppliers or a single supplier for a number of reasons, including notably, the cost-effectiveness of doing business with a single supplier. Although we believe there are alternative sources for some of the components and materials that we currently obtain from a single source, there can be no assurance that we will be able to identify and qualify alternative suppliers in a timely and cost-effective manner. Therefore, for certain critical components, we utilize mitigation strategies such as, for example, maintaining an inventory of safety stock on site at our respective manufacturing locations in an effort to minimize the impact of an unforeseen disruption in supply from these outside parties.
Marketing and Sales
We market and sell our products worldwide through both direct and indirect sales channels for incorporation by integrators and OEM customers into a wide range of end products. Because the introduction of products based on emerging technologies requires customer acceptance of new and unfamiliar technical approaches, and because many OEM customers have rigorous vendor qualification processes, the design-in process and initial sale of our products often take months or even years.
Our principal marketing strategy is to identify applications for which our products and technology offer a compelling value proposition, to become a preferred vendor on the basis of service, value and price, and to negotiate supply agreements that enable us to establish long-term relationships with key OEM and integrator customers. To optimize our go-to-market strategy and tailor our products to end-user application, we organized our marketing team into two specialized ultracapacitor product line teams. One team supports Automotive and Transportation market segments which require highly rugged and robust products with very stringent automotive qualification requirements and solid change management. The other team supports all Green Infrastructure applications such as grid energy storage, wind power and other more stationary applications that require very cost sensitive products with very high service lifetimes and often very complex systems solutions. Our marketing efforts strive to develop application-specific product portfolios and solutions for our Automotive & Transportation and Green Infrastructure market segments. As these design-in sales tend to be technical and engineering-intensive, we organize market-specific teams composed of sales, applications engineering and other technical and operational personnel to work closely with our customers across multiple disciplines to satisfy their requirements for form, fit, function and environmental needs. As time-to-market often is a primary motivation for our customers to use our products, the initial sale and design-in process typically evolve into ongoing account management to ensure on-time delivery, responsive technical support and value-added problem-solving.
We design and conduct discrete marketing programs intended to position and promote each of our product lines. These include trade shows, seminars, advertising, product publicity, distribution of product literature, internet websites and social media. We utilize marketing communications specialists to develop and implement our marketing programs, design and develop marketing materials, negotiate advertising media purchases, write and place product press releases and manage our marketing websites.
We also have an alliance with YEC to assemble and market small cell ultracapacitor products. In addition, we sell electrode material to YEC, both for Maxwell-branded products and for incorporation into YEC’s own ultracapacitor products.

Competition
Each of our product lines has competitors, some of whom have longer operating histories. In some of the target markets for our emerging technologies, we face competition both from products utilizing well-established, existing technologies and other novel or emerging technologies.
Dry Battery Electrode
We have focused our efforts around applying dry battery electrode technology to the production of lithium-ion batteries, which we believe can create significant performance and cost benefits when compared to today’s state of the art lithium-ion batteries that are produced using wet process technology. Our dry battery electrode technology has two types of competitors: current producers of lithium-ion batteries that use wet process technology, which are the standard today in the electric vehicle market, and companies developing new, alternative technologies or processes that could gain broad market acceptance. 
Energy Storage
Our ultracapacitor products have two types of competitors: other ultracapacitor suppliers and purveyors of energy storage and power delivery solutions based on batteries or other technologies. Although a number of companies are developing ultracapacitor products and technology, our principal competitors in the supply of ultracapacitor or supercapacitor products are Panasonic, a division of Matsushita Electric Industrial Co., Ltd., LS Mtron, a unit of LS Cable, Supreme Power Solutions Co., Ltd., Vina Technology Company, Ltd., Samxon, a unit of Man Yue Technology Holdings, Ltd., Skeleton Technologies, Yunasko, Ltd., and Ioxus, Inc. The key competitive factors in the ultracapacitor industry are price, performance (energy stored and power delivered per unit volume), durability and reliability, operational lifetime and overall breadth of product offerings. We believe that our ultracapacitor products and electrode material compete favorably with respect to these competitive factors. However, pricing expectations and competition in certain markets, such as auto and wind, places significant pressure on our pricing and margins for our products, and we are continually pursing opportunities to reduce the cost of our product in order to improve our competitive position and product margins. Specifically, the hybrid transit vehicle market for ultracapacitors in China, a region which has historically represented a significant portion of our sales, has become more competitive with respect to pricing and volume requirements due to changes in government subsidy programs which appear to favor battery based energy storage solutions and also place a requirement for local product manufacturing. We performed a very thorough analysis of the current market landscape and decided to very selectively target opportunities in this market in the short-term. At the same time, our partner in China, CRRC-SRI, has completed localization requirements for the manufacturing of our ultracapacitor-based modules, and we are positioned to support customer demand for any opportunities that may meet our minimum return requirements. 
Ultracapacitors also compete with products based on other technologies, including advanced batteries in power quality and peak power applications, as well as with flywheels, thermal storage and batteries in backup energy storage applications. We believe that the durability, long life, performance and value of ultracapacitors gives them a competitive advantage over these alternative choices in many applications. In addition, integration of ultracapacitors with some of these competing products may provide optimized solutions that neither product can provide by itself. For example, tier 1 auto parts supplier Continental AG designed a combined solution incorporating ultracapacitors with a battery for engine starting in a start-stop-idle elimination system for “micro hybrid” autos which was introduced in 2010 and installed in approximately two million cars by French automaker PSA Peugeot Citroen and was more recently introduced by General Motors for several models under the Cadillac brand.
High-Voltage Capacitors
Maxwell’s CONDIS® line of high-voltage capacitor products, is the world’s largest producer of high-voltage capacitors for use in electric utility infrastructure. Our principal competitors in the high-voltage capacitor markets are in-house production groups of certain of our customers and other independent manufacturers, such as the Coil Product Division of Trench Limited in Canada and Europe. We believe that we compete favorably, both as a consistent supplier of highly reliable high-voltage capacitors, and in terms of our expertise in high-voltage systems design. Over the last ten years, our largest customer has transitioned from producing its grading and coupling capacitors internally to outsourcing substantially all of its requirements to us.

Research and Development
We maintain active research and development programs to improve existing products and to develop new products. For the year ended December 31, 2017, our research and development expenditures totaled approximately $18.4 million, compared with $20.9 million and $24.7 million in the years ended December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. In general, we focus our research and product development activities on:

• | designing and producing products that perform reliably for the life of the application or systems into which they are integrated;


• | designing efficient manufacturing with low scrap rates to achieve improved profit margins and to enable us to reduce prices to allow our products to penetrate new and price-sensitive applications;


• | designing our products to have superior technical performance;


• | designing our products to be compact and light;


• | designing new products that provide novel solutions to expand our market opportunities; and


• | designing new products that convert customer requirements into fully integrated system solutions with built-in intelligence and interface capabilities.

Our current research, development and engineering activities are focused on:

• | electrode fabrication and material science, including activated carbon, electrolyte, electrically conductive materials, dielectric materials and ceramics to reduce cost and improve performance, reliability and ease of manufacturing;


• | product design and manufacturing processes for high-volume manufacturing; and


• | development of integration technologies, including proprietary hardware and software solutions and robust mechanical designs, that are incorporated into complete “plug and play” system solutions.

Dry Battery Electrode
The principal focus for our dry battery electrode development efforts is to demonstrate the applicability of our high volume, low cost dry electrode fabrication process as it relates to state of the art lithium-ion battery electrode materials. Upon demonstration of this process in large scale, it is expected that our dry electrodes will deliver performance and cost advantages when compared to state of the art lithium-ion battery technology. 
Energy Storage
The principal focus of our ultracapacitor development activities is to increase power and energy density, reduce internal resistance, extend operational life, reduce manufacturing cost and increase integration with host applications. Our ultracapacitor designs focus on low-cost, high-capacity cells in standard sizes ranging from 1 to 3,400 farads, multi-cell modules based on various form factors and complete subsystem solutions using proprietary hardware, software and mechanical designs. Our system designs may be specific to a single customer or be intended for more general use by a variety of customers.
High-Voltage Capacitors
The principal focus of our high-voltage capacitor development efforts is to enhance performance and reliability while reducing the size, weight and manufacturing cost of our products. We also are directing our design efforts to develop high-voltage capacitors and dividers for additional applications and solutions.
Intellectual Property
We place a strong emphasis on inventing, protecting and exploiting proprietary technologies, processes and designs which bring intrinsic value and uniqueness to our product portfolio. We place a high priority on obtaining patents to provide the broadest and strongest possible protection for our products, technologies and other strategic initiatives. Our continued success will depend in part on our ability to protect our existing patents and to secure patent protection on developing technologies. As of December 31, 2017, we held 93 issued U.S. patents and 20 published pending U.S. patent applications which relate to our core technologies, processes and designs. Of these issued patents, 86 relate to our dry battery electrode and ultracapacitor products and technology and 7 relate to our high-voltage capacitor products and technology. 
Our pending and any future patent applications may not survive the challenges of patent prosecution in the jurisdictions in which we file throughout the world; however, our strategy is to focus on countries generating revenue as well as markets which we deem key to our business strategies and objectives. We routinely seek patent protection in the United States and the principal countries of Europe and Asia. At present, we do not rely on licenses from any third parties to produce our products.
11

Our existing patent portfolios and pending patent applications relate primarily to:
Dry Battery Electrode

• | compositions of the electrode, including its formulation, design and fabrication techniques; and


• | materials science associated with raw material components.

Energy Storage

• | compositions of the electrode, including its formulation, design and fabrication techniques;


• | materials science associated with raw material components;


• | physical cell package designs as well as the affiliated processes used in cell assembly;


• | cell-to-cell and module-to-module interconnect technologies that minimize equivalent series resistance and enhance the functionality, performance and longevity of ultracapacitor products including system level electronics; and


• | module and system designs that facilitate applications of ultracapacitor technology.

High-Voltage Capacitors

• | physical cell package designs as well as the affiliated processes used in cell assembly;


• | component selection to enable compliance with environmental regulations with minimal sacrifice to product performance; and


• | manufacture of capacitors in a manner which significantly reduces exposure of internal components to impurities, moisture and other undesirable materials in an effort to avoid longer manufacturing times and reduced performance characteristics without these technological advancements.

Historically, our high-voltage capacitor products have been based on our know-how and trade secrets rather than on patents. We filed our first patent application covering our high-voltage capacitor technology in 2003, and we continue to pursue patent protection in addition to trade secret protection of certain aspects of our products’ design and production.
While our primary strategy for protecting our proprietary technologies, processes and designs is related to obtaining patents, we also apply for trademark registrations which identify us as the source of the products. Additionally, we promote our technologies, processes and designs in association with these registered trademarks to further distinguish our products from those of our competitors. As of December 31, 2017, we had seven formal trademark registrations within the U.S.
Establishing and protecting proprietary products and technologies is a key element of our corporate strategy. Although we attempt to protect our intellectual property rights through patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets and other measures, there can be no assurance that these steps will be adequate to prevent infringement, misappropriation or another misuse by third parties, or will be adequate under the laws of some foreign countries, which may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the U.S.
We use employee and third-party confidentiality and nondisclosure agreements to protect our trade secrets and unpatented know-how. We require each of our employees to enter into a proprietary rights and nondisclosure agreement in which the employee agrees to maintain the confidentiality of all our proprietary information and, subject to certain exceptions, to assign to us all rights in any proprietary information or technology made or contributed by the employee during his or her employment with us. In addition, we regularly enter into nondisclosure agreements with third parties, such as potential product development partners and customers, to protect any information disclosed in the pursuit of securing possible fruitful business endeavors.

Risks Attendant to Foreign Operations and Dependence
We have substantial operations in Switzerland and South Korea, and we derive a significant portion of our revenue from sales to customers located outside the U.S. We expect our international sales to continue to represent a significant amount of our future revenue. As a result, our business will continue to be subject to certain risks, such as those imposed by domestic laws and regulations related to topics such as export controls and interactions with foreign officials as well as foreign government regulations, including, notably, changes in tax laws, tax treaties, tariffs and freight rates. To the extent that we are unable to respond effectively to political, economic and other conditions in the countries where we operate and do business, our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. Some of our business partners also have international operations and are subject to the risks described above. Even if we are able to successfully manage the risks of international operations, our business may be adversely affected if our business partners are not able to successfully manage these risks as well.
13

Having substantial international operations also increases the complexity of managing our financial reporting and internal controls and procedures. Additionally, as a result of our extensive international operations and significant revenue generated outside the U.S., the dollar amount of our current and future revenue, expenses and debt may be materially affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Similarly, assets and liabilities of our Swiss and South Korean subsidiaries that are not denominated in their functional currencies are subject to effects of currency fluctuations, which may affect our reported earnings. Also, changes in the mix of income from our domestic and foreign operations, expiration of tax holidays and changes in tax laws and regulations could increase our tax expense. If we are unable to manage these risks effectively, it could impair our ability to achieve our targets for revenue and profitability.
As a result of our status as a publicly traded company within the U.S., we are subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”), which prohibits companies from making improper payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Additionally, as a result of our international operations, we could also be subject to the anti-bribery laws of other jurisdictions which vary slightly from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and may be different than the FCPA. If we fail to comply with anti-bribery laws and regulations, we could be subject to civil and/or criminal penalties as well as expenses related to any internal investigation. 
Backlog
Product backlog as of December 31, 2017 was approximately $21.4 million, compared with $26.1 million as of December 31, 2016. Backlog consists of firm orders for products that will be delivered within 12 months. The actual amount of backlog at any particular time may not be a meaningful indicator of future business prospects as this amount is impacted by a number of factors including potential cancellations of orders by our customers.
Significant Customers
One customer, ABB Ltd., accounted for 12% of total revenue in 2017. No customers accounted for 10% or more of total revenue in the year ended December 31, 2016. One customer, Shenzhen Xinlikang Supply China Management Co. Ltd., accounted for 19% of total revenue in 2015.
Government Regulation
Due to the nature of our operations, including, notably, the use of hazardous substances in some of our manufacturing and research and development activities, we are subject to stringent federal, state and local laws, rules, regulations and policies governing workplace safety and environmental protection. These include the use, generation, manufacture, storage, air emission, effluent discharge, handling and disposal of certain materials and wastes. In the course of our historical operations, materials or wastes may have spilled or been released from properties owned or leased by us or on or under other locations where these materials and wastes have been taken for disposal. These properties and the materials and wastes spilled, released, or disposed thereon are subject to environmental laws which may impose strict liability, without regard to fault of the original conduct, for remediation of contamination resulting from such releases. Under such laws and regulations, we could be required to remediate previously spilled, released, or disposed substances or wastes, or to make capital improvements to prevent future contamination. Failure to comply with such laws and regulations also could result in the assessment of substantial administrative, civil and criminal penalties and even the issuance of injunctions restricting or prohibiting our activities. It is also possible that implementation of stricter environmental laws and regulations in the future could result in additional costs or liabilities to us as well as the industry in general. While we believe we are in substantial compliance with existing environmental laws and regulations, we cannot be certain that we will not incur substantial costs in the future related to unknown liabilities.
Employees
As of December 31, 2017, we had 461 employees in five countries, as follows: 197 full-time, 1 part-time and 1 temporary employees in the U.S.; 136 full-time employees in South Korea; 84 full-time, 8 part-time and 1 temporary employees in Switzerland; 22 full-time employees in China; and 11 full-time employees in Germany. We are unable to estimate the percent of our Swiss employees that are members of a labor union, as Swiss law prohibits employers from inquiring into the union status of employees. We consider our relations with our employees to be amicable.
