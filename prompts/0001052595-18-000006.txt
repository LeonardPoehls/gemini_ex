All our properties strive to highlight friendly service and reflect the local flair of their markets. The upscale and midscale RLH Corporation brands of Hotel RL, Red Lion Hotel and Red Lion Inn & Suites offer a unique local spin on the expected travel experience in an environment that allows customers to feel welcome and at home. Our focus is to anticipate guest needs and pleasantly surprise them with our distinctive Pacific Northwest-inspired customer service. Warm and authentic, our commitment to customer service includes a focus on delivering the guest locally inspired, friendly and personalized signature moments. This is intended to position each RLH Corporation brand hotel as an advocate to our traveling guests, creating brand relevance and loyalty, differentiating us from our competition.
Hotel RL, our upscale lifestyle brand launched in October 2014, is a full-service, conversion brand that is targeted for the top 80 U.S. urban markets inspired by the spirit of the Pacific Northwest and designed for consumers with a millennial mindset. There are seven hotels currently open in the Hotel RL brand and five more expected to open in 2018 and 2019. The currently open hotels are located in Baltimore Inner Harbor, Maryland; Washington DC; Olympia and Spokane, Washington; Salt Lake City, Utah; Brooklyn, New York and New Orleans, Louisiana.
Our economy brands are focused on delivering our guests a consistent experience with exceptional comfort, quality and service at an affordable rate, with approximately 1,000 locations in 46 states and three countries outside the United States.
A summary of our properties as of December 31, 2017, including the approximate number of available rooms, is provided below:

(1) Terminated properties include locations at which we ended our franchise relationship because the hotels did not meet RLH Corporation's hotel standards. We are focused on maintaining a set of brand standards at all of our locations.

On October 5, 2017 our Board of Directors approved a process to market and sell 11 of our 14 hotel ownership positions maintained in joint venture arrangements. It is our intention, subject to market conditions to sell all of our hotel ownership positions in the next few years so that we can focus on our hotel franchise business which is less capital intensive and generates higher profit margins than the hotel ownership business.
On October 3, 2017, we completed the sale of certain specified liabilities and substantially all of the assets of our entertainment segment, previously composed of WestCoast Entertainment and TicketsWest, including ticketing agreements and engagement agreements with various entertainment venues, teams and artists located throughout the Western United States. As such, the results of the entertainment segment are reported as discontinued operations, and the assets and liabilities are classified as held for sale as of December 31, 2016 in this annual report on Form 10-K. The loss on sale of the entertainment segment included in the 2017 financial statements was $0.2 million, net of tax. See Item 8, Notes 17 and 18 for discussion of Discontinued Operations and Assets and Liabilities Held for Sale associated with the transaction.
Operations 
We operate in two reportable segments: 

• | The company operated hotel segment derives revenues primarily from guest room rentals and food and beverage offerings at owned and leased hotels for which we consolidate results. Revenues are also derived from management fees and related charges for hotels with which we contract to perform management services.


• | The franchised hotels segment is engaged primarily in licensing our brands to franchisees. This segment generates revenue from franchise fees that are based on a percentage of room revenue or room count and are charged to hotel owners in exchange for the use of our brand and access to our central services programs. These programs include our reservation system, guest loyalty program, national and regional sales, revenue management tools, quality inspections, advertising and brand standards.

Our remaining activities, none of which constitutes a reportable segment, have been aggregated into "other". 
We have two measures of segment performance under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (GAAP): revenue and operating income. In addition, the following non-GAAP measurements are used to evaluate the performance of our franchise and company operated hotel segments: 
•Revenue per available room (RevPAR) 
•Average daily rate (ADR)
•Occupancy
•Comparable hotel revenue
•Comparable hotel direct operating income (margin)
•Room count
Intersegment revenues are minimal. Certain operating expenses are allocated to the operating segments based upon internally established allocation methodologies. Income tax provision (benefit) and certain corporate operating expenses are neither allocated to the segments nor included in the measures of segment performance. See Item 6. Selected Financial Data for information about our non-GAAP measures and reconciliations to the most comparable GAAP measures. 
Overview
Company Strategy 
Our strategy is to grow our brands and profitability by expanding our hotel network with additional franchised hotels, managing the operations of hotels leased or partially owned by us through joint venture or minority equity participation, managing operations of hotels for hotel owners who have contracted with us to perform management services, and increasing RevPAR by offering superior hotel management technology to hotel operators. 
We believe franchising represents a profitable, less capital intensive growth opportunity. By segmenting our upscale, midscale and economy brands with clear distinctions between each offering, we are uniquely positioned to provide an appealing alternative for a variety of owners. In 2017 we executed 144 franchise agreements. Also during 2017, 120 franchise agreements in our network terminated, partially due to our focus on eliminating hotels that did not meet RLH Corporation's hotel standards. Our strategy for our upscale and midscale hotel brands is to identify larger urban metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs) that are saturated by larger 
3

brands in order to become the conversion brand of choice for owners of established hotels looking for alternatives in those markets. We believe our strong upscale and midscale brand name recognition in the Western U.S. markets provides us with an opportunity to expand our hotel network within our existing footprint. The Midwest, South and East Coast markets also provide us with opportunity to expand our hotel network into markets across North America as our brands will be a unique and new value proposition for current and potential hotel owners in markets saturated by competitor brands. To assist in our ability to grow our hotel network in larger metropolitan cities, we may consider special incentives, management contracting services, minority equity, joint venture opportunities with hotel owners and investors, or adding additional brand options. In addition to conversion from other brands, independently branded hotel operations may also benefit from the RLH Corporation central services programs. Our economy hotel brands have strong national brand name recognition and provide hotel owners an affordable alternative to traditional franchise programs with primarily flat fees, sensible property improvement plans and a wealth of resources and programs to support owners. For all of our properties, we strive to provide hotel owners leading demand distribution technology and sales support as part of our brand support programs. 
We believe that additional growth in our hotel network in larger metropolitan areas will also come from hotel acquisitions where we may contribute partial equity or participate in equity ownership opportunities in joint ventures with hotel owners and investors. Equity investment in hotels new to our system is an opportunity for us to redeploy cash on hand or cash generated from sales of joint venture hotels into improvement and expansion of our hotel network in major cities. Further growth opportunities may come from the expansion of our brand offerings. With Hotel RL we have a hotel product that is intended to be flexible enough to allow adaptive reuse projects, conversions and new builds, to a lesser extent, while giving owners a more free-form approach to adapt the hotel to their unique markets and locations. The new flat fee structure is a true differentiator in this segment to establish the Hotel RL brand, which provides a predictable cost structure for our franchisees with the opportunity to leverage a greater proportion of their top-line growth to superior hotel performance. 
Owned Hotels
All of our owned properties are held in joint venture (JV) entities, in each of which we have a majority ownership interest. As of December 31, 2017 eleven of our hotels are held in RL Venture, LLC, of which we own a 55% interest. During 2016, we completed extensive renovations to these properties, and converted three of them to Hotel RLs. All 11 hotels continue to be managed by RLH Corporation's wholly-owned subsidiary, RL Management, each with an initial five-year management contract, with three five-year extensions.
Our Baltimore Hotel RL is held in its own JV entity, RLS Balt Venture, LLC, of which we own 73%. 
Our Red Lion Hotel Atlanta Airport is held in its own JV entity, RLS Atla Venture, LLC, of which we own 55%.
Our Washington DC Hotel RL is held in its own JV entity, RLS DC Venture, LLC, of which we own 55%. 
The obligation for all of our debt under the JV loan agreements is generally non-recourse to RLH Corporation, except for instances of fraud, criminal activity, waste, misappropriation of revenues, and breach of environmental representations.  
We also operate four hotels under land and/or building leases.
With the objective of accelerating the Company's asset-light strategy in October 2017 the Company listed with CBRE the majority of its owned assets for sale. The hotels being marketed for sale are the following:

1. | Hotel RL Salt Lake City, Utah


2. | Hotel RL Spokane at the Park, Washington


3. | Hotel RL Olympia, Washington


4. | Red Lion Hotel Pasco, Washington (sold in February 2018, entered into franchise agreement)


5. | Red Lion Hotel Richland Hanford House, Washington (sold in February 2018, entered into franchise agreement)


6. | Red Lion Hotel Port Angeles, Washington


7. | Red Lion Hotel Redding, California (sold in February 2018, entered into franchise agreement)


8. | Red Lion Hotel Eureka, California (sold in February 2018, entered into franchise agreement)

Franchised Hotels
As of December 31, 2017 our network of hotels included 1,061 hotels under franchise agreements, representing a total of 65,200 rooms. 
As part of our focus on expanding our franchising division, in 2015 we completed the acquisition of the intellectual property assets and all hotel franchise license agreements of GuestHouse International, LLC, an economy scale brand. The acquisition expanded our presence across the country by adding two recognized hotel brands, GuestHouse and Settle Inn & Suites, to the RLH Corporation brands, and their franchise license agreements. 
In September 2016, we (i) acquired selected assets and assumed certain liabilities of Vantage Hospitality Group, Inc. (Vantage), a subsidiary of Thirty-Eight Street, Inc. (TESI) and (ii) acquired one brand name asset from TESI. Vantage was a hotel franchise company, and the addition of the Vantage assets substantially increased our number of franchise properties and provided us with a broader presence in the United States and Canada. We acquired over 1,000 hotel franchise and membership license agreements, as well as multiple brand names, including Americas Best Value Inn, Canadas Best Value Inn, Lexington Hotels & Inns, America's Best Inns & Suites, Jameson Inns, Country Hearth Inns & Suites, Vantage Hotels, Value Inn Worldwide, Value Hotel Worldwide, 3 Palms Hotels and Resorts and Signature Inn. 
In December 2017, we announced the launch of franchiseasysm, a re-imagined franchise process to appeal to owners of independent hotels or hotels that don't fit a traditional franchise. The process provides a straightforward and flexible website application process for hoteliers looking to operate as independent or under the nationwide Country Hearth brand. Applications can be completed from a mobile device, and agreements offer an associated simplified fee structure. 
We are also investing in sales and marketing talent and technology to improve our ability to manage the various channels that drive occupancy and average daily rate at our hotels, including transient, group and preferred corporate business. We continue to improve and implement our guest management ecosystem, RevPak, which includes a number of industry revenue generation systems fully integrated to provide comprehensive information by integrating information on customer acquisition, customer management and customer retention. This suite of products is flexible and dynamic and can be tailored to the needs of individual hotel brands. It also delivers dynamic and personalized communications and promotions tailored to individual guest travel needs and habits.
Our focus on improving e-commerce revenue generation includes ongoing updates and improvements to our rlhco.com website and improved and targeted digital marketing utilizing information generated through our RevPak reservation and distribution system.
Reporting Segment Revenues
A summary of our reporting segment revenues is provided below (in thousands, except for percentages). For further information regarding our reportable segments, see Note 3 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 

 | Years Ended December 31,
 | 2017 | | 2016 | | 2015 
Company operated hotels | $ | 123,100 | | | 71.6 | % | | $ | 123,589 | | | 83.3 | % | $ | 119,773 | | 90.8 | %
Franchised hotels | 48,559 | | | 28.2 | % | | 24,634 | | | 16.6 | % | | 12,039 | | 9.1 | %

Comparable Hotel Measures and Room Count (Non-GAAP Data)
We utilize these comparable measures because management finds them a useful tool to perform more meaningful comparisons of past, present and future operating results as these measures influence and affect franchise revenues. We believe they are a complement to reported operating results. Comparable operating results are not intended to represent reported operating results defined by GAAP, and such information should not be considered as an alternative to reported information or any other measure of performance prescribed by GAAP. We exclude total revenue earned and expenses incurred related to our hotel management agreements in the comparable hotel statistics.
5

The primary non-GAAP measure for the franchise revenue from economy hotels is room counts due to the prevalence of fixed fee arrangements in this portion of the franchise segment. 
Average occupancy, ADR and RevPAR statistics are provided below on a comparable basis: 

Comparable Hotel Statistics | | | | | | 
 | Years Ended December 31,
 | 2017 | | 2016
 | Average Occupancy(1) | | | ADR(2) | | RevPAR(3) | | Average Occupancy(1) | | ADR(2) | RevPAR(3)
Systemwide - Midscale | 62.2 | % | | | $96.19 | | $59.80 | | 62.3 | % | $93.61 | $58.33
Change from prior comparative period: | Average Occupancy(1) | | | ADR(2) | | RevPAR(3) | | | | | 
Systemwide - Midscale | (10 | ) | bps | | 2.8% | | 2.5% | | | | 


(1) Average occupancy represents total paid rooms divided by total available rooms. Total available rooms represents the number of rooms available multiplied by the number of days in the reported period and includes rooms taken out of service for renovation. 
(2) Average daily rate (ADR) represents total room revenues divided by the total number of paid rooms occupied by hotel guests. 
(3) Revenue per available room (RevPAR) represents total room and related revenues divided by total available rooms. 

Average occupancy, ADR and RevPAR, as defined below, are non-GAAP measures and are widely used in the hospitality industry and appear throughout this document as important measures to the discussion of our operating performance. 

• | Average occupancy represents total paid rooms occupied divided by total available rooms. We use average occupancy as a measure of the utilization of capacity in our network of hotels.


• | RevPAR represents total room and related revenues divided by total available rooms. We use RevPAR as a measure of performance yield in our network of hotels.


• | ADR represents total room revenues divided by the total number of paid rooms occupied by hotel guests. We use ADR as a measure of room pricing in our network of hotels.


• | Total available rooms represents the number of rooms available multiplied by the number of days in the reported period. We use total available rooms as a measure of capacity in our network of hotels and do not adjust total available rooms for rooms temporarily out of service for remodel or other short-term periods.


• | Comparable hotels are hotels that have been owned, leased, managed, or franchised by us and were in operation for at least one full calendar year as of the beginning of the reporting period other than hotels for which comparable results were not available.

Throughout this document and unless otherwise stated, RevPAR, ADR and average occupancy statistics are calculated using statistics for comparable hotels. Some of the terms used in our industry, such as "upscale", "midscale" and "economy" are consistent with those used by Smith Travel Research (STR), an independent statistical research service that specializes in the lodging industry. These terms as used in our disclosures are consistent with the STR definitions.
Future midscale franchise segment revenues will generate revenue from franchise fees that are based on a percentage of room revenue, as has been the historical revenue model for the company. Future economy franchise segment revenues will derive primarily from fixed fee arrangements based on hotel room counts. Our franchised economy room count decreased from approximately 59,300 rooms at December 31, 2016 to approximately 54,900 rooms at December 31, 2017, as we focused on eliminating hotels that did not meet RLH Corporation's hotel standards.
Refer to Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in this annual report on Form 10-K for specific segment results. 


Employees
At December 31, 2017, we employed approximately 1,580 people on a full-time or part-time basis. Our total number of employees fluctuates seasonally. At December 31, 2017, approximately 8% of our total workforce was covered by various collective bargaining agreements providing, generally, for basic pay rates, working hours, other conditions of employment and organized settlement of labor disputes. As we dispose of our hotel ownership assets designated for sale the number of employees' subject to collective bargaining agreements will decline. We believe our employee relations are satisfactory.
