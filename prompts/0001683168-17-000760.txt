Business Overview
 
The Company, through its subsidiaries has historically operated a nationwide distressed asset services company, providing technology-driven asset management, portfolio due diligence, acquisition, repositioning and liquidation strategies for the private investment and mortgage servicing industry. Founded in 2004, Halo began operating in the mortgage origination sector, expanding quickly to an award-winning consumer financial services company. Halo’s years of experience, key leadership and industry knowledge, laid the foundation for its emergence as a premier distressed asset services company. Recognizing the potential decline in opportunities, as the market shifted back to more normalized conditions, Halo strategically diversified its business lines by providing technology solutions to other managers. Today, Halo has refocused its business model as a boutique Technology as a Service company offering Software as a Service platforms, custom development, and technology advisory services.
Products and Services
 
Halo has focused its distressed asset services, portfolio due diligence, and asset liquidation strategies primarily on single family residential real estate across the United States for its business customers (typically distressed debt investors or debt servicers) to market turnkey solutions for improved performance and monetization of their portfolios. In today’s economy, lenders are experiencing an overflow of distressed assets. Many mortgage debt servicers are currently overwhelmed with externally imposed programs that are stretching the limits of their human resources, money and time. Halo’s technology systems are bundled with transparency, accountability, efficiency, and flexibility. This unique strategy directs borrowers into an intelligent, results-driven process that establishes affordable, long-term mortgages while also achieving an improved return for lenders and investors, when compared to foreclosure.

As with any industry, the mortgage and distressed residential industry is dynamic and continues to have strategy shift creating both challenges and opportunities. There is an ongoing consolidation of assets from middle-market investors to institutional investors causing many of Halo clients to sell their inventory and move to other sectors to deploy capital. The margin restrictions caused by this consolidation coupled with the increased regulatory burden and operating costs are making it difficult for smaller investors to compete. As such, Halo is seriously evaluating the viability of its asset management and portfolio services business and has begun to make moves to reposition the Company.
 
The Company is currently exploring potential opportunities with several client relationships that would allow the Company to implement its internally developed and used asset management software platform as an external service for those customers. This is commonly known as Software as a Service (“SaaS”). The Company entered into a consulting and development agreement with a customer during late 2014, and then entered into a SaaS contract with that client who prepaid for a 12-month service plan during March 2015. Cash receipts from customers in advance of revenue recognized are recorded as deferred revenue and will be earned over the entire SaaS contract period. During the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company has secured additional contracts and continues to evaluate both product lines and target markets to pursue in the future.
 
Recent Developments
 
See discussion on SaaS above.
 
Competition
 
The information technology and software development industries are highly competitive, and there is considerable competition from major institutions in Halo’s lines of business, including off-shore development companies, mature off-the-shelf software options, and larger consulting and development companies offering one or more of the products and services offered by Halo. The development and commercialization of new software products and technology services to address companies’ needs is highly competitive, and there will be considerable competition from major companies seeking to expand their own product and service offerings. Many of Halo’s competitors have substantially more resources than Halo, including both financial and technical resources. Additionally, competition is intense in obtaining highly qualified employees, specifically highly trained software developers and engineers.
Intellectual Property
 
The Company maintains copyrights on its printed marketing materials, web pages and proprietary software. Halo’s goal is to preserve the Company’s trade secrets, without infringing on the proprietary rights of other parties.
 
To help protect its proprietary know-how, which is not currently deemed to be patentable, Halo relies on trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements to protect its interest. To this end, Halo requires all of its employees, consultants, advisors and other contractors to enter into confidentiality agreements that prohibit the disclosure of confidential information and, where applicable, require disclosure and assignment to Halo of the ideas, developments, discoveries and inventions important to its business.
 
Employees
 
As of December 31, 2016, the Company had 11 full-time employees. None of the Company’s employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement. Halo believes that it maintains good relationships with its employees.
Government Regulation
 
The services provided by the Company, through its subsidiaries, are extensively regulated by federal and state authorities in the United States. Halo believes it is in compliance with federal and state qualification and registration requirements in order that it may continue to provide services to its clients consistent with applicable laws and regulations. See Risk Factors below for further discussion about the risks involved with Company’s regulatory environment.
